Hi all,

    This newsgroup has been far too quiet lately! I was wondering if anyone had read a paper published a few weeks ago by Pekka Kilpelainen at Helsinki U.
The paper concerns SGML & XML content models and can be found here:
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/~kilpelai/C-1998-12.html .

    It's a very interesting paper if a bit on the theoretical side, and it provides some insight into the amount of work necessary to reduce '&' groups
in SGML content models (there are many in HTML 4) to XML '|' groups.
Basically, the author shows that there is an exponential relationship between 
the length of and groups and their resultant or groups. To me,
this seemed a convincing argument for breaking any future HTML
into separate parts and tackling the and reduction this way. This would reduce the length of the resulting content models (since there are no grouped entities in XML).

Any thoughts?

Regards,

D-
