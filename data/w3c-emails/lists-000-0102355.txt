Workshop participants,

You may recall that I asked, at the close of the workshop,
if you were willing to participate in a mailing list
consisting of the participants of this forum. The response
was overwhelmingly positive, and so I have created
the list. If you want to unsubscribe, send a message
ala:

To: html-future-request@w3.org
Subject: unsubscribe

The purpose of this list is to charter new work on HTML
at W3C, i.e. to collaborate with the W3C staff and
the W3C Hypertext Coordination
group[2] in drafting a briefing package[2].

Administrivia:

This list is archived, world-readable, at:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-future/

Only the participants of the list may post, and only
from the address known to our list software (below).
If you want to be able to post from another address,
make your request to mailto:html-future-request@w3.org,
explaining why the issue has to be addressed on
our end rather than yours.

Subscription requests are not processed automatically;
they go to me.
