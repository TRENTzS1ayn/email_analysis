A while ago, I sent a very brief query to Dave Raggett about architectural
forms in HTML. The next thing I knew, the full text of my email (not much)
had been posted to a w3c site as my "Position Paper" on the Future of HTML.
I found this amusing, though I was a little embarassed to discover that my
private, dark, ill-formed suspicions about "MSXML" had suddenly been
networked as my "position".

I hadn't even thought of attending the conference at that point, though it
did sound interesting. I regret that I was unable to attend.

Now this morning I learn that I've been subscribed to a list for "Workshop
participants", based on a resolution that I "may recall".

I'll stick around anyway because this is fascinating. "Push" participation!
I expect to be named chair of something any minute now! <g>

I hope to contribute more substantially once I've read the real papers.
