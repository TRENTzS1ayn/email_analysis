In addition to the above, I think its worth considering how to
integrate vector graphics (soon to be the subject of a new W3C
working group), math (MathML) and mechanisms for synchronising
multimedia (SMIL).

In trying to write a first cut at a briefing package I am hoping
to establish a basic vision that allows for the clean composition
of each tag set, and a good story on accessibility and
internationalization. Any suggestions for this would be very
much appreciated at this early stage.
