as several people said during the meeting, its as important to *uncouple*
eg tables, from HTML2000 (which I think should be adopted as the
working title), as it is to understand how to plug in eg PGML. lets
assume that a successful HTML2000 will be one in which I can use CALS
tables (assuming they the XMLised) in place of HTML4 tables.

the best example of working modularisation would appear to be the TEI,
no? i would assume that would repay careful study.
