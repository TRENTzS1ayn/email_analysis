As was pointed out at the workshop it is frequently inconvenient
to manage multiple files, as a result users would like to be able
to embed the markup for math directly into the same file as the
markup for the rest of the document structure. The same is likely
to apply to simple graphics. It seems to make sense therefore to
address composition of tag sets in a way that maximises the
synergy between them.
