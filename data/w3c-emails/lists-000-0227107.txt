I think your insight that every page uses some navigation 
and that therefore we may be better off having this as a
core HTML primitive with its presentation specified via CSS
is a very good idea.

Having WWW pages express cross document navigation in a
consistent way would enhance accessibility to a great extent
since the user would then know where to expect standard
controls.

It's like walking into a room and knowing where the light
switch is.
