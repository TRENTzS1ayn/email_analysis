As I said at the meeting, I feel strongly that navigation bars are
*style*, not content. What sort of navigation can *not* be derived from
structured content with an appropriate style mechanism? I don't think
CSS can do it, but thats not the point.

I read the sense of the meeting last week as agreeing that one good
way forward was first to develop a set of XML libraries which
re-expressed the HTML idioms, and from that re-building an HTML SGML
DTD to replace 4.0.

If this proposed WG does NOT deal with the XML questions, then what
will it do? simply add some more tags like <navigation> to the already
bloated set -- surely few people want that outcome? 

Anyway, forget XML, call it SGML. Its still important to break HTML
into SGML pieces and understand now to join it together again in
various ways, for all sorts of reasons.
