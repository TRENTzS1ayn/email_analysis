Embedding SGML in SGML documents is a problem whose scope extends beyond
just HTML.  However IMHO there is now a solution to this problem since the
Web TC modification of SGML.  DTD-less documents can be created.
Architectures can map the HTML elements of the document to the HTML
Architectural form.  The MathML elements of the document can be mapped to
the MathML Architectural form.

Of course there are many details to be worked out, such as making
alternate text available.

I feel I should say that, although it seems inconvenient to work with
multiple files, in the end it generally saves time and effort.  Just as I
use a graphics programs to create a GIF file, I'd use a MathML editor to
create my MathML document and embed it the same way I embed an image in my
document.
