Shouldn't layout be handled by style sheets?

I don't follow this point.  First of all Width and Height attributes are
not required for the Object element.  Secondly I don't see why a rendering
device can't communicate with the browser.  This sounds outside the scope
of the HTML specs anyways.  If a graphical browser is going to embed
MathML in the document window (natively or by a plug-in), it should have
no problem accessing background colours, and ambient font size, and hence
render the Object in an appropreate manner.  If the browser launches an
external program to view the object, then getting the background and font
size is no relevent.

This seems like a special case of 1.  Layout should be handled by style
sheets in general.

Cheers.
