In both cases, I think you are focusing on the way things should be,
whereas I was describing the way things are.  

Over the last two years, the Math WG has watched a number of specs
come out, and heard a lot of talk about how things will work when the
next up-and-coming technology becomes available.  However, in
practice, what has tended to happen is that the issues I pointed to
keep ending up at the bottom of the priority stack, because they are
simple in concept, and hard to implement.  From another point of view,
they are easy to agree to up front, and easy to rationalize omitting
from your implementation later...

From a language design point of view, I have no problem with your
original assertion that math and 2D graphics belong in an OBJECT tag.
My point, however, is that unless the difficulties of then adequately
implementing the OBJECT tag are built into the discussion, realpolitick
dictates that they are unlikely to be addressed at all.
