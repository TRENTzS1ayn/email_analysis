Hi,

The slides from our presentation at the recent Future of HTML conference
are now available online at:

http://www.cnet.com/Papers/W3C/Slides/FutureHTML/index.html

You will need a display with at least 800x600 pixel resolution, and a CSS1
capable browser to view them properly.

Please forward all comments and feedback to daniela@cnet.com and CC:
gregs@cnet.com.

This conference was in my opinion very useful. Thanks to the W3C for
staging it!

Regards,

D-
