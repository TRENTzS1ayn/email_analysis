For "HTML 4.0", feel free to read "Classic HTML".  :-)

This was a first-cut, written at the workshop (without an HTML composition
tool, by the way), to be used as a starting point.  I like your taxonomy:

as a way of enumerating separable, composable element sets.  And then I'd
expect MathML (for example) to be of equal stature as, say, forms, as would
any other composable element set.  I'm not sure I'd separate
paragraph-level markup from document structure in the end, and I would like
to see "linking" amplified to include "navigation" as some of the
discussion on the list has suggested, but this seems like a good way to
continue the discussion.
