Excellent. Thanks for the contribution! It touches
all the bases.

My reservation with this proposal is: is it sufficiently
specific? It looks a bit like a blank check, ala "go away
and work for 18-24 months on making HTML better."

As a former WG chair, I know the value of a specific charter,
so that you can say "never mind about all that; it's not
in our charter anyway."

Let's put it this way: extensibility and scalability
are laudable goals, but they're also hard problems. I
think a lot of folks would bet against any random group of 20 people
who claimed to be solving these problems:

Do we have some sense of the solution to these problems?
Can we give some sense of how we're going to approach them?
Even broad references to bodies of work that suggest
it's a straightfoward task?
