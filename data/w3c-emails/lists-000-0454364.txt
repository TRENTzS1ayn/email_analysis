Todd,

Good to hear from you, after the MSXML mysteries...

Sectioning and layout are somewhat different than text level style IMHO,
for instance,
the most common abuse of tables on the web is to produce columnar format
(not for floats!)
and it is difficult to see how this could be done effectively in CSS or
something similar. 
Tags that divide the document into sensible parts for layout (and for the
application of 
style) are better left in HTML; if we take *everything* out of HTML, then
we are stuck
supporting 2 very difficult languages for even small devices like cell
phones (HTML+CSS).
We need to balance the need for seperation with the need for simplicity.

I agree that all text-level formatting should be removed from HTML
(eg <B> etc). I said this in my paper presented at the conference;

http://www.cnet.com/Papers/W3C/kungpao.html. But we can't leave 
layout up to the browser vendors: this is what we are doing now, and
it is a total disaster - not even a simple DIV acts the same in both.
Should these things be independent of tag boundaries? I don't think so.
This does not allow us to support intelligent internal organization of 
the document.

Currently most sites don't use CSS. It isn't cost effective, it is
difficult to learn,
can't be checked, and only works haphazardly...even the, in your own words, 
'least-broken implementation', is pretty bad.
Moving all the problems to CSS from HTML doesn't solve anything.

Um...this is more or less the path I proposed here, with some solutions
that attempt
to fix the problems you mention, which are indeed hacks and result in rapid
hair loss
for those poor souls who hand author their code (like nearly everyone who
writes HTML).

I'm not sure of the use of the term 'profile' here, I think you mean to
use it in the loose sense.
(In the technical terminology, HTML is an SGML 'application' not a
'profile' - an important distinction.
I proposed in a previous email that it be made a profile - of XML.)

Does any user agent actually pay any attention at all to DOCTYPE?

HTML should be generated only by machinery, for machinery. Humans have no
business writing HTML.
