A point has been made that most of what is worth adding to HTML has been added. 
With the exception of a few attribute tweaks. Some have even said that "HTML is 
dead" despite the fact that (1) major browsers do not have complete or consistent 
support for HTML 4.0, DOM, and CSS2 (arguable even HTML 3.2 and CSS1).

That said, many documents won't require a special document type... HTML is fine for 
generic documents.
