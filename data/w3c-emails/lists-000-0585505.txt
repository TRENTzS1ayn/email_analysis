How much have you looked at the RDF work?

I have an outstanding question much like yours.  The sketch of a
solution that I haven't yet tested adequately is that XML
namespace mechanisms give the application access to names arising
in different contexts, and RDF assertions create relational
semantics, applied across name-uses, the uses identified by
pattern based on where the name originates and where it appears.

In short, syntax and namespace qualification only help you know
that symbols are distinct from one another.  To have connected
semantics some projective or constrictive facilities are required
and RDF assertions are the candidate solution.
