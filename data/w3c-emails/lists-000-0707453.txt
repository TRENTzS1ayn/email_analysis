Hi,

I have couple of question and/or bug messages:

*Is it correct that TIDY adds new STYLE element whenever it finds
incorrect tags (with -c set)? I mean, that when I tidyfy HTM document
and later I edit it again (insertin some other buggy tag) and reruning
TIDY on edited document, it adds new pair of <STYLE> tags. It is not
nice and I am not sure, whether it is correct HTML.
*would it be possible to include support for other ISO Latin
encodings? Being a Czech, I would prefer ISO Latin-2 (aka ISO 8859-2) to
ISO Latin-1.

Have a nice day

Matej Cepl
