Hi,

There is a bug in manual on http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/:
instead about quote-ampresand (as shown in example under the manual for
configuration files), the value is called quote-marks.

Another thing, that there's some strange mess between pages shown on
http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/ and
http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/ where former is from yesterday (MET)
and latter from 8th April.

BTW, configuration files are a _GREAT_ thing. Thanks.

Matthew
