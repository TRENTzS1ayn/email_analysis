Tidy does seem to have some trouble with the troublesome example.
Generally the structure should be something like:

<html>
<head>
...
</head>

<frameset>
  ...
  <noframes>
    ...
  </noframes>
</frameset>

</html>

So the original html erred by having a body. It also had the body outside the
frameset. The correction of the html should be to replace the body tags with
noframe tags and also to bring the enclosed section to within the frameset
section. This might be hard for tidy to do. Easier would be to just replace the
body tags (start and end) with noframes tags. Leaving it outside the frameset. If
being a stickler for form, it could remove the body all together.

Correcting HTML seems a pretty hard problem. Tidy makes a valiant effort and gives
us a good start on the job in many instances. Doing everything might be more than
can be hoped for. Try making a long outline in MSWord, save it as HTML, and then
try to clean  t h a t  up.
