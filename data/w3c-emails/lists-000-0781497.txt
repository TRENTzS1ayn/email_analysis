The 14-Apr-99 version of tidy misreports HTML documents which use
the FRAME attribute of a TABLE as being HTML 4.0 transitional.  For example:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN"
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/strict.dtd">
<HTML>
 <HEAD>
  <TITLE>CVR Hosts Status</TITLE>
 </HEAD>
 <BODY>
  <TABLE FRAME=BORDER RULES=ALL SUMMARY="This is a sample table.">
    <TR><TH>Test
  </TABLE>
 </BODY>
</HTML>

Tidy reports:

Tidy (vers 14th April 1999) Parsing "example.html"
line 13 column 1 - Warning: html doctype doesn't match content

"example.html" appears to be HTML 4.0 Transitional
1 warnings/errors were found!

I went to http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/strict.dtd to check the HTML 4.0
strict DTD, and FRAME is included as an attribute of the TABLE element...
