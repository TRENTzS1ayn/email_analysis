Hi Dave,

I just downloaded and installed tidy (I actually heard about it only now
through the wml mailing list), and as a first test ran it over the main
file of one of my projects
(http://gttserv.lth.rwth-aachen.de/~sp/tt/chemapp/calight/cal-docs/cal.html),
since I would very much like to use tidy to clean up HTML code generated
by yodl (http://www.xs4all.nl/~jantien/yodl/).

This file was for the most part generated by yodl, especially the
automatically generated table of contents section.

When I run tidy aver it, it only reports (lots of) warnings, and no
errors, but the resulting HTML file is pretty different, the whole first
part is missing :-)

Maybe at some point you could have a look at that effect, it seems to have
to do with a <hr> inside <h2>...</h2>, but from the tidy docs I understood
that if it doesn't know how to clean up the code, it would report an error
instead and not try to change that part.

It's also very possible that the code generated by yodl is buggy,
especially inside the TOC. But I couldn't quite determine whether and 
where yodl and/or tidy make a mistake.

Thanks for your help and your effort with tidy,
all the best,
Stephan
