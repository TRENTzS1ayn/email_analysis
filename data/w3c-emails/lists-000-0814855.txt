Thanks. I didn't expect the browser to handle the ampersand entity
in a URL, and I obviously misunderstood the purpose of the 
quote-marks setting. I was thinking that, since quotes might be in 
the text in the input file, and Tidy was breaking lines (possibly 
causing quoted passages to wrap onto multiple lines), that it would 
make sense to replace the quotes with quote entities. 

By the way, (since you're going to look at it) the Tidy documentation 
on configuration files:
http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/#config
has two sections on quote-marks (I think the second should be 
quote-ampersand) and the description in the first is confusing:
    causes " characters to be written out as &amp;quot; 

Thanks again.
