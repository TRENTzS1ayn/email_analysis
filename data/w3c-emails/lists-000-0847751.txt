Hi.  I'm new to this list.  I teach programming at a upper secondary school
in Sweden, and I also manage the school's web pages.  Until yesterday I
believed my HTML was flawless, but then I found HTML Tidy... :-)  Let's see
if I can contribute something.


From the main page for HTML Tidy:


>Users running in Microsoft Windows should be aware that Dos doesn't expand
wild cards in filenames. This means that if you have several html files in
the same directory and want to tidy all of them:

Instead you need to run tidy separately on each one. I will look into a fix
for this for a future release.

A quick fix is to use the DJGPP (<http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/>) port of
gcc to build (32-bit) DOS executables (NB not Win32 console applications,
but still usable in a Win9X / Win3.1x DOS box) that, among other things,
perform file name globbing and handle long command lines (>126 characters).
 See <http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/eli-m17n99.html> for a thorough
description of the port.

I rebuilt tidy using DJGPP with no changes to either the source files or
the gcc Makefile.  The resulting TIDY.EXE is rather large due to debugging
symbols, but adding -s to CFLAGS makes the executable file only marginally
(2kB) larger than the distribution DOS executable.  Using the DJP (DJ
Packer) utility gives a 65500 byte TIDY.EXE (available for evaluation at
<http://home.swipnet.se/pelewin/html-tidy/tidy.exe>).
