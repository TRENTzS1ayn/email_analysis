Any word on the next release of Tidy supporting the latest xhtml WD's namespace
and DOCTYPE's system identifiers?

There is a minor bug wrt xhtml and the "clean" option.  It creates CSS like

DIV.c1 { ... }
P.c2 { ... }   /* etc. */

where xml docs (including xhtml) with

<div class="c1"> ... </div>
<p class="c2"> ... </p>

wouldn't match up to the above styles, though it "works" in current HTML+CSS
browsers displaying xhtml.  Then again, "div.c1", "p.c2", etc. would work in the
current crop *and* future XML-aware browsers.

...

A suggestion for the configuration file ... an option to force the desired
output DOCTYPE declaration. Something like

doctype: omit | guess | strict | loose | <!DOCTYPE ...

where the default behavior is "guess" (current behavior).  The output format
(HTML or XHTML -- implied or specified elsewhere) determines whether the
"strict" or "loose" applied to HTML 4.0 or XHTML 1.0.  The final choice above
would be for a custom DOCTYPE not covered by the other ones (such as HTML 2.0
and 3.2).

There might be better ways to do this, but I think the ability to specify the
DOCTYPE would prove handy.

$0.25 ...
