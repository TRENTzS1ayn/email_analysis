It appears that Tidy's values for the Doctype when converting from html to
xhtml is incorrect:

The output that I receive from the apr99 version is:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html-in-xml/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

It also seems that the html xmlns attribute is being set incorrectly to:
http://www.w3.org/Profiles/xhtml1-transitional

Is this correct, or do I need to set a parameter?
