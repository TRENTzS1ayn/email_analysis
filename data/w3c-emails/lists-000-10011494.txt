Hi, I was wondering if there's a way to use Tidy to remove all HTML
from a page and just get the text. 

In other words, I like to use Tidy as an HTML to Text conversion
utility that I can call problematically. 

Actually, I am planning on using JTidy so that I can do this
conversion as part of an application I am working on.

Thanks in advance. 

Spencer
