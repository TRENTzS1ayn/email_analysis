I recommed keeping the message you got when you subscribed, for future  
reference, rather than making everyone look at an unsubscribe message on each  
message from the list, taking up space on everyone's drives.

That message gives all the vitals you need, and it's only a one-time 5.8kb message

try 'echo unsubscribe | Mail html-tidy-request@w3.org'
