That would be great, but I am quite active on the net, so if I kept every little bit
of info... welll, you can imagine what happens.  Eventually I get overwhelmed and then
trash the lot.

If your list uses the "standard" that's great, but I and others am not phsychic and my
own XML list for example does not use the "standard" - so you see, placing the
"standard" in the sig is nevertheless a good idea.

Cheers and thanks!
Mark.
