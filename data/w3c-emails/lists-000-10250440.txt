Greetings Dave Raggett,

Your work and offering of html-tidy has been well received and provided us
with a valuable source for communications on the technical side of html.
However, (with all due respect) there have been a number of unsolicited
advertisements from various donators to the Tidy list, that are most
annoying and should be discontinued.  The Tidy list is for the purpose of
Tidy correspondence.  The list has been very informative and helpful, but
if
the SPAM is allowed to continue, I fear that there will be many valuable
contributors who will ask to be taken off of that list.

It is possible to screen the majority of these un-wanted postings at W3C or
the Tidy site, <html-tidy-request@w3.org>, before they get out.  A number
of
filters can be employed that should help with this.

Thanks, and Cheers,
James
