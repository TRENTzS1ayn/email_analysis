Hi Dave,

     The facility to convert old-fashioned FONT tags etc. to STYLE
in HTML Tidy is brilliant, and has certainly helped this novice who
was fighting with the STYLE syntax - thank you!  I find the font size
percentages that are substituted for the old <FONT SIZE="+1"> etc.
don't accurately reflect how my browser (Netscape 4.7 on a Macintosh)
treats the old integer values: is this a symptom of the PC/Macintosh
and Netscape/Explorer incompatibilities?


     There are some slightly surprising omissions from these
"stylising" conversions though:

Colour and background image data, traditionaly added to the <BODY>
tag, can now be encoded within the STYLE definitions.

<B> and <U> tags can also be encoded in STYLE, but Tidy doesn't.

     Would it be a reasonable request that you add these to the
list of extra features to implement on a rainy afternoon?  (We *do*
get plenty of those in England at this time of year :-)

          TTFN,

               Peter
