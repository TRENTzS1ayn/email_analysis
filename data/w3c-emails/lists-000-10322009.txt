Strange.
Some days ago, a person named T. Schick complained that she
received messages from the list, when she had never subscribed to it.
So, did you subscribe ?
If yes, send the correct request to the owner of the list.
If not, is it possible that someone forwards messages to your address ?
You can get informations about this by examining closely your messages
headers (full header, not the usual one)
