IMO, this would be a bad idea.  The purpose of Tidy is to *clean up*
invalid
(and unwellformed) markup.  (Note that Tidy inserting 'style="margin-left:
2em"'
is, I believe, a bug -- with or without IE3's em-is-a-pixel problem.)

Agreed.

Tidy thinks very highly of its users.

Seriously, the problem has to do with the common
HTML-perceived-as-a-formatting-language hack of:

     <i>
     <p>This paragraph will be italicized, because italics is on.</p><p>And so will this one.</p>     <p>Italics has now been turned off.</p>That's the mess Tidy was designed to clean up.  It can't read your mind.
It
does handle a large *majority* of cases with aplomb.

Tidy is not (at least at this point in time) an HTML validator.  I *always*
check my my documents with a validator after Tidying.  Two good online
validators are:

     http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/
     http://validator.w3.org

(Note: the first one above is really excellent -- it allows, for example,
file
uploading -- but it seems to be down at the moment.)

Or try Liam Quinn's excellent (offline) Windows app:

     http://www.arealvalidator.com

Then I would not request hide-endtags.  How should Tidy know what is
"meaningful" to you?  According the HTML DTDs, the endtag for BODY is
optional...

> Why doesn't clean clean TABLE backgrounds?

Agreed.  Also BODY attributes, TD BGCOLOR, etc.  Somewhere this was
discussed
(the Tidy web page? here?).  I think the objection given was that there
wasn't
enough CSS support in the installed base to warrant it.

I think a possible solution is to to add "all" as a clean option, so that

     clean: all

moves *everything* presentational to CSS.

I disagree, for the same reason as given before: Tidy's purpose is to fix
invalid markup, not to cowtow to current or future buggy browsers.  Should
Tidy
start intentionally emitting invalid [x]HTML, I suspect you'll see its
popularity wane.
