I can't support this suggestion to use the meta generator tag to control
tidy behaviour. My editor (optionally) puts in a generator line but the
content of the HTML is entirely manual and in user control. It doesn't
dictate how you write the code, just demonstrates the results. So from that
point of view it should be treated as a "by hand" creator.

Cheers,

To me, this feature is extremely valuable, as FrontPage 98 in particular
loves to span block elements with inline ones.  Tidy does a perfect job in
cleaning up this auto-generated mess.

Perhaps what is desired is alternate behavior, depending on whether the
HTML source file is generated by hand or by machine.  As a proposal,
perhaps keying on the presence of a <meta name="GENERATOR" ...> tag
(although *not* Tidy's own tag :-) would engender one of two behaviors: the
current insertion of extra inline tags if the GENERATOR tag is present
(implying a machine-generated source), and simple termination of the inline
element if the GENERATOR tag is absent.
