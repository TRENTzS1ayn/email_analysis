I may be wrong, but I believe that TD does not have a width attribute in
HTML version 4 (this being described in the col element).
Tidy does not complain when parsing the following file :

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN">
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Test</title>  <body>
    <table width="100%" border="9" summary="test">
      <col width="40%" align="center">
      <col  width="60%" align="left">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td width="10%"></td>        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </body>
</html>

The output message is :
Tidy (vers 30th November 1999) Parsing "table.html"
"table.html" appears to be HTML 4.01
no warnings or errors were found

BTW, the HTML output is *correct* (the width has been removed)
My question is : should not tidy complain in order to allow the user to
clean the source.
Maybe is this a "psycho-rigid-Unix-user-question" :-)

And sad enough, 50% of the HTML browsers I wanted to use with my pretty
cleaned and correct HTML were not able to display it correctly  :-(

Jany.

tidy is great anyway. Thanks Dave.
