This report is for the Tidy version of 13th January 2000.

The column numbers reported by Tidy in warnings for unknown attributes are
incorrect.  For example, the following HTML:

  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN">
  <html>
  <title>Column bugs</title>  <body>
  <p bogus="X" yoohoo="Y">Some text</p>  </html>

reports these warnings:

  line 6 column 1 - Warning: unknown attribute "yoohoo"
  line 6 column 1 - Warning: unknown attribute "bogus"

However, the column numbers should be 14 and 4, respectively.  I presume
but have not verified that "lexer->columns" is not being updated as
attributes are parsed in "lexer.c".
