Actually, I was agreeing with you. <TABLE BORDER> should be legal. If Tidy
wants to convert it, it should go to the implied form, not to <TABLE
BORDER="border"> (which is an invalid value), or perhaps to <TABLE
BORDER="1"> (which is I believe the implicit value).

cheers,

Stuart,

Thanks ... looks like a browser issue then.

I'm sorry to have bugged you with a spurious problem not of your making.

Regards,

Nigel
