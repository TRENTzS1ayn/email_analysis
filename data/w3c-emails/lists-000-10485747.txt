Tidy has been further expanded to "make it look good in Netscape 4.x"? ???
Even
with the "hack it until it looks good" yardstick, it truncates the
beginning of
the list item[s] in IE4.x, IE5.x, and Opera 3.x (and presumably Mozilla,
though
I don't have a recent build).

Could this not be made an option, as opposed to default behavior?
