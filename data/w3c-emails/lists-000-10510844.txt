Tidy's word-2000 option is draconian and strips out the class, lang
and style attributes, see PurgeAttributes(). It also strips out
width attributes from th and td. This was based upon an inspection
of the markup produced by the save as web page export filter from
Word2000. I figured it would be more cost effective to strip these
out and to later add back in class attributes manually.

I would be interested to get suggestions for improvements.
