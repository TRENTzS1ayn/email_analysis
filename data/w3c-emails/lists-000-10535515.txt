How about calling it a regenerator?  I expect much of the purpose of HTML
Tidy is to work on markup generated by another program which attempts
WYSIWYG and does so with invalid markup.  Tidy doesn't generate the markup,
it rather regenerates it.

I think it would be a useful umbrella term for those functions.

Certain programs habitually generate the same errors.  If detecting the
generator assists in disambiguating a markup error with regard to the
intention behind the error, detecting the original generator from the META
tag would be very useful.  Not the by-hand vs. by-machine difference as
originally suggested but rather differentiating different machines'
behaviors and intents.
