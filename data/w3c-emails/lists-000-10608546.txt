Certain programs habitually generate the same errors.  If detecting the
generator assists in disambiguating a markup error with regard to the
intention behind the error, detecting the original generator from the META
tag would be very useful.  Not the by-hand vs. by-machine difference as
originally suggested but rather differentiating different machines'
behaviors and intents.

Yes, that seems to be a very good idea. If the Word 2000 generator tag is
seen then invoke the Word 2000 cleanup function (unless explicitly
over-ridden).

I was very pleased to discover that tidy adds its meta generator tag, not
replaces the one there already.

Cheers,
