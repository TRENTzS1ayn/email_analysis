Would you want to add the facility to remove WordPerfect <BR WP="BR1">
codes
and <BR WP="BR2"> codes as you have for Word 2000 codes? (I don't THINK
Tidy
can do that yet ...). I don't think even conversion to <br /> is necessary,
as they seem to replicate the line breaks at the ends of paragraph
elements.

Thanks,
