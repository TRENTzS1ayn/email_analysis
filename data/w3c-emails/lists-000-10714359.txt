Dave Raggett has explained in http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/ why
this
isn't and won't be an option. (Look for the subtitle "Layout style".)

Are there any other problems?  If not, it would be easy to run a
search-and-replace to remove these line breaks.  (Since I use
MS-DOS/Windows
and am too lazy/stupid to program, my preferred tool is a compact and cheap
old
version of SNR; a big new GUI version of this can be downloaded from
http://www.bcpl.net/~wnidiffe/stextu.html and I think the package includes
a
"console-mode" version.  With UNIX, I'm sure you're spoiled for choice.)
