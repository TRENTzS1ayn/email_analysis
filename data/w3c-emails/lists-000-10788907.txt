Which would be all CSS. NN3 has no CSS implementation whatsoever.

<<I know the aim of TIDY is to ease conversion towards HTML4.0 but is it
possible to use it to clean HTML files to an output that would stick to
HTML
3.2 ? in particular, Word-2000 function generates a lot of style classes,
would it be possible to make TIDY work to HTML 3.2 ? This is because a lot
of our users still use navigator 3, which doesn't work very well with
css.>>

You want Tidy to recreate a Word2000 page in deprecated HTML? This does not
seem reasonable, does it?

It does seem reasonable to me that if a page is validated to HTML 4.0 and
uses CSS, it should look fine in Netscape 3. That has been my experience.
