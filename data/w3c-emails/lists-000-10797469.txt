The "indent" option appears to take care of our designer's
immediate concerns (yeesh, how did I miss that in the
documentation!).

I'm still paranoid about the idea of normalizing our HTML code
at all, because of the general crappiness of both IE and Netscape.
God knows what kind of formatting wackiness that proper HTML tags
will cause.

But like you say, we can always do some pre/post processing to fix
these.   Tidy seems to do such a good job on our files that it
seems a shame not to use it just because it creates correct code!

Thanks!
