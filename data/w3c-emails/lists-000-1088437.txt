Tidy isn't currently looking at the meta element for this. A work
around is to either get Tidy to map Latin-1 characters to numeric
entities or to map them to native Latin-1 character values. You
can do this via the command line options or the config file.
See the tidy home page for details:

Yes, it is specified by the HTML 4.0 spec from which XHTML is
derived. The former HTML working group disapproved of the
language attribute for the script element, preferring instead
the type attribute which is based on Internet Media Types.

That would be very hard since Tidy works by creating a clean parse
tree from the markup and pretty printing it to create the output.
You may find that the options available to you in the config file
offer what you want. If not can you be specific about your
preferrences for how markup should be formatted.
