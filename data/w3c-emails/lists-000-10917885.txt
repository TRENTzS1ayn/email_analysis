To unsubscribe, send a message of:

     To: html-tidy-request@w3.org
     Subject: unsubscribe

And in future, please keep track for yourself what mailing lists you
subscribe to and keep the welcome message they give you as they contain the
instructions on how to unsubscribe.

(Now if we could just do something about people who set up auto-repliers on
their mailbox that send cryptic messages back to the posters to mailing
lists.)
