It is, after all, called "HTML-TIDY." My guess is that the program assumes
when you ask for XML that you want a *web page* in XML rather than a db for
example; and most web browsers expect the <html>, <head>, <title> and
<body>
tags (and their closing equivalents), so it puts them in.

I could be wrong, of course . . .

I'd use TIDY as my FIRST cleanup step.
