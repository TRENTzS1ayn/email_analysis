Many thanks for your feedback.  I have altered FindTag() in tags.c
to deal with this, moving the test for XmlTags to before the
dictionary lookup. I have also updated the way xml is formatted to
suppress line breaks after start tags and before end tags for
elements with mixed content. I have to make a new release with these
fixes soon.
