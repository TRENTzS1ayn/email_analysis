It would be very useful if one could control of the amount of message output
tidy generates.  Specifically the ability to turn off all message output (to
stderr) expect for errors and warnings (and optionally, not even warnings).
This is not the -e option, it still should output a file.  Its a great program
and it would be much easier to use it in HTML process applications if it could
be quite like most unix programs.

Thanks,
