I have the latest version, but I think I finally figured out what the
problem was. In order to get my config file to work you must have
deleted the white space before each line.

Even with just a simple one line config file, such as
"uppercase-tags:Yes", if I have one white space before the line it
accesses the config file but ignores the line. I don't get any error
messages, but nothing changes. When I delete the white space, it works
as expected. Thanks for trying it out.
