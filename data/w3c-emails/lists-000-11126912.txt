That's plain wrong. Although you could say that they are special
paragraphs, this is not only related to the display of these elements.
Instead, they dogive the document an overall structure that could be
used by browsers to display an outline.

And h[1-6] elements do have a hierarchy too: a h1 element is more
important than h2. It's only that the elements are not nested.

No. In this case, the headings lose their semantics. They are no longer
recognized as headings by HTML-parsing software.
