Hi Dave,

     Back in December Dan Kohn requested you include a Meta
Generator tag in Tidy's output, and you replied:

> ...It would need to be modified slightly, since href is not an
> allowed attribute for meta.

There was universal approval to the idea in this list, and I'm
pleased to see that the 13th January version incorporates a simpler
version of what Dan suggested:

<META NAME="generator" CONTENT="HTML Tidy, see www.w3.org">

Would there be advantage in including the version number (and release
date)?


I see that the W3C's own front page has a couple of Meta tags with
full URI references, for example:

>   <META http-equiv="PICS-Label" content='(PICS-1.1"http://www.classify.org/safesurf/" l gen true for "http://www.w3.org"
by
> "philipd@w3.org" r (SS~~000 1 SS~~100 1))'>

Is this valid, thus somewhat contradicting your original statement,
or has the W3C webmaster got it wrong? :-)


Incidentally, Tidy replaces the double-quite marks in the second and
third lines of the above example by &quot; - is that correct?


          Regards,

               Peter Vince
