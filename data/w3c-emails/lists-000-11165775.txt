This is probably related to my post of 21st January where I posted that
valid XHTML 1.0 files are not recognized by Tidy as such. Since then I
have also found that valid HTML 4.01 are not recognized either. All my
files validate with the W3C and WDG validators but not with this version
of Tidy. Older versions of Tidy report HTML versions correctly.

Maybe there are other errors in that table that you refer to as well?
Unfortunately I don't have an older version of the source code to check
what was there previously.
