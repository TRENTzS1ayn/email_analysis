Basically this could be done via a modified printing routine
in pprint.c, but what are you going to do about scripts like

  if  some condition
      markup for use if the condition is true
  else
      markup for use if the condition is false

You can't pick the right markup unless you know the value of the
condition. Other problems arise from computed values. In short, I
don't think this problem is tractable *in general*.
