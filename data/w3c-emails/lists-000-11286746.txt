I just tried your test file and discovered that when you save
the file to "Web page" (not using the HTML export filter), all
of the <o:p> elements are empty. I am therefore curious as to why
you want these preserved. For instance, at the end of the file
there is:

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-AU><![if<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>Which is essentially an empty paragraph and a pretty poor way to
add vertical whitespace.
