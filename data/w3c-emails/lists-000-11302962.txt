Actually, nesting plain "div"s seems sufficient in Amaya and in MSIE:

<div>
 <h1>First Order Heading</h1>   <h2>Second Order Heading</h2></div>

Using "id"s (names) might be pretty, but as Jany points out, they make the
structure inconvenient to modify. Retaining the <hN> elements seems useful
for backward compatibility with HTML.

I'd be interested in hearing why OpenJade might be a better solution, but
Tidy still seems to be appropriate for this variation of HTML-to-XHTML
conversion. Does this seem feasible in the simplified form above?
