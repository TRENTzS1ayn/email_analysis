For what it's worth, I just ran your code snippet through tidy26jul99 and
tidy27sep99 on a linux box and both my tidy versions claimed there were no
warnings or errors.  Tidy recognized the code as html 3.2.  Don't know
whether the problem is specific to Windows or whether more recent versions
of Tidy all display it.
