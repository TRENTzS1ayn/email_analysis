Dave,

Could you include an option to use tabs instead  of spaces? I know, it
might not comply with whatever standards exist for HTML,  but it's sooo
convenient!

Also, maybe it is possible to give more detailed  options for output
formatting? Currently when I run Tidy, my code which was fit  on one page
now spans on three :(

The format I use is:

<table>
<tr>
???  <td>blah-blah</td>
???  <td>blah-blah
???????  blah-blah</td></tr>
<tr>...etc.

It's like I don't strip end tags  (Netscape sometimes screw up my tables
without them), but I don't waste a  separate line for them either. Tidy
currently doesn't have an option for that.  Can you make one? Something
like 'do not put end tags on new line'.

Also I noticed that if table cell  contents span multiple lines, they are
not indented past <td>, but are put  on the same level as <td> tag. Could
this one be addressed as  well?

Thanks a lot.
