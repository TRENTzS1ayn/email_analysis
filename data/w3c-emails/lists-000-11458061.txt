... thinks it's in BODY instead.

Running HTML below thru Win32 Tidy:

<html>
<head>
<title>test</title><body>
</body>
</html>

gives:

     Tidy (vers 13th January 2000) Parsing console input <stdin>
     line 6 column 1 - Warning: </head> isn't allowed in <body> elements
     line 7 column 2 - Warning: <body> isn't allowed in <body> elements

     "stdin" appears to be HTML proprietary
     2 warnings/errors were found!

The OBJECT element may also appear in the content of the HEAD element
