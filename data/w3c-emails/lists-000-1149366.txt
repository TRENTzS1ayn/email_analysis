But they are not valid XML PIs, which cause otherwise well formed
XML/XHTML pages to be rejected by XML parsers/validators.

We already have different types of parsers in different flavors.
Stuffing proprietary PIs inside legal XML constructs would impose only
small modifications and minimal overhead on parsers for those proprietary
PIs. The nice thing however, is that these XML/HTML files may be
procesessed by XML parsers as well.

I see that as a great benefit, others may not.
