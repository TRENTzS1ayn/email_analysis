It
is much easier to pinpoint and correct errors if the "Show Source Input"
block is checked.  Not all Validators are up to date - in concert with -
valid HTML standards or use correct DTD's (Document Type Descriptions).
IMHO
an excellent primer regarding Validators can be found at:

All Things Web - Understanding HTML Validation

http://pantos.org/atw/h-valid.html

There are clickable hyperlinks to validation tools (via logos) on the pages
of the mini-site listed in my signature block.  Without wishing to appear
self-serving, I ask those interested to visit the "Standards Now" and
"Campaign for a non-Browser specific WWW" (also has excellent information
regarding Validation) web pages.
