There is a tab problem in the Makefile on line 28 which prevents building
with GNU Make and FreeBSD make - at least on my system.  Also, the date
of parser.c is whack:

-rw-r--r--  1 root  www  95354 Jan 12 18:32 parser.c

Date reports: Wed Jan 12 14:31:46 EST 2000

gmake: *** Warning:  Clock skew detected.  Your build may be incomplete.

Is your clock one minute fast over there? :)
