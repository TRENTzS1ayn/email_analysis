That one is the same as your output.  No change.

Reasonable.

Maybe, under XML, Tidy doesn't like a <br> outside a <p>.  Seems a strange
error message though if that were the case.  Also, it would complain about
the <a> not having a container.

If you could cite a URL to the full page that exhibits the behavior it
would be much easier to diagnose.

Because <br>s are always empty; they aren't containers.

Working from your example markup, try putting the <br clear="all" /> as the
last content your last paragraph?  Further, put the <a>...</a> as the first
content of your first paragraph.
