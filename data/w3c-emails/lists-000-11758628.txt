Inasmuch as I am retired and therefor have lots of "play time" on my hands,
I
decided to convert all of my existing web pages (78) from existing HTML
4.0/4.01 to XHTML 1.0 (although I have retained copies in the HTML
iterations
in case I want to revert).  I did this for there seems to be no doubt that
XHTML will soon be adopted as the defacto web authoring language in order
to
accommodate the various wireless/handheld device Browsers that will soon be
forthcoming. The DTD's for XHTML 1.0 are now available for Validation on
the
W3C page (I provide a clickable hyperlink on the Validation page of my
mini-site in my signature block).  Of course the current iteration of XHTML
1.0 is at present only a proposed recommendation of W3C (the usual Caveats
apply), but I believe the eventual form and substance will not differ too
much - if the DTD's change somewhat, I will adjust my coding.

In any event, I have validated all of my pages as XHTML 1.0 in the W3C HTML
validator, the W3C Cascading Style Sheet validator and the XML.com (RUWF -
R
U Well Formed?) validator (again, I have provided a hyperlink to this
facility on the Validation page of my mini-site).

The point of all this is that I used TIDY to convert all of my web pages to
XML/XHTML - solely - I just ran 'em through with nary a hitch! (Of course,
I
had previously validated the HTML code).

So far I have checked my XHTML 1.0 pages in the following Browsers, where
they perform/display as designed:

MS Internet Explorer ver 5.0
MS Internet Explorer ver 4.0, 4.x
Netscape Navigator 4.x
Opera 3.60
Web TV 2.0
Lynx 2.7, 2.8
Amaya 2.2
OBR (Optical Braille Recognition)

Thanks Dave Raggett!
