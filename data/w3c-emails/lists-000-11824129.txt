I maintain a small set of XHTML pages and up until recently Tidy has
been a great help. Final validation has been with the W3C or WDG on-line
validators.

With the 13th January release I find that all my XHTML pages are now
reported by Tidy as being HTML Proprietary yet they still valid XHTML
according to the on-line validators. Has a change been made to Tidy
that has resulted in a bug which now prevents Tidy reporting valid
XHTML? I have even tried with a minimal set of tags, html, head, meta,
body, div and hr and still I have no success.

I am using tidy.exe in conjunction with HomeSite 4.5 and the Tidy dll
that is part of HTML-Kit. Previous versions of Tidy report my pages as
valid XHTML so I am sure something has changed with the latest release.

Have I missed something so obvious that I cannot see it? Is anyone else
having the same problems?
