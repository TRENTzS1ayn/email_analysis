In SGML the case of a tag doesn't matter. In XML it does. For XHTML,
which is a reformulation of HTML in XML, the W3C HTML working group
was forced into making a choice of case for HTML elements and
decided to use lower case. The root element "html" therefore needs
to be in lower case for XHTML but could be in either case when the
document conforms to SGML.
