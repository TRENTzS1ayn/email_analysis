Dave,

I'm in the process of testing my Java version of Tidy on some public web pages.  I'm seeing some indescribably bad HTML documents, so, as I see it,  their is a great need for Tidy :-)

Anyway, I've noticed that the official Tidy seems to generate bogus attribute values in some cases.  It seems to be in cases where the attribute value is missing in invalid elements.  Java Tidy outputs "" for the missing attribute values.  My guess is that Tidy is printing uninitialized data for these values.  Since I have enough other bugs in Java Tidy to solve, I thought I would pass this one along to you.

Attached are 2 test HTML documents.  To reproduce the problems, run tidy and look at the values for the following attributes: "width" in test1.html, "font" and "br" in test2.html.
