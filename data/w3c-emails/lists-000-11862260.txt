While I cannot speak to the cause of this problem in Mozilla, I do know it
is not limited to Mozilla. I have seen the same problem in M14 on NT and
Linux. Although viewing source shows the HTML file, it does not display in
the browser. But a problem was first pointed out to me by someone running
IE4.5 on a Macintosh. His browser displayed the raw source code.

In all cases, the page could be displayed correctly in the browser by
removing the xml declaration on line 1 of the file.

Since IE4.5 is a freely distributed production version of a browser, I
have had to back off my plans to convert all my html files to
xhtml. Actually, I have been converting them to xhtml, and then removing
the xml declaration.

Sorry, this is probably not a problem with tidy, but perhaps not too for
afield for  the tidy list.
