ok, using "-n" works fine. I still have a little problem : how to customize
the header ?

*this one make the .xml unreadbale by IE5, how can I remove it :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html-in-xml/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

*this one cause does not seem to be valid (404), and actually I would prefer
to have only <html> :
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/Profiles/xhtml1-transitional">

I think it would be valuable to put this "HTML 2 XML for dummies" in a
section of the project description.

thanks for your help.
