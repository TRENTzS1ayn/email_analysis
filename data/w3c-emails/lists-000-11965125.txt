Hey, don't knock it till you've tried it :-)

HTML-Kit is a whole lot more than a wrapper for Tidy.  The fact you can
Tidy
a document right in the editor and then selectively replace tidied elements
of the script is worth it alone.

add.

No, wait a moment. . . .

><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN&nbsp;</DIV>I take that back.  It should be integrated within MS Outlook!
