Dear Dave and colleagues,

I am using the windows console version of tidy (tidy.exe) since a 
few days as a plug-in for the EditPlus HTML Editor. I really got to 
like tidy, because the integration in EditPlus worked perfect and 
tidy itself is the best HTML teaching tool I ever experienced. 
Nevertheless I'd like to  report two problems that arouse with tidy:

1. If the title of a HTML page is accidentally wrapped into a 
<strong>- tag (I know that this is a beginner's mistake, but I am 
one), tidy.exe shifts the title text with the <strong>-tags into the 
body and puts out some confusing error messages. I have attached 
a zip-file (tidybug.zip) with an example for this: pretidy.html is the 
file as written by me, posttidy.html is the file after correction by 
tidy.exe and tidyerrs.txt is the errorfile. For this example I was 
running tidy with the -f -m options.

2. I had written a configuration file tidyconf.cfg for more convenient 
use of tidy, pointing to the configuration file via the -config option. It 
worked perfectly at the beginning, but during heavy usage and 
experimenting with the configuration file over the day I got the 
message "can't access tidyconf.cfg" more and more often. At the 
time of this writing, tidy skips the configuration file completely, and, 
running it from the windows console, it seems that the -config 
option is not recognized any more. I have never changed the 
location nor the name of the configuration file ad it was always 
placed in the same directory as tidy.exe. In addition, when it 
worked the error-file option was only realized inconsistenly.

I hope the above may help to improve a very useful tool
greetings
