The question is whether to assume the strong tag was intended to
be part of the title or whether the </title> end tag has been
forgotten. I guess the best approach would be to make the help

Thanks for your feedback, I will see what I can do. Although I have
no clue as to what is happening about the config file. I haven't
seen anything like that myself. (not much help I'm afraid).
