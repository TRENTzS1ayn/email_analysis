What possible reason would you have for empty tags?  What are you trying to
style when there is nothing to style inside the tags?

According to the DTD, TABLE requires TBODY, either explicitly or
implicitly, which in turn requires at least one TR where each contains at
least one TD or TH.  It is just not legal to have <TABLE></TABLE>, ID
attribute or no.  (Adjust case appropriately for XML.)
