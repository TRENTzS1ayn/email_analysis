With DHTML (the DOM) you can add content.

With TABLE, yes.  But her example of <span id="foo"></span> is entirely legit.
You can tell Tidy to leave empty <P>s alone with the "drop-empty-paras" option,
but apparently not DIVs or SPANS.  I've previously tricked Tidy before by
changing empty SPANs and DIVs to something like <span id="foo">&nbsp;</span>.

IMO, there should be a "drop-empty-elements-with-IDs" option (though with
hopefully a shorter name :).  Or better yet, just a "drop-empty-elements"
option, period.

drop-empty-paras was too focused on one element.
