After the < and the element name, you can have any whitespace before and after
the attribute name, before and after the = sign, or between the attribute value
and the closing > of the start tag.

Bad?  How so?  The following is perfectly valid:


<a
            href         =

"foo"
                  >


If by bad, you mean hard-to-read, well yes -- in that example.  But in the case
of long URLs, it sometimes makes sense to linebreak before or after attributes,
since you don't want to break the URL itself.
