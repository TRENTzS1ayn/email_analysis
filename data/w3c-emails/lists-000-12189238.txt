Another reason is that you can use style sheets to style the empty
element. One of the reasons I won't let Tidy loose on the
RichInStyle.com test suite (http://richinstyle.com/test) is that it
takes exception to things like <div style="background: red; height:
100px; width: 100px; border: solid; float: left">, dropping them and
making the test page useless.
