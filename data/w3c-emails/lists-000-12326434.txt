I prefer tabs also.  I can easily (re-) define the number of spaces 
these are expanded to on my favourite text editor (BBEdit on the 
Macintosh).  It also makes for smaller files, particularly if there 
is a lot of indenting.  And we are always being told to minimise the 
file size to speed downloading :-)

Regards,

Peter
