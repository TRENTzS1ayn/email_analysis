I'm using Tidy from with in HTML-kit (version 1 , build 288) and like what
it does except for one major problem.  If there's a solution could you send
me step-by-step procedures to solve it.

I'm developing Visual Basic 6 Webclasses and using replacement tags such as
<WC:name></WC:name> (forms have 10 pairs of tags) and when I press F9 from
within the HTML-Kit, Tidy wants to remove all of them.  How can I get it to
leave any tags starting with "WC:" and "/WC:" ?  I tried
Edit/Preferences/Tidy, but I must have done it wrong because it didn't help.
