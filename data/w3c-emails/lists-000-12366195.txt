Being nit-picky, it probably should be

add-xml-decl

(not PI).  I've called it a PI too, only to be told in no uncertain terms that
it is *not* a PI, it just *looks* like one.  :)

See http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-prolog

and http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-PI

But if you leave it as "add-xml-pi", we'll know what you *mean*. ;)
