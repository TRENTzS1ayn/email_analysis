I think the consensus here was that differentiating "machine-generated" 
markup (where a block tag is often incorrectly spanned by an inline tag, 
and therefore where the inline should be duplicated in the next block) from 
"hand-generated" markup (where an inline fails to terminate at the next 
block tag due to inadvertent omission of the terminating tag, and therefore 
where the inline termination should be inserted) wasn't easily possible 
from the HTML context.  Therefore, a configuration option to choose one of 
these two behaviors would be welcome (with the current behavior as the 
default -- principle of least surprise).
