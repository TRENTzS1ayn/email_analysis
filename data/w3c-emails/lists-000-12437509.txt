I absolutely agree - a possible solution would be to extend the 
"indent-spaces" configuration directive to accept not only numbers as 
values but also boolean or string values:

examples:
indent-spaces: 4
indent-spaces: no  // maybe too confusing?
indent-spaces: tab

I would never vote for replacing a good thing with another good thing, but 
rather allow the choice between both of them...
