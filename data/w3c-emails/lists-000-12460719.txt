Re: ability to include new tags via config file

Good point.  However, _by default_ tidy's configuration doesn't, I believe,
include any of the non-standard tags.  So someone has to take a specific
action to get Tidy to deal with something 'invalid'.  In those cases, Tidy
should not generate a DOCTYPE that indicates the page is one of the
known standards; instead, perhaps, it should require the user to provide
a different doctype, even if that means they have to write one...
