But if the server is using & as its separator in CGI scripts, the link
will be broken. See

    http://www.cs.duke.edu/~dsb/kgv-faq/errors.html#bad-entity

for more information. The bottom line, if I understand correctly, is
that as long as you refer to web sites that use only & as separators
in CGI scripts, you can't have HTML 4.0 compliant pages :(.
