Hi Dave,

The HTML spec allows for machine-readable META data lines in the 
header, one variant of which specifies the last update date and time 
of the file:

<META NAME="datetime" CONTENT="2000-03-30T20:31:00+0100">

I believe this and the other META statements are valuable indicators 
on HTML files.  The FTP program I use stamps the current date and 
time on the file's hard-disc catalogue information when they are 
transferred, rather than that from the source disc.  Having the 
actual update time encoded in the file itself allows it to be quickly 
checked to see if it is the current version.

I was wondering if it would be possible for Tidy to recognise this 
Meta statement and update it, or even (optionally?) to add one in the 
same way as it adds a Generator statement?

Regards,

Peter
