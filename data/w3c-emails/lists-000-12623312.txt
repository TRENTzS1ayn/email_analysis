Two things appear to have gone wrong in the very week that I was
travelling and away from email!

First there were a lot of bounced messages Second there was some
weird problem whereby old mail was suddenly reposted without any
obvious reason. Our sysadmin kindly noticed the problem and stepped
in with a fix - thanks Gerald!

Hopefully the volume of email will drop to a low level as I for
one can't afford much time to work on Tidy. There are more
pressing tasks such as drafting briefing packages and charters
for further work on HTML at W3C.
