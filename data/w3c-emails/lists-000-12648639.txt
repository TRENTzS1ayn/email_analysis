Can't the empty tags be inserted themselves in the same manner relative to
the position of contentful markup (:before/:after)?  AFAIK, the only tags
that make sense when empty are TD, TH (which can be made to render as
non-empty using CSS), and BODY.  Even empty paragraphs make no sense in
HTML (how can you reasonably describe nothingness as a paragraph?) except
as a presentational abuse of HTML.
