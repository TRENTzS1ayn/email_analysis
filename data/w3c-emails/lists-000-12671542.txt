If your document is xml, then you need to set the xml option.
Otherwise, you need to declare all of the new elements. Tidy
supports several properties for this:

  new-empty-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
  new-inline-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
  new-blocklevel-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
  new-pre-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3

e.g.

  new-inline-tags: WC:name

From what you say, these may not be settable from within HTML-Kit
at least in the version you have. You may therefore need to use
Tidy directly with a plain text editor or a tool such as NoteTab
which run's tidy.exe on your behalf (see www.notetab.com)
