It's a little hard from your email to determine exactly what your
configuration looks like.  Basically, all you should need to actually
run JTidy, I think, is the Tidy.jar file which is included in the
distribution.  Make sure that it is specified in your CLASSPATH.

Can you send me privately the URL or the actual text of a web page that
is giving you these "unexpected </head> ..." messages.  I'll run it here
and see if I have the same problem.  We can go from there and determine
if the problem is in JTidy or your setup.
