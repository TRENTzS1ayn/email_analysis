Dave,

This report is to draw your attention to a couple of coding oddities that I found with Tidy in translating it to the more strongly-typed Java.

(1) In parser.c ParseBody (line 2227) there is the following if statement:

                if (!node->tag->model & (CM_ROW | CM_FIELD))

    In C, the operator '!' has higher precedence than '&', furthermore,
    according to K & R, '!' converts a non-zero operand to 0 and 0 to 1.
    So, I doubt that this is what you intended.  Did you intend the following?

                if (!(node->tag->model & (CM_ROW | CM_FIELD)))

(2) In parser.c ParseDocument (line 2715) there is this function call:

        ParseHTML(lexer, html, no);

    But the prototype of ParseHTML is as follows:

        void ParseHTML(Lexer *lexer, Node *html, uint mode)

    Did you intend to pass IgnoreWhitespace (0) as the mode (since 'no' is
    the first element of the enum Bool).

Regards,

Andy Quick
