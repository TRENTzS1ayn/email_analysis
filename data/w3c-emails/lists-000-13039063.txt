Okay, I see what you mean now.

First of all, I set up Tidy on my own by just extracting everything from
the zip file and that seemed to work just fine.  I think your
installation is working fine also.

The problem is that the example that you're using, 'code example of
using Java Tidy as a parser' from the JTidy page, has the following line
in it:

tidy.setXmlTags(true);

This means that the _input_ is XML so that is what Tidy is expecting. 
However, your input is HTML, not XML.  Either comment out or delete the
line and you'll see much better results.  You'll get a lot more errors
but they'll be legitimate errors in your page.

You might also try substituting the line

tidy.setXHTML(true);

This tells Tidy to _output_ XHTML although I'm not sure what effect that
has when your using the pretty printer in the TestDOM class in the
example rather than the built-in one inside Tidy.  To use that one, and
bypass all of this other coding, change

t.print(tidy.parseDOM(in, null));

to

tidy.parseDOM(in, System.out);

HTH,
Gary
