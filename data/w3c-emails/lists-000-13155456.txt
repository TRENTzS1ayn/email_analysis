Since both <embed> and <applet> are deprecated in favour of
<object>, it seems a worthwhile task for  Tidy to undertake.
Unless  I have missed the option, it does not currently?

In any event, we are using  JTidy in batch mode, and have written
our own classes to do the above conversion. I guess the problem is
that there are many options, which may be subject specific.

Thus in our case, chemists often transclude molecules using either

<embed> (resolving to a plugin which the user may or may not have)

or

<applet>  (resolving to java which the user may or may not have enabled)

Neither is failsafe, ie both risk no display at all.

Our code could automatically translate either of the above options
to
<object>  This to be either Java or plugin  (or vice versa)
<object> This to be either plugin or Java (or vice versa)
<object>  This to include an image if the above fail
</object>
</object>
</object>

One can see the complexity. Is this perhaps why  Tidy does not
currently handle this conversion?

Are there other issues relating to this we might have missed? 
What for example should one do about  <img>?  Should it be
converted to  <object> or left well alone?
