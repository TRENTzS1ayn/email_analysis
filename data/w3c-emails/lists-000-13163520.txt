Hi all,

I have just posted a new release, see:

  http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/

Due to the pressure of other work and lots of travel etc. I would
like to apologise to all those people who have written to me about
Tidy and who haven't received a reply from me. Please keeping
sending in your bug reports and I will do my best to fix them as
soon as I can.

Regards,

-- Dave Raggett <dsr@w3.org> http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett
