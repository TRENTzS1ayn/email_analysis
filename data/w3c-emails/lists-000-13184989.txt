Hello Chris,

Tidy is right about this warning, please check the HTML Reference's 
Appendix, 
[http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/appendix/notes.html#notes-specifying-data].

You'll have to mask your '</' with a backslash ('<\/'), in order to produce 
valid HTML, just as you'll have to mask '&' with '&amp;' when you are 
writing URLs.


Examples straight from that page:

                 <SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
                   document.write ("<EM>This won't work</EM>")
                 </SCRIPT>

                <SCRIPT type="text/javascript">
                  document.write ("<EM>This will work<\/EM>")
                </SCRIPT>


Some more information you may find on 
[http://www.htmlhelp.org/reference/html40/special/script.html]:

         Technically, the first occurrence of "</"
         followed by any letter is considered the end tag
         for the SCRIPT element. While browsers are
         forgiving in this, authors should avoid using
         strings such as "</P>" in their embedded scripts.
         JavaScript allows authors to use a backslash to
         avoid ending the SCRIPT element prematurely,
         e.g., document.write("<\/P>").


Enjoy...

Maybe the first chat site that validates as HTML
4.0 even though user input may contain HTML codes.
