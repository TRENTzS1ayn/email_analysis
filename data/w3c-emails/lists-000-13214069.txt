Dear Folks,

One of my users has reported a problem when tidying his XHTML on the Mac
platform. I have since reproduced his problem with the Windows versions of
Tidy, so this is a non-platform specific problem that I look to your advice
on.

I am able to reproduce the problem with both the 30 Apr 00 and 08 Jul 00
versions.

Here is his original comment :

Here is his config file :

indent: auto
indent-spaces: 2
wrap: 72
markup: yes
clean: no
output-xml: no
input-xml: no
show-warnings: yes
numeric-entities: yes
quote-marks: yes
quote-nbsp: yes
quote-ampersand: no
break-before-br: no
uppercase-tags: yes
uppercase-attributes: yes
smart-indent: no
output-xhtml: yes
char-encoding: latin1
new-inline-tags: mind-it-ignore, /mind-it-ignore
tidy-mark: no
logical-emphasis: yes
drop-empty-paras: no
alt-text: image

Here is a small portion of his input HTML ("index.shtml") that demonstrates
the problem. The entire file can be provided on request :

And is is the tidied output of the above :
