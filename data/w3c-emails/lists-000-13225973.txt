Hello Terry,

Tidy is right about what it's doing - the input file does not appear to be 
valid XHTML 1.0.
I used the WDG Validator 
[http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/direct.html] because it allows 
direct HTML input, while the W3C Validator [http://validator.w3.org/] only 
allows URL and uploaded File validation, yet I believe them to be fairly 
identical.

Please see following snippets from the reference:

"Empty elements must either have an end tag or the start tag must end with 
/>. For instance, <br/> or <hr></hr>."
[http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.6]

"Include a space before the trailing / and > of empty elements, e.g. <br 
/>, <hr /> and <img src="karen.jpg" alt="Karen" />. Also, use the minimized 
tag syntax for empty elements, e.g. <br />, as the alternative syntax 
<br></br> allowed by XML gives uncertain results in many existing user agents."
[http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines]

The output file ALMOST validates, the validator still complains about the 
LEFTMARGIN and TOPMARGIN attributes in BODY.
I have mentioned this before, it would be a very nice addition if tidy 
would allow to suppress "illegal" attributes.

Maybe the first chat site that validates as HTML
4.0 even though user input may contain HTML codes.
