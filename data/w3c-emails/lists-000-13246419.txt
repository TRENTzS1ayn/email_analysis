Hello Dave, not that this is crucially important, but, however,
I would like to see tidy include the release date in its META GENERATOR tag.

Possibly a solution wold be to change in lexer.c, line 785:

AddAttribute(node, "content", "HTML Tidy, see www.w3.org");
to
AddAttribute(node, "content", "HTML Tidy %s, see 
http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/", release_date);


I have to state clearly though that my knowledge of C is quite limited 
(unfortunately), and most of that limited bit I forgot already... :(
I believe that further at the beginning of lexer.c, a line like
extern char *release_date;
would have to be added.


Hope this works...
