Sounds great: Great solution, but also great effort to implement it: 

How do you convert undefined elements/attributes? :-)

Seriously: Attributes and Elements can be deprecated, obsolete,
known proprietary (e.g. M$ or NN) or unknown (typos, ...). Conversion
for the first two classes would be great, for the third one: terrific,
for the last one - impossible.
