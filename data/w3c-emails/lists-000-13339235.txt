Yes.
Or rather, it all depends.  On _which_ attribute, _why_ the HTML is being
tidied, _whether_ an acceptable transformation exists, _what_ the output
is to be used with.

Obviously, if you have HTML-for-browser-foo using attributes that are
specific to browser foo, and you want to use the tidied HTML with browser
foo, a default behaviour of leaving non-standard attributes just the way
they are is pretty much ideal.

Equally obviously, if (as happens to be the case here), there are attributes
you never wanted in the first place but the editor you use insists on
putting them in, you want them deleted.

Even more obviously, if there is important presentation information which
_can_ be expressed in a standard way using style sheets, you'd like to do
that (so that browser Bar can handle the file), but you might well want to
keep the old attributes as well (so that old browser Foo, which can't handle
CSS2 yet, can still render the file).

It's the kind of problem options files are designed to help with.
