Indeed yes, and I suggested the same change back in February.  See:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2000JanMar/0105.html

for details.  It's also logged on Dave Raggett's "Pending Work" page:

  http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/pending.html

(look at the last paragraph before the "Other ideas" section near the 
bottom of the page).

So I guess that's at least two votes for a quieter Tidy!  ;-)
