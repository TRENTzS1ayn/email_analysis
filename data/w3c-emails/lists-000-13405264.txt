If this is the situation, how is Tidy able to deal with other "singleton"
tags, such as <IMG...>?

Perhaps I'm unclear on the Tidy's purposes, I had gotten the idea from the
documentation
that it was supposed to create a valid DOM structure from an HTML document
and
allow you traverse it.

This was my first thought, however there are a couple of problems for what
I'm working on:

1.)  It takes a good deal of processing time to parse once to get an XHTML
doc, then pass it through an XML parser (I use Sun's ProjectX - jaxp), and
finally to pass it through an XSLT parser/transformation (jclark's XT in my
case).

2.)  I have also run into issues where XML parsers (XT and ProjectX-jaxp)
have not been able to deal with entities like '?' returned by Tidy'.
