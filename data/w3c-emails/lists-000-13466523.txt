To:html-tidy@w3.org

It is, indeed, not trivial...
As a first approach, I would try the following:

The freshly tidied HTML file would have to be processed once more by a perl 
script, which in a first step would have to turn the class definitions into 
unique definitions (I believe that tidy names classes like "c1", "c2" etc, 
thus "c1" may be a different definition for one document than for another), 
adjust the class attributes throughout the document accordingly, write the 
modified style definitions into the wanted external CSS document and 
replace the <STYLE></STYLE> with the appropriate <LINK REL="...">.

This should work, but the resulting CSS Document will be fairly large and 
quite ugly.

Second idea then would be to reduce redundancy by checking first whether a 
class definition already exists before adding it to the CSS document...


A well, Mr. Rzepa, a paid two weeks vacation in London does sound 
tempting... maybe my employer would even let me go... ;-)

PS: did I make any sense at all?
