Subject: is there a mode for tidy to provide some template code?


Is there a flag or configuration option I could provide tidy so that
when it encounters these types of situations:

Tidy (vers 8th July 2000) Parsing console input (stdin)
line 579 column 8 - Warning: <img> should use client-side image map
line 622 column 1 - Warning: <table> lacks "summary" attribute
line 654 column 51 - Warning: <img> lacks "alt" attribute


The resulting output would include some sample lines (or comments at least)
showing the format one would use to supply this lack?  That would be
wonderingly useful in my estimation...
