I just checked my master copy and found:

/*
 if there already is a class attribute
 then append class name after a space
*/
if (classattr)
{
  int len = wstrlen(classattr->value) + wstrlen(classname) + 2;
  char *s = (char *)malloc(len *sizeof(char));
  wstrcpy(s, classname);
  wstrcat(s, " ");
  wstrcat(s, classname);
  MemFree(classattr->value);
  classattr->value = s;
}
else /* create new class attribute */
  AddAttribute(node, "class", classname);

There is clearly a bug. The first wstrcpy needs to duplicate the
original value, i.e. to be: wstrcpy(s, classattr->value) so Andy is
right! I will include the fix in the next release.
