Are you sure that the <BASE> was not added by Netscape? When I view 
the page using Opera, there's nothing before the <HTML>.

Anyway, the file you attached has <BASE> not even within <HTML>. 
Given that, I don't think you can criticise Tidy for failing to 
produce the "right" rearrangement. I haven't tried, for example, 
starting a document
 <H1>First heading</H1>
 <HTML>
 <HEAD><TITLE>title</TITLE></HEAD>
 <BODY> 
but I wouldn't complain at whatever Tidy made of it. 

Garbage in, garbage out!
