Hi,

I recently downloaded Java TIDY from :
http://www3.sympatico.ca/ac.quick/jtidy.html

I ran JAVA TIDY on http://www.cnn.com to convert the page 
to XHTML. The page is converted, but when I try to see how
the XHTML page is rendered on Internet Explorer it looks 
totally different, as compared to the original HTML.

I also used the HTML TIDY plugin for the HTML Kit Editor on 
http://www.cnn.com to convert the page to XHTML. This time 
the page was rendered normally.

I also tried the above 2 steps on other sites like yahoo.com,
amazon.com, etc. For these sites there is no problem while 
rendering the page( for JTIDY and HTML TIDY ).

Could anyone please tell me if I am missing some configuration 
of JAVA TIDY, which is causing this error while rendering ?

Thanks in advance.

Regards
Masaoud
