Masaoud,
 
There are many possible configuration settings for Tidy. 
 
Some of these settings allow changes on HTML code that result in stricter,
more compliant, XHTML/XML.
 
This could cause the resulting -- tidier -- code to render quite differently
than the code that was input.
 
I suspect that the CNN site uses non-standard tricks to get certain visual
results that are removed with the settings you are using. I suggest trying
many different setting combinations, looking at the resulting code, and
seeing what the rendered result is.
 
I find HTMLTidy most useful as a development tool. It enforces good coding
on my part and teaches me the differences between standard HTML/XHTML and
what (unfortunately) actually works in the current browsers.
 
Ken

Hi,
 
I recently downloaded Java TIDY from :
http://www3.sympatico.ca/ac.quick/jtidy.html
<http://www3.sympatico.ca/ac.quick/jtidy.html> 
 
I ran JAVA TIDY on http://www.cnn.com <http://www.cnn.com>  to convert the
page 
to XHTML. The page is converted, but when I try to see how
the XHTML page is rendered on Internet Explorer it looks 
totally different, as compared to the original HTML.
 
I also used the HTML TIDY plugin for the HTML Kit Editor on 
http://www.cnn.com <http://www.cnn.com>  to convert the page to XHTML. This
time 
the page was rendered normally.
 
I also tried the above 2 steps on other sites like yahoo.com,
amazon.com, etc. For these sites there is no problem while 
rendering the page( for JTIDY and HTML TIDY ).
 
Could anyone please tell me if I am missing some configuration 
of JAVA TIDY, which is causing this error while rendering ?
 
Thanks in advance.
 
Regards
Masaoud
