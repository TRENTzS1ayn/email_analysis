Hello all together,

I would like you to have a look at [http://www.sl-chat.de/Tidy/], my 
experimental page for a Browser interface to HTML Tidy.

It is not done yet, particularily I plan to add "by file upload" and "by 
URL" functionality to it, but the Tidy integration works fairly well. 
Please let me know if you find any bugs.

If you have special preferences, and want to override the default values, 
you can form an URL like following scheme and bookmark it:
http://www.sl-chat.de/Tidy/?tidy-mark=no&output-xhtml=yes&clean=yes
(this would suppress the tidy META GENERATOR tag, convert presentional 
markup to CSS and output XHTML).


I'm looking forward to hearing your comments.

Maybe the first chat site that validates as HTML
4.0 even though user input may contain HTML codes.
