Hi all,

calling tidy by
"tidy3.exe -config xhtml.ini -i -u -c -asxml %1 > tidied.htm"

(ini file is :
tidy-mark: yes
wrap: 65535
indent: auto
indent-spaces: 4
output-xhtml: yes
doctype: strict
break-before-br: yes
clean: yes
logical-emphasis: yes
enclose-text: yes
enclose-block-text: yes
error-file: error.txt
)

output says :

Tidy (vers 30th April 2000) Parsing "enag20~1.htm"

"enag20~1.htm" appears to be HTML 4.01 Transitional
no warnings or errors were found

(i thought i'd downloaded the VERY latest version as of 2 weeks ago...
???)

BUT

i then noticed that &#8220; and &#8221; (and maybe &#8222; too) quotes
had been transformed into simple quotes ("), not even into &quot;
entities. Is that normal behaviour ? I'd prefer them stay as they are...
or at least be warned about it, if it's due to my config !

:-(It's not easy to find these quotes afterwards...)-:


CU, have a nice day

Norbert
