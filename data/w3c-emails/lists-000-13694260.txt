I have been trying to operate directly on the DOM tree that JTidy produces
with the parse or parseDOM method.  I find that this usually causes a null
pointer exception with programs that usually work on DOM trees constructed
by XML parsers.  I chased down the source and it seems to be that JTidy
produces Text nodes that return null when you call getNodeValue().  XML
parsers always seem to produce some String object here.  Basically you have
to modify your programs to check for this condition and they seem to run
fine.
