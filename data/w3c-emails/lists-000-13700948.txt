Is there an official standard for html capitalization?
I've seen varying opinions in many respected textbooks and even in the
w3c.org site.
Is there no official standard?

Thanks,
John

P.S. I haven't used Tidy yet. I'll download it and try it out now. But I'm
not sure if Tidy's capitalization is the "official" std that our company
(IISC) should stick with.
