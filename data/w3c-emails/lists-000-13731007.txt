Hello.  I would like to parse the results of a tidy operation into a DOM.
I'm not sure if this is possible, and it apparently is not with MSXML, as it
raises numerous errors on any HTML document I tidy and then try to parse.  

Is my premise wrong - parsing HTML into an XML DOM can't be done, or am I
using the wrong parser?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
