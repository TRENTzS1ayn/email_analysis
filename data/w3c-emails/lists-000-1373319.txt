I have fixed both of these for the next release which I hope to do
in a few days time, once I have worked through all the feedback.

This would lead to extremely long text lines and would be
unusable in a text editor. I guess it would make a very small
decrease in file size compared with the default settings, but
don't expect that to be signficant for download times.

Tidy works by building a clean parse tree then printing it out.
In this process all knowledge of the original layout is lost.
Unfortunately it would be a great deal of work to preserve the
original layout given the massaging that goes on to clean up the
markup.

Many thanks for your feedback.
