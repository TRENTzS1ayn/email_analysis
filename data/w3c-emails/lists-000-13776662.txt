The simplest thing is to use Tidy to clean up the markup and
convert it into well formed XML, and follow this up with an
off-the-shelf XML tool, e.g. the IBM java tool kit for XML.

You could alternatively add code into Tidy to do what you want.
Tidy provides a simple interface for walking markup trees, although
it doesn't conform the the DOM, but this is hardly surprising given
that work on Tidy started before the DOM.
