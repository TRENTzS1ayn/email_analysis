I get the same under OS/2 warp 3. If you are not into recompiling source
code, you can redirect Tidy's error messages to a file, by adding:

  2>error.txt

at the command line. Your command line would then look something like
this:

tidy -config tidy.cfg input.htm 1>output.htm 2>error.txt.


Cheers,
        Eddie.
