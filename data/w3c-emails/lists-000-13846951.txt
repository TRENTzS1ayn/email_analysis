I can see Stuart's point that P is not allowed in TABLE but if he is right
in listing the only things allowed within a TABLE, why doesn't Tidy insert
the TBODY where it is needed rather than let the browser imply it which
always seems to be a dangerous thing to do?

Cheers,

Tung -- your HTML is at fault, according to the HTML specification: 

11.2.1 The TABLE element

<!ELEMENT TABLE - -
     (CAPTION?, (COL*|COLGROUP*), THEAD?, TFOOT?, TBODY+)>

Those are the only allowed child elements of TABLE. Note that most TBODY was
introduced after the original implementations of TABLE, so most browsers
imply an TBODY if they see TABLE - TR without containing TBODY.
