If you mean &amp;amp; (no second &), it's may be that you're running with
the default value of the quote-ampersand option, which is yes.  If that is
the case, adding the following line to your config file should fix the
problem:

quote-ampersand: no

Note that the definition off quote-ampersand is mistakenly labeled
quote-mark in http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/

If, on the other hand, you really mean &amp;&amp; , perhaps someone else
will have an answer, since I haven't seen that happen myself.

Hello,

if I use &amp; in my HTML file, tidy converts it to &amp;&amp;, because
it replaces
all '&' with '&amp;'.

regards,
Gerrit.
