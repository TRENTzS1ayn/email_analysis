Tidy looks to be a terrific tool for our project.  However, it has one feature  
which prevents us from using it---it wraps a line at a point that is  
inappropriate given our HTML files; we would like to see whether there is a way  
to modify this behavior.

To get around the mathematics limitations of HTML, we frequently
format logical formulas by stringing together a series of specially created  
graphics and emphasized text, for example:

<img src="foo.gif">this-string-should-stay-adjacent-to-gif--nospace-allowed

Though we want tidy to wrap lines at 72 characters, and our project requires
"wrap-attributes: no", tidy introduces a linebreak into the above
at the first <em> tag, thereby producing:

<img src="foo.gif">
this-string-should-stay-adjacent-to-gif--nospace-allowed

This introduces a space between the graphic and the text, and that
space ruins the logical formula which we are attempting to display.

Do we need to change the way the markup tree is built or the
way the tree is pretty printed?  Could you at least point us
to the spot (or spots) in the source where this behavior is generated.

Thanks for your help,
 Yours,
Ed
