Tidy seems to like to change my "&nbsp" bits to "&#160".. Firstly, is this
"better"? I mean, I've always used "&nbsp", but is it non-standard or
somesuch? If "&nbsp" is actually "bad to use", then I thank Tidy for
enlightening me :).

Also, supposing for a moment that "&nbsp" is ok to use, how do I get Tidy to
leave those in there? Looking over the docs
(http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/#help), the most relevant parameter
to my issue seems to be "quote-nbsp". The docs describe it as such: 
"If set to yes, this causes non-breaking space characters to be 
written out as entities, rather than as the Unicode character 
value 160 (decimal). The default is yes."
However, I tried setting the option both ways fro testing. When set to "yes"
(or by omitting the option, which sets it to a default of "yes"), then Tidy
changes my "&nbsp" to "&#160". On the other hand, when set to "no", Tidy
just changes my "&nbsp" to what *look* like spaces (though I suspect that
they're not really character 32, a traditional space).

So, in summary, are "&nbsp" tags to be avoided? And, if not, how can I get
Tidy to leave mine alone? ;)
