That sounds to me like a browser bug; but let's not quibble and instead
accept that you don't want the line break.

Do you use <pre> anywhere?  If not, perhaps you don't need line breaks. 
And if this is so, you could just do a spot of postprocessing to remove
them wholesale, converting from

   [line break]<img
 
  ">[line break]

to

   <img

   ">

respectively.  Too lazy to learn perl (etc.), I use Thomas Lundin's
MS-DOS/Windows-based search-and-replace utility "SNR" for this kind of
thing.  As shareware goes, it's not cheap, but it's handy for all sorts
of purposes.  (Most of its rivals are limited to working line by line,
and won't insert or delete line breaks.)  Strangely, SNR doesn't seem
to have its own web page, but if you poll Google for "thomas lundin snr"
you'll find various sources for it.
