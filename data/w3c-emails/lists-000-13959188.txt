The browser does right, interpreting the end-of-line as white-space and 
displaying it as a space.

I have a similar "problem" with Tidy when changing font size/weight between 
words.  Where Tidy puts the <span ...> tag (or whatever) relative to its 
adjacent space does matter, as the size of that space changes with which 
font it is associated with.  Tidy, quite understandably, does not 
"remember" which side of the space the tag was on.
