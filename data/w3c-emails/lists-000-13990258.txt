We are trying to use tidy to clean up the crufty HTML that Word 2000
produces.  It all works very well except that we lose links to .GIF files
that Word produces.  We would like to keep these,  if possible.  Is this a
bug, or is there a configuration switch I can set to do what we want?
 
Thanks,
Charles Reitzel
