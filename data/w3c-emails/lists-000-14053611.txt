Another contributor to the list recently pointed out that the 
HTML spec actually specifies the DOS standard CR/LF format for best 
compatibility.  Even though there is a small file-size overhead in 
this old "teletype" standard, it is none-the-less the standard, and 
said overhead is really quite small.

Well no, it doesn't.  Here's what it says:

On the Internet, some platforms use carriage return line feed pairs
for line breaks, some use just line feeds, and others just carriage
returns.  As a result, HTML user agents should consider both
isolated line feed and carriage return chracters as line breaks,
with carriage return line feed pairs treated as single line breaks.

That is,
<new line> = CR LF | CR {not followed by LF} | LF.

Concerning line break after <img src="...>,
the specification goes on to say in the very next paragraph
A line break occurring immediately following a start tag
should be discarded, as should a line break occurring immediately
before an end tag.  This applies to all HTML elements without
exception.
That is to say, any HTML user agent (browser) that treats
"<img src='foo/bar'>
and the best of luck" in any way differently from
"<img src='foo/bar'>and the best of luck"
is ***wrong***, "without exception" a line break "should be discarded"
"immediately following a start tag" such as <img...>.

Tidy is within its rights putting a line break there.
Since there are broken browsers out there, it may be unwise for Tidy
to insist on its rights, but let's be clear about where the fault lies.
