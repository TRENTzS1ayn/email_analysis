Dave,

The coding question I raised in a previous message concerning line 2227
of parser.c seems to be causing differences between Tidy and Java Tidy
in the handling of errors with these tags.  Java will not let me code the line
as you have it:

                if (!node->tag->model & (CM_ROW | CM_FIELD))

So I have the equivalent of:

                if (!(node->tag->model & (CM_ROW | CM_FIELD)))

in Java Tidy.

Attached are 2 test cases that may help you.
