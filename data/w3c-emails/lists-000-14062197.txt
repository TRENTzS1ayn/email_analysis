HTML Tidy corrected
<td colspan="7" align-"LEFT">
to
<td colspan="7" align-="LEFT">

A better correction would be
<td colspan="7" align="LEFT">

This is a real error.  (Mind you, the page is full of errors, using
Javascript just for navigation, when <A> is good enough for the job,
and paying very little attention to the proper nesting of <TABLE>
and <FORM>.  Typical HTML, really.)

We can characterise the situation as
<attribute name> <double quote>
where <attribute name> ends with a dash; the suggested repair
is to remove the dash from the end of the <attribute name> and
pretend it was '='.
