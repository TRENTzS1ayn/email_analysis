In principle this could be done, it should be relatively easy to
modify ParseValue() in lexer.c to do this.

Do you have any examples of such legacy scripts, and why these
need to be included in attribute values rather than as the
content of script elements, or in linked scripts?

XHTML could specify whitespace handling beyond that specified
by XML 1.0. So far folks have not been in favor of specifying
limits on the length of attribute values.
