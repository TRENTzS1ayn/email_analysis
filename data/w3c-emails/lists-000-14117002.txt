I believe this is the same bug as documented per my EMail of 16 Jul 00 :

As reported by several other people, and confirmed by myself, this is a bug
introduced into the 8 Jul 00 version of Tidy.

Fortunately, if you have the source code, the fix is quite simple :

tidy.c, Line 898 :

                if (input != null)

this should be :

                if (fp != null)
