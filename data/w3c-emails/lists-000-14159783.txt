Though you didn't mention which platform of Tidy you're looking for, I'm
guessing Win32 since your X-Mailer seems to point to Outlook ;). 

Anyhow, if that's the case, your download link would be
(http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy.exe), which I just copy-n-pasted from
Tidy's webpage. And, I just tried that link, and it worked for me :). If
things still don't work for you, it could be some hiccup in between you and
Tidy's server; to check for that, you could try Tracert.
