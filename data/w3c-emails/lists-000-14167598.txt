The problem is the -- operator.  For example, the for loop in your
example might have been counting down instead of up.  You wouldn't want
Tidy to change idx-- into idx==.  I don't believe you can represent
the -- operator inside a comment that's both legal XML and is recognized
by JavaScript.  So Tidy has to leave it alone.

The only solution is to pull the JavaScript out of the comment and put
it in a CDATA section.  Gary L Peskin posted some changes to do this a
few weeks ago.  Search the Tidy archives at

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2000JulSep/thread.html

for "CDATA".  Beware that the results might get rendered improperly by
non-JavaScript aware browsers, assuming you wanted the resulting XML to
be renderable as "backwards compatible" XHTML.
