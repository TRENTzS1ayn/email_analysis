No, this is correct. HTML defines the values of href attributes as CDATA:

| <!ATTLIST A
|   href        %URI;          #IMPLIED  -- URI for linked resource --
:
| <!ENTITY % URI "CDATA"
:
| CDATA is a sequence of characters from the document character set and 
| may include character entities.

Character entities are recognised by starting with an ampersand. Any
ampersand that doesn't introduce an entity (such as those in URLs) needs
to be encoded as '&amp;'.

hope this helps,
