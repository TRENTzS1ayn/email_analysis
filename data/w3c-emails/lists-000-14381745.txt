Hello everyone, had a question here about html tidy (Called Code Sweeper
--built into Allaire HomeSite 4.5) it's about the very simple code below



<link rel="STYLESHEET" type="text/css" href="test.css">
<meta name="AUTHOR" content="Anyone">
<meta name="DESCRIPTION" content="The Consultative Group.">


is turned into:


<link rel="STYLESHEET" type="text/css" href="test.css">
<meta name="AUTHOR" content="Anyone">
<meta name="DESCRIPTION" content=
"The Consultative Group.">

another example is this one:

<div align="center"><a href="/"><img src="net.gif" width="64" height="28"
border="0" alt="[ net ]" vspace="3"></a> <a href="/feedback.asp"><img src= 
"feedback.gif" width="74" height="28" border="0" alt="[ Feedback ]" vspace=
"3"></a></div>


It seems to break the lines after the = character forcing us to manually or
search and replace all the broken sections.

We have quite a few REAL old documents that have to be converted into html
4.0 standards hence the question here..<G>

It's allot of work...

All help appreciated, hopefully this hasn't been discussed to death
already...<G>

Big Jay
