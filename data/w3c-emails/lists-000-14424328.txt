Dave,

Thanks for the new release!

I've discovered a minor problem that has been present in the past
several releases.

The -i command line option sets IndentContent and SmartIndent, but the
-indent command line option only sets IndentContent.  I don't know which
is correct, but I get the impression they are supposed to function
identically.  This may be caused by an apparent oversight in the if-else
parsing logic in tidy.c, where "indent" is tested for twice (the second
test will obviously never succeed).

Randy
