I know this is unrealistic, but I have to ask anyway.

Take a look at py8ieh=bugzilla@bath.ac.uk
<mailto:py8ieh=bugzilla@bath.ac.uk>  ?s comments on this
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6731 mozilla bug.  I think I
have to agree with his CSS comments.

I would like to see Tidy or another program be able to look for these
tables that are used in this manner and rewrite the HTML code to use CSS
to structure the page the same way.

Anyhow.  I said it was unrealistic.


Thanks

Kevin Berkheiser
