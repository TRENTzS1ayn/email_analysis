Yes, but when using older Unix tools like grep or sed, it makes things a
LOT easier to have the entire marker, including all its attributes, on one
line.

There are also plenty of editors that will wrap the line for you without
actually inserting a line-break (Emacs for example).

I asked for this option a few weeks ago and it is gratifying to see that I
am not the only one who would find it useful.  It is also gratifying to
see it on the "Pending" list.  Thanks, Dave.  Now what about zero-padding
slide numbers with %03d? :-)

Cheers,
