Yes, it looks like you are right. Andy Quick supplied a "fix" over a year
ago, that I applied to my code, but had never seen the effect of this "fix"
until your example.

Specifically, Andy added the following lines at line 204 (04 Aug 00
version) of istack.c in function InsertedToken() :

    if (lexer->istacksize == 0)/* Andy Quick 13 Jun 99 */
        tidy_out(lexer->errout, "0-size istack!\n");

I have yet to verify your suggested fix.

Regards, Terry
