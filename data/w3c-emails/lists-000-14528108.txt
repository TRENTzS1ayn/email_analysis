You might want to check out HTML-Kit. It's an HTML editor which integrates
with tidy and does a whole host of useful stuff (too much to mention here).
You can download the latest version from:

  Subject: Frontpage2000


  I am a rank amateur at web design and use Frontpage 2000 to put up a small
homepage for my family and friends. Several have commented that the "clown"
that should be in the top left hand corner is some times all over the place
depending upon which version of browser, particularly Netscape, they are
using.
  I have also used W3C HTML and CSS validation service which indicate a
truck load of errors, all rather meaningless to this novice.
  I am not a programer and never intent to be;
  So is Tidy for me?
  Will it fix my Frontpage2000 problems?
  Can I incorporate it into Frontpage2000?
  Which Tidy program would suit me: Tidy.exe or TidyGUI (I run Win 98se)

  Thank you for your time.
