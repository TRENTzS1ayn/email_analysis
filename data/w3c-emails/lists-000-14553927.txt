I have started a small regression test of the August Tidy release. The May (and July) releases "tidied" up a test file fine, as did the August version (the August version now generates the Tidy log file). However, the August version now gives an error message I believe is spurious and am wondering if Tidy is really referring to some other error that I can't find. The spurious error is:
 
    line 24 column 1 - Warning: <li> isn't allowed in <body> elements

and the context, approximately lines 20-25, is:

   <body
   onload='javascript:if (top.frames.length&gt;0) parent.docLoaded(window.location.href);'>
      <span class="DocTitle">Cash Reserve (Overview)</span><br />

Comments-suggestions?
