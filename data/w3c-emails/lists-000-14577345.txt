The above style is the most often used.  There's nothing that says the whole
DOCTYPE declaration has to go on one line (I personally find it easier to read
if it doesn't).

The XML 1.0 BNF[1] says:

      [28]  doctypedecl ::= '<!DOCTYPE' S Name (S ExternalID)? S?
                        <!-- some stuff omitted for clarity -->

      [75]  ExternalID ::= 'SYSTEM' S SystemLiteral |
                           'PUBLIC' S PubidLiteral S SystemLiteral

So use the SYSTEM keyword only if there is no PUBLIC keyword:

<!DOCTYPE foo PUBLIC "some FPI" "http://someSystemURI">
<!DOCTYPE foo SYSTEM "http://someSystemURI">

Not in XHTML, because XML *requires* a SYSTEM identifier (see production rule
#75 above).

[1] I found it tiresome navigating around the BNF inside the XML 1.0
Recommendation, so I extracted just the BNF here:
