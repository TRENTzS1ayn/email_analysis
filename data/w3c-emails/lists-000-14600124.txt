Thank you, Jelks & Richard, for clearing that up for me, I was clearly 
wrong about "SYSTEM" and omitting it.

However, I still believe that tidy is wrong about the indentation. While I 
agree with Jelks that it's easier to read like this and that there is 
nothing that says it has to be on one line, Tidy should respect the 
configuration settings and apply them also to the Doctype declaration.
This means: if "indent-attributes" is set to "no", the doctype should go on 
a single line unless "wrap" comes into effect.
If "indent-attributes" is set to "yes" or "wrap" has a value greater than 
zero and smaller than the length of the doctype declaration, the line 
should be wrapped and "indent-spaces" should be applied.

Another thing that I noticed:
Text following a <BR> often gets indented by one space (on a new line), no 
matter what is set about indentation in the configuration file.
Did anybody else experience this problem?
