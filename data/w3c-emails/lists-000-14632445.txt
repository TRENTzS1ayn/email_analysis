Yeah, I've done that too, but it can be a bit of a pain if you have
paragraphs that are of a reasonable size, i.e. larger than screen width.

All I want is for my <IMG>, <A>, and <META> tags to stay on one line (so I
can CTRL-K a tag in one go) and everything else to break at 80 columns or
so. It just seems so logical to me to have the option to treat tags as
un-breakable units...
