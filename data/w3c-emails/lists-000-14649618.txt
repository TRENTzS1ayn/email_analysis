I use tidy and Amaya to manage XHTML documents. A major
annoyance is that they break lines differently, introducing
a lot of noise in my CVS/RCS history.

A while back, we got some feedback on the XML c14n spec,
proposing an alternative line-breaking algorithm:

"In [...] significantly enhancing the utility of line-oriented text
processing tools in dealing with canonicalized documents, I believe
this alternative is worth considering."

Basically, you break lines between <tag-name and >,
and after each attribute, and line breaks in character
data get escaped (&#10;).

I have written it up in some detail; please see:
