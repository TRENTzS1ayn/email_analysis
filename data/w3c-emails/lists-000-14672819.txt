Alright, I have tried to spot the problem and found following minimized 
examples. In UPPERCASE you will find the INPUT and in lowercase tidy's 
output... three examples, first shows the effect, second doesn't, third 
does again:

[Example I, "indentation buggy"]
         <TABLE>
         <TR>
                 <TD><BR>
                 </TD>
         </TR>
         </TABLE>

     <table>
       <tr>
         <td><br>
          </td>
       </tr>
     </table>


[Example II, "indentation correct"]
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><BR>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

     <table>
       <tr>
         <td><br>
         </td>
       </tr>
     </table>


[Example III, "indentation buggy"]
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><BR>
  </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

     <table>
       <tr>
         <td><br>
          </td>
       </tr>
     </table>


The funny part is that if you re-run tidy over the correct output of the 
second example, you're gonna get the "incorrect" out put of the third 
example....


Do you need me to find more examples, like... without tables? Or is this 
sufficient? By the way, I believe that this is NOT a new "bug", it's been 
like that in previous releases already.

PS: [http://www.sl-chat.de/Tidy/] has been updated to output tidy's error 
messages, as requested by someone whose name I forgot. Thanks for the 
suggestion though.

Maybe the first chat site that validates as HTML
4.0 even though user input may contain HTML codes.
