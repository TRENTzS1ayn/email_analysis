Hello Dave,

such an option might be useful for some purposes, but would not really be 
necessary, I think.
Besides that, the 1 space indentation is not related to this, is it?

What might be useful is a modification to the "indent: auto" option, like 
when <br/ > appears before </td>, that Tidy does NOT add the otherwise 
common linebreak?
Do I make sense here?

About the one-space-indentation: I think it's inherited, meaning that 
further lines are also indented by an additional space. But I did not try 
this yet, will do so tomorrow.

Have a nice evening!
