Thanks.  All very strange.  I had just re-downloaded it again and got the April
version when I reported this.  The date stamp of tidy.exe even said Aug. 7.
Double-checked, and there was only tidy.exe in my path -- indeed, in my whole
system period.  Did again just now and it correctly reports the Aug. 4 date.
