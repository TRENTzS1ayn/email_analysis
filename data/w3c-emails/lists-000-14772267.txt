Bodo <uchc01@pop.uni-dortmund.de> reported a problem with TIdy
"losing" font information.
Alexander Biron <biron@ifh.de> explained why that happens.

But I wonder.  Putting <font>...</font> around block-level stuff
is an *extremely* common mistake.  I very frequently see it wrapped
around <table>, <p>, <center>, and other block level tags.

Perhaps it would be possible to make a special case of
<font...> <Block-Level-Tag...> ... </font> and automatically
convert it to <div ...><Block-Level-Tag...> ... </div> instead?

No, I haven't a clue how to do that.
