[Valuable advice snipped.[

So, that's my comment about your HTML code ;). But, I'd also like to briefly
talk about the FONT tag in general, and why I use it. I would really like to
use CSS in my pages, but it seems that Netscape and IE render font sizes
differently (arghh!). Is there some solution around this, so that the fonts
appear the same size on both Netscape and IE, while still using style
sheets?

There certainly isn't any solution using <font>.
The people over in our IT Services unit don't understand why I complain
about their use of absolute <font size=N>.  *They* can read the result.
But on my screen, it's microscopic.  CSS was supposed to fix this by
giving better, more portable, ways to specify font sizes.

Don't forget the people using Opera, ICab, and Amaya (which seems to
agree with Netscape most of the time on my SPARC/Solaris box).
