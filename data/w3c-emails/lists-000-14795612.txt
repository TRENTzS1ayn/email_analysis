I must have gotten something wrong, it happens only ONCE...

If a <BR> in the input is followed by (space OR tab) OR (newline AND (space 
OR tab OR newline)), Tidy inserts a newline AND space ("\n ") after the 
<BR> in the output.

If the <BR> in the input is followed by (nonwhitespace) OR (newline AND 
nonwhitespace), Tidy inserts a newline after <BR> but gets the indentation 
of the following line right.


I think this is pretty exactly describing the problem.
