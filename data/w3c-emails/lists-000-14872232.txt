You're right, of course. I actually think now that my first suggestion 
didn't make much sense.

Yes. All the options on blue background are performed by regular 
expressions on tidy's output. All the options on grey background are passed 
to Tidy. I find this a very convenient way to quickly fix certain issues, 
especially since my knowledge of C is way under what I would like it to be.

My favourite configuration for creating XHTML documents is this:
http://www.sl-chat.de/Tidy/?spaces-to-tabs=yes&fix-indent-auto=yes&indent-SYSTEM-id=yes&tidy-mark=no&wrap=0&literal-attributes=yes&indent=auto&indent-spaces=4&output-xhtml=yes&char-encoding=latin1&quote-marks=yes&clean=yes&logical-emphasis=yes&enclose-text=yes

Maybe the first chat site that validates as HTML
4.0 even though user input may contain HTML codes.
