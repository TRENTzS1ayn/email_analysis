1.current version tidy will move error placed form or table which in a table out of the table.but this will somtimes change the struction of the table serious.i think tidy can try best to keep the struction but the function InferredTag(..).
for example:
change  <table><form>..</form></table> ,to <table><tr><td><form>....</form></td></tr></table>,not
<form>...</form><table>..<table>.

2.xml validator look '<' in script as error.i wish tidy can put content between <script> and </script> in <!-- .. --> or <![CDATA[ ....]]>.

i implements this by print "<![CDATA[" after tidy print tag <script>,
but i don't think it's a good idea,because this will result in something
like:<script..> <![CDATA[  <![CDATA[ .....]]> ]]> </script>,after twice 
tidied.`
3.i wish tidy can decide char-encoding automatic by the attribute 'charset' in tag <meta>.

respectfully,
young.
