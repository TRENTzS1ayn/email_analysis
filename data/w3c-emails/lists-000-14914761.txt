Dave,

I propose the following modification to ReadChar (in tidy.c)
so that '\r' alone is mapped to '\n':

int ReadChar(StreamIn *in)
{
    ...
    for (;;)
    {
        c = ReadCharFromStream(in);

        if (c < 0)
            return EndOfStream;

        if (c == '\n')
        {
            in->curcol = 1;
            in->curline++;
            break;
        }

        /* PROPOSED CHANGE */
        if (c == '\r')
        {
            c = ReadCharFromStream(in);
            if (c != '\n')
            {
                UngetChar(c, in);
                c = '\n';
            }
            in->curcol = 1;
            in->curline++;
            break;
        }
        /* END PROPOSED CHANGE */

        if (c == '\t')
        {
            in->tabs = tabsize - ((in->curcol - 1) % tabsize) - 1;
            in->curcol++;
            c = ' ';
            break;
        }
    ...
}

My testing indicates that this handles isolated '\r' as
a lineend, and also handles "\r\n".  There is no change
to isolated '\n' as a lineend.

I will make the corresponding change to Java tidy if
no one has any objections.

Regards,

Andy Quick
