Although it took me a moment to realize what HTML you were talking about, I
did try the Mac OS 04 Aug 00 version of Tidy, I didn't specify any options,
and I didn't have a problem. However the Mac OS 04 Aug 00 version (which I
haven't released yet) has a number of fixes that your version may not have
- specifically there are a number of fixes for the common problem of
dereferencing a NULL attribute value causing a crash/segmentation fault on
many platforms. I haven't yet made available the latest version of the web
page I maintain for Tidy bug/fixes.

I do that for the Mac platform (changing the hard-coded strings) - I'm not
sure Dave could do it in a portable cross-platform way.
