Hi all,
I'm using COM TIDY to load a HTML file which
is then treated as XML and as such goes through a 
XML parser - MSXML3.

My problem is that the DOCTYPE causes an error to occur
in the loadXML method in COM TIDY. The DOCTYPE contained
within the HTML is:

<!doctype html public "-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en">

is there anyway I can omit this DOCTYPE which will give me no error in the
loadXML method. I've tried the following:

TidyObj.Options.DocType="omit"
and
TidyObj.Options.OutputXML=true

but they don't seem to make a difference !!!

Any suggestions ?
Ciaran.
