Take the LAST, as that is what a browser would do, I think.
Not sure though.
Yet, I believe it would make sense: if you set a variable to a certain 
value, and lateron assign another value to the variablem, the variable is 
always gonna contain the LAST assigned value, and not the FIRST assigned value.

It would also make sense, to include DTD conformity into this approach and 
drop (or convert to stylesheets where possible) all nonstandard attributes.

This may be turned off by a configuration option, but should be turned on 
by default.
