Hello Dave!

First a BIG BIG 'thank you' for making available such a great little tool,
finally giving me the possibility to write *clean* HTML code with no
proprietary stuff.

Anyway, I've encountered a bug in current version:

Just 'TIDY'  my small html file I enclosed in my mail - this explains it

Best regards,
