As it turns out, this came up a few weeks ago.  Tidy is actually doing
the right thing.  The &'s must be escaped as &amp; according to the HTML
spec.  Check the thread in the mailing list archives at

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2000JulSep/thread.html

and search for "& in hrefs".

Hope this helps.
