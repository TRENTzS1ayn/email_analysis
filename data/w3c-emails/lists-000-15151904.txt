I just noticed -- if you're viewing this in Tidy's web-based mail
archive, these two href's appear to be the same.  Apparently the archive
software isn't as smart as Tidy because it doesn't seem to have properly
escaped the ampersands.  How funny!

The first href should contain:

   ?p1=1&p2=2&p3=3

and the second href should contain:

   ?p1=1&amp;p2=2&amp;p3=3

(Hopefully that will come through OK.)
