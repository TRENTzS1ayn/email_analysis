As it turns out, this was *not* what I meant.

I think it hasn't anything to do with my problem.

Mine is that a site URL inside the HTML
 <a href="http://www.bogus.com/script.asp?p1=1&p2=2&p3=3>

results in a warning message

line 1 column xx - Warning: unescaped or unknown entity "&p2"
line 2 column yy - Warning: unescaped or unknown entity "&p3"

The thing the thread far below is talking about is a different thing.
