So I plead for Tidy to NOT bug with the ampersands in hrefs anyway!
I also dare to state that [1] is the normal way you see these hrefs in HTML
documents, [2] is *very* seldom seen imho.

I'm pushy, I know, but I don't have the will to change all my hrefs in my
pages just because Tidy can't be taught to leave these href's alone.
So I will live with that.
Everyone did it this way ever since, why should I change this?

I'm willing to use   &_a_m_p_;   (note strange format because I want to
prevent it from being converted) if I want to use ampersands in *texts* -
that's normal behavior. But no one would ever convince me to change all
ampersands in my asp calls to the above. This would be too much work -
resulting in nothing but satisfaction that Tidy doesn't output warnings
anymore.
But I won't go so far for this 'satisfaction'.
