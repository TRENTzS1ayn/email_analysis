The reason why Tidy complains about unescaped ampersand signs in HREFs is 
simply because they are not "legal" HTML, according to the DTD.

Just type the example below into the textarea on 
http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/direct.html and press the "Validate 
it!" button.

You'll get a result like this:

>     Error: unknown entity p3

You should not change all your hrefs because of Tidy, you should change all 
your hrefs because they are invalid HTML.
The argument "everyone did it false ever since, why should I do it right 
now" is simply answered by "right is right and false is false".
