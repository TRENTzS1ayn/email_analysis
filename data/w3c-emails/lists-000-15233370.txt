Hi -

The message about using CSS for fonts reads:

  You are recommended to use CSS to specify the font and
  properties such as its size and color. This will reduce
  the size of HTML files and make them easier maintain
  compared with using <FONT> elements.

The last sentence should finish

  make them easier to maintain compared with using <FONT> elements.

Best Wishes -
