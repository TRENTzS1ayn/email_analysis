Your problem is, that you are writing sloppy HTML code. There are no entitys
'p2' and 'p3'. If you do not even whant 'p2' and 'p3' to be entitys, you have
to encode your ampersand as an entity:

<a href="http://www.bogus.com/script.asp?p1=1&amp;p2=2&amp;p3=3>

This is correct HTML and good browsers will convert '&amp;' back to '&' before
they request the referenced URL.

See

for a broader discussion and

to see, that you actually write sloppy HTML code.
