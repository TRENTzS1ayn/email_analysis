Mine is that a site URL inside the HTML

results in a warning message

line 1 column xx - Warning: unescaped or unknown entity "&p2"
line 2 column yy - Warning: unescaped or unknown entity "&p3"

And so it jolly well should.  There *are* entity references &p2 and
&p3 in that attribute value.  They *do* need escaping.  (There is also
a missing closing quotation mark.)  Legal HTML for this is

     <a href="http://www.bogus.com/script.asp?p1=1&amp;p2=2&amp;p3=3">

Attribute value literals allow entity references so that you can get
characters into them that are not otherwise easy to enter (like quotation
marks).  The price of that is that some of the characters you _can_
enter easily need escaping too.
