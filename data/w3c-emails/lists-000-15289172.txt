To:<html-tidy@w3.org>

In Perl5 [http://www.cpan.org/ports/],

$foo =~ s/<SCRIPT[^>]*>.*?<\/SCRIPT[^>]*>//gsi;
... would strip all script tags (including content),

$foo =~ s/(<SCRIPT[^>]*>).*?(<\/SCRIPT[^>]*>)/$1$2/gsi;
... should remove the content of all script tags but leave the tags untouched.


cheers,

sebastian
