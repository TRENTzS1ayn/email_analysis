I am having a problem in the Java version of Tidy (JTidy) where
user-added inline tags are not allowed to nest in some
(but not all) cases where
standard inline tags are. I wrote to the author of JTidy, Andy Quick,
and he replied that he is following the behaviour of Tidy
and that this behaviour also occurs in Tidy. 
He recommended that  I post the question to this list. 
So....
Can anybody comment on whether this is a feature or a bug to
be fixed? My description and his reply follow.
Thanks much
Carl Resnikoff

Subject: JTidy bug or feature?

Hi Andy. 
I've run into some unexpected behavior of JTidy that may be a bug,
or at least I need advice.
Several months ago, I added a tag "<lm:xcode>" to JTidy, using 

 p.put("new-inline-tags", "lm:xcode");
 tidy.setConfigurationFromProps(p);

Then I can do some later postprocessing on anything enclosed 
in at a <lm:xcode> <lm:xcode> block.
This works very well for almost anything I've thrown at it, (see attached
file) 
but when I try to do:

<strong><lm:xcode>Test-1</lm:xcode>Test-3</strong>

I get the following error:
line 13 column 1 - Warning: inserting implicit <strong>
line 16 column 1 - Warning: replacing unexpected </lm:xcode> by </strong>
line 20 column 1 - Warning: missing </lm:xcode> before </strong>

But if I use one of the standard inline tags like
<strong><i>Test-1</i>Test-3</strong>,
the inlines nest correctly.
That suggests that there are more than one kind of inline tag.
Can you clarify or suggest a workaround?
thanks, Carl

Carl,
 
It seems that the last 3 versions of C Tidy behave the
same way.  Java tidy is a port of C Tidy so it is not
surprising that Java tidy's output matches C tidy's.
 
I suggest you post this to the mailing list and see if
someone can answer it.
 
Andy
