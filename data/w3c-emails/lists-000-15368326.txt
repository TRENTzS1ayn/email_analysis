When I build the latest tidy release, I am seeing the following:

$ make
$ ./tidy -e < release-notes.html

Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) Parsing console input (stdin)

stdin: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
stdin: Document content looks like XHTML 1.0 Transitional
no warnings or errors were found

$


Can anyone tell me why the two lines labeled "stdin:" are being produced?
When I read this, it seems to me that tidy is reporting a discrepancy, even
though it explicitly states that no warnings or errors were found.
