oppsss... I just realized that I missed the exclamation marks.. sorry for 
that... here's the corrected code:

$to_be_tidied_data = "content of file to be tidied";
# replace all <!--#...--> blocks with a placeholder string
my @SSIStack;
my $SSIBlock;
my $i = 0;
while ($to_be_tidied_data =~ m/(<!--\#.*?-->)/gsi) {
   $SSIStack[$i] = defined($1) ? $1 : "";
   $to_be_tidied_data =~ s/<!--\#.*?-->/SSIStackPlaceHolder\[$i\]/si;
   $i++;
}


$tidied_data = &tidy($to_be_tidied_data);

# replace all placeholder strings with the corresponding <!--#...-->
for ($i=0; $i <= scalar @SSIStack; $i++) {
   $tidied_data =~ s/SSIStackPlaceHolder\[$i\]/$SSIStack[$i]/s;
}
