The proposed solution (see below) indeed fixes the problem for the code
<A HREF=mailto:"user@host"> blah </a> 
and produces the desired output.

However, it does not change tidy's behaviour for code like
<a href="test.html>link</a> <a href="test.html">link</a>
This still leads to a segmentation fault (on SunOS/Solaris or a null
pointer on other systems).
This seems to be a different bug, though it looks very similar. Maybe
someone can find a similar solution.
