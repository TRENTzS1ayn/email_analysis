I am a new comer to TIDY.  I am using it to clean up some very ugly HTML generated by a integrated development system from Merant.  The generated HTML has some non-standard syntax imbedded. i.e. _MF_TableConvert=1.  Is there anyway that I can have TIDY pass through this type of non-standard syntax with out generating errors?

TIA
