Additional note:

The HTML input I used to catch error #2 was the source of the Expedia.com
home page, which duplicates the following attribute in multiple cases
througout the document:

style="font-size:12px;line-height:130%"

The reason I mention this is that, in the event that the duplicate
attributes are style attributes and have different values, Tidy could merge
those definitions.  This is fairly low on my list of requests though.  I am
much more concerned with just getting well-formed XML output.

Even though I set -asxml, the output was not well-formed.  These are the two
errors I've come across:

1) < and & are not escaped in uncommented blocks of JavaScript
2) duplicate attributes are not removed

Regarding #2, in the event that the values are exactly the same (which was
the case in my work), Tidy should simply delete one of them.  If they are
different, one of the values should be thrown away.  Which?  All but the
first?  (I don't care.)

I'm trying to generate an XSLT stylesheet from HTML input by the user (after
being Tidied).  So far, it works beautifully, except for the two problems
mentioned above.
