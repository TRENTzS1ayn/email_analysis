To:html-tidy@w3.org

One of the requirements of our application is to accept end user's html.  In
a number of cases this html is poorly written/generated and I'd like to be
able to inform the user of such and prohibit acceptance until it's properly
written.

I'd like to use JTidy wrapped in a JSP tag to handle this but the api seams
a little confusing to me.  I can instantiate JTidy but none of the public
methods seem to be what I want.  Instead, I find myself ripping out code
from main or instantiating a StreamInImpl so I can use a the Lexer instance
and look for errors.  However this seems less than optimal.  What I really
want is a list of errors as objects such as would be written to stderr.  Am
I missing something entirely or is this not really how JTidy is designed?

thanks,

brian
