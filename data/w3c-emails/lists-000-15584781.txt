Dave,
I'm using tidy to clean up some web forms.  We use the Fast
Template classes for PHP (there is also one for perl) which use
some specially formated comment fields to know where to substitute
fields.  Would there be a way that you could have tidy force (leave)
comments which start in column 1 alone.  For example:
<!-- BEGIN DYNAMIC BLOCK: row -->
<tr><td>{SOMEFIELD}</td><td>{SOMEOTHERFIELD}</td></tr>
<!-- END DYNAMIC BLOCK: row -->

Need to be left alone, another example is emacs's html helper mode
time stamps:
<!-- hhmts start -->

<!-- hhmts end -->

Tidy will change this to:
  <!-- hhmts start -->
  Last modified: Tue Aug 29 10:51:01 MDT 2000<!-- hhmts end -->

Thanks,
