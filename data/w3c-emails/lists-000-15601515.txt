Those methods only give me the number of errors/warnings.  I would like to
be able to take the input from the user and coupled with the diagnostics
from JTidy, highlight the row of the offending error.  I suppose I could
write to the PrintWriter and then parse it, but JTidy already has this
information.  Is there anyway to get a list of objects containing all the
error row, col and msgs?

thanks,

brian

You can use Tidy.getParseErrors() or Tidy.getParseWarnings()
to get the error/warning count after a call to Tidy.parse().

You could also use Tidy.setErrout(p) to set the error output to
go to a PrintWriter p.
