Why not do it the long way around?
Let Tidy add the header and trailer lines you don't want,
but then strip them out?  For example, in UNIX, you could do

tidy -asxml InputFile | sed -e '1,/^<body>/d' -e '/^<\/body>/,$d' >OutputFile

(throw away lines from the beginning up to and including <body>,
 throw away lines from and including </body> to the end,
 copy the rest)

It worked when I tried it.
