It would be great if Tidy gave an option to write JavaScript and CSS to an 
external file, but this would involve QUITE SOME additional work...
Such a feature would not make much sense without the ability to parse (and 
tidy) entire directory trees (that is: to tidy an entire project at one 
run, putting JavaScript functions and CSS style rules into each one 
external file)...

Lots of work, but certainly worth consideration!

Maybe the first chat site that validates as HTML
