In the 26 June version of tidy, an unescaped ampersand appears to be being
replaced by &mp; rather than &amp;

Worse, &amp; appears to be being replaced by &mp;!

My source file had the phrase "AT&T Bell Laboratories"

   Tidy (vers 14th April 1999) produced the warning
   line 182 column 3 - Warning: unescaped & or unknown entity "&T"

   and corrected the file to read "AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories"

whereas

   Tidy (vers 26th June 1999) produced the same warning
   line 182 column 3 - Warning: unescaped & or unknown entity "&T"

   but corrected the file to "AT&mp;T Bell Laboratories"

If the corrected file from the 14 April version is then presented to the 26
June version the correct "AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories" is then changed to
"AT&mp;T Bell Laboratories" despite the fact that "no warnings or errors
were found" in the file.
