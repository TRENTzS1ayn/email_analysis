My fix avoids this problem, and produces the following output
for your example:

line 4 column 1 - Warning: <a> attribute with missing trailing
quote mark
...
<a href="test.html&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=">link</a>
...

It would be better to make a retroactive guess that the first >
in the attribute is the end of the tag, and to push back the
rest of the text. I will need to spend more time to understand
how to do that.
