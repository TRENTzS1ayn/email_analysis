One quick example, before I go home:

<html>
   <head>
     <title>frameset</title>
   </head>
   <frameset>
     <frame src="test.html">
   </frameset>
</html>

... but Tidy sets DOCTYPE "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN".

For more examples I'll have to do a litte resarch, that'll have to wait

Have a nice weekend!

Maybe the first chat site that validates as HTML
