The relevant section in the HTML specification (4.01) is at
<http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-cdata>:

| Although the STYLE and SCRIPT elements use CDATA for their data model, for
| these elements, CDATA must be handled differently by user agents. Markup and
| entities must be treated as raw text and passed to the application as is. The
| first occurrence of the character sequence "</" (end-tag open delimiter) is
| treated as terminating the end of the element's content. In valid documents,
| this would be the end tag for the element.

It is the sequence </ (which some programs will treat as the end of the
element, regardless of whether it's actually the right name or not) that
is the problem here -- not specifically an end tag apparently without
a matching start tag.

Tidy's behaviour is therefore correct for HTML4.01 documents. (Though I
expect XHTML is stricter, and requires CDATA element content to use &lt;/
instead.)
