I basically do the same trick, define a couple PHP variables, include a 
header file, then comes the page content, and then I include a footer file.

For the content cleaning, I added the option "body-only" to my online 
version of tidy [http://www.sl-chat.de/Tidy/?body-only=yes]... and then I 
let some lower charges copy and paste the text into tidy and from there 
into my template files... ;-)
