Sounds like we need a "tidy" for JavaScripts, but the bigger problem seems insuperable.

Thus ensuring that dynamic HTML is written by JavaScript
 in an XHTML consistent manner
is one thing, ensuring that the resulting HTML is itself  XHTML  compliant
is a far worse problem..

The use of  JavaScript seems to be increasing, but boy is it going to cause
problems in the future!

Does anyone know of any  tools that can even begin to look
at the above problems of handling  JavaScripts?  Likewise, are
there any tools for validating  the stylesheet components?
