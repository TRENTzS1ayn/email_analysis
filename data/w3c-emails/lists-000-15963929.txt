I'd be very interested in a "JavaScript Tidy" myself...

Regarding StyleSheets, there is the W3C CSS Validator 
[http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/] (especially useful is the text area 
version) and BradBury's TopStyle [http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/], a 
commercial StyleSheet editor that allows validation of your stylesheets 
against various style definitions and also does perform pretty-printing for 
you.

Does anybody know whether a comparable tool exists for JavaScript?

Maybe the first chat site that validates as HTML
4.0 even though user input may contain HTML codes.
