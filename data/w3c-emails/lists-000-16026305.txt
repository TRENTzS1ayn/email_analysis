Do you have an example?  Is this by any chance JavaScript embedded in
comments?  Except for JavaScript, Tidy has been changing illegal runs of
"--" into "==" just fine for us.

Note that JavaScript embedded in comments is an exception because of
JavaScript's -- operator.  Tidy can't break up the -- operator without
affecting the script.  If this is what's happening, you might check the
thread titled "xml parsing error for < character" for a possible
solution (go to
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2000JulSep/thread.html
and search for "< character").
