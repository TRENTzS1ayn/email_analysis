This is related to the JavaScript problem I mentioned in my previous
reply.  Tidy is interpreting the style element's content as just text,
not a tag to be tidied.  The "proper" XHTML output should escape the <
preceding the LINK, or wrap the content in a CDATA section.  The problem
is that, as you indicated in another message, many Tidy users want
Tidy's XHTML output to be directly renderable by today's browsers where
escaped <'s and XML CDATA sections aren't recognized.

One workaround is for Tidy to hide the CDATA section markup in comments.
This produces well-formed XML and that is also directly renderable by
existing browsers.  The gotcha is that every script and style language
has its own comment syntax, so Tidy can only recognize a limited set.
