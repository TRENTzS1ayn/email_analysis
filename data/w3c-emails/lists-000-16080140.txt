</style>

The input is valid, style data is CDATA. In XHTML it's PCDATA.

I think Tidy has to assume, that the input code is close to be perfect, so it
can do two things:

 * encode occurences of < and & into &lt; and &amp; or
 * wrap the style data into <![CDATA[]]>

Any other action (besides reporting an error) isn't appropriate in my opinion.
The input is valid HTML, so there aren't errors tidy has to correct. The thing
tidy does in your case is conversion between HTML and XHTML syntax rules, so
one of the above actions (the latter is recommended in XHTML/1.0) should take
place.

What you want and what you've meant with your code isn't the right thing to
do.
