Hi,
?
I've been having trouble getting the Doctype config file property to work.?
I have tried the following:
?
doctype:omit
?
which yields:
?
?
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN&quot;>
?
and the fpi option
?
doctype:"-//DFORCIER/DTD HTML .00001//EN"
?
which still yields the above doctype.
?
Anyone else try this feature in config files with any success?
?
