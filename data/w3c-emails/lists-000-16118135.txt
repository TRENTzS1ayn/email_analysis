How about ...

hide-scripts: none
hide-scripts: comment
hide-scripts: cdata
hide-scripts: comment,cdata

and

escape-script-entities: yes
escape-script-entities: no

(where "escape-script-entities: yes" means "turn < and & into &lt; and
&amp;).

This way it's entirely user-configurable and nobody gets *too* disgruntled
