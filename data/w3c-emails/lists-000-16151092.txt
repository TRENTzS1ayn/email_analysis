Dave,

I have just installed the BBedit plug-in 'BBTidy' ( HTML Tidy) by putting
the plug-in into my extensions folder. I get an error message when starting
up BBedit:

This operation could not be completed because an error occurred:  Uknown
Error: 19304.

I also get an error once I have used the plug-in and then hit the cancel
button to close the window: error: 17608

I am using BBedit 4.0.4

All the best,
Jim
