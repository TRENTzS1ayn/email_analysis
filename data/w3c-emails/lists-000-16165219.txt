You don't say what version of BBTidy you were using - the current version
is v1.0b7.

I have not seen this particular problem, nor has anyone else reported this
problem, EXCEPT, someone reported a similar problem with BBTidy v1.0b5 a
few months ago, and the one common thing is both reports are from the UK,
and so both users are likely to be using an "British" Mac OS - maybe the US
version of BBEdit doesn't get along with the "British" OS in some cases.

As per the release notes, I have only tested with certain versions of
BBEdit and BBEdit Lite - v4.0.4 is not a version I have tested with.

If you can provide me with more details of your hardware and software
configuration (an Apple System Profiler report would be fine), I will see
if Bare Bones Software can help out with this particular version of BBEdit.
Does the problem occur everytime you try to use BBTidy? Have you allocated
more memory to BBEdit, as per the BBTidy documentation?

Unfortunately I don't know how to solve your problem at this time, but with
your help I'm sure we can figure it out.

Thank you for your interest in BBTidy.
