Pretty layout problem

    <!-- comment goes here -->
    <!--#include file="footer.inc" -->
    <!-- another comment goes here -->

when TIDY'd (? sp.) looks like this

    <!-- comment goes here --><!--#include file="footer.inc" --><!-- another
comment goes here -->

Any way to retain the original layout? Perhaps a new-blocklevel-tag? Something
in the config file?

Also, when there's only ONE comment the pretty version has an extra blank line
after it (which thus detaches the comment from the following block - defeating
it's purpose), thus

    <!-- comment -->

    <p>Markup here</p>

instead of

    <!-- comment -->
    <p>Markup here</p>

Any way to fix this?
