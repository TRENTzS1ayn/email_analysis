Or, even more accurately: 

http://www.altavista.com/cgi-
bin/query?q=%22islet+transplant%22&amp;kl=XX&amp;pg=q&amp;Translate=on

This contains all instances of "&" escaped to "&amp;", instead of just one.

cheers,

No, you created the error and Tidy reported it!

Instead of
   "http://www.altavista.com/cgi-
bin/query?q=%22islet+transplant%22&kl=XX&pg=q&Translate=on">
you should have   
   "http://www.altavista.com/cgi-
bin/query?q=%22islet+transplant%22&kl=XX&pg=q&amp;Translate=on">
