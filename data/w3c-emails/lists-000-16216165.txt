Maybe I miss something, but an include file normally contains HTML,
e.g. the content of a navigation bar. When you put this between <pre>
and </pre>, you can get into trouble with the document the server
finally transmits to the user.

In this case I would not change anything with the HTML source, but would
really like to see tidy change. Here we are only concerned with the
pretty printing function of tidy. I don't know of any instances, where
authors want their comments to be moved around (like being appended to
the end of the previous line. So I would like to see tidy change to
leave comments where they are. The only issue one might argue about is
indenting. BTW, for this purpose, include statements are just comments.
