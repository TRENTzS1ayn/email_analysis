I wrote, about HTML Tidy changing the line breaking around comments:

Alexander Biron replied:
Maybe I miss something, but an include file normally contains HTML,


Totally irrelevant.  The point remains:  the comment moving that
HTML Tidy did in the original example CHANGES THE CONTENT of the
document.

It seems as if HTML Tidy is assuming that comments are like tags,
where a #RE; following a start-tag is ignored.  But comments are
not like tags.  Whether on aesthetic grounds or on content grounds,
we are agreed that newlines after comments should not be removed.
