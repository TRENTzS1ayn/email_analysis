For XHTML, I am looking into ways to hide a CDATA marked section
in the script element, e.g.

<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[
 ... some javascript ...
//]]>
</script>

A similar approach is applicable to CSS. 

This solves the pressing problem of making the documents wellformed,
but leaves open the Turing-complete issue of document.write and
direct use of the DOM to generate markup programmatically. The HTML
working group wisely ducked the issue, leaving it up to authors to
deal with!

Of course the Web is increasingly about scripting rather than
static documents. XML Schema doesn't even begin to tackle the
problem of documents with dynamic constraints. However, this
is something that work on XForms is having to address!
