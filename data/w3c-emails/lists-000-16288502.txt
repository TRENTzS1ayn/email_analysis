The mechanism for pushing/popping inline elements and for
treating <a> interact in subtle ways. I hope that this time
things will work better in the next release.

  <a name="foo"><h3>my heading</h3>

should be mapped to:

  <h3><a name="foo">my heading</a></h3>

and

  <a href="bar">some text<a>

to

  <a href="bar">some text</a>

and

  <a href="bar">some text<a href="foo"> ...

to

  <a href="bar">some text</a><a href="foo"> ...
