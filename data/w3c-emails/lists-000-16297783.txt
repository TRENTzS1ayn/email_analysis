Tidy has moved the font information into a style on the i element
and replaced the middle font element with a span element. This
is as expected. If there was an enclosing <p>, then in principle,
tidy might have been able to move the font info to that since
you specified the same font size throughout. However, that would
involve more complexity than Tidy can deal with today.
