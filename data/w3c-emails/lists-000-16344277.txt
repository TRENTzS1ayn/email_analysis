Comments need to be indented in the pretty version, with no newlines removed
OR ADDED. In my original post I said that when there's only ONE comment the
pretty version inserts an extra blank line after it (which thus detaches the
comment from the following block - defeating it's purpose), thus

    <!-- comment describing purpose of following para-->

    <p>Markup here</p>

instead of

    <!-- comment describing purpose of following para -->
    <p>Markup here</p>

unless the blank line is added BEFORE the paragraph block which follows the
comment? In this case the prettying function needs to recognize that the
previous tag was a comment and NOT insert the extra blank line.
