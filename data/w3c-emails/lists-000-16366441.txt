I would like to see the same behaviour added for <INPUT TYPE="hidden">.
I usually write hidden INPUT fields right after the opening FORM tag, 
indented and one per line.
Tidy currently collapses the line breaks and indentation into a single 
space, which is not very "pretty"...

I'd like to add to this that, like with <BR>, Tidy adds a 
one-space-indentation after commments under certain circumstances, for 
example if between comment and next tag or word is a newline plus one or 
more whitespaces (typical for indentation). This appears to be quite 
clearly a bug in the pretty printing routine of Tidy, if someone on this 
list could tell me where and what to look for, I'd happily try to spot and 
fix it.
