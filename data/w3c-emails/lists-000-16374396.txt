Many of my co-workers insist on using Dreamweaver (arghh), an HTML editor
that is slightly less-bad than Frontpage. Anyhow, I find that it's biggest
fault is that it throws in extra <font> tags all over the place..

As I edit pages (by hand, of course), I often see opening and closing font
tags right next to each other. And, of course, there're often a handful of
</font> tags at the end of the document (</font></font></font>...). 

Anyhow, it'd be really cool if HTML Tidy could consolidate some of these
Font tags :). But, I realize that this could be a bit difficult, especially
since it's sometimes necessary to have extra <font> tags (each <td> needs a
new <Font> tag, for instance).

So, though I may not be able to help code the algorithm, I'd be willing to
help write some pseudo-code, if that would help. And, if anyone wanted to
join the "team", that'd make things easier as well. 

Any thoughts on this? And, yes, I realize that the <font> tag is
discouraged, but the two major browsers treat CSS too differently for that
to be a practical alternative ;).
