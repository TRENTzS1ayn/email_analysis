Dreamweaver 3 can use Allaire's HomeSite instead of the built-in HTML 
editor, and HomeSite provides support for HTML Tidy (you can replace the 
included tidy.exe with a newer version and you can create a custom tidy.cfg 
of your preferences)...

It should not be all that difficult to teach those of colleagues that like 
using Dreamweaver to keep a little bit of discipline and tidy up their 
documents through HomeSite...

Also, as far as I know, Dreamweaver provides a function (under Menu/Extras 
maybe) that combines redundant font tags and also pretty-prints the code...

So, ideally, the process of creating a pretty and valid HTML document with 
dreamweaver would be: make your layout, fill it with content, clean up with 
dreamweavers function in "Extras"(?), send it through tidy.

This should give optimal results (regarding the circumstances).
