Yeah, for everyone that's asked, they are actually running Dreamweaver 3
<g>. To demonstrate what I mean, though, imaging this example text:

What rolls down stairs
Alone or in pairs
Rolls over your neighbor's dog

They'd type that in and then want to have it be blue text. So, they
highlight and apply the color. Then, say, they want it to be size=2. So,
they highlight and apply the size. But, instead of giving out one <font>
tag, that generates two. Then, say, they want to make the last line orange
-- so, that part is highlighted and the color is applied.. But, as you can
see, by the end, there end up being several </font></font></font> tags at
the end of the text...

Also, since some of you are Dreamweaver users, I have another question. And,
this should be pretty easy to answer, as it just deals with configuration
(but I don't know the answer myself because I choose not touch Dreamweaver
with a 10 meter pole). Anyhow, what are the exact steps needed to change the
spaces-per-tab size? Unfortunately, it would seem that the Dreamweaver
default is about 2, so you end up with weird "wave" effects like this:

<table..>
  <tr> 
    <td>avsdkj sadkvf lkasmdv 
    <table>
      <tr>
         <td>blah blah</td>
         <td>blab blab</td>
      </tr>
    </table></td>
   </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <table>
      <tr>
         <td>blah blah</td>
         <td>blab blab</td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      </td>
    </tr>
</table>

And, I find that pretty difficult to read, but a larger tab size (6 or so)
would make that much easier. So, what I'd like to do is to just email my
co-workers saying "Please change your Dreamweaver tab size. Here are the
steps needed...".

And, yes, I could just use Tidy to reformat the tab size, but I'd like to
kill this problem at the source ;).
