Hi,

I'm having some trouble when using the Word2000 option via the TidyCOM
wrapper object, but Andr? Blavier says it has to do something with the Tidy
Code itself.

Could you tell me what the status of my problem is? Has it already been
reported, am  doing something wrong, are there workarounds, etc...?

Marc

Hi Marc,

I'm afraid I can't really help you with the problem you describe. TidyCOM is
just a wrapper around Dave Raggett's HTML Tidy and your problem comes from
the Tidy core. I suggest you submit it to the HTML Tidy mailing list.

Cheers.
