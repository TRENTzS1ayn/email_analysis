Maybe a new option in the config file can do so in a more general way.

Ignore-Tags: <@include>, <@whatever>, <something>

Tidy ignores those tags or, if there is a end tag, anything between that tag
and it's end-tag.

Oh, i've just seen the new-*-tags option. Couldn't this be used for the wished
effect?

But i do not prefer this possibility, i would use e.g. lynx -source to get the
parsed source from a Tango Server and then run tidy like:

LYNX -SOURCE http://tangoserver.com/file.html | tidy -config tidy.conf

The only problem with this technique is, that -m (for modifying the source)
wont work, but you can workaround that with a script that requests e.g.
http://server/file.html and puts the tidy output back to that file by
referencing locally, as /file.html.
In Dos Batch language this would look like:

for %a in (*.html) do call LYNX -SOURCE http://tangoserver.com/%a >%a
