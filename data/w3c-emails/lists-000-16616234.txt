I see... valid point.

Yet, Tidy's approach with nested tables produces incorrect HTML, <form> may 
not be contained within <form>:


     <table border=1>
       <tr>
         <td>
           <form>
             <table border=1>
               <tr>
                 <td>... form content ...</td>
               </tr>
               <tr>
                 <td>
                   <form>
                     <table border=1>
                       <tr>
                         <td>... form content ...</td>
                       </tr>
                     </table>
                   </form>
                 </td>
               </tr>
             </table>
           </form>
         </td>
       </tr>
     </table>

What do we do now?
I think it should be quite safe to move <form> around <table> if there is 
not more than ONE <form> within the <table>...
If there are multiple <form>s, I see two ways: either move the <form> into 
<td> or split the table into multiple tables (not nested), but this might 
cause problems with the rowspan attribute.

Any way out?
