Even worse:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <form><td>...form content...</td></form>
      <form><td>...form content...</td><td>...form content...</td></form>
    </tr>
  </table>

or:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <form><td>...form content...</td></form>
      <form><td>...form content...</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  ...form content...</form>

These can't be translated into standard HTML.  Unfortunately they work
in both IE and Netscape.  I think Tidy's policy for impossible-to-fix
cases like this is to treat them as fatal errors and refuse to output
anything.  So arguably Tidy could do a better job by discriminating more
cases than it currently does and reacting accordingly (move the <form>
outside the table, move the <form> inside the <td>, report a fatal error,
etc.).  Easier said than done, I know.
