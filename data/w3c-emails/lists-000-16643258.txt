Hello Glenn,

Well, the point is: it is not me who writes incorrect code - it's others. I 
use Tidy to automatically clean that up, in a realtime environment, thus 
manual editing of the input HTML is not possible.
So, personally I do not need Tidy for the pages that I produce, because I 
write incorrect code in the first place... but I do need Tidy to help me 
produce clean HTML pages with input from authors that know or care little 
about HTML standards.

Tidy's purpose is not to deduce whatever the author may have intended: as 
far as I understand, Tidy is designed to produce valid HTML which reflects 
best the interpretation of the (possibly invalid) input by common browsers.
In other words: what matters is not the author's intention but rather how 
the code is rendered in Netscape, MSIE, Opera & Co....

And believe me - it _is_ easier to teach a machine to correct the code than 
to teach those (hundreds of not caring) people about the standards. It's 
way beyond their head.
