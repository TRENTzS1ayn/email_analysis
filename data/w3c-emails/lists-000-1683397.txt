A lot of the authoring tools automatically generate, for example, <I> and <B> in
place of <em> and <strong> (MS FrontPage 98 generated the latter, but FP2000 has
reverted to the former -- with no option to change or set it).  It would be
handy if there were a "replace-elements" option to obviate the need for Perl,
XSL, or a text editor's search-and-replace function.  Something like:

replace-elements: i, em; b, strong


PS.  I suppose it would have to be attribute-aware, though.  Given an XML input
fragment of

<foo bar="5" />

and a config file containing

new-empty-tags: foo
replace-elements: foo, zot

the result fragment should come out as

<zot bar="5" />


Would this be difficult to implement?
