Hi folks. I understand that I'm not alone in my desire to use HTML Tidy in
a multi threaded environment. I hope to be able to make it fully
thread-safe and if anyone has started work on this or noted problems with
threading could you please contact me. Any help is much appreciated !

Thanks!

Martin
