An interesting idea, although I guess I would prefer a slightly
different syntax, e.g.

   replace-tags: i/em, b/strong

using "tags" rather than elements for consistency with other
property names and , for list item separators also for consistency
with other properties.

No. The only question would be how it interacts with the clean
operations. My preference would be to do this separately before
the clean operations are applied.
