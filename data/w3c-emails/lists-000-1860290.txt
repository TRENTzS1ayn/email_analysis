Tidy doesn't yet support DTD subsets:

   Support for XML

   XML processors compliant with W3C's XML 1.0 recommendation
   are very picky about which files they will accept. Tidy can
   help you to fix errors that cause your XML files to be
   rejected. Tidy doesn't yet recognize all XML features
   though, e.g. it doesn't yet understand CDATA sections or DTD
   subsets.

It seems like the time is ripe to add this. I will look into adding
support for CDATA marked sections as well as DTD subsets. Other
things to tackle include generalizing to Unicode tag names etc.
