Hi,

I often see, that Html Authors use Html comments to seperate sections in
their Html file using e.g.:

<!----------------->

or

<!-- ----------- -->

The second one detected by Tidy correctly with "malformed comment", but the
first one isn't. I'm not sure, how the first example should be treated;
NSGMLS reports the following:

<!----------------->
 ^  commment declaration started here

So this must be some illegal use et all.


To tidy up both i suggest to split those '-' lines up to legal comments,
like:

<!-- -- -- -- -- -->

or something alike.

regards,
 Bjoern Hoehrmann
