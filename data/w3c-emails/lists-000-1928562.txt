Yes, after "tidying" ("replace-tags" on ill-formed markup might be problematical
:) and before "cleaning".

The big question is ... would it be difficult to transform the attributes as
well?  Given:

<p id="foo">Hello world.</p>

and

replace-tags: p[id="foo"]/div[class="bar" style="color: red"]
/* using CSS-style attribute selectors
   (see http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html#q10 ) */

to create:

<div class="bar" style="color: red">Hello world.</div>
