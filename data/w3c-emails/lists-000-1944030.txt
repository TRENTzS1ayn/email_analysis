SGML rules are that "--" starts and ends a comment, inside a markup
declaration
"<!" and ">" .  So nsgmls will complain about <!-----> or <!-- -- -->
XML changed this so that comments start with "<!--" and end with "-->" to
allow more HTML documents to slip in.  So perhaps Dave could replace
the warning with some lesser one, e.g. "malformed comment (SGML syntax)".

I personally think that (and I know Charles Goldfarb who invented SGML
also thinks this) thinks that it is a good thing to have a continuum of more
strict syntaxes
    slack: HTML as implemented
    allows systematic slacknesses: SGML
    unforgiving: XML
So perhaps it would be good to parameterize the error messages with
an indication like this. For example, <p>a & b</p> is allowed in HTML
and SGML, but XML is more strict.

Tidy should follow the XML convention for parsing comments,  but I think
it should follow SGML convention for generating them: it might be
nice to have a user option to convert "-"+ sequences to "="+ sequences.
