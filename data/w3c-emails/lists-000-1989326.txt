What are the chances that any of these ideas about restructuring Tidy (for
use in a library) will be implemented anytime soon?  I'd rather not hack
into Tidy on my own until things are stable on the "Official Release" end of
things.  If there won't be many significant structural changes anytime soon,
I'll go ahead and start hacking away.  But if there will be, I've got
another project that I could bump up on the priority queue and work on for a
little while...

Thanks to Terry and Dave for their support.
