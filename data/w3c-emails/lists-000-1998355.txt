Hi,

after "clean" and "drop-font" it would be nice to have a further
feature, which would help a lot:
drop-msextension should clean HTML from the frontpage-stuff (<!--
mstheme -->, <!-- msbot --> hidden in comment-tags, which do nothing
than blow up the whole source.

I ask this for really practical reasons, because I have to spent quite
a lot of time with labouring this out manually. Is it difficult to
implement?

After all, I want to thank the developers of tidy. It really helps.


Mit freundlichen Gruessen
