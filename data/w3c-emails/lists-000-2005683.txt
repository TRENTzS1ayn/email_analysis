LOL. I hear you! ...

The only problem with that a number of other vendors use that same technique as
a form of tool "Processing Instruction". Instead of picking only on Microsoft,
how about something like:

drop-comment: mstheme, ...

Also, one should note that, while maybe guilty of bloating, these extensions do
no *harm* to HTML as such.  You can have completely valid HTML with MS's "bots"
sprinkled around, because they are perfectly legal comments.

If you want to see something that uses non-standard stuff that doesn't validate
as *anything*, take a look at the output from MS Word 2000.  Here is a sample:

Interesting (?) porridge composed of XHTML, XML, HTML, and CSS "extensions" ...
