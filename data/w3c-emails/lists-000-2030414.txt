I would love the option of taking all data in a td block and display it on
one line

Example

<td bgcolor="999999"><img src="../images/nothing.gif" width=1 height=1
border=0></td>

what Tidy does is

<td bgcolor="999999">
<img src="../images/nothing.gif" width=1 height=1 border=0>
</td>

Browsers interpret a CRLF as a space and your line you are attempting to
draw using a bgcolor
Ends up being one character high.

This makes tables with tons of formatting impossible.

Would it cost anything to get this feature added so I can use the plugin
with HTML-Kit?

Thanks for your time

Joe Feser
