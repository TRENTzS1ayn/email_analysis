How do I get Tidy to ignore my PHP code blocks

A PHP code block is defined as

<? Php code goes here ?>

Thanks in advance

Subject:doctype loop in tidy7jul99


There seems to be a problem with the doctype handling in the
July 7
release.  My limited testing shows that if 1) I specify
"doctype: strict"
(or loose or transitional, but not omit, auto or
"-//W3C//DTD HTML
4.0//EN") in a configuration file, and 2) the HTML document
to be tidied
begins with a <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML
4.0//EN"> line, Tidy
outputs the normal messages to STDERR but only an "endless"
repetition of
doctype declarations to STDOUT (I became suspicious when my
index.html file
contained 2,695,007 ? doctype declarations (137,445,376
byte) but no
HTML... ;-) ).

There is, of course, the possibility that I am doing
something wrong.
Having four months old twins, you never seem to get enough
sleep...

Also baffling (to me, at least):

When I tidy the following simple HTML:

<title>foo</title>

like this:

tidy -config tidy.cfg try.html >try2.html

and tidy.cfg contains:

clean: yes
doctype: strict
char-encoding: latin1

I get:

Tidy (vers 7th July 1999) Parsing "try.html"

"try.html" appears to be HTML 2.0
no warnings or errors were found

and try2.html looks like this:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN">
<html>
<head>
<title>foo</title>
</head>
</html>

and I tidy try2.html, like this:

tidy -config tidy.cfg try2.html

I get:

Tidy (vers 7th July 1999) Parsing "try2.html"
line 6 column 1 - Warning: discarding unexpected </html>

"try2.html" appears to be HTML 2.0
1 warnings/errors were found!

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN">
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN">
<l>
<l>
<l>foo</l>
</l>
</l>

The 'tags' seem to be dereferenced dangling pointers (the
string is
"l\1\3").  I am using the Win32 console .exe from the
archive on a Win98
system.  Recompiling with DJGPP for a DOS Protected mode
executable gives
the same results.
