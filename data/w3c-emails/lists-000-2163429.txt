Ah, I see the problem. The issue is that in SGML processing
instructions end with the first '>' character. XML 1.0
altered this to require processing instructions to end with ?>

I could modify Tidy to require ?> as the terminator of all
processing instructions, but this would break its ability
to parse legal html. I guess a reasonable approach would
to make this a new configuration option that is automatically
set if the input is in XML. This would be easy to do for the
next release.

The patch is in the file lexer.c. The code to change is
just after the case statement

Old:

            case LEX_PROCINSTR:  /* seen <? so look for '>' */
                if (c != '>')
                    continue;

New:

            case LEX_PROCINSTR:  /* seen <? so look for '?>' */
                if (c != '?')
                    continue;

/* now look for '>' */

c = ReadChar(lexer->in);

                if (c == EndOfStream)
                {
                    ReportWarning(lexer, null, null,
UNEXPECTED_END_OF_FILE);
                    UngetChar(c, lexer->in);
                    continue;
                }

                AddCharToLexer(lexer, c);

                if (c != '>')
    continue;
