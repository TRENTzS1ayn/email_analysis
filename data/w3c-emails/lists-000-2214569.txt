The HTML document below has an <a> element whose href attribute has been
split across two lines (the URL in the original document was unusually long
and had evidently wrapped to the next line).  7-Jul-99 Tidy converts the
line break into an unencoded space, resulting in a broken link.  Both IE 5
and Netscape 4.5 (tested on Windows NT) ignore the line break but not the
space.  A secondary problem is that spaces should be encoded as %20 in URLs.
I can see how fixing this problem may be difficult since Tidy might have to
distinguish between attributes that are URLs and those that are not.

-------- Example HTML document --------
<html>
  <head>
    <title>x</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <a href="http://www.x.com/ind
ex.html">Wrapped URL</a>
  </body>
</html>
