TIDY (ver. 7 July) reported the following odd warnings:

line 59056 column 8 - Warning: inserting implicit <T?u>
line 59057 column 1 - Warning: trimming empty <T?u>

This "<T?u>" string was nowhere to be found in the input file. Here are
lines 59056 - 59057:
</font>
</ul>

And since TIDY also immediately trimmed these phantom tags the output file
was clean too, so not strictly a problem but worth investigating
nonetheless?
