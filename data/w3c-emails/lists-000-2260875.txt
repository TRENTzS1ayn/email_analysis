Hello Dave Raggett,

I have two problems with Tidy that I would like your advice on:

(1)This is the piece of JavaScript embedded in an html script file:

<script type="text/javascript" language="JAVASCRIPT">
<!-- Hide script
document.write("<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>*** Today is "+dayName[now.getDay()]+", "+monName[now.getMonth()]+" "+now.getDate()+"***</H4>");
//End hiding -->
</script>

This is the error mesage that Tidy gives for the line begining "document.write"
(which is written as one long line):

line 62 column 124 - Warning: '<' + '/' + letter not allowed here

The error message is refering to the end of the line containing the </H4>
text.

Can you explain whether the Javascript code is wrong or is Tidy wrong? My
Javascript debugger has no problem with this line.

(2) Tidy gives me this message:

Warning: <meta> unrecognized attribute value "http-equiv"

My HTML 4.0 documentation indicates that the attribute value is valid. Can
you explain this error message?

Thanks

Rudy Kohut
