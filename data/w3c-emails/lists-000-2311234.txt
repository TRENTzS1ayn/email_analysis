Maybe I'm not understanding something, but I came across something that
doesn't look right in the code.

The option -asxml is supposed to make tidy output XML, but it seems like it
is outputting XHTML instead.  Change line 713 from "xHTML = yes;" to "XmlOut
= yes;" to fix the problem.

Another idea I had (since I need both XHTML and XML capability) is to add a
command line option for xHTML, adding

            else if (strcmp(arg, "asxhtml") == 0)
                xHTML = yes;

right below line 713.

Thanks!
