Hi,
I would suggest, that tidy puts the headings (H1 to H6) in the right order.

I can often see, that the Hx elements are misused for some typographical
effects and therefore some heading levels are skipped (e.g. H2 -> H4).

[1] says that "Content developers should not "skip" levels", and in [2] it's
called 'bad practice', so i think it's useful if tidy reconstructs this
locical order by making the first Hx to a H1 element and puts the following up
to this level, so that no levels are skipped.

An Example:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<HTML>
<TITLE>Heading 'bad practice'</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H2>heading2</H2>
<P>text</P>
<H4>heading4</H4>
<P>more text</P>
<H3>heading3</h3>
<p>even more text</p>
<h2>heading2</h2>
<p>surprisingly some text</p>
</BODY>
</HTML>

Should be tidied to:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<HTML>
<TITLE>Heading 'bad practice'</TITLE>
<BODY>
<H1>heading2</H1>
<P>text</P>

<H2>heading4</H2>
<P>more text</P>

<H2>heading3</h2>
<p>even more text</p>

<h1>heading2</h1>
<p>surprisingly some text</p>
</BODY>
</HTML>

At least some warnings should be reportet if heading levels are skipped.

 Bj?rn H?hrmann
