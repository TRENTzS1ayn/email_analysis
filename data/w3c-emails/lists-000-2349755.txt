I posted a new release yesterday, just before I leave for
the family vacation. I won't be able to answer email until
after I return on August 15th (a European style holiday!).

The new release is smarter about malformed lists and
also supports a new feature for wrapping naked text
found at the body level into paragraphs. This is really
helpful in getting style sheet margins to work!

In this release, I am also trying to solicit some feedback
as to where people using Tidy are located and to see if I
can start a collection of souvenirs.

p.s. I have just received a copy of Office 2000 and will
be tackling the challenge of smarter filters when I get back.
