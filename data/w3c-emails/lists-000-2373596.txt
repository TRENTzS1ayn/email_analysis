Internet Explorer 5.0 is supposed to be a parsing and validating XML
browser.  I've been having a bit of a problem taking the XML/XHTML output
from Tidy and getting IE 5.0 to accept it.  It complains about errors in the
Transitional DTD (downloaded from W3C).  Has anyone else had any problems
with Tidy's XML/XHTML output in IE 5.0?
