I can confirm on another platform (Mac OS) that there is a bug here (still
in the 26th July 99 version). In my case, it appears that infinite
recursion is probably occurring, and would have likely crashed had I not
stopped it. I was getting the following error output on the above test case
:

Tidy (vers 26th July 1999) Parsing "<b> inside <li>.html"
line 8 column 7 - Warning: missing <li>
line 8 column 10 - Warning: missing </b> before <li>
line 8 column 10 - Warning: trimming empty <b>
line 8 column 10 - Warning: trimming empty <li>
line 8 column 14 - Warning: inserting implicit <b>
line 8 column 25 - Warning: discarding unexpected </b>
line 8 column 25 - Warning: discarding unexpected </b>
line 8 column 25 - Warning: discarding unexpected </b>
... ad infinitum ...

I haven't done any debugging on it yet.

Regards, Terry
