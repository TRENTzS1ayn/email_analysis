Just as a FYI, it is not crashing on the Mac OS version.

Here is the error output I am getting from the test case above (using the
26th July 99 sources ) :

Tidy (vers 26th July 1999) Parsing "comment in <tbody>.html"
line 9 column 3 - Warning: discarding unexpected

"comment in <tbody>.html" appears to be HTML 4.0
1 warnings/errors were found!

Here is the cleaned output :

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN">
<html>
<head>
<title>Comment in `tbody' before a `tr' causes Segmentation
Fault</title>
</head>
<body>
<table summary="example">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>xxx</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</body>
</html>
