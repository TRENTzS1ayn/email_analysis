Using HTML Kit 2.60 and Tidy that ships with it.

If a form has a action that is blank ie 

<form action= method=post> only with no ""

<form action="" method=post> does not cause a problem

I get the following error

Access violation at address 0208151D in module htmltidy.dll. Read of address
00000000

I have also sent this message to Chami.

If someone else could please verify this is not an operator error on my part

thanks

Joe Feser
