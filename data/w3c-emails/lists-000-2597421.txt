Because you can't have <FRAMESET> inside <BODY>.

Interesting though that it did supply the DTD for HTML 4.0 Frameset 
(so it recognized it as a frameset document) yet eliminated FRAMESET 
(which is legal for such a document) and not BODY (which is illegal 
for such a document).  If there is a BODY tag, it must be enclosed 
with NOFRAMES, which in turn is enclosed in a FRAMESET tag 
(preferably the outermost).

What options were you running under?  If you were running it under 
clean, remember that under strict HTML 4.0 there are no such things 
as frames.
