Hello,

HTML Tidy is a fabulous tool. However, I am experiencing strange behaviour
(the English spelling, just for you Dave!) in a very specific circumstance.

<FRAMESET rows="*">
  <FRAME
SRC="test.asp?a=<%=a%>&b=<%=b%>&c=<%=c%>&d=<%=d%>&e=<%=e%>&f=<%=f%>">
</FRAMESET>

For some reason, I am getting the following "cannot process" error on this
code snippet..

"Missing quotemark for attribute value"

If I delete a SINGLE parameter from this list, the error is removed and
everything works, like so:

<FRAME SRC="test.asp?a=<%=a%>&b=<%=b%>&c=<%=c%>&d=<%=d%>&e=<%=e%>">

It appears to be 100% related to the size of the SRC string! How bizarre!

Any light anyone can shed on this would be greatly appreciated, because our
code currently has dozens of very long HTML strings in precisely this
format..
