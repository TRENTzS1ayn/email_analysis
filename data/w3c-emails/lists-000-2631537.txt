This is an oversight on my behalf. The fix is to add the following
into ParseRowGroup in parser.c at line 1481 just before the code for
discarding unknown tags:

        /* deal with comments */
        if (node->type == CommentTag ||
            node->type == ProcInsTag ||
            node->type == AspTag)
        {
            InsertNode(rowgroup, node);
            continue;
        }
