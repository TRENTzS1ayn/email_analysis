Dear Dave,

Thanks for all your responses to the bugs in Tidy 26 Jul 99 that were
reported in your absence.

Welcome back.

Ironically, I just happened to release earlier today, an updated version of
"MacTidy", and specially created a "Known bugs in Tidy on all platforms"
web page, where I recorded many of the bug reports submitted (without
attribution I'm sorry).

This page can be reached at :

I may wait for your next release to incorporate your fixes.

Regards, Terry
