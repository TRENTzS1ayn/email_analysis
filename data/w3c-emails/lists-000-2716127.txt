I prefer test cases, but that's just me - you guys know HTML better than I

Is this the same bug as Randi Waki reported in "7-Jul-99 bug: <tr> without

Well you have apparently found a bug (I reproduced it here) - the question
is it Mac OS specific? I don't modify the guts of Dave's code, so the only
thing I can think of platform specific line termination library code
causing a problem.

Would like to see what happens on other platforms.

Sounds like a bug - I was not aware of that behaviour (I'm using StdIO and
SIOUX). I should be able to fix that.

Thanks for the report.
