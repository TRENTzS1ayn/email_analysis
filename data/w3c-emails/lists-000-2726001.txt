Related, but different.  There, the non-TD TR content is said to be 
deleted instead of being moved to before the table, and then either 
way you end up with an empty TR which is then deleted.

The bug I'm reporting is a more fundamental problem with removing 
empty TRs due to their effect on preceding rowspanning cells and not 
the problem of non-TD content within them.  What I am saying is that 
empty TRs shouldn't be deleted; they should instead have an empty TD 
inserted within them.  The paragraph in that example should still be 
moved to before the table.

I'll be able to test that under FreeBSD later today, unless someone 
else beats me to it.  I'll also test the above cited bug under my 
patch.
