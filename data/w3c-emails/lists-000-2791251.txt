Ah, you want an HTML UnTIDY :-D

But seriously, I use TIDY to validate my HTML while developing and then run
it through another program, HTML Compressor I think its called (I'm not at
my regular computer so I can't tell you) when the page is complete.

Greetings.  I'm new to the list, but have really enjoyed 
using html-tidy for about 7 months now.  Thanks for the 
great product!

Will Tidy ever have a minimalist mode?

I'd like to save some network bandwidth.

What I have been doing is setting wrap length to 999  & 
turning indentation off.

This doesn't remove things like 
1. extra vertical whitespace
2. syntactically unnecessary newlines
3. trailing whitespace from a line

I'm always trying to trim a few bytes here and there.

Any thoughts anyone?
