Some one was looking for code to compress a page after using
tidy.  You might find such a thing at
http://www.winfiles.com.

Also I came across:

I have uploaded to Simtel.Net:

ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/win95/html/hcr.zip 27315 bytes

hcr.zip         Reduce HTML file by removing comments. w/C src

This program removes comments from HTML files making them smaller and
faster.  Many HTML editors, to prevent formatting, add lots of unneeded
comments in HTML files which are not necessary after completion of a
project and for viewing HTML files in browser.  This program removes
those comments without disturbing any of the formatting of the document.
This program is specially optimized for Microsoft Frontpage.

Special requirements: None.

Freeware.  Uploaded by the author.
