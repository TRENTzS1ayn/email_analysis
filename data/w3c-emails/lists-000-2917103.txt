I have now confirmed this bug occurs also on other platforms (specifically
in my case, I ran the 26 Jul 99 version of "tidy.exe" under Windows95 with
VirtualPC v2.1.3 on my Mac).

I was to reproduce (only happens with Navigation Services), and fix.

I have incorporated this fix and Dave's 15th Aug fixes into MacTidy v1.0b3,
which I hope to release shortly. I have not incorporated your fixes
(wstrcasecmp, etc) yet.
