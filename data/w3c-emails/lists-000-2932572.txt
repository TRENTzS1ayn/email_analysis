Hi,

I'm very concerned in accessible webdesign and therfore i'm trying to enhance
pages for use with text mode browser like Lynx [1].

Lynx does not create an empty line before <PRE> and therefore i got used to
use <P><PRE>... to ensure this empty line.

HTML Tidy now cuts all those important P tags off and i have to insert them
again.

Would be /nice/ if tidy lets them were they are, maybe with an option not to
trimm an empty P.

regards,
  Bj?rn H?hrmann
