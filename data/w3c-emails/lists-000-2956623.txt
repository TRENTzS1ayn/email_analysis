I'm a bit confused.

Here's my test file:
$ cat t.html
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Test spacing</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
This is test output
<p>
<pre>
is there any space?
</pre>

This is test 2
<br>
<pre>
is there any space>
</pre>
</body>
</html>
$ lynx t.html
                                                                   Test spacing

   This is test output
   
is there any space?

   This is test 2
is there any space>
$

It looks to me like lynx puts in a space for <p>.

Of course, I'm using Lynx version 2.8.3dev.6 .  What version are you using?
