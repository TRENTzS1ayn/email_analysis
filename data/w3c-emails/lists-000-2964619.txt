To:<html-tidy@w3.org>

| <BODY>
| This is test output
| <p>
| <pre>
| is there any space?
| </pre>

renders correctly but tidy would removes the empty P here that causes the
empty line *and* this example is illegal HTML4.0 Strict.

BTW: Tidy should correct this and put those Body text into a P or DIV.

| <BODY>
| This is test output
| <br>
| <pre>
| is there any space>
                    ^
| </pre>
| </body>
| </html>

renders without an empty line.

So i think there are no version diffs.

| Of course, I'm using Lynx version 2.8.3dev.6 .  What version are you using?

2.8.2rel.1 (01 Jun 1999) win32 binarys

(same with 2.8.1)

Test case:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN">
<html>
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
<body>
<p>normal text</p>
<pre>this is pre text</pre>
</body>
</html>

Lynx renders:
   normal text
this is pre text


Same case but with line
<p><pre>this is pre text</pre>

Lynx renders:
   normal text

this is pre text


BR Test case:
<br><pre>this is pre text</pre>

Lynx renders:
   normal text
this is pre text


Any other construction won't work, since GUI Browser would render it different
then.
