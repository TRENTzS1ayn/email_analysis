I am not sure that this is a TIDY problem, but it sure causes me one. When
the pretty file is created it inserts line breaks in perfectly legal places,
but they are not always invisible. For example

<a href="...">
<img src="..."></a>

As readers will be fully aware, this creates a little underline before the
image where the whitespace is part of the link.

Is there any way for TIDY to recognise these situations and not insert the
line break?



Cheers,

Rick Parsons
