Using the July/26 version of Tidy when I have things like
"&trade;" [Trade Mark symbol] in my source Tidy changes it
to "&amp;trade;", or if there is a "&" in a search URL it
changes it to "&amp;" making the URL useless.

Is there some different option I should pick?  I normally use
"-ium" as my options with no config file.
