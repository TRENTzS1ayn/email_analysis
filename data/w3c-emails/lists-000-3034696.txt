Hi,

  are there any plans on supporting the DOM interfaces for
representing parse trees in Tidy? I am using Andy Quick?s
JTidy in a university project to parse sloppy HTML into
a modifyable tree. Since XML parsers won?t accept these
documents, JTidy is a good solution for the problem.
  However, DOM is a standard object model and has
the advantage of being widely used and supported by
other packages.
  I believe turning JTidy into a full-fledged parser by supporting
(at least core) DOM would be a great feature to add!
