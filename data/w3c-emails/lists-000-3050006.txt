I'll check my URL's closer, seemed to be server that didn't
like it not the browser.

I'll switch my &trade's to &regs then.  'trade' is listed in
entities.c of the source code but I don't know what that
actually means at this point.

Hang on, I just and went put "&trade;&reg;" in a page.  In
IE4.01 it is rendered as I expected as a supper scripted
"TM".  In both netscape 4.61 and Opera 3.60 it came out as
"&trade;".  All three agreed that &reg; = "(R)".  So I guess
&reg; it is...

I would love to have that, just so I know what *is*
proper...
