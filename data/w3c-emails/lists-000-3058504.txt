Just to followup - this is NOT a bug. Tidy's pretty print splits up long
strings (e.g. "Demonstration of HTML Tidy's erroneous elimination of empty
rows.") across lines, using a "\". This appears to be valid HTML - i.e. if
you run the output described above through Tidy again, it finds no
problems; also I tested in Netscape, and it was happy.
