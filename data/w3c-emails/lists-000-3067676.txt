I am thinking of adding core DOM support to Java Tidy in the
near future.

I was wondering what the plans are for DOM support for the
official C Tidy.  Since C does not lend itself easily to object-oriented
programming, I was wondering if anyone is working on wrapping Tidy
as a COM object?  It would make a nice little project, and it could
include support for DOM interfaces.

Subject: DOM support?

Hi,
  are there any plans on supporting the DOM interfaces for
representing parse trees in Tidy? I am using Andy Quick?s
JTidy in a university project to parse sloppy HTML into
a modifyable tree. Since XML parsers won?t accept these
documents, JTidy is a good solution for the problem.
  However, DOM is a standard object model and has
the advantage of being widely used and supported byother packages.
  I believe turning JTidy into a full-fledged parser by supporting
(at least core) DOM would be a great feature to add!
