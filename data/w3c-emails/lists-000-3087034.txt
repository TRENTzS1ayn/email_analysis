Hi,

I'm following this list loosely so I am
not sure if
this possible bug has not been reported before:

First I can say it is ok with the release 
of the 15th of April.

When I am using an element <foo> I can turn
the error into a warning by configuring:

     new-inline-tags: foo

This works with the following HTML-file:

<html>
<head>
<title>Test</title>
</head>
<body>
TEST <foo>
</body>
</html>

Although the missing </foo> is warned.

With the new  release it does not work
neither with

     new-empty-tags: foo

nor with

     new-inline-tags: foo

It results in an error.

Please, can someone verify this or just tell
me that I did something wrong?

Thanks!

Roland

P.S.: Tidy is great :-))
