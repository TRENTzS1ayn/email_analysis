Hi everyone

This is my first Email to the group, & not sure what the response will be, I
first learn of the HTML tidy almost a week ago

I first program I checked on had 2500 lines , One mistake I did was use
<PRE> at the top and </PRE> at the bottom, I now know why it failed with
"Opera" while Netscape & MSIE worked OK, maybe I should get opera as a test
program, but HTML tidy might be just as good.

Anyway because of the 2500 lines I was not sure of counting down to line
number 1245 or up for that matter.
you can insert <dam it> near the middle and count from the "<dam it>" error,
or you could try a batch file I made
listed below.
You should know the first line, to find more on FIND go find /? (as you
might know) but this line will put line numbers all the way down the thee
left of your program, then going between "err.TXT" , "list_err.TXT" &
"my_file.HTM life should be easier,

and if you do not wish to use the second line put a "REM" in as I have done,
take it off otherwise
+++++++++++++ check it.bat++++++++++++++++++
tidy.EXE -f errs.TXT my_file.HTM
REM find /v /n "" my_file.HTM > list_err.TXT
==========================================
Just two last things I believe there is "Java tidy" is there "Javascript
tidy"
And can you compile Java " *.CSS " files with MSIE 5 Frontpage or Netscape
composer
