Tidy is far from the only useful program that identifies things by line
number, so I recommend you acquire an editor that can jump directly to a
particular line number, and my personal recommendation is GNU emacs, but
any editor with this capacity would do.  Why go through life adding four
unneeded steps and an unnecessary file to every editing cycle?
