If I have a web page on which I wish to display source code, I thought
that all I needed to do was include the code thusly:


<html>
<head>
<title>test code</title>
</head>
<body>
<code>
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
fprintf(stdout, "Hello, world (%s)\n", argv[1]);
return 0;
}
</code>
</body>
</html>


However, tidy complains about the above by saying:


Tidy (vers 26th July 1999) Parsing "stdin"
line 7 column 11 - Error: <stdio.h> is not recognized!
line 7 column 11 - Warning: discarding unexpected <stdio.h>

"stdin" appears to be HTML 2.0
2 warnings/errors were found!

This document has errors that must be fixed before
using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version.

HTML & CSS specifications are available from http://www.w3.org/

Is there a different HTML tag I must use so that I can include arbitrary
source code without modifications?
