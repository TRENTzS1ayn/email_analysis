I would like to ask if anyone on this list has hacked tidy or
generated a patch in order to use tidy with PHP3 files.

Some previous attempts such as:

http://techst02.technion.ac.il/~sbaruch/tidy_baruch.zip

still mangle HTML code within the PHP tags.

For those unaware of PHP3, you may visit: http://www.php.net/
PHP is fastest-growing server-side scripting language used on the
web, currently in 500,000 web sites according to Netcraft.

Tidy is so useful for pure HTML files that I wish to use it with
PHP3 files also.
