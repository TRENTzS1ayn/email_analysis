I've been using TIDY (as a plug-in for HTML Kit
http://www.chami.com/html-kit/ ) to tidy up my PHP3 scripts for some time
now.  I've found that you get less managing if you use a 

<script language="php">
</script>

tag for php elements that span more than one line

<? ?> can be used OK for simple element substitutions.

You're right though, it's still not perfect :-(

TIDY incorrectly mangles the following:

<A href="<? echo myUrl ?>Click Me</A>

to

<A href="&lt;? echo myUrl ?&gt;Click Me</A>

which breaks the PHP.


I also find it particularly annoying that TIDY re-indents <? ?> tags each
time you tidy a document, but leaves <script></script> blocks alone.

Subject:TIDY for PHP3

I would like to ask if anyone on this list has hacked tidy
or
generated a patch in order to use tidy with PHP3 files.

Some previous attempts such as:


http://techst02.technion.ac.il/~sbaruch/tidy_baruch.zip

still mangle HTML code within the PHP tags.

For those unaware of PHP3, you may visit:
http://www.php.net/
PHP is fastest-growing server-side scripting language used
on the
web, currently in 500,000 web sites according to Netcraft.

Tidy is so useful for pure HTML files that I wish to use it
with
PHP3 files also.
