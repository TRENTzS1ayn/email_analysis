It is exactly those situations that you point out that
are breaking the code, as much of the dynamic page generation
does not allow the luxury of using the
<SCRIPT></SCRIPT> tags as the small elements of dynamic changes
are "embedded" in the HTML, that is, not multi-line.

Ideally, in the parser, when tidy encounters an opening
<?php tag, EVERYTHING is just saved on a node and printed
out verbatim until the closing ?> tag.  I would not want
tidy to decide upon how to format the server-side scripting
code.
