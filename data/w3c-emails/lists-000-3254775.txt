Hi  everyone
when I first got HTML tidy someone told me about Emac
I hope is working OK for you because I have nothing but problem, I must of
downloaded 4 hours all total and I still don't have Emac to view, last night
I download something then found some folders missing Email someone who told
that was a very old version I had and should for version 20 or so.

The  fact someone sent me a fast E mail reply is the best I can think of
about the great Emac.

From Eric
