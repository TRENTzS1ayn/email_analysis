I tried the example given on the PHP site:

       <html><head><title>PHP Test</title></head>
       <body>
       <?php echo "Hello World<P>"; ?>
       </body></html>

It worked fine, so perhaps it's just a matter of using a recent
version of Tidy? On the other hand, perhaps Tidy still fails for
more complex examples of PHP3. One thing to note is that Tidy works
by building a clean parse tree and then pretty printing it out. This
means that if you PHP3 code generates HTML markup for the start tag
for some element, you should also include PHP3 code for the end tag,
as otherwise Tidy will be surprised by an unexpected end tag and
will delete it, most likely causing your page to fail. Tidy is only
software after all and not a mind reader.
