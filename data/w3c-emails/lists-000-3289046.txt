I am getting a problem with long strings in title="..." and summary="..."
being split over multiple lines and indented. The problem does not seem to
affect content="..." in META elements so does not seem to be the general
treatment of attribute values, just some of them. The title= value, in
particular, is visible in browsers. Is this a bug, feature or avoidable with
selected switches? Examples available if required.

Cheers,

Rick Parsons
