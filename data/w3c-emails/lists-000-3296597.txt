If a start tag contains an unterminated ASP construct, 26-Jul-99 Tidy enters
an infinite loop and eventually runs out of memory.  For example:

  <html <%

where the end of file occurs right after the ending %.  A variation which
exercises a slightly different path through the code is:

  <html <% %

In both cases, the problem is in lexer.c, ParseAsp(), which fails to check
for EndOfStream after reading characters.

Thanks,
Randy
