This is tricky since <? ?> is the syntax used for processing
instructions, and it is unlikely to be the correct thing to
format all processing instructions in the way you want.

Perhaps Tidy could look at the name immediately following the <?
to determine what rendering to apply?

Tidy is wrapped into a DLL for use in HTML Kit. I don't maintain
HTML Kit myself, so you need to contact "Chami" for further
information.

It would certainly be helpful to have a simply way for Tidy to know
which processing instructions should be formatted specially.
