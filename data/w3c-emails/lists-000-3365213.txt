To: HTML Tidy Mailing List<html-tidy@w3.org>


I've gotten HTML Tidy to pop up in the big black box but I don't see any
indication anywhere, either in the program, the w3 faq, the archives,
or on the net about what to do next. Can someone please point me the
direction of some instuctions on how to get HTML Tidy to tidy up my HTML
.

Thank You,
Red
