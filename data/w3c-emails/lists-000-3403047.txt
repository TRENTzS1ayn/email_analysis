I'd be happy to volunteer to do the ColdFusion one for obvious reasons <g>,
as soon as the fix comes out for custom tags (broken in the July 26
release...)

Subject: Contrib library of tidy config files tags?


I was wondering if it might make sense for people to submit config file
tags that people write for various add on HTMLish enhancements (ColdFusion,
Tango, PHP, etc.) which then could be downloaded from the tidy web site
or perhaps even bundled with the software.  That way if someone wanted to
say write a set of config tags so that tidy could be used to clean up
a netscape bookmark file, or ColdFusion pages, etc. they could just point
to the appropriate config file...
