Tried to run HTML-Tidy with the clean (-c) option on the attached page (test.htm), which was saved from Word 97 as an HTML document.  Also attached is the first part of the TidyOut.log file generated (enough to show the problem).  It's obvious that Tidy got stuck in a loop somewhere on line 17 of the input HTML file.  When I originally ran Tidy (from HomeSite 4.5) it eventually locked up my machine after the TidyOut.log file grew to over 500MB.

I think Tidy is great, and was looking forward to using it to clean up Word's poor excuse for HTML rather than doing it by hand.  This test, however, gives me pause.  I don't know whether this problem has been reported previously (I didn't see it in a brief perusal of the Release Notes), but I hope it can be fixed or worked around.

Thanks for listening.
