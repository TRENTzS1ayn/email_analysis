I assume you are using Windows.

You have to open a DOS window first.  Go to the Start menu, choose Programs,
then choose "DOS Prompt" or "Command Prompt" or something like that.  Then
you can type.

However, if you're totally unfamiliar with the DOS prompt, you may encounter
additional obstacles.  I don't know if there is a more friendly front-end
available for Tidy...
