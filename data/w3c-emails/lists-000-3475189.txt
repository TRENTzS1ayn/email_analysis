I have reduced your bug to following test case:

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Some title</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<ul>
</B>
</ul>
</BODY>
</HTML>

I found out that ParseList function in parser.c goes to infinite loop,
when it encounters </B> tag. I don't know where exactly the bug is, but I
will continue my efforts.
