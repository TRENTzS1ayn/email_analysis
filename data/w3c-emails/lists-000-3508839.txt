While I don't doubt both your findings, as an FYI, I ran the Word97 file
through the Mac OS version of Tidy (based on the 26 Jul 99 sources, with
the fixes suggested by Dave on 15 Aug 99), and it worked without problem (I
didn't check to see if the correct results were produced - I can provide
the output files if you are interested). Some of the bugs reported in the
26 Jul 99 version of Tidy (and some of the fixes on 15 Aug 99) pertained to
infinite loops. You might want to check older mail to see if this is a
known bug.

Regards, Terry
