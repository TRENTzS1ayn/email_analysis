Hello,
first excuse please my English, I know, it's very simple and sure with 
bugs. I understand better than I write. I'm sure, You don't get post from 
Czech Republic every day.

I've just downloaded Your utility tidy386.zip. I thing, it's very usefull and 
powerfull. 

I wanted to run it in MSDOS 6.22, but i got the error-message: 
no DPMI - Get csdpmi*b.zip
so I tried to run it in the DOS-box of Windows 3.11, it was full functionally.

I don't know what does it mean: DPMI, I want to run tidy in DOS, where can 
I get the zip-file? I have only 386SX 4MB RAM. 
I hope I will heve a better one soon to test the 32-bit version of tidy.

I don'n know why, but in some cases tidy doesn't recognize 
the <h2> by splitting.

I tried to split a file with a lot of <h2>-tags, but I got only slide1.htm. 
I meant, that I should get the same amount of files, as the amount of <h2>-tags 
in the source-file is, shouldn't I?

I thing You can find out more than me, if You try it yourself. Here is the 
file:

<a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR//REC-CSS1-961217.html">
http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR//REC-CSS1-961217.html</a>

Another times I got 19 times correctly linked the same time named slide1, slide2, etc... slide19, 
it wasn't exactly the same file, but the same content - CSS1-specification

I have tried it more times, by other files was all OK.

I send You a zip-file as atachment containing a batch-file, five different config-files 
and a option-file with option, option values and default values. This can be 
usefull for new user. Check it please I hope, there 
are no tipe-mistakes.
If You want, You can add it/these (as examples) in Your pakage. Test it and sand me please Your 
comment. 

If You want, you can change the filenames, then You have to change the commands 
in the batch-file. The name of the batch can you change without doing anything 
else. It starts With "$", to be the first one in a dictionary. The batch-file and 
the config files have to be in the same directory as tidy386.exe.

I'm looking forward for new release
Good look by developing

Thank You for an answer
I'm interested in HTML, XHML, XML and the work of W3C. Does W3C test the various 
recomandations in a browser? In witch one? What's its|Your meaning about browser-specific 
attributes? Do You know a web-adress to these features?
