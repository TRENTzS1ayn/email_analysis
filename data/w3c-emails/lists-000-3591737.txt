It's very strange.  I made up a short test html file to test it when I read your
reply, and it worked.  So I went back to the long (30k) file I had originally
had problems with.  It worked too! Not only that, the problem I had where Tidy
did not terminate after processing the input file - that problem went away too.

I'm mystified.  The changes from erroneous results to excellent results  were
these:

1) I shut down all open windows. I had quite a few open previously.
2) I started a new command line session (I'm running Windows 95).

Perhaps Windows was short on some resource and this caused DOS or Tidy to
malfunction.  I dunno!

Thanks for your help, it got me to check it out again.
