This bug is still in the July 26th version, for those interested.
I'd like to be able to use tidy to be sure the pages are valid,
not just "tidy", so this is a bigger deal for me than for most.
But keep up the great work, Dave!  It's still the best tool I've
got for this stuff, so I won't complain.
