As a follow-up, adding the content model 
CM_TABLE to the tag <td> in tags.c results
in what I believe to be the correct output.

in tags.c:

//    "td",         VERS_FROM32,  (CM_ROW|CM_OPT|CM_NO_INDENT), ParseBlock,
null,
// changed to
    "td",         VERS_FROM32,  (CM_TABLE|CM_ROW|CM_OPT|CM_NO_INDENT),
ParseBlock, null,

However, since I am very new to this list and
to Tidy, I'm not sure what this breaks.  In my
limited testing, everything else seems to be
un-affected.

Anybody able to confirm this or offer any suggestions?

Thanks.
