Dave,
?
The fixes for the custom tag support are working great. I can now set up
new-blocklevel-tags and new-inline-tags for tidy configurations.
?
I did find one problem. Not sure if there is an easy way to fix it though. I
realize that this is a ColdFusion markup language issue but I'm sure it will

apply to other scripting languages that use the <> for delimiters (PHP,
etc.)
?
If I have a custom processing tag like ColdFusion's <CFIF (expression) > tag
and run it through Tidy with a custom tag configuration for it, the
following happens:
?
(old version)
?
<CFIF?True IS True>
?? This should always be output 
<CFELSE>This will never output 
</CFIF>
?
(html-tidied version)
<CFIF True="" IS="" True=""> This should always be output <CFELSE> </CFELSE>
</CFIF>
?
Two problems are occurring here. The CFIF tag expression "True is True" is
being parsed and each item is being treated like
it was a separate attribute. The second thing that is happening is the
insertion of the extra </CFELSE>.? The second problem
is not really an issue, but if there was some way to turn off automatic
attribute generation that would be a good thing.
?
Now I'm off to go play with the Word-2000 feature... <g>
