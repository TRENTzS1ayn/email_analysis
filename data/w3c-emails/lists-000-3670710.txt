Then surely you realize that it is highly improper to use another's 
mailing list as a destination for spam.  Would every subscriber to 
the list have to send a remove request before you'd remove the list 
from your spam list?  At most you can _ask_ _once_ for people to 
opt-in to your list, but not unilaterally decide for people that they 
are interested in your mailings.

And learn the difference between "affect" and "effect" please.  You 
come across as a fool when you get them mixed up.


Back to the list topic, I have looked over the latest HTML Tidy 
changes and expect to send additional bugfixes tomorrow.  Here's a 
few I can recall from the top of my head:  search for "Framset" and 
"xhtml1l".  There are also omitted slashes at the end of some URLs in 
that same source document.  (I'm sorry, I can't recall which one.)

There's also a function which can corrupt the node list such that 
this expression evaluates as true:

(node->content->prev->parent == node)

Again, I can't recall which one, but when I can run a diff again I'll 
have it for you.

I also see there is not yet HTML 4.01 support in HTML Tidy.  I think 
I've got it done in my copy except that it still can't distinguish 
HTML 4.0 from HTML 4.01.

All these I expect to mail to the list the evening of the 29th.
