I find it ironic that the guy didn't run Tidy on his HTML before posting it
here.  That way he would have spotted the missing alt attributes, missing
</a> before </center> ...

Subject:Rate your resource on the CodeCranker

As the popularity of CodeCranker grows and the number of
links increases it becomes more important to make sure your site is getting
the exposure in our list that it deserves.  We've addressed this by putting
in place a rating system that allows your users to rate the quality and
content of your site.  This in turn is used to sort the links in each
category.  We also find the highest rated links and feature them every week
in a Site of the week (for each category) and a top rated resource page that
is updated every day.  All you have to do to participate in this system is
to place the following snippet of HTML on your site.  

<!-- Insert this code exactly -->
<center><form method="post"
action="http://www.codecranker.com/cgi-bin/links/rate.cgi">
<input type="hidden" name="ID" value="7892">

As a programmer who hates spam myself I want to make sure
that you only receive this kind of e-mail if you want it.  If you no longer
want to receive e-mail from the CodeCranker simply reply to this message
with an Un-Subscribe in the subject and we'll remove your name immediately
(this won't in any way effect your link entry with us)
