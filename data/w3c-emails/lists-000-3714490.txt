I thought that I remembered some semtantic change to ALT being discussed as
potentially coming in HTML 4.0 or 4.01/whatever that would make ALT=""
illegal/not advisable.  At the time I thought it rather peculiar, but
wanted to see where things fell out.  If it is still something that
can be done, I agree that it would be nice to have an option for it.
