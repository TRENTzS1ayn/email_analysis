Dear Dave,
I recently downloaded your HTML Tidy and I think it is a really cool program. 
I only have one problem. Every time I try and make corrections on my pages 
with Java applets, under the HTML 4.0 Transitional, the applets stop working 
in the end. Is there a bug fix? Or is it something I'm doing wrong maybe? Any 
suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you and take care,

                                             Dawn
