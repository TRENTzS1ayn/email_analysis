Subject: HTML Tidy - BUG


Hello Dave,

  A few days ago I found your HTML Tidy utility (from the W3C web site).
  I think it is great, and I find it very useful.

  I think I stumbled upon an error. When I run it on the attached HTML file.
It goes into an endless loop at the following error in my HTML:

                     line 16 column 51 - Warning: discarding unexpected
</ol>

  If I use the -f option and let it run it will fill the hard disk (I only
waited until the file was 350Mb big:-)

  First I thought I knew what the problem was. If you take a close look at
"logic.html" you will notice that the line breaks in the file are "0Dh, 0Dh,
0Ah", and I thought this confused Tidy.

(The file ends up like this if I transfer it with FTP from my UNIX system in
ASCII mode. The Windows 95 FTP client adds the second 0Dh)
   
  But then I got the file as binary (now 0Dh, 0Ah for line breaks) and the
same thing happens (the attached "logicb.html").

  The version of Tidy that I am using is the Win95 console application dated
"Tidy (vers 27th September 1999)".

  I hope this helps you kill a bug :-)

  Thanks for a great utility!

Best regards,
   Peter

P.S. You will notice that the file is a Word 97 document saved as HTML, but
I think I have modified it by hand. I don't remember.
