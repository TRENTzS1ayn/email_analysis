No, but because it's an image used instead of the proper markup. Dots  
that carry important information (i.e. are not purly decorative, for  
which alt="" would be the bet solution) are usually meant to indicate a  
list marker.
For list items, the correct markup is <li> (within ul, of course), even  
if it does not displayed as a dot (which is actually a feature of HTML).
