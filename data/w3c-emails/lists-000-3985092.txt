Tidy's AdjustConfig() routine attempts to ensure that the config
options are self-consistent. If you have enabled drop-font-tags, or
logical-emphasis, then Tidy will (currently) automatically enable
the clean option. It's possible that in you example the removal of
the font tags also removed the need for a style rule. I will
investigate this further. Thanks for the examples.
