I suggest that you get the latest Java tidy with DOM interfaces.
The method names such as 'getChildNodes' make the relationships
more clear.  The Java tidy web page has an updated sample that uses
the DOM interfaces, as returned by parseDOM().

In the following HTML file (with missing end tags added) the embedded
table will be a child of one of the td elements:

<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><td>table 1 - header info.
</td></tr>
</thead>
<tfoot>
<tr><td>table 1 - footer info.
</td></tr>
</tfoot>
<tbody>
<tr><td>
<table><thead><tr><td></td></tr>
</thead><tfoot><tr><td></td></tr></tfoot><tbody><tr><td>Skip
this table</td></tr></tbody></table>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Skip embedded table to this row.
</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</body>
</html>
