Hi,

I found a not optimal HTML-cleaning by tidy in case of two opening
<table> tags and only one closing </table> - For an example see
attachment.

In short: Tidy then combines both tables to one table by shifting the 
content of the first table to the location of the second table and
removing the second opening table tag.

As far as I can see, the original construct can have three reasons: 
1.) The second opening <table> tag was accidentally included, but should
not be there.

2.) There should be two independent tables; the first one simply is
missing the </table> tag.

3.) There should be nested tables, one of the two is missing the closing
</table> tag.

In case 1.) The HTML-cleaning applied is correct. In the other two
cases it is not. I for example had a long file with the first table at
the very top (missing </table>) and a second table close to the bottom.
After tidying the file, I had difficulties identifying the merged
tables.

Since I cannot think of a strict algorithm to distinguish between the
three cases, I propose tidy should not perform the present automatic
HTML-cleaning and give a warning, but rather give an error and not
clean the code. However I am not familiar with the distinction between
error and warning in tidy, so maybe a warning is correct here. Then I
would propose a more detailed warning text (like when tidy finds <font>
tags).
