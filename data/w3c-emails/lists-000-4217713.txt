Dear Dave,

While porting the 27 Sep 99 version of Tidy, I noticed that in parser.c,
you use free() rather than MemFree().

Specifically, lines #149, #884.

Is there a good reason why these calls should not be MemFree()? I prefer to
bottleneck the memory management calls through MemAlloc()/MemFree() etc,
for debugging and tracking purposes.

I made the changes in my code, and it still seems to work fine.

Regards, Terry
