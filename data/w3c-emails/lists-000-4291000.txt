Thanks for the explanation. Sadly, I don't see an easy way to give
you what you want, as Tidy is basically a just a smart parser that
generates a valid HTML parse tree then pretty prints it out. A work
around would be to use a server-side include for just the attributes
of the body element. Tidy currently knows about several different
kinds of preprocessing syntax you could use for this purpose.

In general, it is impractical to verify files involving a
preprocessor without being able to compute the preprocessing
instructions using the actual data they will be run on. Tidy is
useful when the preprocessor adds attributes or elements, but
not when these are an essential part of the document.
