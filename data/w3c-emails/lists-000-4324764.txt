Whilst I agree that this would a useful feature, I think that the wrap issue
on attribute values needs to be addressed separately (see earlier posting in
the wrap of the TITLE= value but not the CONTENT= value). I think that there
is a need to disable the wrap of attribute values whilst still allowing the
indent and wrap of body text.

My justification is that wrapped and indented TITLE= values (and perhaps
some others) is often visible to the browser user. e.g. <ACRONYM
TITLE="HyperText
                   Markup Language">HTML</ACRONYM>

Thanks for the feedback. You can set the number to the maximum
value for a signed 32 bit integer. However, I agree that it
would be nicer to avoid the need to know what this number is.
"wrap: 0" seems like a reasonable way as does "wrap: never".
I will look into this for the next release.
