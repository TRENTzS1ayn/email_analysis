Having now worked with this for a couple of months, and I agree that it does
make the structure clearer, it does cause other problems. When there is a
very fine grained table structure in the source (lots of cells with very
small contents such as a single character) then the increase in both the
byte count and length of the file becomes unreasonable inserting at least
one extra blank line per cell.

It was intentional, as previously I found it hard to visually sort
out one element from another. I'm sorry that I forgot to mention
this in the release notes.
