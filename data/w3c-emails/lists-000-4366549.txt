Hi,

given is the following HTML File:

<ul>text<li>more text</li></ul>

The Warnings are:
line 1 column 1 - Warning: inserting missing 'title' element
line 1 column 5 - Warning: plain text isn't allowed in <ul> elements
line 1 column 10 - Warning: missing </blockquote> before <li>

and Tidy's output is:

[...]
<body>
<blockquote>text</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>texttext</li>
</ul>
</body>
[...]

Since there was no sign that there was any type of quotation in my code, tidy
should not inserte a blockquote element here.

regards,
 Bj?rn H?hrmann
