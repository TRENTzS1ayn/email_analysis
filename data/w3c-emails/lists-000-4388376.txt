Only if TABLE is the first content of another tag (such as BODY).  If there
is content before the TABLE, the moved text is not lost.  This is due to a
bug in MoveBeforeTable().  I've addressed this in my 1999-Sep-29 patch.

My later patch apparently still doesn't prevent the addition of the empty
cell.  I'll look into that.
