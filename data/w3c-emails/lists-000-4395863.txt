(This has nothing to do with the wrap option...)

Hi Dave,

Perhaps you'll hear from me more often. I'm just about to tidy up a >1000 pages
Website, some of which with a quite complex structure, which might push TIDY to
its limits. Maybe even beyond them... :-))

     (FYI, I use a Cyrix 586 133 MHz machine built out of
     spare parts, with 64M RAM, under Win95.A release and
     Debian 2.0 GNU/Linux 2.0.34 (but no RPM converter, and
     not yet time to compile the sources...)

It was the third page I was working on when happened the following :

calling TIDY to cleanup the page "frag.html" (I'll keep a copy for you on the
site at URL http://www.globenet.org/periph/agenda/frag-old.html , so you may try
out yourself. If the page doesn't exist, this means that today's update is still
to come, and the old file is still named "frag.html").

I use a "html.bat" file with just one line :

> tidy.exe -config html.ini -wrap 1024 %1 > html.htm

You notice that I redirect the screen output in order to create the cleaned-up
file, as (unlike the manual says) TIDY doesn't write to the disk, at least when
I use it in a DOS-window inside Win95. I didn't yet try it otherwise.

and the "html.ini" file looks like this :

> indent: auto
> doctype: strict
> char-encoding: ascii
> break-before-br: yes
> uppercase-tags: yes
> uppercase-attributes: yes
> clean: yes
> logical-emphasis: yes
> keep-time: yes
> error-file: error.txt

So, I started with :

<keyboard>html frag~1.htm</keyboard>

waited one or 2 seconds, as usual, but then... (thought, maybe it takes somewhat
longer, as this page is the biggest I tidied up, 'til now)
after some minutes, I <CTRL-BREAK> the program. Then, I found a zero-length
"html.htm" file and an "error.txt" file which at first sight had 365k in size,
but NO ! It were 365MEGAS ! In fact, if I'd waited a bit more, maybe the program
had eaten up all my disk space...
Next time, I'll let it write the output to a diskette :-)

CU soon

Norbert
