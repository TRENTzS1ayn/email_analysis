Thanks for this and your follow on messages. I am working on a new
release but may not be able to address all issues in a single
release without a long delay.

This feature was requested by a user, who found it helpful for
Tidy to reproduce the same visual rendering while fixing the
document so that it conforms to the spec.

On further reflection, I now believe that it makes more sense
to wrap an li around naked content in list elements and to
add a style attribute to suppress the bullet or number. I am
developing a complementary tool called HTML Untidy which will
be used for converting clean HTML+CSS to support old browsers.

On the style element - the next release will set the type
attributes for style and script.

Thanks again for the feedback.
