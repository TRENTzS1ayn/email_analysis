To quote Nasscom

?According  to estimates by McKinsey & Co., by 2010 the IT Enabled services
market  is  poised  to  grow  from  the  present US $10 billion to US $ 200
billion  worldwide  market. It will mainly constitute HR Services, Customer
Interaction  Services,  Finance  and  Accounting,  Data Search, Integration
Analysis  and  Remote  Education,  amongst  others.  Outsourcing is the new
mantra in this business.

Nasscom  had  identified  I.T.  Enabled Services as a major opportunity for
employment  and  earning  foreign exchange for India. According to a survey
undertaken  by  NASSCOM,  as  on  August  1999, there were more than 35,000
people  employed  in  this  sector in India. Nasscom estimates that by year
2008, this sector can generate an additional one million jobs and almost US
$ 18 billion of annual revenue, most of it coming from export activities.?


Thank you,
Warm Regards
