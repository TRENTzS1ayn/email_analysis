I am using an HTML editor with a plugin, that supports TIDY. The XML
declaration was set by default and I did not change anything there. Older
versions of TIDY worked fine, why should I manipulate the config?

Some minutes ago I looked for the newest version of TIDY and there it was:
The brand new October release! I downloaded it and the problem has gone
without changing any line of my HTML code. It seems to me, the "critical
element" was _not_ my code, but the September release of TIDY.

Kind regards
