I don't know what you mean by "crash", but it looks like both programs
ran to completion. They didn't do the useful thing you wanted, but
that's another issue.

As for the difference between "<>" and "<(null)>", that's just a
difference in the implementation of the C I/O library. When printf() and
friends are passed a NULL pointer to what's supposed to be a string, the
Linux version prints out the text "(null)", while the Mac version prints
nothing. I don't know what the ANSI C standard says is the Right Thing
to do here, but I suspect it's either "undefined" or "implementation
specific".

Otherwise, it looks like both Mac and UNIX versions do exactly the same
thing.
