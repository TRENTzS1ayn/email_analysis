In fact it does produce some output after error messages:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN">
<html>
<head>
<title>Some title</title>
</head>
<body>

Segmentation fault

I used gdb (gnu debugger) to see what is happening when Tidy crashes. The
Segmentation fault happens at line 797 in pprint.c, when PPrintTag is
trying to access parent of HR element, which is null pointer. 

I am bit confused, becouse no one else have been able to reproduce this
bug. My configuration is Red Hat Linux release 6.0, egcs-2.91.66 and glibc
2.1.1. 

I noticed that Tidy survives when font tag is not present. I try to figure
out what makes that difference.
