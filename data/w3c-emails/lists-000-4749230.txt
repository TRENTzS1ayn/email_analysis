if node->implicit gets set by parser.c,
  then pprint.c ought to annotate that the tag
     that was inferred and not explicitly found from user input

eg
for inputs of
     <li>  something
     <li<  else

and the inference of <ul>
the pprint output ought to be

     <ul> <!-- inferred ul -->
       <li>  something
       <li<  else
     </ul>

we are mutating the authors data and (s)he ought to be able to understand
the relationship of the end result to the original inputs without resorting to
some form of DIFF(1)

also reasonable that this be a configurable runtime option
     -ann{otate}
