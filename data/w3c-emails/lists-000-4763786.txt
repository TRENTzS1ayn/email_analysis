How would you  like to write a tutorial for the Mac version <grin>? A
common complaint is new users  don't always figure out on their own how to
use the program. I intend to improve the usability and user interface, and
one day write "real" documentation.

Looks pretty good. A couple of minor grammatical errors. Fortunately the
MS-DOS version of Tidy is pretty simple to use. However people should
really read the Overview.html page you point to, in order to get the best
out of Tidy.

I would suggest perhaps adding the use of I/O redirection, and avoiding the
use of the -m option.

e.g. tidy -i -wrap 400 -upper -f errors.txt foo.html > foo.out
