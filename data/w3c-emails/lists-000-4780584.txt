Yes, I guess you are correct on this one - being a Mac user, I rarely run
MS-DOS applications, and when I do, it is under Windows 9x. So I assume you
can't actually run this version on older configurations running DOS only.

First I think you have the URL wrong - while using the above URL does
indeed download a file (I didn't bother completing the download), it is not
a published URL (that I could find) on the main Tidy page. All the links to
the Win32 Command line version of Tidy, from the main Tidy page are :

<http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy.exe>

Secondly, I downloaded this very file a day or two ago, and it is in fact
the 22 Oct 99 version.
