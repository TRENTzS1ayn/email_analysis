To: Tidy List<html-tidy@w3.org>

I'm doing this evil thing with texi2html and Tidy. The first text I emit
from the texinfo file (in an "@ifhtml/@end ifhtml" block) is a style
sheet. texi2html doesn't know about style sheets or other <head> things,
so the style sheet ends up being emitted in the <body> section. 

Tidy to the rescue! Tidy recognizes the style sheet and moves it to the
<head> section, which is exactly the right thing to do. (Thank you very
much!) However, it leaves behind an empty <p></p> pair in its place,
presumably because the style sheet used to look like a text thingy
before it got relocated.

Here's the Makefile entry:

   blah.html: blah.texinfo
      texi2html -monolithic -menu -verbose blah.texinfo
      tidy -clean -modify -indent -asxml blah.html


Anyway, I can't seem to find any combo of parameters that will get Tidy
to eliminate and/or not emit truly empty paragraphs, or to keep it from
generating one when it relocates all the text from that section. I'm
open to suggestions.

Note: I have contacted the current maintainer of texi2html, and he
offered some suggestions, but nothing that would easily get texi2html to
put a style sheet in the <head> to start with. He's got something in the
works, but it ain't there yet (and it didn't sound like it would be very
pretty when it is there either).

Any helpful suggestions are welcome. (So are the other ones for that
matter:-)
