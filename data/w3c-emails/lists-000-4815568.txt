I am using html-tidy in html kit to try and redo some web pages.
However it seems to get into an endless loop. T
The version I am using is Oct 22.

The page that I am trying to re-do is:
http://www.sis.port.ac.uk/~allangw/penpic.htm

I found a message from someone who was seeming to have a 
similar problem, but as far as could tell that particular problem was 
fixed in the Oct 22 release.

I'm afraid that I'm not very good (in fact can't at all!) understand 
technical command line interfaces - that's why I have to use it within 
HTML Kit.

I know that there are a lot of closing tags omitted - is that the 
problem. 

(On the page in question the endless loop occured when it got to 
line 24)
