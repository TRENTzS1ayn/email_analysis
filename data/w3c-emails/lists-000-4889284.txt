I have fixed the problem in the new release, which I plan to post
later today. I took a look at the above URL and note that it uses
<L>...</L> (not part of HTML) whereas, I would have expected to see
<ul>...</ul>.

p.s. the download time for the photograph could be reduced
considerably, e.g. from 37Kb to 5Kb along with a slight improvement
in its perceived quality - I attach the revised file which was
generated by first smoothing then resampling the image to the visual
dimensions used in the page.
