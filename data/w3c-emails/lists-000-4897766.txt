We may be drifting far afield here, and I don't usually follow these
esoteric points in emerging standards terribly closely, but I just want
to know if I understand what this means. Does this mean the old trick of
hiding Javascript in HTML comments is not going to work in XML-ized
pages? Can you even have Javascript in XML-ized pages? I suddenly feel
like I'm missing something crucial. I haven't seen this issue discussed
before...
