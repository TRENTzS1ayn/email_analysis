Good question! It sure looks like Javascript's -- operator is illegal
in XML comments.

I'm not sure what Tidy should do. Some options that come to mind
(applicable only when the output is XML, of course):

  - Corrupt the script by changing hyphen+hyphen to hyphen+space.
  - Output illegal XML by leaving hyphen+hyphen as is.
  - Parse comments for <script> elements and move them out of the comment.
