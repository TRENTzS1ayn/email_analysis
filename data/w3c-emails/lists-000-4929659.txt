Aha! Although character entities aren't recognized in comments, they
should be recognized in <script> elements. So I think there is an
additional option:

  - Parse comments for <script> elements and change hyphen+hyphen to
    &#45;&#45; (or maybe -&#45;).

(&ndash; and &mdash; wouldn't translate to quite the right character.)
