hi,
1.there is a bug reading html files with <li>
if its not rapped with <ol> the procedure ParseList calls ParseTag and this
one calls backs - endlessly.
if u want 2 know how i fixed it let me know

2.also in some files the program doesnt find the end tags of </form> and
even </html>,
just wondering if u know something about it...

thanks
