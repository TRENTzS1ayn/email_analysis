Thank you Scott,

Let's carry this a little further.

Who's misconceived notion was it to stat such the false rumor, that FreeBSD
is not Linux?  There is a problem in making such a statement.  I can only
surmise that the writer is young, inexperienced, short on education, a
jokester, can not comprehend what they read, and / or works for microsoft.
That statement needs to be supported, assuming that it can, by the person
making the statement.  I for one want verification of the validity.  Until
then, I will assume that this person is one of the above and nothing more.

I encourage the use of Linux and recognizes that other Unix-compatible
 operating systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, Redhat, SuSE, Caldera, etc..   
all deserve attention and recognition.  The only major significant
difference in these flavors of "Linux", is the extra set of tools,
utilities, 3rd party software, and packaging wrapper.  The basic operating
system "kernel" is the same.  It is Linux.
