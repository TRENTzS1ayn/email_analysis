Actually, let me direct you to the official source for Linux and see what
they have to say about what English-Language Linux Distributions that exist
out there.

"Linux is a free Unix-type operating system originally created by Linus
Torvalds with the assistance of developers around the world."  

"As a benefit to the source code for the Linux kernel being
freely-distributed, a number of companies have developed their own
"distribution" of Linux. Each of these distributions has it's own feature
set, and some are geared towards specific types of computer systems. In some
cases, they are available at no charge via FTP and in other cases they may
be purchased on CD for a relatively low cost, or as a companion to a Linux
book."
