I have "cleaned" word2000 docs with tidy. 
I modified the code to leave the style within the
document (in clean.c). 

However, 
some of windows characters (" ", """, "'")
appears on the output as 
&ndahs, &ldquo. 

my perl parser crashes on that input. 
does anybody have an idea how to modify tidy output to
put this characters in their original format. 

thanks, 

Avi
