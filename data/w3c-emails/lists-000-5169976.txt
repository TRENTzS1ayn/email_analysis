We are using the Java Script Template Engine on some of our web pages and 
would like to process the html with Tidy.  The format of the JSTE tag is 
<#...stuff...#>.  I have modified Tidy to ignore everything between <# and 
#>.  This let's our html coders work with the code and tidy it without 
breaking the JSTE tag.  I was able to do this for the command line version 
of Tidy by modifying html.h, lexer.c, parser.c and pprint.c.  I have 
attached a zip file that contains these four modified files (these files are 
modified from the tidy24nov99 base).  I would like this modification in the 
Tidy plugin in the HTML-Kit but I am unable to get that working.  I am 
hoping Chami may consider creating a plugin with this modification included.

Thanks,

Al Medeiros
