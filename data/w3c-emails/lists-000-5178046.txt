FWIW, I reproduced Victor's problem (more or less) with the Mac OS version
of Tidy 24 Nov 99. It has the same symptoms as other bugs reported earlier
- FreeNode() freeing an already freed block. In Victor's case, I got 2
occurrences of the problem.

For completeness, here is the error report and cleaned output produced
using Victor's sample bad.html and tidy_config.txt, with the Mac OS version
:
