Dear Sir

I'm still trying to learn HTML, and I had quite a help from Html-Kit.
For a few days I have been having this problem:
When I try to have my code checked, the program never stops.
The first time it happened, I tought it was because the file was long, with 
a lot of text, then I began to cut it in small parts and saving it as 
different files. It seemed to work, but today it happened again.
I send you the file that caused the problem, and a screen capture of the 
program message.
I never had enough patience to see if it would stop!... I use Ctrl-Alt-Del.

This is not a reclamation! All I have to do is thank you and the makers of 
HtmlKit for giving for free such useful tools!

Promise these files have no viruses that I know!

All I want is to give my contribution for an even better program.



Thank you so much!
