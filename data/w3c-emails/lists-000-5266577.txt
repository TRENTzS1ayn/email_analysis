Hi!

First of all, thank you, Mr. Ragget, for such a wonderful software.. tidy is
rather .. huh ... neat!  :)

Second, the enhancement request (it should be a chinch) -

I'd like to have 2 new command line options:  --links and --images. I think
it's obvious, --links would print a (unformated ?) list of all the href URLs
for the <a...> tag, --images all the src URLs of <img...> tags. These two
options would make tidy very usable in scripts.

When I get those, I'll tell you about the other enhancement request that I
have in store :)

Hypertextualy yours,

Armando
