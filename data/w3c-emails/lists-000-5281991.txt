Hello,

  In tidy.c ? line 778 the command line argument ?indent? is processed and
sets IndentContent=yes.

  Right below it on line 784 ? the same argument ?indent? is processed and
WOULD set both IndentContent & SmartIndent to yes.

  I want smart indent behavior, but the command line processing seems to be
flawed because the second case is never executed ? only the first one.
