Hi,
As far as I can tell html-tidy doesn't seem to handle
two columns of nested tables. I passed it over one doc
and it produced a staggered set ...
from XXXX   XXXX
     XXXX   XXXX
to
     XXXX
            XXXX
     XXXX
            XXXX
Am I doing something wrong here?
Cheers
John
ah, also it picks up <img> tags and
declares no "alt"s have been used when the <img> tag is
used as "background=" in a <td>. That's bogus.
