If you are using an img element for a table cell, why is
it bogus to give people who can't see it an explanation
of what they are missing?  If it is only cosmetic, you
should set alt="" as missing out the alt attribute will
just confuse people using text-only browsers.

Could you please send me examples of the source markup
that demonstrates these two problems?
