I can't reproduce this. One possibility is that you are using
a config file with the clean option set to yes. Alternatively,
you could be setting drop-font-tags or logical-emphais, both
of which set the clean option internally.

Does the problem persist with the latest version of Tidy?

You are probably setting the indent option to yes. Try auto or no
both of which will avoid the problem. Netscape Navigator is somewhat
inconsistent about stripping trailling whitespace.

The next release should also support JSTE.
