Is there a way to prevent Tidy (I am using it within the HTML-Kit) from wrapping text that is surrounded by quotes?  I have identified td as an inline tag to prevent extra whitespace from being generated.  We have a long <td> that contains <img> tags.  These <img> tags imbed images that are in a directory structure that contains a blank in the name of one of the directory levels, for example:
"Images/home gif/logo.gif".  If I set Wrap at to anything reasonable then Tidy will break one of these <img> tags when it encounters the space between home and gif.  I have tried several different options but the only thing I found that eliminates the problem is to set Wrap at very high, like 400.

By the way Dave, thanks for adding JSTE support to your December version.  I'm sure Chami will get it in the HTML-Kit version soon after.
