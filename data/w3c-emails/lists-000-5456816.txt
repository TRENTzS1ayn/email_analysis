Hi!

I'm affraid that I don't agree with your concept of restricting tidy to be a
"pretty-printer for HTML Code".... after all, there are 3133 lines in
parser.c vs 1594 in pprint.c. Therefore, I think of tidy in a wider sense,
and the -slides option proves my point :).

Unfortunately, I haven't got the time to hack the (estimated) 20 lines of
code that would have to be added to tidy to do the stuff I proposed. It's
not the 20 lines, its understanding the whole of the code, of course.

Re LinkExtor, I'll look into it (thanks for the tip), but the fact is that
there are dozens of extractors, in Perl, Python, C, even Lisp. But on the
other hand, tidy is (on my system, at least) all of 103 kb... which is
better that loading perl's 491 k, plus (assuming) libwww and the rest.

The point is that tidy tracks bleeding edge HTML, is based on a grammar, and
its fast.

Again, thank you for the tip

Armando
