I presume that you are referring here to only to quoted attribute values
rather than contained body text. Having taken note of the %20 requirement
for spaces in URIs, there are other situations where wrapping attribute
values can have a visible impact on the browser. e.g. ALT and TITLE text.
This can be eliminated by switching off wrap altogether by setting it to
zero but that is taking a sledge hammer to crack a nut. My editor would like
a wrap of about 60 for perfect readability so I think some sort of
wrap-attribute-value: bool is needed just to suppress this particular action
but allow contained body text still be tidied up.

Subject: Eliminate Line Wrapping within Quotes "..."


Is there a way to prevent Tidy (I am using it within the HTML-Kit) from
wrapping text that is surrounded by quotes?  I have identified td as an
inline tag to prevent extra whitespace from being generated.  We have a long
<td> that contains <img> tags.  These <img> tags imbed images that are in a
directory structure that contains a blank in the name of one of the
directory levels, for example:
"Images/home gif/logo.gif".  If I set Wrap at to anything reasonable then
Tidy will break one of these <img> tags when it encounters the space between
home and gif.  I have tried several different options but the only thing I
found that eliminates the problem is to set Wrap at very high, like 400.
 
By the way Dave, thanks for adding JSTE support to your December version.
I'm sure Chami will get it in the HTML-Kit version soon after.
