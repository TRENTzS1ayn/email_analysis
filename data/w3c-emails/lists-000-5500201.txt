Hi all,
I have download the tidy and found that it is a good tool to validate the document, and the site of w3c provide the function of http://validator.w3.org/ to validate the document.
If they have difference on their capability,  which is better?
If the latter is better, why didn't add the function into Tidy?
 
Best!
