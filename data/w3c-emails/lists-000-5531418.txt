Sorry, Dave, I meant to send you the following message via this list. I will 
include it here now - together with your response - for general information.

On Wed, 1 Dec 1999 I wrote to Dave Raggett:

Additionally, Dave, when I use the attributes:

xml:lang="en" lang="en"

in the HTML root element, Tidy reports unknown attribute "xml:lang" - again, 
the page validates error free in the W3C Validator.
