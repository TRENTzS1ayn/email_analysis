Re: nice to have browser indicator...

One of the web browsers does that I think - goes through a web page
and tries to provide an indicator of what features match what browsers.

Unfortunately, I've looked at so many of these things I don't recall
which one it is.  I know I've used w3c (and that's not the one), Bobby
(which may be the one) and NetGarage (I think it is called).

Check over on Yahoo, which is where I generally go to get the latest URLs
for these kinds of sites.
