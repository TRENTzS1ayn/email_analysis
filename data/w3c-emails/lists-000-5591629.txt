I'm not quite sure what you mean by "optional end tags" ...
My reading of the w3 stuff (after I validated) suggested that nested tables weren't a
Good Thing and so the output of html tidy was perfectly valid ...
but not useful.
The URL is http://www.crosswinds.net/~linuxmusic/index.html
pay no mind to all the font stuff - dreamweaver did that on one trip
into it and I haven't cleared it up yet

Yes, that's fair enough. It's just that most (all?) graphical browsers 
won't display the "alt" so maybe it's not bogus - but it is redundant
in that case.

 Hmm, I tried 4.00 transitional but the validator said I wasn't using
that :(
