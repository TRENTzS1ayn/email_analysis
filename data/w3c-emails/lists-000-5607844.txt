To: Terry Teague<teague@mailandnews.com>

Dear Folks,

I am pleased to announce the first public beta release of "BBTidy", a
plugin (based on the popular free "tidy" program by Dave Raggett), for the
popular BBEdit text editor for Mac OS, to check and correct HTML and XML
source.

You have either expressed an interest in Tidy for Mac OS, a version of Tidy
for BBEdit, or are on various mailing lists of similar interest - if you
received this in error, accept my apologies (this is a one time mailing).

For complete information on and new online documentation for "BBTidy",
"tidy", and other Mac OS versions of "tidy" which have been recently
updated (based on the 30 Nov 99 version), visit :

Regards, Terry Teague
