Does it recognize your code as HTML 4.0 otherwise? APPLET is deprecated in
favor of OBJECT.

I am not sure whether it is me or something else. 
Every time I run html-tidy with the html-kit, the applet tag disappears on
the tidied version. 
Am I doing something wrong? 
This happens at work and at home. I see no other comments about this so I
presume its me.
