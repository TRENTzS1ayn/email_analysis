First, congrats on a great piece of software.  I use it through HTML-Kit and
am extremely impressed with Tidy's power and ease of use (one click on their
interface).  Here are a couple suggestions:

+ It would be nice for Tidy to verify that the charset being used is the
correct canonical name (e.g., ISO-8859-1 not ISO_8859-1) both in the XML
processing instruction <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> and META tags
such as:

    <meta
     http-equiv="Content-Type"
     content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />

+ I assume you are aware that Tidy reports an error when shown the new XHTML
namespace of <http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml> and incorrectly changes it to
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1>.  And, Tidy incorrectly reports a bug for
xml:lang="en".

+ Finally, I think you should consider having an option for Tidy to add a
tag such as <meta name="Generator" content="HTML Tidy, a free utility from
Dave Raggett at the W3C, version 30th November 1999"
href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/">.  The point would be for
anyone viewing the HTML source to say, "Wow, I wish my source looked this
nice!" and immediately know what to do about it.  Of course, you would want
to allow people to turn this off, but I would suggest that the default
should be on.

Thanks again for the great utility.
