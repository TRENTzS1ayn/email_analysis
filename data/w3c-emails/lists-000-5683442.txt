Hi Dave,
As you suspected, Tidy was setting the clean tag (I had set the
convert B and I tags to STRONG and EM).  Finally managed to track it down
with the help of Chami - thanks for all the assistance and keep up the
excellent work.

This sounds like HTML Kit is always setting the clean option. Does
the problem persist if you use the latest version of tidy.exe?
