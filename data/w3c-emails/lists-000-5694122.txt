-- Tidy accesses my html files OK and my config file but I cannot get a
config file to work.  

If I use a nonexistant file for config.txt in the command it gives me an
error message, and rightly so. But I'm not getting any error messages
when I use config.txt so it seems like it does find the file and use it.
It just doesn't do anything.  

Any suggestions ? 



I use this command: 
tidy -config config.txt book.html


This is config.txt: 
         
         indent: yes
         indent-spaces: 30
         wrap: 72
         markup: yes
         clean: yes
         output-xml: no
         input-xml: no
         show-warnings: no
         numeric-entities: yes
         quote-marks: yes
         quote-nbsp: yes
         quote-ampersand: no
         break-before-br: no
         uppercase-tags:Yes
         uppercase-attributes:Yes
         output-xhtml: yes
         char-encoding: latin1


There are no indents and nothing is capitalized.
