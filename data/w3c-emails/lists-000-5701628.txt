Hi,

I have tried tidy for preparing presentation and I have some 
comments on it.

1) Is not it strange, that program of the HTML's author and advocat 
fo CSS does produce HTML files, which are not using stylesheets at 
all. See

<center>
<small><a href="slide2.html">next</a>
</small></center>

in the bottom of every slide. Especially in the situation, when using 
of styles would be so usefull -- for example, if I would be sure, that I 
will use browsers supporting JavaScript well, I will set it to invisible.

2) Is there any simple program which would allow me to transfer 
html trees from Win95 / Linux with long filenames to M$-DOS? I 
mean not only shortening of the filenames themselves (zip / unzip 
can handle this beautifuly), but making appropriate changes in the 
<a> elements as well.

Have a nice day

Matthew
