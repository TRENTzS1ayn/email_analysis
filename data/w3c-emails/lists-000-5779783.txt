Hi,

I compiled tidy30Nov99 for SunOS4 with gcc-2.8.1 and encountered some
minor problems, some due to this old OS and some 'nitpicking'.

config.c: realloc seems to be a problem for this machine, as it fails
  on the unused local static (without a warning to the user). My C is
  rusty so the attached patch config.c-realloc might be lame. But it
  works :-)

localize.c: redefines ACCESS_URL, which is defined in include file
  platform.h

platform.h: defines ACCESS_URL to http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL, which
  should have (IMHO) a trailing slash. ISTR some w3c recommendation,
  that directories should be mentioned as directories in URLs, saving
  at least a redirection

SUPPORT_GETPWNAM on this OS leads to including <pwd.h> and
  <sys/types.h>, which defines uint (for System V compat). This gives
  me a warning on the redefinition of uint in platform.h. I can ignore
  these, but maybe some other symbol than __USE_MISC needs to be
  checked (as ulong is not defined in <sys/types.h>).

Other questions and comments:

- I ran tidy on one of my files and again on its output. There it had
  inserted empty <p>'s and complaind about it. Another tidy run had no
  more errors. Can tidy clean things up in one run, or does it work
  like me, when cleaning up a messy desk with the storage space of a
  second desk :-)? The error occured at a (misused) <P> at the end of
  a pragraph before <HR>. The paragraph was <P>-blocked by tiny, but
  an additional <P></P> was inserted.

- tidy reports HTML version 3.2 for some files, but in the cleaned
  version the doctype is set to 2.0. Why?

- tidy needs some user feedback in error situations. It took me pretty
  long to spot a typo in the config file, because tiny does not
  complain about unknown options. I know it's not finished, but I
  patched my version so that it catches these errors.

- someone should alter the bottom idividual part of the welcome
  message to the mailing list, since it seems to be copied from
  another of your w3c-lists :-)

May the source be with you
  Jan
