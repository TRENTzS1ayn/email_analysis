I agree. HTML Tidy is my program of choice when working with HTML, both to
keep my own code in order and make the appallingly markup produced by some
other programs readable. 

A META tag would serve as a recognition of the work done on HTML Tidy and
as a pointer to the program for people looking at the HTML source for a
page.
