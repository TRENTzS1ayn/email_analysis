Basically I am in favour of the suggestion. I would not necessarily
consider tidy a "generator" of the HTML, but I can't think of a better
expression right now. Since href is not an allowed attribute within
<meta> one could opt for the solution content="...,http://..." this is
similar to the http-equiv="refresh" syntax in <meta>.
