Dave,
 
Hate to be a pain, but the new '=' substitution feature on comments is
causing the Cold Fusion <!--- ---> comments to become <!-- =-->. Minor
feature request: a 
config file option to turn off the comment conversions...
 
I know Tidy can't be everything to everyone and CFML is a very specialized
server-side markup.
 
Regards,
 
Darren
