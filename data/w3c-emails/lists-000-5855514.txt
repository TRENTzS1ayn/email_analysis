Bjoern,

CFML is a dynamic, server side language. When you do commenting, sometimes
you may want server side-comments only that
won't show up on the client-side generated HTML.

ColdFusion is a server-side HTML-like markup language which Tidy can support
using additional keyword configurations, one of which is an alternate
comment syntax to allow you to document your server side CFML, but
not have the comments show up in the resulting client-side HTML, which could
compromise security.

CFML allows you to use <--- ---> as server-side comments which get processed
by
the Cold Fusion engine and won't show up in the generated client-side HTML
which results.

Here's a quick CFML lesson

Example 1: MyPage.cfm

<HTML>
<-- Standard HTML Comment -->
<BODY>

   <--- CF query against database FOO--->
   <CFQUERY name="Foo" Datasource="Foo">
     Select name,age from FOO
   </CFQUERY>

   <TABLE>
      <CFOUTPUT>
      <TR>
        <TD>#name#</TD>  <--- Output Name column from foo --->
        <TD>#age#</TD>   <--- Output Age coulumn from foo --->
      <TR>
      </CFOUTPUT> 

   </TABLE>

</BODY>

</HTML>


This is what the server side CFML markup looks like. Cold Fusion then does
dynamic server side processing, and sends back something to th client which
looks like this:

<HTML>
<-- Standard HTML Comment -->
<BODY>


   <TABLE>
      <TR>
        <TD>Darren</TD> 
        <TD>Forcier</TD>
      </TR>
      <TR>
        <TD>Bjoern</TD> 
        <TD>Hoerhmann</TD>
      </TR>

   </TABLE>

</BODY>

</HTML>

Who the hell was so stupid to write a program that creates invalid markup? I
suggest to contact Allaire Corporation and ask them for a bugfix.
