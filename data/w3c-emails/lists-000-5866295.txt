But HTML Tidy doesn't operate on your engine's results; it operates on
files.  The designers of your "server-side comments" should have thought
twice about throwing non-HTML data into an HTML file.  Proprietizer!

Perhaps HTML Tidy should have some generalized code to handle any instance
of <x--...--x> where "x" is any single character (matching) to handle all
the many syntax of server-side directives (except Apache's <!--#...-->) it
deals with already as well as any more the next eager beaver decides to
come up with.

Meanwhile, this is a very crappy syntax Allaire has come up with as it adds
another layer of confusion upon comment syntax.  Couldn't you have come up
with a different character to use than "-"?

Is there any additional syntax to CFML's <---...---> markup that we could
use to disambiguate it from (other) badly formatted comments?
