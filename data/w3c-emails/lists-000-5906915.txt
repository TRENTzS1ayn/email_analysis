Hi,

I thought a little bit about presentation features of TIDY (aka -slides) 
and prepared (of course) presenation about the future direction, 
where TIDY should continue in this matter. It is available on 
http://www.volny.cz/cepls/pres-tidy/slide1.html (source page is 
available in the same directory as pres.htm). Please, all replies on 
my personal address as I have not managed to be subscribed to the 
list yet.  

   Have a nice day

       Matthew
