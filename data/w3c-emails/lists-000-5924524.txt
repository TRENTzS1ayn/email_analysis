IMHO Tidy-master Raggett shouldn't put any more
development effort into the slide feature.  It's
cute but doing it right (IMHO again) would be a waste of time.

An XML/XSL slide package would be more appropriate
but slides are so presentational (no pun intended)
that they almost always need to be hand-tweaked,
which is sort-of anti-SGML.
