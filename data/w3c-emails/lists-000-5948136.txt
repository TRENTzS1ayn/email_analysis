You automatically replace "&nbsp;" with a regular space in many cases. If a
person goes to the trouble of entering a space as "&nbsp;" they probably
want it to stay that way (Unless they're Microsoft Office users, in which
case all bets are off). Since empty table cells are not rendered in
browsers, and other programs (Frontpage) remove "extraneous" spaces, it can
be quite inconvenient to use tidy with other editors. Could you make
replacing "&nbsp;" optional? Example follows.

Original:
-------
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD>&nbsp; </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
--------
Output:
--------
<table>
<tr>
<td> </td>
</tr>
</table>
--------
