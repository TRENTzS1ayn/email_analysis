Great tool!
tidy prints misleading error messages given the following:

<html>
<HEAD>
<TITLE>Tidy bug with unrecognized tag</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<body>
<table summary="tidy bug">
    <tr>
        <td>
            Main area.
            <br>
            <BOGUS_TAG>
                tidy treats the closing bogus tag below as a /td,
                and hence mistakenly complains about all the tags
                after it.
            </BOGUS_TAG>
            <hr>
            <FORM>
                <input type="submit">
            </FORM>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
</body>
</html>

Tidy (vers 30th November 1999) Parsing "/home/spage/junk/tidy_bug.html"
line 11 column 14 - Error: <bogus_tag> is not recognized!
line 11 column 14 - Warning: discarding unexpected <bogus_tag>
line 16 column 13 - Warning: <hr> isn't allowed in <tr> elements
line 17 column 13 - Warning: <form> isn't allowed in <tr> elements
line 20 column 9 - Warning: discarding unexpected </td>

The last three errors are misleading, we're still in the <td> element.

(I am using an HTML templating system that leaves its own tags in its
output.)
