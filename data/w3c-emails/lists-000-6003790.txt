Bonjour everyone,

I know we have badly (horribly) written files on our website
http://www.ffv.fr/

Occasionnaly, I tidy up some of them. But on the last one, Tidy
(included in HTML Kit build 288) stripped the HTML, HEAD and BODY
tags. Wow. I know the body tag has a bad link attribute, but is it
normal that Tidy suppressed the whole tag?

The file can be found at : http://asso.ffv.fr/apprendre/app_form_new.html

... yes, I know it needs tidying!

Merry Xmas and Happy new year!
