Dave Raggett,

Thank you for "Tidy".  I am using it with the editor Kedit for Windows.  I 
have added a Tool Button for Tidy, and a couple of macros to call Tidy, 
display the error file, and place the cursor at the offending point in the 
source file for each error or warning. (Man, I do make those errors!)

In the "Tidy (vers 13th January 2000)", there seems to be a problem in 
reporting the column number when there is a character code for the 
Microsoft Windows fonts in the range 128 - 159.  It is apparently reporting 
the beginning of the "clause" containing the character, rather than the 
character itself.

If this is a "feature" rather than a bug, I'd vote to alter the behavior so 
it points to the offending character.

Thanks for thing about this, and again for Tidy itself.

Here is a sample HTML, excepts from a conversion from Word2000 of a 
document by someone else, and the Tidy report from it.
