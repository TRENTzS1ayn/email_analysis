Hi

We are building an applet that needs to parse some html response pages from 
a server. This pages are dirty so we are plannig to use Java Tidy to clean 
up the code the applet receives (we can't modify the application that 
generates this pages).

There is lodsa javascript code into the comments in this pages (plenty of 
errors) and Tidy seems to inspect the comments so it stops at the parsing 
and doesn't even generate the DOM tree.

Is there no any way to disable the parsing into comments/scripts?

Tx in advance

When all else fails, declare yourself a portal and go home.
