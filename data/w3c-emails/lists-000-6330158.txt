Dave,

The backlog of Java tidy issues is growing a bit faster than I can
handle them.  Generally speaking, Java tidy is quite stable and
matches C tidy on a very high percentage of HTML documents.
However, there are more bug-finders than bug-fixers right now :-)

I was wondering if I could ask people to post them to this mailing list
so that I could increase the potential number of bug-fixers.  I would
be willing to approve and integrate bug fixes into the source code.
Maybe people could clearly indicate in the subject whether the issue
applies to Tidy, Java Tidy, or both.  Another idea would be to set up
another mailing list, but I don't think it's worth that at this point.

Regards,

Andy Quick
