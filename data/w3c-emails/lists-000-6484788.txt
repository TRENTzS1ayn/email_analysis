The ANSI C version of Tidy treats the contents of comments
and scripts as CDATA and preserves the text as is. Comments are
treated as special nodes in the tree, while script and style are
treated as regular CDATA elements.

I guess I am misunderstanding what is going wrong for you. Perhaps
you could send me some examples to make it clearer. Note that I
only maintain the C version and not the Java version of Tidy.
