The reason is that your content model for each of the elements
appears to be mixed. This inference is made when text occurs as
the immediate child of an element. Tidy won't indent the content
for elements with mixed content.

Perhaps this rule is too harsh? Another possibility would be
indent all element content for indent: yes and to apply the
current rule only for indent: auto

What do people think?
