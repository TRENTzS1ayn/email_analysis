Hello Dave,
I'm in the process of making the transition from HTML 3.2 to 4.0 on my website.  My home page (http://www.citicom.com/~jimmymac) is the first one to undergo the transition.

I ran your HTML Tidy utility on it and came up with the following:

line 20 column 2 - Warning: <style> isn't allowed in <body> elements
line 139 column 1 - Warning: expected "html PUBLIC" or "html SYSTEM"

It found a bunch of other errors that I corrected, but I'm stumped on these two, especially the last one.  I thought that "html PUBLIC" was introduced in the beginning, not the ending.

Any help would be greatly appreciated  -- please forgive my ignorance.

--Jim
