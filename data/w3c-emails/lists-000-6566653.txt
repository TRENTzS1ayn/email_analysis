I would just like to communicate my ideas regarding Java Tidy,
and my role in its development, for those of you new to this
list.

Java tidy is a port of Dave Raggett's HTML Tidy written in ANSI C.
C Tidy is the original Tidy, and should be regarded as the reference
version.  I implemented Tidy as a Java Bean, and I have
maintained it for the past year.  This has involved making it stable,
updating it as Dave has released updates of C Tidy, and adding
some support for DOM Level 1 interfaces so that Java Tidy can
be used as an HTML parser.

It should be made clear that I am responsible for the maintenance
of Java Tidy, not Dave Raggett.  So, please do not bother him
with Java Tidy questions.  I think we all very much appreciate
Dave's efforts on this very useful software tool for "real" HTML
parsing/pretty-printing.

Please use this list to report errors or enhancement requests for
Java Tidy. If the issue applies specifically to Java Tidy, please
clearly indicate that in the subject. I will endeavour to monitor this
list and maintain Java Tidy as best I can, given that I am not
financially supported for this work (and that is not my intention),
and so I cannot devote much of my time to it.  It is my hope that
people interested in the ongoing development of Java Tidy will
contribute by fixing bugs and providing source code.

Regards,

Andy Quick
