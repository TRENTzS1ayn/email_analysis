I didn't get that error.  Have you changed your page since posting?

This is apparently caused by the line break between the "PUBLIC" and the 
DTD.  Putting them on the same line eliminates the warning.  I suspect 
that's a problem with Tidy's parsing.

It is.  However, the Tidy warning comes at the end of the file presumably 
because it was looking for a DOCTYPE line and never found one it recognized 
(because of the parsing problem).  The error points to the end of the file, 
which is the point that Tidy concludes that you didn't have a recognizable 
DOCTYPE.
