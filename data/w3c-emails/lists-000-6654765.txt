It doesn't have to be alt="something".  It can be alt="" (nothing).

Tidy could possibly use a heuristic that keeps track of img srcs and
dimensions and note images where the same image is given, say, 3 or more
different sizes, and presuming they are resized transparent GIF references
and provide them with alt="" attributes automatically.  Especially if
height or width is 1.  I have an implementation of a compilation of such
data for a page, but alas that code isn't mine to share.

It is generally safe to assume that single-pixel height or width images are
either transparent or purely decorative and thus can be provided with
alt="" if an alt attribute is absent.  A boolean setting of
presume-resized-transparent=yes (or shorter setting) could theoretically be
used to control this presumption.

Anyone like this idea?
