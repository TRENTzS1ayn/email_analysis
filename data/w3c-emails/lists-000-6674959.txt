The browser lynx will provide [IMAGE] alt text for images which lack alt
text, and [LINK] when they are wrapped in anchors, which will get in the
way of screen readers, so even empty alt attributes have a purpose.
Additionally, the alt attribute is REQUIRED by HTML 4.x and XHTML, so they
MUST be there (preferably containing meaningful text, but only when the
image itself is meaningful).

Single-pixel.  And the file sizes for these have been known to be under 50
bytes, but it is impossible for a GIF to have a file length of one byte.

For images that actually serve a purpose (linked images), this would be
worse than nothing as it would make those links unnavigable by standard
configurations of lynx.  And with the prevalence of images containing text,
in many cases it is essential that the images have meaningful alt text.

I do understand though that HTML Tidy can be configured to provide a
user-defined string as alt text for images with no alt attributes.  That
should be sufficient for your purposes.

Tidy should not rely on its user to fix up mistakes it makes, lest the user
take the lazy route and do nothing at all.

That would result in an invalid HTML file.  You can't delete ("zap") the
alt attributes and still have a valid document.  A reading of the DTD alone
would show you that.

I hesitate to ask, but you do know that alt texts are for alternative text
to be displayed only when the image is not displayed, and not an
"explanation" (and not as tooltip text), right?  Sometimes the best
alternative for a meaningless image is an empty string.
