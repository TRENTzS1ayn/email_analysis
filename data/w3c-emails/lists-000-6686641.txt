OK, I'm with you so far (I think).

Um, now I'm lost.

Aside from that, I'd temporarily forgotten that the alt attribute was
required by HTML 4 and above; and I cheerfully admit to having never
done more than glanced at any DTD.  (OK, lock me in the stocks and pelt
me with eggs and rotten tomatos.)

Yes, of course, I knew that.  Just a typo.  Alzheimer strikes again,
sorry.

Yup, I know that (even though MS and Netscape seem not to); "explanation"
was my shorthand for this. Anyway, I don't mean a caption, which, browser
permitting, can I think be achieved with "title":

<img src="img/msie.gif" alt="MS Internet Explorer"
title="shameful attempt to earn money from you, dear reader" height=
[etc etc]>
