Dear Stanton McCandlish,

Tidy is acting properly, here. The SPAN element is, indeed, an inline
element. Since you are talking about HTML 4.01, in particular, you can
find the relevant information at <URL:
http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#h-7.5.4 >.

It's unfortunate for your purposes that the DIV element does commonly
cause a line break. But, considering that it is actually a block level
element, this does make some sense.

When I'm in a situation like yours, I generally use multiple inline
elements, one inside each block level element. This is unwieldy, but
technically correct. So, for example, each P block level element would
have its own SPAN inline element, since a SPAN element cannot contain P
block level elements.

The following example is easy to work with, but technically incorrect:
<SMALL><P>Paragraph 1</P><P>Paragraph 2</P></SMALL>

If we rework it, we have the correct:
<P><SMALL>Paragraph 1</SMALL></P><P><SMALL>Paragraph 2</SMALL></P>

If we rework your example in a similar way, we have:
<P><SPAN CLASS="x"><SPAN CLASS="y">text</SPAN></SPAN></P>

Question: Can you use style sheets to overcome the presentation problems
you're having with the DIV element? In fact, can't you set the display
property of the DIV element to inline, instead of block, so you do not
experience this problem? I think, the resulting CSS would be:
DIV ( display: inline )

(I haven't done much with style sheets, yet, so the above may not be
correct.)

Sincerely,
