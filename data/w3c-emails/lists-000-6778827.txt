I run Win98/32bit. My installed version of tidy doesn't run at all.
When I type: "tidy -help" or any other command, the cursor jumps to the
next row and nothing happens (Tidy gets automatically opened with the
Win98-programme "conagent.exe" (MSDOS-window, in MSDOS-mode Tidy can't
get opened)).

Anyone who will/can help me?
