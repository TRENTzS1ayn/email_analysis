To:"J. David Bryan"<jdbryan@acm.org>, HTML Tidy List<html-tidy@w3.org>

When Tidy (at least the January version, I did not yet get to test the new 
April version) is called with [--alt-text ''] (or with the line _alt-text: 
""_ in the config file), your example

<IMG SRC="fred.gif">

is tidied as:

<IMG ALT="" SRC="fred.gif">

Running Tidy (Jan 13, 2000) again on this result, you will get:

<IMG ALT="SRC=fred.gif">


Tidy chokes on its own empty attributes - interestingly it has no problem 
with empty ALT values, if the ALT apears as the last attribute of the IMG 
tag, right before the concluding ">".

I am going to try the new April version today, to see whether this bug got 
fixed...
