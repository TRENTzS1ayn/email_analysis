To: HTML Tidy List<html-tidy@w3.org>

After compilation and testing of the new tidy release (SuSE Linux 6.2), I 
have noticed following misbehaviours:

The commonnly found
<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
gets tidied to:
<FONT FACE="Arial," SANS-SERIF="">

Another example that I've seen quite often is
<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">
which is tidied to:
<FONT FACE="Comic" SANS="" MS="">


The other problem is the empty-ALT-attribute-on-IMG-tags issue:
<IMG SRC="logo.gif">
still gets tidied to
<IMG ALT="" SRC="logo.gif">
which is "tidied" to
<IMG ALT="SRC=logo.gif">


Could someone kindly direct me to where to look for the cause of these 
problems? I would very much like to contribute to Tidy, but I am kind of 
confused about where to get started.
I am no C guru, but so far I understood all the discussed patches, and I 
believe I would be able to fix this problem, if someone set me to the right 
path.
Many thanks.


Sebastian

PS: I am using Tidy to clean up HTML-Input in my chat 
(http://www.sl-chat.de/SL-Chat), does anybody have something like a 
"powered by Tidy" button or such?
