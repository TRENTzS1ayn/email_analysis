Hi Dave!

My Name is Chris Treisch and I am a consultant at CoreComm. We are very
interested in conforming to w3c standards, but we can not deploy Tidy for
ASP use, as it has issues with some ASP code. 

I know it is clearly documented about the --> value="<%=rs("varName")%>"
issue, but what are your plans in releasing a version that deals with these
issues a bit more gracefully? Any suggestions until then?

Also, what if our organization requires width, align and valign in <td>
tags? Any way to flag them?

I know you must be busy, but any feedback you have would be appreciated.

Do you know of any other w3c programs that help developers?

Thanks in advance for your time!
Chris Treisch
