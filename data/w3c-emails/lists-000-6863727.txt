If you ever get the time to let me know what my error is, that would be terrific, but I don't expect you to have time, so PLEASE dont feel in any way that I am asking you to do so!! =). I have been experimenting with Tidy and cannot figure out a way to prevent it from rendering my Javascript rollovers in all lower case (ie: onMouseOver becomes onmouseover). This crashes in IE (of course...) >:( . I am using Tidy in 1st Page 2000 and have tested this in the TidyGUI linked to from your page. I have not tested it with the Command Prompt version you offer, however.

Not certain that this is a bug or an avoidable aspect or my blind eyes ( a "big picture" mindset makes the fine print hard to read ... hmmm wondering if perhaps I have wasted a lot of money on programming training after all... )

Anywho, love the app, and my Postcard will be on the way um... soon!  ; ) For now, I am from Toronto Ont., CAN

Thanks for a marvellous app!
Marcus
