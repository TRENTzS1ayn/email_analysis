Hello Mikael, thanks for your reply.

yes. freshly compiled on a SuSE Linux 6.2 Distribution.

this is my syntax (tidy being called from within a perl script):

$tidiedMessage = `echo "$Message" | tidy30apr00 -f /dev/null -quiet -latin1 
--wrap 0 --wrap-attributes no --tidy-mark no --uppercase-tags yes 
--uppercase-attributes yes --alt-text '' --doctype '-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 
Transitional//EN' --quote-marks yes`;

I tried removing all the configuration directives, with no significant 
changes in the result.

with $Message = '<FONT FaCe="Comic Sans MS">test</A>', $tidiedMessage will be:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN">
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<TITLE></TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<FONT FACE="Comic" SANS="" MS="">test</FONT>
</BODY>
</HTML>

The irrelevant lines (doctype to body, /body to /html) are then 
automatically removed by my perl script, which leaves $tidiedMessage to be 
'<FONT FACE="Comic" SANS="" MS="">test</FONT>'.
Having this tidied again, turns $tidiedMessage into '<FONT FACE="Comic" 
SANS="MS=">test</FONT>' which then stays like that on subsequent tidy attempts.

Yes, but in my case, the correct version (with "'s) gets "tidied" to the 
worse... that's what's bothering me and what I'd like to fix somehow.

Well, I am not working on files, I am kind of "abusing" Tidy to work on 
strings that (may) contain HTML codes...
This way, I manage to have my chat page validate as HTML 4.0 Transitional, 
which makes it stand out among all other chat sites that allow the user to 
use HTML in their messages: 
http://validator.w3.org/check/referer?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sl-chat.de%2FSL-Chat

At least most of the times it validates, whenever it fails, I usually find 
a simple fix to eliminate the error (by parsing the messages before sending 
them to Tidy).

The only idea that I have now is to maybe try out using a config file 
instead of command line options, I'll try and look into that. Still, this 
misbehavior of Tidy needs to get fixed, and I am more than happy to 
contribute - if only I knew where to start.

Many thanks so far,

sebastian.
