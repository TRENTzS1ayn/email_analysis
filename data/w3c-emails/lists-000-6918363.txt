Marcus -- there should be absolutely no reason for IE to fail on lowercase
event names. What version of IE are you testing against? 
 
Feel free to send me the problem code privately if you like. 
 
cheers,

Subject: JavaScript Rollovers and Tidy (bug?)


If you ever get the time to let me know what my error is, that would be
terrific, but I don't expect you to have time, so PLEASE dont feel in any
way that I am asking you to do so!! =). I have been experimenting with Tidy
and cannot figure out a way to prevent it from rendering my Javascript
rollovers in all lower case (ie: onMouseOver becomes onmouseover). This
crashes in IE (of course...) >:( . I am using Tidy in 1st Page 2000 and have
tested this in the TidyGUI linked to from your page. I have not tested it
with the Command Prompt version you offer, however.
 
Not certain that this is a bug or an avoidable aspect or my blind eyes ( a
"big picture" mindset makes the fine print hard to read ... hmmm wondering
if perhaps I have wasted a lot of money on programming training after all...
)
 
Anywho, love the app, and my Postcard will be on the way um... soon! ; ) For
now, I am from Toronto Ont., CAN
 
Thanks for a marvellous app!
Marcus
