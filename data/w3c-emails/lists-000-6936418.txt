Sebastian, I'm interested in doing the exact same thing. More often than not I 
need to only parse portions of html rather than complete files. I was planning 
on working on a Perl script of my own but haven't had time yet. I'm no Perl 
guru, but if you are looking for help on your script and would like to share 
it, I'd be happy to poke around and see if I can help out. Feel free to 
contact me via direct e-mail or on the list...
