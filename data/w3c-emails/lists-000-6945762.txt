Reading from and writing to another process at the same time in Perl is a
real pain due to problems with buffering.  You can easily get into a
deadlock situation.  Your best bet with tidy is to probably use a temp file.
But having said that, if you're still really against it, look into the
IPC::Open2 and IPC::Open3 modules.  There's a good example of these in the
Perl Cookbook, recipes 16.8 and 16.9.
