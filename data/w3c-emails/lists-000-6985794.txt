Please try the following modifications to your tidy.cfg. I am not sure 
about the char-encoding: latin1, but the way I understand this, it should 
leave Czech special chars untouched....
Also, you had quote-nbsp set to "no", which of course was wrong.
quote-ampersand was misspelled and break-before-br should be set to no as 
otherwise you would always have a whitespace at the end of the line (in 
most common browsers at least).

I hope this helps....

Sebastian
