Hello,

I found an old thread about how to use tidy to clean up word 
htm but keep enough information.

I am doing it the following way:

Save from word as htm,
filter the file with 'filter' a command line version of htmfilter 
which can be downloaded from www.microsoft.com (look for 
'htmfilter ms word') this strips out the <o:p></o:p> tags which 
tidy does not like.
Then run tidy on it and end up with <p class ="MsoNormal" etc
Which is stuff I can work with.

Now the only problem that I need to solve is how can I run tidy 
from within a VbScript so it's out putgoes to a file and not to the
 DOS window 

Hope this helps,

Gerrit Kuilder
