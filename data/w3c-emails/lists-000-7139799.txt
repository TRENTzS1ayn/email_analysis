Hello Andre,

I for one would appreciate it, I am still struggling with the output of
tidy going to a doswindow instead of the file I want it in and being
able to use it as oTidy.tidy(configfile,filein,fileout) or
fileout=oTidy(configfile,filein) would make at least my life a lot
easier.

Regards,

Gerrit Kuilder
