Hi Dave,

I have been using tidy for a few months (java), and I think your tool is
great. I have experienced problem using thidy with word 2000. The
problem is that all the images dissapear. If you want I can attach the
html generated by word 2000 and all the image files.
I will fix the html my self, but I felt it would be nice to tell you
about this.
Keep up the good work,

Regards,

Greg.
