Hmmm...I cannot reproduce this.  I cut your original HTML text from your 
message and pasted it into a file.  Running the latest version of Tidy 
(30th April 2000) with its default options produces the correct output.  I 
also succeeded with the "-indent" option.

What version and commandline options are you using?
