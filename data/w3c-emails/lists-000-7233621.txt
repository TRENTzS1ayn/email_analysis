Hello,
       As I understand, Tidy validates the HTML file and would fix the
mistakes ,if any in the HTML file.  
The following HTML code which has no end
anchor tags,is given as input to Tidy. It has put the missing end anchor
tags in the output but misplaced them. 

The following HTML code is given as input to tidy

<HTML>
<BODY>
<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com"> This is a link to yahoo page
<A HREF="home.htm"> This is a link to a file
</BODY>
</HTML>


The output got from tidy 
 
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html>
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
<body>
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com"> This is a link to yahoo page <a
href="home.htm"> This is a link to a file</a></a>
</body>
</html>
 

      In the output, the end anchor tags were put at the wrong place.The
actual output should be
     <a href="http://www.yahoo.com"> This is a link to yahoo page </a>
     <a href="home.htm"> This is a link to a file</a>

Could anyone tell me, how to solve this problem...


Thanx in Advance,
Reddy.
