Hello Dave,
Dear List Members,


here is the announced script for calling tidy from your perl scripts.
Feel free to send me your questions, comments, flames....


Pete, maybe you could have a look and eventually help out a bit with the 
comments in the source? I tried the best I could, but I kind of think 
different than other people... ;-)

Dave, if you like it, you can post it on the Tidy site... if you prefer to 
set a link, I will create a site for it and tell you the URL, let me know, 
please.


Many thanks to everyone who gave me support on this.
