If this is a problem -- and I suppose that yes, it might impede
legibility -- then I'd just run Tidy's output through some filter. 
Being too lazy to do any programming, I don't use perl myself, but I'd
guess that such a perl routine would be easy to write.  The program I
use is the underpublicized and pricy but excellent shareware SNR; it's
easy to write a translation table that for example adds two line breaks
to the middle of any example of "--><!--".
