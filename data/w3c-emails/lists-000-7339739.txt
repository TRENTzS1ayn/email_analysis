A quick thought about Tidy and server side processing:

Server side processing _produces_ HTML.

Just because your source pages look like HTML, doesn't mean it should
validate - It's not HTML! Tidy correctly *balks* at non-HTML tags (the sever
side processing tags) - that's its job!

I realised long ago (using Tidy on my PHP pages) that it makes more sense to
validate the files which your server side processing produces.  Even though
my PHP source pages validated, the output (due to my dodgy code) didn't.

IMHO, I'm starting to think that it is becoming an increasing burden on the
continuing development of Tidy.  Dave (and the others activily involved in
the development of Tidy) have to continually re-write good code to bend the
rules to allow server tags to validate which will never apear in the
finished document.

I've probably not explained this as well as I could, but hopefully you'll
get my point.

Keep up the excellent work Dave.
