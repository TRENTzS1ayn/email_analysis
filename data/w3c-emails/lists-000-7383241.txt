I agree fully and strongly. The only place where it makes
any sense to worry about HTML correctness and validity is
in the final output. The code residing at the server could
be anything (C code, perl script, ASP, PHP, a human typing
away at lightning speed...) - it doesn't matter if that
is in any way valid according to HTML rules. But the output, 
the thing seen by the clients, must be correct and valid.

Most of the time it's quite feasible to feed the server
output to Tidy. That's what I do when I check my ASP or 
perl code.

So, it might be nice if some non-HTML code (ASP, PHP...)
could be validated as such, but in the long run it's 
nothing to vaste development resources on.
