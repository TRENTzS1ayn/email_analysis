Actually Tidy does change my doctype if I set "doctype: auto" in
the config file. But the error of seeing the use of "div" as
transitional remains.

Furthermore "doctype: strict" is really weird. If I set this option,
Tidy sees that the following is Transitional, because of the
use of a center element, but it does not correct the mistake, nor
does it give any warning:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<title>Test</title>
</head>
<body>

<center>
Hi, Tidy! What am I?
</center>

</body>
</html>

Thus because of an option that would seem to enforce a strict
regime and extra pedantic behaviour, Tidy is actually made to
output bad XHTML!

The option "clean: no" is also necessary for this to happen.
Perhaps the combination of "doctype: strict" and "clean: no"
ties Tidy's hands, but at least it should issue a warning that
the output is not correct XHTML. Instead I get "no warnings or 
errors were found".
