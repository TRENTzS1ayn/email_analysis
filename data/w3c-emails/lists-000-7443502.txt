Hello,

I am running the Java version of HtmlTidy.  When the Html input looks
like the one below , Tidy replaces the ^M with nothing, resulting in two
separate words being combined (see Tidy output below also).  I do not
know what product was used to create the offending Html.  I tried
setting Word2000 and Clean to yes, but there was no change.  Is there
anything I can configure to make Tidy substitute a space for the ^M?

Thanks,
Bernice
