They aren't broken.  It is the browser's duty to convert "&amp;" to "&"
before submission to the server.

If search engines accepted ";" as an alternative to "&" as recommended by
the specification, the need to encode "&" as "&amp;" in HREF attributes
would be eliminated.  (I note that Lycos doesn't yet allow this
substitution, hint hint.)
