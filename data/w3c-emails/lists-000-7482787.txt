The application I am writing runs tidy and then programmatically extracts the
hrefs from the resulting tidied document and spiders those hrefs. The spider was
not replacing &amp; with & before sending the http request. I will do the
replacement inside the spider library. I just assumed that urls within hrefs
would be exactly the same after running jtidy.

The querystring sent by a browser will have had the "&amp;"
interpreted into "&".
