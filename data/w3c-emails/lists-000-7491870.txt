The best course for such dilemmas is to run the HTML in question through a
validator.  You can use the W3C's validator or (my favorite)
www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator  ...  in either case, it would tell you that
naked ampersands (i.e., not escaped as &amp;) are not OK, either in URLs or
anywhere else.  A validator is analogous a final spelling checker.  It's good to
run a document through a validator, even if it's been "Tidied".  Tidy is good,
but the validator is the ultimate test.
