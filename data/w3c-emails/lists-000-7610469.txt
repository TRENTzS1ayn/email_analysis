I assume that you mean the character 0x0D (ie. '\r') when
you say "^M" because tidy processes "^M" like text.
The line end character for HTML/XML is 0x0A ('\n').  Tidy
strips out control characters (other than '\t' and '\n') from
the input stream.  There is no option to treat '\r' like white
space or line-end.

I suggest that you either preprocess your HTML, or put a
hack in StreamInImpl.readChar.
