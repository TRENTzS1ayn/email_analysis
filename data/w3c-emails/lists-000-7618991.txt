Actually it is 0x0D0x0A (CRLF, "\r\n").  Or, more specifically, CRLF is
preferred, but you can have CR or LF alone delimit end of line, but
whichever one you use, you MUST be consistent throughout the entire
document.  (This is an HTTP requirement for the requested document body.)

That would be an error then.  Tidy should treat CR, LF, and CRLF as
equivalent and normalize the document to whichever is appropriate for the
platform on which it was compiled or, if indeterminate, to CRLF.
