Hi,

I use the attached Perl script to post-process Tidy's output to do exactly 
what you guys want. It also does some other handy things. It's a filtering 
wrapper that runs Tidy on your input, then fine-tunes/strips things from it's 
output depending on which options you specify. Run it from the command line; 
it's usage basically mimics Tidy's. By default, unless you specify options it 
simply returns Tidy's output the same as if you ran Tidy directly. I run it 
with -s option to cleanup HTML fragments that get put into my server-side apps.

Comments within the script should explain it pretty clearly; if not feel free 
to contact me. Note: I use it under Linux/Unix and I have no clue if it works 
on anything else.
