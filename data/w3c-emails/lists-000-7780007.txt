Has anyone successfully used JTidy's XML/XHTML output with Sun's ProjectX
XML parser?  Or for that matter, has anyone been successful in using JTidy's
XML/XHTML output with *any* SAX based parser?

ProjectX is based around the SAX parser.  I am running into a problem where
I am getting a SAX exception:

[[org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: Missing whitespace before SYSTEM literal
URI.]]

from the following JTidy output:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<meta name="generator" content="HTML Tidy, see www.w3.org" />


The output seems to be valid.  The error doesn't seem to make sense.  Any
suggestions?
