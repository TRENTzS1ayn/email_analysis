The Java Tidy manifest file has two issues, both related.

1. There is no blank line before the class entry. User-specified manifest
file entries must be preceeded
by a blank line; otherwise, the first section of the manifest is taken as
additional name/value pairs for
the mainifest file's main header.

2. Running the command-line version of JTidy could be simplified by adding
to the mainfest file's
main header the following: "Main-Class: org.w3c.Tidy.Tidy", followed by a
blank line.  Then,
you can run Jtidy by doing "java -jar Tidy.jar"

Here is my proposed new lib/mainfest.txt file for JTidy:

Main-Class: org.w3c.tidy.Tidy

Name: org/w3c/tidy/Tidy.class
Java-Bean: True
