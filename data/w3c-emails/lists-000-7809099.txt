Hi,

This is the original:

<DL>
<A HREF="#BookI1"><DT>Item1<DD>This is Item1</A>
<A HREF="#BookI2"><DT>Item2<DD>This is Item2</A>
</DL>

This is what Tidy says:

line 11 column 1 - Warning: missing <dd>
line 11 column 19 - Warning: missing </a> before <dt>
line 11 column 45 - Warning: discarding unexpected </a>
line 12 column 19 - Warning: missing </a> before <dt>
line 12 column 45 - Warning: discarding unexpected </a>
line 17 column 15 - Warning: missing </a> before <p>
line 19 column 13 - Warning: discarding unexpected </a>

This is was Tidy produces:

<DL>
<DD><A HREF="#BookI1"></A></DD>

<DT>Item1</DT>

<DD>This is Item1 <A HREF="#BookI2"></A></DD>

<DT>Item2</DT>

<DD>This is Item2</DD>
</DL>

I really wanted the complete DT/DD-Pair to be a link... The same is true if
two (or more paragraphs <P>) are contained within one link. I think that
tidy should not bother about the contents of a link (<SPAN>, <I> etc are yet
accepted) and accept allthing within. Only when missing the correspondig
</A>-Tag tidy should report an error, and when a very long link is included
it should only report a warning (best if you trigger size and occurence of
this warning with an option - eg. "href-length: number" where
"href-length:0" disables this warning, other numbers set the upper
threshhold before warnings).

And - because I'm just writing to you - a nice-to-have:
I prefer to have no empty line between DT/DL (before DT it's ok), so I can
see better the corresponding pairs in long DLs. Can you add a option to
suppress this? Or (best-to-have :-)) options to control the insertion of
linefeeds before/after each arbitray tag. The above example I would manually
tidy to:

<DL>

<A HREF="#BookI1">
<DT>Item1</DT>
<DD>This is Item1</DD>
</A>

<A HREF="#BookI2">
<DT>Item2</DT>
<DD>This is Item2</DD>
</A>

</DL>

and really would like to let Tidy do this for me...

BTM: I have the latest Version "released on 30th April 2000" running on
Win-NT together with NoteTab 4.82.

Thanks in advance for your efforts!
