At  < http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#docconf >

they show the Doc Type for XHTML 1.0 Transitional to be:

<!DOCTYPE html 
                       PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
                       "DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

but when I use HTML Tidy (as part of HTML-Kit) to convert a document to XHTML 
1.0 Transitional, it shows the DOC Type should be:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

Which is correct?

(Also, Netscape 2.0 doesn't know what to do with the <?xml version="1.0"?>
It shows it at the top of the page and doesn't hide it.)
