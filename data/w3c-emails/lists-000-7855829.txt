With the BBEdit plug-in, there are problems at times with the special
characters. For example, while the "err" document will correctly report an
incorrect character (&agrave;), the fix in the "out" document will be
something like &amp;cedil; instead of &amp;agrave;. Other than that, this is
a great product; keep up the good work!
