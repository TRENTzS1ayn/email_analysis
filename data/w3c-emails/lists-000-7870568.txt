Dear Dave Raggett,

I have recently downloaded the free software 1stPage 2.0 and am mostly
using the automatic source formatting.

Unfortunately, any single & is translated into &mp instead of &amp, so
documents which contain these characters are messed up.

The program said to report bugs to you, I hope you are the right person to
contact.

Otherwise I really like the product.

Best regards,

Gernot Guenther
