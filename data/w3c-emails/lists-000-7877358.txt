There certainly are commercial products such as RoboHELP (from
EHelp.com) and ForeHELP that will take in web pages and hierarchies and
turn them into compiled HTML Help (.chm). They are not for the light of
wallet, but they do work. Microsoft offers their "free" HTML Help
Workshop
(<http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/tools/htmlhelp/chm/hh1start.htm> ),
but it requires a lot of extra work to use that productively.
