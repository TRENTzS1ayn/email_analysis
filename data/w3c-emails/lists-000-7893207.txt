Okay, maybe I can explain it by showing the process that Tidy goes through
correcting each error.

You started with:

<table>
<caption align="top"><h1>indhold</h1></caption>

and presumably some other table content following it.  After each error
I'll illustrate what Tidy does by reprinting the markup as edited, with a +
to indicate where Tidy is in the parsing.

Just before the first error, you have:

<table>
<caption align="top">
+
<h1>indhold</h1></caption>

>line 14 column 23 - Warning: missing </caption> before <h1>

Because:

<!ELEMENT CAPTION  - - (%inline;)*     -- table caption -->

and H1 is not an element of %inline;.  This implies closure of the caption.

<table>
<caption align="top">
</caption>
+
<h1>indhold</h1></caption>

>line 14 column 23 - Warning: trimming empty <caption>

<table>
+
<h1>indhold</h1></caption>

>line 14 column 23 - Warning: <h1> isn't allowed in <table> elements

Tidy moves unexpected content in a table to occur before the table.

<h1>
<table>
+
indhold</h1></caption>

>line 14 column 27 - Warning: plain text isn't allowed in <table> elements

<h1>
indhold
<table>
+
</h1></caption>

>line 14 column 34 - Warning: </h1> isn't allowed in <table> elements

<h1>
indhold
</h1>
<table>
+
</h1></caption>

Some internal knowledge is needed here.  Tidy doesn't really keep track of
end tags when building its internal document tree.  That information is
derivable directly from the structure.  The </h1> isn't really
moved/copied.  Similarly for the </caption> above.

>line 14 column 34 - Warning: trimming empty <table>
>line 14 column 34 - Warning: discarding unexpected </h1>

This is a combination error.  It parsed the table, so it's in the document
tree, but it encountered a closing tag that isn't open.  This appears to
have implied to Tidy internally that the table has closed structurally,
resulting in what it sees as a table with no children

<h1>
indhold
</h1>
<table>
</table>
+
</caption>


<h1>
indhold
</h1>
+
</caption>

>line 14 column 39 - Warning: </caption> isn't allowed in <body> elements
>line 14 column 39 - Warning: inserting implicit <table>

<h1>
indhold
</h1>
<table>
+
</caption>

>line 14 column 39 - Warning: discarding unexpected </caption>

<h1>indhold</h1>
<table>
+

And then it will go on to parse the rest of the table.

Solution:  don't put H1 inside CAPTION; it can't go there.
