How consistent?  There may be problems if they're not consistently legal
BODY content, such as a series of table rows without a TABLE tag.

You might be able to get by by putting a comment "cut line" at the start
and end of your snippet, running Tidy, and then extracting only the parts
between those comments for your fragment file.  The instances where your
fragment's content could slip out of those section-delimiting comments are
limited.

Tidy could have an option added to automatically insert such markers in the
document, note their positions, tidy the document as if it were complete
(but suppressing errors occurring outside the markers), then only output
the text between the markers.
