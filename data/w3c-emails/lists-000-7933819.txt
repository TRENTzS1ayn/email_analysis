I can confirm that I can reproduce this problem with the Mac OS version of
Tidy. Here is the error output :

MacTidy (vers 30th April 2000) Parsing "Boot:PageTemp.html"
line 1 column 1 - Warning: inserting missing 'title' element
line 3 column 1 - Warning: <title> isn't allowed in <body> elements
line 5 column 1 - Warning: <body> isn't allowed in <body> elements
line 6 column 5 - Warning: <center> isn't allowed in <h1> elements
line 6 column 50 - Warning: discarding unexpected </center>
line 9 column 1 - Warning: discarding unexpected </ul>
line 26 column 1 - Warning: trimming empty <p>
line 35 column 92 - Warning: missing </a> before <option>
line 35 column 92 - Warning: missing <li>
line 35 column 92 - Warning: missing <li>
line 35 column 92 - Warning: missing <li>
... ad infinitum

Line 35 is :

<LI> <A HREF="http://www.lib.uconn.edu/ArchNet/">ArchNet (Virtual library
for archaeology)<OPTION></A><P>

You have a bogus <OPTION> tag that is causing the problem (adding an
</OPTION> end tag, inside or outside the </A> won't help).

Still, this is another case of a looping bug that ought to be fixed if
possible in Tidy.
