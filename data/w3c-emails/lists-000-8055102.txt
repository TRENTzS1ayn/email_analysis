Hi all.

I have caught my copy of Microsoft Frontpage 98 sticking the anchor tags
outside the header block on occasion when I tried placing a hyperlink or an
<a name=> tag in a heading.  I figured this was the kind of stupid mistake
Tidy would sort out, but, instead, the program has been eating my anchor
tags for breakfast.  Can Tidy be made to fix this kind of nesting bug while
preserving the anchor tag with the nesting corrected?

While I'm at it, I'm using the console-mode executable version of Tidy that
was compiled for use under 32-bit Windows.  I downloaded the program from
the W3C web site last week.  The error file generated by Tidy gives a
program date in January of 2000.  Isn't the current version of Tidy supposed
to be from April? Is this just a failure to update the date info in the
file? or should I be downloading the source code and compiling it instead of
using the pre-compiled executable posted at the W3C web site?

Thanks,
Jerry Weichbrodt
