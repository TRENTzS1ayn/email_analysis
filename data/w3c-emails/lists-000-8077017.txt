No, td is a table tag only legal inside tr.  It is not legal inside form,
and form is not legal inside tr.

But it is legal to have more than one form in a table, but it isn't legal
to have a form within a form in any way.  You can't even do it with the
ins/del tags.  To do that you'd have to either split or nest tables, and
that would require a whole lot of code just to analyze the table structure
so you'd know how to split it.

Better to have it obviously broken than to make it look deceptively correct
and submitting the wrong fields to the wrong form.  Only if the form is the
only form in the entire table can you make it encompass the entire table,
else Tidy must either reduce its scope to just the td or refuse to do any
more parsing until the user corrects the problem manually.  That could be
reduced by checking to see if there are other formctrl elements that can't
be moved (non-<input type="hidden">) which would be disenfranchised by a
reduction of scope.

This is complicated by the fact that it is legal to have formctrl elements
outside of a form, yet certain browsers don't support their use outside of
forms.
