I have an XML document with embedded HTML tags that I want to correct (make
lower-case) in order to be a correct XHTML document.  Tidy does not appear
to make the HTML tags lower case as I would have guessed.  If I copy out the
HTML section and remove the XML tags from around the HTML's Input elements,
then run tidy on it, it makes the tags lower case.  

I've tried several different configuration options but none seem to force
tidy to make the HTML tags lower-case.  Here's how I thought I should have
been able to call it:

tidy --input-xml yes --output-xml yes --output-xhtml yes --add-xml-decl yes
--assume-xml-procins yes file.xml

Here is a portion of the document I was hoping to fix

<sec3c>
<INPUT type="text" name="sec3c" rows="5" />
</sec3c>

I was hoping it would correct it to:

<sec3c>
<input type="text" name="sec3c" rows="5" />
</sec3c>

What am I missing?
