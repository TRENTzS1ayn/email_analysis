Dear Mr. Dave Raggett,

I downloaded your 'html-tidy' application for linux, and it is really great 
by the way. But I could not find a .deb-package, so I created one out of 
the .rpm. Would you be interested in having that package among the 
downloads as well ?

Yours sincerely,
         Torgeir Hoffmann
