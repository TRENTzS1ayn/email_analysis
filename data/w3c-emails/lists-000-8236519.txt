JTidy seems to be converting &cent to the actual "cent" symbol during
conversion.  This is causing my XML parsers (JAXP and JClark's XP) to scream
real loud and smack me (they throw errors)!!!  Since the "cent" symbol is an
escape character, shouldn't JTidy be representing it as &cent instead?

Thanks for the feedback,
Scott
