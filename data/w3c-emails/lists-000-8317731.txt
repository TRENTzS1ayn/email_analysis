Dave:

I have just downloaded and am playing with your BBTidy plug-in. While 
I sure I could eventually suggest a couple of things I would like to 
see incorporated, the main thing I want to comment on is "Force 
Uppercase Tags".

Seems it does not force the entire tag to upper case, but skips over words:

Before:  <font size=+1>
After : <FONT size=+1>

Also <TABLE width="450">
Also <TR align="CENTER">
Also <FONT face="GENEVA,HELVETICA,ARIAL" size="-1">

Next Item:

Performing Tidy on a selected section of the document is nice, but 
somewhat annoying when it inserts this stuff at the beginning of the 
tidied selection:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN">
     <META name="generator" content="HTML Tidy, see www.w3.org">
     <TITLE></TITLE>

I am using BBEdit Lite 4.6 on a PowerMac 7200 (OS 7.6.1).

Matt
