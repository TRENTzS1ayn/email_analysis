I've experienced the problem with the DOCTYPE in XML as well.  If it
helps, I observe the problem with the Nov 30 1999 version of tidy, but the
July 26 1999 version does not have this problem.

Example:
fas% lwp-request http://www.news.perl.org/perl-news-short.rdf 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
 
<!DOCTYPE rss PUBLIC "-//Netscape Communications//DTD RSS 0.91//EN"
            "http://my.netscape.com/publish/formats/rss-0.91.dtd">
 
<rss version="0.91">
 
<channel>
<title>Perl News</title>
<link>http://www.news.perl.org/</link>

[...cut...]

Example of Tidy processing:
fas% lwp-requesthttp://www.news.perl.org/perl-news-short.rdf | tidy -xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE rss PUBLIC "-//Netscape Communications//DTD RSS 0.91//EN"
"http://my.netscape.com/publish/formats/rss-0.91.dtd">

Unfortunately, I need the line in there.  I could remove it, run it through tidy, and then put it back in, but I'd really prefer not to do that if I don't have to.  I'm hoping I'm missing some config option or something, but I couldn't find it if I am.  Anyway, here's what the beginning of the source file looks like:
