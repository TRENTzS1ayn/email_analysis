The formal grammar for HTML is defined by the HTML specifications,
see http://www.w3.org/MarkUp. Unfortunately, a great many documents
and document generation tools don't conform to these specifications.
Tidy is a kind of expert system that knows lots of rules for fixing
up real-world html with a pretty printer for outputting the result.
The code uses tables for tags and attributes to invoke the
appropriate processing methods, but the complexities of the problems
it has to deal with preclude a description of the parser using BNF.
