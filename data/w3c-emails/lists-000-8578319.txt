... thinks it's in BODY instead.

Running HTML below thru Win32 Tidy:

<html>
<head>
<title>test</title>
<object id="asd" classid="asdasd"></object>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

gives:

Tidy (vers 13th January 2000) Parsing console input <stdin>
line 6 column 1 - Warning: </head> isn't allowed in <body> elements
line 7 column 2 - Warning: <body> isn't allowed in <body> elements

"stdin" appears to be HTML proprietary
2 warnings/errors were found!

From
<http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/struct/objects.html#h-13.3>:

The OBJECT element may also appear in the content of the HEAD element
