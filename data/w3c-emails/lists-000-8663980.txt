This is indeed illegal. The simplest fix is to move the script into
the table cell. You could also rewrite your script to avoid the
processing error.

Tidy isn't smart as a human and doesn't have enough common sense to
"know" that this is a good thing to do. For instance, it doesn't
understand hardly anything about JavaScript.
