I've built a Web Page with Netscape Composer, and am now trying to use
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/ to learn to understand the HTML I've
generated, so please excuse my lack of the precise jargon in the HTML
area.

The URL of my offending Web Page is:
http://www.xmission.com/~benfolks/Resume.html

I've include a map, generated by MSN's expedia, as a link from my postal
address to let people know how to drive to me: 

<a
href="http://maps.expedia.com/QMResults.asp?Region=244&street=2566+Blaine+Ave&city=Salt+Lake+City&state=UT&zip=84108&place=&A=16&Lat=40.731892&Long=-111.817237&Tab=1&L=USA0409">2566
Blaine Avenue</a>

When I ask TIDY to analyze my HTML, it issues messages complaining about
every appearance of '&' in the link, looking like this:
line 36 column 62 - Warning: unescaped & or unknown entity "&street"

Is this a problem in TIDY, or is this kind of parameter passing outside
the scope of HTML?
