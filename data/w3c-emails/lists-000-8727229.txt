The W3C Validator does this, although maybe not in a very warm fuzzy way. It 
is much easier to pinpoint and correct errors if the "Show Source Input" 
block is checked.  Not all Validators are up to date - in concert with - 
valid HTML standards or use correct DTD's (Document Type Descriptions). IMHO 
an excellent primer regarding Validators can be found at:

All Things Web - Understanding HTML Validation

http://pantos.org/atw/h-valid.html  

There are clickable hyperlinks to validation tools (via logos) on the pages 
of the mini-site listed in my signature block.  Without wishing to appear 
self-serving, I ask those interested to visit the "Standards Now" and 
"Campaign for a non-Browser specific WWW" (also has excellent information 
regarding Validation) web pages.
