Hi:
can someone point me to a document (document portion) or an article
which clearly defines the rules for treatment of white-space and
new-line characters within the HTML source ? Including the
rules for using entities such as &nbsp;
 
All my HTML books seem to be really vague about this subject, and
I am probably stupid 'cause I don't see how to get this info from the
DTDs.
