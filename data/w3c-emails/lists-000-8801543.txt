Inasmuch as I am retired and therefor have lots of "play time" on my hands, I 
decided to convert all of my existing web pages (78) from existing HTML 
4.0/4.01 to XHTML 1.0 (although I have retained copies in the HTML iterations 
in case I want to revert).  I did this for there seems to be no doubt that 
XHTML will soon be adopted as the defacto web authoring language in order to 
accommodate the various wireless/handheld device Browsers that will soon be 
forthcoming. The DTD's for XHTML 1.0 are now available for Validation on the 
W3C page (I provide a clickable hyperlink on the Validation page of my 
mini-site in my signature block).  Of course the current iteration of XHTML 
1.0 is at present only a proposed recommendation of W3C (the usual Caveats 
apply), but I believe the eventual form and substance will not differ too 
much - if the DTD's change somewhat, I will adjust my coding.

In any event, I have validated all of my pages as XHTML 1.0 in the W3C HTML 
validator, the W3C Cascading Style Sheet validator and the XML.com (RUWF - R 
U Well Formed?) validator (again, I have provided a hyperlink to this 
facility on the Validation page of my mini-site).

The point of all this is that I used TIDY to convert all of my web pages to 
XML/XHTML - solely - I just ran 'em through with nary a hitch! (Of course, I 
had previously validated the HTML code).  

So far I have checked my XHTML 1.0 pages in the following Browsers, where 
they perform/display as designed:

MS Internet Explorer ver 5.0
MS Internet Explorer ver 4.0, 4.x
Netscape Navigator 4.x
Opera 3.60
Web TV 2.0
Lynx 2.7, 2.8
Amaya 2.2
OBR (Optical Braille Recognition)
 
Thanks Dave Raggett!
