Thanks for the reply. I've been experimenting with Tidy, trying to find a 
work-around to make Tidy treat comments the same as block level tags.

I manage a state government web site where a number of authors (with 
varying levels of html skills) should be editing the files. I've designed 
templates for people to use that have lots of comments describing the 
structure of the documents for instance:

<!-- paste text here -->
or
<!-- header starts here do not edit -->

When I happened upon HTML Tidy (in the latest version of Homesite) is 
seemed to me to be a great way for us to maintain a reasonably consistent 
style and layout control across a group of authors.

However before I can use it as a management tool it will be essential for 
Tidy to leave the all important comments alone. The Homesite GUI for tidy 
really helps for those authors who are not comfortable working with Tidy at 
the command line level in a DOS window

Of course I could always remove all my comments, and apply the Dilbert 
principle where lack of documentation is a serious job security strategy :-)

Regards, Steve
