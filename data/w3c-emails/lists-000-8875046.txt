To:html-tidy@w3.org

Given then following bit of (broken) HTML, tidy produces a rather
interesting result...

<pre><TT><P>Text</TT></pre>More text

(Linebreaking, and other markup, isn't necessary to demonstrate the problem,
 so I've excluded it)

Tidy produces HTML which contains "More text" in <tt> tags, and does so for
all text until the end of the document.

Unfortunately, latex2html uses the above construct fairly often. I've
verified the problem in the 13/01/2000 release.

Cheers,

Simon.
