Try something like this:

  copy in\*.txt out
  cd out
  for %%f in ( *.txt ) do html-tity -m %%f

It's been a long time since I did DOS; you may have to tweak the
above
to get it to work. Specifically, note that the following DOESN'T
work:

  cd in
  for %%f in ( *.txt ) do html-tidy %%f >..\out\%%f

because the redirect is evaluated once for the entire "for..."
command,
not once for each file.

In rough order of preference (which incidentally is the order they
came
to mind):

* Get the solaris stuff working. :-)
* Get bash/perl/sed/etc. for NT.
* Install a small Linux on the NT box and use
tidy/bash/perl/sed/etc.
  (but this requires turning your NT box into a dual boot machine
and
   the down time my be unacceptable.)
* Write something in Visual Basic to filter the files as needed.

Good Luck,
