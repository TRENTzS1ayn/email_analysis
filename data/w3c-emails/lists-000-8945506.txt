Hi Dave,

Back in December Dan Kohn requested you include a Meta 
Generator tag in Tidy's output, and you replied:

> ...It would need to be modified slightly, since href is not an
> allowed attribute for meta.

There was universal approval to the idea in this list, and I'm 
pleased to see that the 13th January version incorporates a simpler 
version of what Dan suggested:

<META NAME="generator" CONTENT="HTML Tidy, see www.w3.org">

Would there be advantage in including the version number (and release date)?


I see that the W3C's own front page has a couple of Meta tags with 
full URI references, for example:

>   <META http-equiv="PICS-Label" content='(PICS-1.1
> "http://www.classify.org/safesurf/" l gen true for "http://www.w3.org"     by
> "philipd@w3.org" r (SS~~000 1 SS~~100 1))'>

Is this valid, thus somewhat contradicting your original statement, 
or has the W3C webmaster got it wrong? :-)


Incidentally, Tidy replaces the double-quite marks in the second and 
third lines of the above example by &quot; - is that correct?


Regards,

Peter Vince
