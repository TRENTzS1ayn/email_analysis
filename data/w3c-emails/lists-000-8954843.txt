I'd say it may be possible.  However, the only "version" number we have is
the latest release date.  However, I recommend that the reporting of
software and version be done in a manner akin to the syntax for User-Agent,
i.e. product/version (comment):  CONTENT="HTML-Tidy/13jan00
(http://www.w3.org/)" (though I'd prefer HTML-Tidy/2000-01-13 barring an
actual version number, partly because it is a nice unambiguous date format
and that, well, two-digit years are evil).

Using an HTTP-EQUIV="User-Agent" META tag would not be proper since that
header is already used by the server and HTML-Tidy isn't a User-Agent in
that sense.

Those aren't HREF attributes, but merely CDATA text including in part URL
syntax.  There's nothing preventing having http:// in the generator META
tag, except maybe avoiding confusion that URLs have any meaning in HTML in
such places.

Um, it's not _incorrect_ (in that it is also not incorrect to replace every
character in that or any other attribute value with numerical character
references) but it is unnecessary and possibly troublesome for PICS
interpreters.  (They should be able to handle the &quot;s, but perhaps HTML
Tidy should avoid converting " to &quot; when ' is used to quote the
attribute value (which is legal).  I haven't checked, but it may also need
to include a check to translate ' to &#39; when ' is used to quote an
attribute.
