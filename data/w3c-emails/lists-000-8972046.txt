    Further to my report of 22 January, it appears that the reason Tidy 
wraps when it shouldn't is a problem in lines 682-683 of "pprint.c":

  else if (!attr->dict->nowrap || WrapAttVals)
      wrappable = yes;

If I understand this correctly, it means that wrapping of attributes is 
performed if the internal "wrapping is prohibited" flag is not set or the 
user has asked for wrapping.  However, I think the logic should be that 
wrapping is performed if the internal "wrapping is prohibited" flag is not 
set AND the user has asked for wrapping.  In other words, if the user says, 
"don't wrap," then wrapping should not be allowed.

I think this change fixes the problem:

  else if (!attr->dict->nowrap && WrapAttVals)
      wrappable = yes;
