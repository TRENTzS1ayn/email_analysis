Actually, this has nothing to do with Tidy but with the language.
heading elements are nothing but paragraph like elements with default
display options (sort of shortcuts) . They don't have nor implicit neither
explicit hierarchy. 
They could be replaced by something like
<p class="heading1">, the class being processed at display by CSS (for
example)
So, you can't include a paragraph in a paragrah and you can't include a
header in a header.
Another way to solve this would be to use div elements and display header
in a
way according to the depth of the inclusion (using CSS).

<div>
  <p class="heading">Heading 1</p>
  <div>
    <p class="heading">Heading 2/</p>
    ........
  </div>
</div>

CSS :
/* element h1 */
div p.heading {
  font-size:
  }
/* element h2 */
div div p.heading {
  ...
  }

/* element hn */
div div ... div p.heading {
  ...
  }

The superiority of this is that the appearance of the header is not
hardcoded but "computed", and that if you move a division, there is no
need to recode the headers.

Hope this helps
