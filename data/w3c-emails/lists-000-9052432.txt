The problem here is that (if as Jelks Cabaniss said) name is ID, the
structure of the file is not easy to modify, because, when you add a
division somewhere, all IDs after it have to be modified.

I am not familiar with Tidy code :-(
I prefer the second solution because it is a way to get rid of hn
elements which IMO are not needed. What we should need in
well-structured HTML would be a <divtitle> element (But this is my
preussian-psycho-rigid view of SGML/XML languages). Actually, hn are 
useful shortcuts, but the purity of the model suffers from them.
And the XHTML DTDs do *not* have any divtitle element. 

The tools to make the transformation is *not* Tidy, but some SGML tool
(like OpenJade for example, but there must be others).

Jany.
