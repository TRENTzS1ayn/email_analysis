That's plain wrong. Although you could say that they are special  
paragraphs, this is not only related to the display of these elements.  
Instead, they dogive the document an overall structure that could be  
used by browsers to display an outline.

And h[1-6] elements do have a hierarchy too: a h1 element is more  
important than h2. It's only that the elements are not nested.

No. In this case, the headings lose their semantics. They are no longer  
recognized as headings by HTML-parsing software.
