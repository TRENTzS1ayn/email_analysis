This report is for the Tidy version of 13th January 2000.

When given a legal HTML 3.2 file, Tidy reports the content to be "HTML 
proprietary."  For example, this text, which validates at the W3C site:

  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
  <html>
  <head>
  <title>Valid HTML 3.2</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
  </html>

...is reported as "HTML proprietary".  The cause is the definition of the 
HTML 3.2 doctype string at line 60 of lexer.c:

  {"HTML 3.2", "XHTML 1.0 Transitional", voyager_loose, VERS_HTML32},

However, the proper doctype string should be:

  {"HTML 3.2 Final", "XHTML 1.0 Transitional", voyager_loose, VERS_HTML32},

...according to the HTML 3.2 specification at http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-
html32.html.
