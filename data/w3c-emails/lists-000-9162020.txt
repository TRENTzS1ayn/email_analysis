This report is for the Tidy version of 13th January 2000.

If an invalid configuration option is specified in the configuration file, 
Tidy silently ignores it.  This is bad because the invalid option may be a 
misspelling of a proper option, e.g., "keep-tine" instead of "keep-time".  
As a result, Tidy may be doing something drastically different than what is 
intended.

The solution is to change line 446 in config.c from:

  NextProperty();

to:

  {
    if (!entry)
      ReportUnknownOption(name);

    NextProperty();
  }

Note that Tidy already reports invalid options that are specified on the 
command line.
