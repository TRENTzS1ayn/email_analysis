Tidy is picky about what characters it expects within tag names.
Perhaps I should add an option to make it less picky. In the
meantime you could patch the code for ParseTagName() in lexer.c
or you could add @ to the namechar set defined in InitMap() also
in lexer.c. The source code is available from the Tidy home page
