The problem is it can not make presentational markup structural, so in most
cases the HTML you get is syntactically and presentationally (on the latest
Browsers) correct, but it is not good.

For example: Word 97/98 exports headings (even if defined in Word correctly)
as 'big bold standard-text', not as <h1>...<h6>.

Tidy can convert all the ugly FONT SIZE="5" to CSS but it cannot revert
those lines of 'big bold standard-text' to real HTML-headings.

They could but (in contrast to the FONT-element) they are no problem in
accessibility and don't harm anybody if defined in complete.
Defining them (or something different) may be done with CSS additionally.

In most cases they should rather be replaced by another HTML-element
representing their structural meaning like <STRONG> or <EM> and the
STYLE-Definition should be set for these elements.

Just converting them to <span class="..."> would not produce good HTML.
