I have demoed Tidy to a number of people in the past, and one of my favorite
presentations is to take a single-line "document" containing only:

      <li>This line starts with a bullet!

and running it through Tidy.  A few days ago, I did this demo and saw something
I had never seen before.  Here is the XTHML it generates:

      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
      <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <head>
      <title></title>
      </head>
      <body>
      <ul style="margin-left: -2em">
      <li>This line starts with a bullet!</li>
      </ul>
      </body>
      </html>

Note the style attribute inserted into the ul element. ???

When viewed in the browser, it reads " line starts with a bullet" -- truncating
the word "This" as expected.  Tidy wasn't given any options (like -clean).  I
trust this is just a bug -- I hope Tidy doesn't start inserting unrequested
style attributes into elements!  :)
