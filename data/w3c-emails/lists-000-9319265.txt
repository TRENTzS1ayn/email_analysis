Matthew Brealey seems to be having major problems using Tidy, 
and I offer my sympathies - we still use Explorer 3 at work, and so 
I, too, have to resort to "tricks" to get a reasonable result. 
However, Tidy is designed to clean up illegal code, yet he seems to 
be asking that it leaves it illegal!  This would defeat the whole 
object, and I couldn't condone that.  I would suggest he uses the 
error output file to see what Tidy believes is wrong, and correct 
what is reasonable by hand.

Regards,

Peter
