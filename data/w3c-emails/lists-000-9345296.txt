To me, this feature is extremely valuable, as FrontPage 98 in particular 
loves to span block elements with inline ones.  Tidy does a perfect job in 
cleaning up this auto-generated mess.

Perhaps what is desired is alternate behavior, depending on whether the 
HTML source file is generated by hand or by machine.  As a proposal, 
perhaps keying on the presence of a <meta name="GENERATOR" ...> tag 
(although *not* Tidy's own tag :-) would engender one of two behaviors: the 
current insertion of extra inline tags if the GENERATOR tag is present 
(implying a machine-generated source), and simple termination of the inline 
element if the GENERATOR tag is absent.
