The handling of Wintel long file names on the command line works fine. Names
containing spaces enclosed with double quotes as normal are accepted with no
problem. However the same is not true in the config file. The long file
names are accepted, but ones containing spaces are not. Enclosing in quotes
causes the entire option to be ignored. This only affects one config option
- error-file: which can be replaced by the -f command line option which is
acceptable (to me) as a workaround until a fix is available.
