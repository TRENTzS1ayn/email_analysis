I think that perhaps a fundamental problem highlighted by this posting and
some others of recent weeks is that tidy is getting schizophrenic.

It is not sure whether it is a

Pretty-lister
HTML validator
HTML corrector
Standards evangelist

Slide show presenter

Perhaps if some functions were peeled off (from the bottom)it would not
suffer from these conflicts of design.
