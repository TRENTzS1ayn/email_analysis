No, this isn't quite a garbage in/out situation. I am getting 
the same <ul style="margin-left: -2em"> thing happening.

It is happening inside table cells with UL and unclosed LI items. 
Now that I know that it is not just me, I will test to see if
there is any other consistency here.

The Macintosh version of the 13th Jan release produces a pretty 
similar output, although as I have the "output-xml" option in config 
set to "no", it gives an HTML 2.0 Doctype, and creates the Style 
entry in the header.  One does wonder where the "-2em" comes from, 
but while this is a good party trick, should we really worry if such 
a non-sensical input gives a rubbish output?  After all, what is the 
excuse always trotted out for computers - "Garbage in - garbage out!"

Incidentally, Netscape 4.7 on the Mac displays your example below 
"sensibly", in that the bullet is pretty hard against the left 
margin, but it doesn't lose the first word, or anything for that 
matter.

Regards,

Peter
