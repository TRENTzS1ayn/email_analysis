My apologies for not having made this behavior clear in the
documentation. An <li> element without an enclosing list (ul or ol)
element is an error and gets reported to the user. Originally, it
was corrected by wrapping a ul element around it, however this
caused the page to look quite different from how it would have
looked in Netscape prior to being tidied. By experiment I found that
using the style property to negatively indent the bullet gave a good
semblance of the original rendering. The style attribute will be
ignored by old browsers.
