No Dave, please do not such things.

When it comes on cleaning presentational markup done by abuse of
HTML-elements translating to CSS results in illogical markup.

Some authors use BLOCKQUOTE or invalid lists to create margins.

Did you think about replacing all BLOCKQUOTE-elements by
<span style="margin-left:2em">?

No!

The job to bring back structural markup to the mess must be done by the
author and he has to _understand_ what is the difference.

Only possible use for "enhanced autocleaning":
Maybe if you know about certain bugs in special word-processors or editors
you may revert these.
