I didn't realise the list wouldn't let you post if you weren't subscribed
- I've never had any problems with any other W3C mailing lists]

I didn't say they were all bugs - I referred to bugs/suggestions.

The character reference stuff is certainly a bug.

Ideally, yes. But when you have a 600-file website (as with my new site),
it can be a little tedious to trawl through each file individually, so I
tend to do a for/in for each directory (although some pages I leave as
they are - for example, it will drop the following:
<div style="width: 200px; height: 200px; background: red"></div> as
empty).

But I find it necessary to tidy because I write all my HTML by hand, and
tend to omit end tags, which isn't a good idea because it can cause
Netscape to crash (given:
<p style="border: solid thin">
Some text
<p style="border: solid thin">
Some text
</p>
) , so I instruct Tidy to stick them back in again.
