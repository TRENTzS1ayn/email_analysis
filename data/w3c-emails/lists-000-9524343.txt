We are looking at creating an XHTML version of our HTML and I
was trying out html-tidy.  It looks very cool, but the one
problem I see is that I can't find a way to limit the layout formatting
of the resulting page.  Specifically, I would like it not to touch 
the indenting/linebreaking scheme that's already there.  Our web 
designer informs me that this will create subtle browser-specific 
formatting problems, for example, closing and opening TR and 
TD tags must be on the same line when they enclose adjoining images, 
otherwise browsers will put some extra space between the cells, 
e.g.

<table some options...>
   <tr><td><img src="whatever.jpg"></td><td><img src="somethign else"></td>
   </tr><tr>
   ...
   </tr>
</table>

instead of 

<table some options...>
  <tr>
    <td>
       <img src="whatever.jpg">
    </td>
    <td>
       <img src="somethign else"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  ...
  </tr>
</table>


Is there any way to do this in html-tidy, or is it possible
to add an option to do this?

Thanks!

-Mike
