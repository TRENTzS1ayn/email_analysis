To: HTML Tidy List<html-tidy@w3.org>

    Whenever Tidy supplies a corrected DOCTYPE, it produces one such as 
"!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC...", i.e., with the "html" in lower case.  In 
lexer.c, the "FindGivenVersion" routine, which is responsible for parsing 
the DOCTYPE statement, has this comment at line 769:

  /* but at least ensure the case is correct */

FindGivenVersion then replaces the DOCTYPE string supplied in the source 
HTML file with the identical string but containing "html" in lower case.

    Can someone please explain why changing this to lower case is 
"correct?"  Thanks.
