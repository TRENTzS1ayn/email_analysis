The number of columns for each tab stop varies from one system or
program to another, Unix systems generally use 8, but other systems
often use 4 or 5 columns. Many people like to use a smaller number
of spaces, to maximize the space remaining before the right margin.
In principle, an option could be added to use tabs, but this isn't a
frequently requested option.
