Hi.  I'm using Tidy via the HTML-Kit editor.  This does wonders for
cutting the junk out of Word2000 documents saved as 'web pages.'

Quite frequently the program will crash with an error in the tidy.dll.
It has trouble cleaning particular documents.

Has anyone experienced the same, and figured out what part of the page
the program chokes on?

I'm using HTML-Kit build 290 beta 7 with the Jan 13th version of Tidy.
