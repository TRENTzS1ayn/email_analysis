Hi,

I know the aim of TIDY is to ease conversion towards HTML4.0 but is it possible to use it to clean HTML files to an output that would stick to HTML 3.2 ? in particular, Word-2000 function generates a lot of style classes, would it be possible to make TIDY work to HTML 3.2 ? This is because a lot of our users still use navigator 3, which doesn't work very well with css.

If anyone knows of other good tools with source code that work towards HTML3.2, then I'd be glad to hear about them.

Thanks,
