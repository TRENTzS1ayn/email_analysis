Hi All
Below are text from two BATCH  files, then some comments,
I'm not sure if I would pass the Microsoft batch file exam,
but these files do work for me.

================= run_tidy.bat ==============================
check_it fileName html

rem <check_it><space><FILENAME><space><EXTENSION>

==================== check_it.bat ==========================
find /v /n "" %1.%2 > %1-%2_num.txt
copy %1.%2 oldver.htm

tidy.exe -f %1-%2_notes.txt -modify %1.%2

copy %1.%2 new_%1.%2
copy oldver.htm %1.%2
del oldver.htm

===================== comments =============================
To run this as you would need of course "TIDY.EXE"
also "RUN_TIDY.BAT"
& "CHECK_IT.BAT"
also the file to be checked, it might be "NEW.HTML"

To make the batch files you would need to make two text files with "note
pad" copy & paste
the text given above save the work and change the file name to the two batch
file names given.
"RUN_TIDY.BAT" & "CHECK_IT.BAT"

BEFORE YOU START
=================
Edit the RUN_TIDY batch file and replace "fileName" with the name of your
file  like NEW
( you might also have to change HTML to HTM )

TO START
========
Click onto the file "RUN_TIDY.BAT"

WHAT HAPPENS WHILE YOU WAIT
=============================
"RUN_TIDY.BAT will run the batch file "CHECK_IT.BAT"
from the text given it will make %1= fileName and %2=HTML

As it is running "CHECK_IT.BAT"
A file called "fileName-html_num.txt"
Then it copies "fileName.html" to "oldver.htm"
Then it runs tidy
& makes notes to file called "fileName-html_notes.txt"
& fixes errors and modifies "fileName.html"
Then it copies you modified version to "new_fileName.html"
Then it copies your original html file back to your original "fileName.html"
Then it deletes the file it made called "oldver.htm"

NOTE
=====
The reason it makes a text file with numbered lines is if you are a computer
that does not have a HTML editor.

======================== Question =============================
Is there some other and better way maybe with click-on style "buttons"  to
change TIDY options easer?

It would be great if TIDY printed to file the whole line that had any errors
on it,

From Eric
