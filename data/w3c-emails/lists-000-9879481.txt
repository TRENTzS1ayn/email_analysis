I tend to disagree. Some times you need both. The integration between
HTML-Kit and Tidy is very clean-cut and cleverly done. I use HTML-Kit more
or less as I would use Emacs to edit HTML files, but the ability to hit F9
and have Tidy validate and format my HTML code and then instantly preview
the results, speeds up my development process a lot.
