Hey, don't knock it till you've tried it :-)

HTML-Kit is a whole lot more than a wrapper for Tidy.  The fact you can Tidy
a document right in the editor and then selectively replace tidied elements
of the script is worth it alone.

I believe it has already been integrated within HTML-Kit
http://www.chami.com/html-kit/ but I haven't used this program myself.  I
don't
see why it needs to be integrated within anything; it works quite happily on
the command line and I'm grateful for the lack of flab that a GUI would add.

No, wait a moment. . . .

I take that back.  It should be integrated within MS Outlook!
