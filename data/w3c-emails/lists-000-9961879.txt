Tidy doesn't yet support CDATA marked sections, and this is noted
in the documentation:

 <h3>Limited support for XML</h3>

 <p>XML processors compliant with W3C's XML 1.0 recommendation are
 very picky about which files they will accept. Tidy can help you
 to fix errors that cause your XML files to be rejected. Tidy
 doesn't yet recognize all XML features though, e.g. it doesn't
 understand CDATA sections or DTD subsets.</p>

However, this is long over due and will be fixed in the next
release.
