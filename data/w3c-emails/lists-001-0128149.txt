It's a bug alright!

I have fixed this and the result is now:

   <br />
   <br />
   <h3><a id="clipboard" name="clipboard">ClipBoard</a></h3>
   <br />
   <br />

when tidying to XHTML. The br's are produced as a consequence
of finding the two empty <P>'s. n.b. <P> can't contain <h3>.
The fix will be included in the next release of Tidy. Many
thanks for reporting this bug.
