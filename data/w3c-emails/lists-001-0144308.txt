Tidy can be used with a variety of character encodings, and Rick
Jeliffe has done the most work on this. You can localize Tidy's
messages (see localize.c) and perhaps also the character encoding
by modifying the source code.

Perhaps the easiest thing is to convert your files to UTF8
and pipe them through Tidy and then convert back to the character
encoding of your choice.
