The current version of BBTidy (v1.0b7) does have some additional fixes that
the current (04 Aug 00) base "tidy" C code doesn't have. In fact, some of
these fixes were derived from proposed fixes by various people for the Java
version of Tidy.

For more specific information on the known bugs and bug fixes in Tidy that
I have documented, visit :

<http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/1057/tidybugs.html>

This list isn't quite current - I haven't had time to update it with the
latest known bugs.

Hope this helps.
