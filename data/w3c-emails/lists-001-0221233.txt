I have used tidy very little but now may be required to used for a large
project and as I know from the news group some of you out there are pretty
hardcore users and so I was wondering if tidy can handle JSP pages. I Know
it has support for some scripting stuff and mentions ASP on the home page.


Thanks in advance.
Jim
