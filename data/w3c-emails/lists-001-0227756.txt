As part of a project to "tidy" the values of certain "chemical"
attributes as a pre-processing operation before running Tidy
itself, we would very much like to run the  Indent element aspect
of Tidy, whilst leaving all other operations alone. This would
allow us to serialise the  HTML, and hence operate on the required
fields.

Does anyone know of a) whether Tidy can only indent elements,
or b) whether there is a separate program or script that can "pretty"
the HTML tree structure
