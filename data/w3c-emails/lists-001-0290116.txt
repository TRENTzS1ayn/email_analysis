Hi everyone, 

a while ago Pete Gelbman posted a way to integrate tidy into GNU
Emacs.  Unfortunately this does not work quite as well with XEmacs,
aparently since the shell-command-on-region function works
differently.   

I got the code snipped up and running, but I haven't found a way to
direct the error messages into another buffer, they are placed at the
top of the replaced text.  

I don't speak emacs-lisp very well (close to "not at all"), so was
wondering if someone has adapted Pete's elisp-code for XEmacs
(21.1.11)?

Regards -- Stephan
