Carriage return is a valid XML character, so the entity &#13; is a legal
XML entity (isn't it?)  So shouldn't tidy convert &#13; to a carriage
return?

<p>Shouldn't we get a carriage return right &#13; here?</p>
<p>This becomes &#9; tab.</p>
<p>And this becomes &#10; newline.</p>

    "You want to have consistent and uniform muscle
    development across all of your muscles? It can't be
    done. It's just a fact of life. You just have to accept
    inconsistent muscle development as an unalterable
    condition of weight training."

- Response to Arthur Jones, who solved the
  "unsolvable" problem by inventing Nautilus.
