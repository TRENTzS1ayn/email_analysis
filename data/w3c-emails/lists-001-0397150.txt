It may be omitted according the HTML specs, since HTML is based on SGML --
which allows you omit explicitly writing both start and end tags, and have
the parser infer them from the context.  But XHTML requires them.  If you
don't care about "well-formed" markup, use

hide-endtags: no

in the config file.

It's just a warning.  It's meant to remind you that non-visual browsers can
have problems with tables, and that the summary attribute can help.  You can
suppress warnings with

show-warnings: no

in the config file if you like.

That's up to you.  Tidy defaults to

clean: no

so it won't remove your presentational markup unless you tell it otherwise.
Just suppress the warnings if you don't like the advice Tidy gives.
