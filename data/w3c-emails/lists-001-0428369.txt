Andy:

thanks for u excellent work on jtidy, which we has used it since last year 
in our project. it was really a good port, thanks very much!

but i think i haven't the lastest version of jtidy, can u told me how to get 
it? for i can't find any through the old jtidy page, even links in it. 

Best wishes!
