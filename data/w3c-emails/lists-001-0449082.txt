Please forgive me if this is not a bug.

When using tidy in Homesite 4.5a I noticed that any css that is inserted by
it does not end the statement with a ;"> but with ">, leaving out the
semicolon. I thought that in order for the css statement to be valid it must
end with a semicolon then the quote and greater than symbol. Is this not
true?
