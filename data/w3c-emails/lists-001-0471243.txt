The semicolon is used as declaration separator and is not part of the 
declaration itself . Thus is not necessary for the last declaration in a CSS 
statement block. If CSS statements are generated by software, some programs 
(but not tidy)  place a semincolon behind the last statement, because it is 
easier to manipulate (e.g. adding or deleting declarations)  the statement. So, 
what you reported is not a bug.
