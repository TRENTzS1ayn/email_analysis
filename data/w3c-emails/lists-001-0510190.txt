I do limited regression testing when porting Tidy to Mac OS. Most of my
testing comes from real-world HTML that users send to me or the mailing
list when they discover what they believe is a bug. I keep those files
around, to make sure the bugs have been fixed, and haven't re-appeared
(sometimes they have), but I don't exhaustively test things (as I have
found out <grin>). There is some pretty horrible real-world HTML out there
<grin>.

I too would be interested in regression suites - perhaps you could make
your own available.
