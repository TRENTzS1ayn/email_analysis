Could I be so bold as to ask you to send them to me :-)

Yes, haven't we all.

Mine is pretty simplistic ;-) to say the least, it goes something like this:
tidy input.html > original.html
tidymod input.html > output.html
windiff output.html original.html

with more files I would probably make two output folders,  original and output and diff the contents of these instead. 
Not very sophisticated I admit but if I have a resonable collection of HTML files to feed it, it should be quite useful.
