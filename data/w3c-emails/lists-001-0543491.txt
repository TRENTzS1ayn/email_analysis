w3 is the organization that sets the HTML standard. O'reilly's books try
to cover it as well as information how browsers implement it. I only
have their "Dynamic HTML" and there, <script type=""> is described as is
<table summary="">. I would be astonished if it was not somewhere in
your book.

These are instances of HTML attributes which are not defined by the w3
HTML standard, but which where invented by Micro$oft for the Internet
Explorer 3. (BTW I have this info from my O'reilly book)

The author of tidy decided that his code should warn you of any
non-standard HTML. That is why bordercolordark and bordercolorlight are
reported. Nevertheless tidy treats them just like any other
attribute. So you can use them and tidy in parallel without problems.

The <table summary=""> and the <script type=""> attributes are
recommended to be used. That is why tidy reports when they are
missing. But again tidy can live with code where they are not existing.
