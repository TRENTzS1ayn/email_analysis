I'm getting 'Text exceeds memo capacity' errors from Tidy.

Is there a fix for this?

I also want to change the default settings for Tidy. Could someone 
explain in *very simple terms* how I set the environmental variable
HTML_TIDY in Windows 98 please. What exactly do I need to type and in
which file?
