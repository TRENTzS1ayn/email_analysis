Greetings,

Java Tidy (JTidy) has now been moved on over to SourceForge. The JTidy
website is up and running at 

<http://lempinen.net/sami/jtidy/>

and the SourceForge project page is at

        <http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy/>

SourceForge is experiencing some problems, so I have not been able to
import the sources to public CVS yet. There is, however, a spanking
new package available at

<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13153>

You can read the package release notes at

<http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=14322>
<http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=14324>

When downloading, make sure to grab the 04aug2000r3 package, as r2 had
a stupid fault in it.

Comments are welcome.

-Sami
