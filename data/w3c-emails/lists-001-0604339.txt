Or, if you happen to go the route of a separate batch file (as mentioned
above), you could just run Tidy by typing "tidy.bat", which would work even
if your batch file has the same name as your Tidy executable file.

Additionally, I can see Norbert's point of avoiding messing with your system
files. If you're concerned about that, you could always make a backup of
your autoexec.bat file before making changes to it (you could copy it to
another directory, for instance). But, on the other hand, Norbert's method
still works, so if you want to use it, that's fine.
