I vote for number 3 as well. For convenience, we may want to prefix
the mails with "JTidy:" or somesuch.

This is probably my bad; I applied a patch sent to me when releasing
r2. I'll fix things as soon as I have SF CVS up. (Oops, that would be
now :)

This sounds good to me. What I am worried about, however, is backwards
compatibility. It would be ideal to carry out this in a way that would
enable those of us who are using the Tidy DOM features (including
myself) get away with little or no changes.

Someone who knows the DOM internals better might be more qualified to
comment.

PS. OK, the JTidy CVS is up now. I have not verified the success of
the import though; have a look at

    <http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/?cvsroot=jtidy> 

if you're interested.
