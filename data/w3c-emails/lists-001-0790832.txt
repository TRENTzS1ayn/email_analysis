Gary, do you think that SAX is less of a moving target than DOM? If
yes, I think your proposal sounds very good. It has the following
advantages:

- The DOM implementation would be left to the folks who know it best
  (e.g. Xerces)
- Maintenance of the JTidy DOM support would be easier.

The disadvantages are:

1 Work required to design the SAX2 event generator
2 Speed
3 Existing application base.

The solution to 3) would be to either support the existing DOM classes
in parallel or providing a smooth migration path to the DOM functionality.

Can you give a work estimate? How about the speed/memory penalty?

-Sami
