Dims --

Hi.  I'm looking at implementing SAX support into JTidy.  Would you be
willing to act as an alpha site/consultant while I'm implementing this? 
I haven't used SAX much myself but I am generally familiar with it and
I've reviewed Dave Megginson's site in a fair amount of detail.

I'm looking at implementing the XMLReader interface and initially
driving just ContentHandler and ErrorHandler methods for now.

Thanks for the question.  Hope you can help.

Gary
