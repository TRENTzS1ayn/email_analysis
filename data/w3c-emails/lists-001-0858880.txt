Actually, I did something else: I put TidyMessages.properties into the .jar.
It didn't seem to be there in r2, and, once again, I couldn't download r3
properly. That way, I didn't have to figure out where to put it, and, right,
I can't modify it, but I can always do a jar cvfu and update it with a fresh
copy. Now, it runs perfectly.
