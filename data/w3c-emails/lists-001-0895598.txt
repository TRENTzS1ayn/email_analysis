It's good to know that Andy left us with a faithful port of tidy!  I
have real reservations about "fixing" the JTidy code base and getting
out of sync with Tidy.  I think we should strive to keep the
implementations as identical as possible in this core functionality.

When Tidy is fixed, we will obviously reflect that change in JTidy.  But
I don't think it's a good idea to have local fixes all over the place. 
I felt badly about the last fix but it was causing a java exception and
I annotated it clearly.  We'll have to remove it or revisit it when Tidy
is corrected.

How do others feel?

Gary
