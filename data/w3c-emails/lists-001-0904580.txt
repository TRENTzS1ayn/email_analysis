Yep! Now I know what the Wine team has to go through, trying to
duplicate all the bugs ;)

Seriously, I appreciate Andy's and Dave's work tremendously, and do
think that the Java port should keep as faithful as possible to the original.

I agree. I do think, however, that in cases where a trivial fix would
be possible, we could try to offer it to Mr. Raggett just to make his
job easier.

If necessary, I can administer a separate CVS code fork (a branch,
mergeable to the trunk) for JTidy versions that beat the original to
bugfixes etc. Forks are not very productive though :(
