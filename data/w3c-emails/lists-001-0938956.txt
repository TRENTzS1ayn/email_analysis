Hi all,
I have a situation where an element has a duplicate attribute.
Example:
<table class="C1" class="C2" name="Name">

Using, [J]Tidy, how do I (chances are JTidy cannot do this - I'll ask
anyways)
1) Tell JTidy to always take the first one, OR
2) Get rid of all such attributes altogether (e.g. have <table
name="Name">), OR
3) Is my only chance is to work with a resulting DOM from JTidy?


Thanks.
