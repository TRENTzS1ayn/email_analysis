I uploaded a new release (04aug2000r5). Can those of you who had
trouble unzipping r4 please verify that r5 works ok?

BTW: r4 unzipped fine on my Debian box. This seems like a really weird
problem in that it only affected some people.

Release notes for r5 are at

<http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=15275>

Comments welcome.
