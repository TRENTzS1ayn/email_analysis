Hello Dave

Please forgive my writing to you but I am a little confused about a
behaviour in tidy.exe.

If you write a terminating tag - </span>, for example - but with a space
between the slash and the tag word - </ span> - tidy.exe does not detect
it and puts another terminating tag - in the "correct" format - where it
thinks appropriate.

Is it a W3C requirement that there is no intervening space character
between the slash and the tag word?

Best wishes

Brian Smith
