I suspect that instructions more along these lines - including how
to find 'a dos-box' , etc. would be helpful since many Windows
apps are strictly gui based.

I wonder if there is a way to set up tidy.exe so that it automatically
starts a dos window and then runs.  If someone then somehow (don't
know enough windows to supply the missing details here) tells
windows to run tidy with a specific html file, it would produce
output in said window.  Unfortunately, not a lot to be done
about tidy with no arguments producing no output as long as
it is going to be set up to read stdin for data ... unless
someone adds a 'timeout' for initial input on the windows
platform...
