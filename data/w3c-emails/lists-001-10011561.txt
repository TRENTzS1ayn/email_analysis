There's something on Dave's web pages about configuring registry entries so
that when you drop a file on Tidy it will fire up a browser window
containing the Tidied output.  You can then use File|Save As... to save the
output.

Have a look and post back if you don't find it.  I haven't tried it myself
yet.

I have played w/ creating batch files some.  It turns out that if you drop a
file onto a batch file, it gets the 8.3 form of the filename, which is
fairly useless.

I think the timeout would be a Star Treck solution...

I suspect that instructions more along these lines - including how to find
'a dos-box' , etc. would be helpful since many Windows apps are strictly gui
based.

I wonder if there is a way to set up tidy.exe so that it automatically
starts a dos window and then runs.  If someone then somehow (don't know
enough windows to supply the missing details here) tells windows to run tidy
with a specific html file, it would produce output in said window.
Unfortunately, not a lot to be done about tidy with no arguments producing
no output as long as it is going to be set up to read stdin for data ...
unless someone adds a 'timeout' for initial input on the windows platform...
