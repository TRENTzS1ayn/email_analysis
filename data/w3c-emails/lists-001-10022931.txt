This mailing list is dedicated to HTML features, HTML Tidy is beeing
discussed at html-tidy@w3.org, as Tidy tells you every time you run it.

This is an acknowledged bug for the _XML_ pretty printer. I'll have a
look at it. HTML Tidy has only limited support for XML; the HTML pretty
printer works just fine and prints it like you intended.

Tidy 04 August 2000 prints this as

    <a href="page1.html"><img src="images/next.gif"
    alt="Take me to page one please" width="55px"
    height="25px" /></a>

The current 1.90-dev version additionally warns you about

  Warning: <img> attribute "height" has invalid value "25px"
  Warning: <img> attribute "width" has invalid value "55px"

Please send in _reproducable_ bug reports, i.e. complete HTML pages and
configuration options and send it to html-tidy@w3.org or use the bug
tracker at http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidy this is, as I said, not
the right place to discuss HTML Tidy features.

I don't get what you are trying to say. Tidy currently doesn't repair
the order of table children, but the order you used is quite correct.

Again, I'm not sure what you want here.

Please not the Reply-to: html-tidy@w3.org, answers will go there.
