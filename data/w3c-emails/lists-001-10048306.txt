It is still active.

As I understand it they are waiting for the next release of HTML Tidy
first, the last being 04/08/00.

The guys over at SourceForge, working on HTML Tidy, are VERY active and
will have a release out soon - there has been talk of an anniversary
edition. I imagine a JTidy will quickly follow. 

See tidy.sourceforge.net for more details.
