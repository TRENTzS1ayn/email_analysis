With XHTML 1.1 differing only very slightly in the  DTD from 1.0,
but with the elements now modularised,  I wonder at what stage
it becomes worth while to produce a version of Tidy that
can begin to support this proposal?  Can whoever is well
versed in the ways of the W3C explain when a proposal is
firm enough to encode against it?

Will  Tidy also respond to the modularisation  by being itself
modular?
