Hi,

Did you ever get an answer to this? I'm hitting exactly the same problem. It
is possible to specify new tags, but I have not found a way to say 'all
elements are OK'. So far my workaround is to do a regex scan for non-html
tags, then add those to the command line.

Subject: Passing through unknown tags in <head>? Hello, I'm trying to
convert some HTML files to XML and then process them with
XSLT.  However, these HTML files have proprietary tags in the <head>
section which Tidy strips out.  I've been looking at the jTidy source to
see if there's any obvious way to get these tags to pass through.  One
thought is to extend the custom tag configuration so the specified tags
can also exist in the <head> section.
