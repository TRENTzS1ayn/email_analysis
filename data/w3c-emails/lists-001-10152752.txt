I run Tidy on Windows NT 4.0. Since filtering 
a file is very straightforward task, I rather use 
Explorer shell than a specific GUI. I think this 
applies to any 32-bit Windows. That's how it 
works: 

1) On the Registry branch 
 "\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\htmlfile\shell" 
 (or "\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\NetscapeMarkup\shell" 
 if Netscape is the default browser)
 create an entry "Tidy" with content "T&idy!". 

 Of course, you need administrator priviledges 
 and some knowledge of using Regedit.

2) Under "Tidy"-key, create a "command" entry
 with content "[path]Tidy.exe -options %1" 
 where "[path]" is the directory where Tidy.exe 
 resides (not needed if the directory is included 
 in Windows' path-variable) and "-options" are 
 Tidy's own options. The "%1" is the important 
 part: it refers to the selected file.

 Now you can tidy up an .htm/.html file though 
 a right mouse click & selection or through key 
 strokes 'Win-listbutton' & 'i'.
