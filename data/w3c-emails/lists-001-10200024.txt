Subject: Tidy Bug Report: A wrong space is inserted


Hi, thanks for Tidy source first.
Here is a bug that I met.
<font> </font> is containing <hr> tag, so Tidy made a correction. But a
wrong space is inserted.
Refer to the HTML source below.
This bug is critical for DBCS char like Korean. Could you send me a hot fix
or how to fix it for this?

You are recommended to use CSS to specify the font and
properties such as its size and color. This will reduce
the size of HTML files and make them easier maintain
compared with using <FONT> elements.
 
HTML & CSS specifications are available from http://www.w3.org/
