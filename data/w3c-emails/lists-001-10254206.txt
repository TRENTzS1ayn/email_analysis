Mr Raggett

I was introduced to HTML Tidy when I purchased HomeSite last year. It has 
been a tremendous aid to me as I learn HTML and now XHTML. Thank you.

I am currently working my way through 'Beginning XHTML'' from Wrox and note 
that you are one of the authors.

My present puzzle is as follows:

In the book's examples, the following line appears - I believe I have 
copied it correctly.

         <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html" xml:lang="en" lang="en">

When I run Tidy (inside HomeSite) against an HTML file containing the 
above, I get the following.

         Tidy (vers 30th April 2000) Parsing "input.html"
         line 4 column 1 - Warning: <html> has XML attribute "xml:lang"

         "input.html" appears to be XHTML 1.0 Transitional
         1 warnings/errors were found!

Would appreciate you please advising which is correct - the book or the 
Tidy output or if a change to Tidy is in order.

Thanks for your help
Regards
Mike Connelly
