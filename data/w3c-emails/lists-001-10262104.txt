Hi!

I attempted to download tidy.exe from your fine web site.  Unfortunatly the
content advisor in Internet Explorer (5.5) did not let me access the download
site.  I've tried changing all the content settings.

Please could you mail me tidy.exe so I can use your fine product.

Many Thanks

Steve Evans
