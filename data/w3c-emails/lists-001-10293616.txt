Hi Steve,

Here is a Win32 build (using VC++) from the current CVS code.  Be advised
that this is pre-release code, but it includes many bug fixes and some new
features compared to the 04Aug00 version (also attached).

Do you mind being a beta tester?

take it easy,
Charlie

Hi!

I attempted to download tidy.exe from your fine web site.  Unfortunatly the
content advisor in Internet Explorer (5.5) did not let me access the
download site.  I've tried changing all the content settings.

Please could you mail me tidy.exe so I can use your fine product.

Many Thanks

Steve Evans
