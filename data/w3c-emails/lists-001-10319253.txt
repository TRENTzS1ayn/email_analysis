Of course, in this day and age, no one emails executables any more.  Silly
of me...

If you go to the project home page at http://tidy.sourceforge.net/, you'll
find links to these files.  Can someone build me a Linux binary?  Terry, how
'bout a Mac build?  (email is fine, but I'll have to rename the file)

take it easy,
Charlie

How about a URL?  What you sent was converted to "tidy.v1.9beta.txt" and
had the content ...

     FILE QUARANTINED
     ----------------

     Antigen for Exchange removed tidy.v1.9beta.exe since it
     was found to match the =*.exe file filter.
