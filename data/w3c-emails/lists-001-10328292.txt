The latest CVS doesn't seem to build under Linux on my machine (Red Hat 7.0),
for two reasons:

 1) <sys/utime.h> in src/platform.h should be just <utime.h>

 2) In tidy.c:1286 a call is made to futime(). Linux (at least glibc 2.2)
   doesn't have that. Instead it has utime(), which takes a filename as its
   first argument instead.

Also, htmldoc/Overview.html doesn't contain any info about the new 'body-only'
config option.

Also, could you move all the stuff in CVS to a 'tidy' directory so that it
plays nice with all the other SourceForge CVS downloads, pretty please? :)
