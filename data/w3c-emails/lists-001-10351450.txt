Hi,

I've tested the solaris build and found a bug which does not occur with
the original 4aug00 version of tidy.

My html contained a table with a missing </tr> tag. tidy.v1.9beta moved
the table to the end of the file and also put some comment lines inside
the table. 

I have included a short example file where you can see the effect.

I called tidy with the following command line:
tidy.v1.9beta -f errors.txt tableTest.html > output.html

Included are the files:
tableTest.html  -  input file
output.html     -  tidied file
error.txt       -  error file

Bye,

Achim
