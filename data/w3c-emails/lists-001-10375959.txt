This was originally posted to a jtidy forum, but I was told this is the place
to ask. (I guess assume I'm using HTML Tidy)

I have written a web bot (that uses jtidy) that can fill out forms automatically,
or with the help of pre-defined templates.

I was testing it on a variety of pages and it "broke" on ones with overlapping
tags.

e.g. 
... 
<center> 
<form> 
<input... 
</center> 
<input... 
</form> 

jtidy automagically closes the form tag before the </center> tag, thus when
I explore a node starting from the form root, I don't have all form data accessible
to me. So basically a nodes loose their proper parents.

I know this is not a bug, it's someone else's bad HTML. But can anyone suggest
a quick fix? Is there a way for jtidy (HTML Tidy) to move the </center> tag
so that it encloses the entire form?

Thanks for your help, 
-swagr
