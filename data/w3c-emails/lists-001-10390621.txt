Hi All,

I cannot tell if it is me or tidy who is doing the wrong thing.

My HTML contains a sequence like this:

<html>
<head>

<script>
<!--
  some script statements here
// stop hiding -->
</script>

<noscript>
show this stuff when scripting not enabled
</noscript>

</head>

<body> ....

Tidy's output moves the <noscript> block to within <body>; specifically as
the very first thing after <body>.

When I move the <noscript> block before the <script> block and tidy again,
the tidy output now has BOTH
the <noscript> and the <script> block within <body>; neither is in <head>
any longer.

Can anyone shed some light on this behavior? -v shows 30th April, 2000

Thanks,

Cordially,

Paul
