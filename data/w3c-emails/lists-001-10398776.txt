Hi All,

I've looked more closely at this and here's what I'm seeing:

<noscript> is illicit contents for <head>.  So...it makes sense that tidy
moves it from <head> to <body>.  But there does appear to a bug, to wit,
once an illicit <head> element is found, everything (licit or no) from that
element onward to the </head> (except <title>) is moved within <body>.  So,
a <p> tag, illicit in <head> followed by a licit <script>...</script>
sequence, will cause both the <p> and the <script>...</script> to be moved
within body.

Also, once an illicit <head> element is detected, tidy insists on generating
its own <title> element, even if there already is one.

Cordially,

Paul
