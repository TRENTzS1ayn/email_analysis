Seems the best place for it. Where were you expecting it to go? 

What it's actually doing is: 1. finding <noscript> outside of <body> 
2. inserting </head><body> so <noscript> is in the right place 
3. deleting the now-superfluous <body> you supplied

The explanation above covers this case too: Tidy isn't "moving" 
anything, it's inserting the missing <body> prior to <noscript>.
