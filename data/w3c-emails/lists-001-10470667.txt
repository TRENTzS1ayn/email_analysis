Hi All,

Thanks for the several replies.

It is not my intent to disparage Tidy; it is truly a swell piece of work.  I am simply inquiring about a particular behavior.  I guess I had in mind an alternate approach.  It's appropriate that <noscript> or any other element that ought not occur in <head> be placed in <body>. But why should the head-licit <script> tag suffer the same fate? To put it differently, why not process all <head> tags, moving to <body> those that are illicit while leaving in place those that are licit?

Cordially,

Paul

Seems the best place for it. Where were you expecting it to go? 

What it's actually doing is: 1. finding <noscript> outside of <body>

2. inserting </head><body> so <noscript> is in the right place

3. deleting the now-superfluous <body> you supplied

The explanation above covers this case too: Tidy isn't "moving" 
anything, it's inserting the missing <body> prior to <noscript>.
