This is a known feature and problem of Tidy.  This basic technique of
inserting parent end tags when an illegal child begin tag is encountered
solves the bulk of markup problems in an efficient and elegant manner.

It doesn't always do what you'd like, however.  In particular, it doesn't
handle overlapping inline tags the way browsers do:

E.g.
The <i>quick <b>brown</i> fox</b> jumped ...

becomes:
The <i>quick</i> <b>brown fox</b> jumped ...

rather than (what most browsers do, in effect):
The <i>quick <b>brown</b></i> <b>fox</b> jumped ...

Thanks to Bj?rn and Terry, the problem was solved for headers <h1><h2>...
and anchor tags <a>, both of which get special treatment.  But it still pops
up in unexpected places like this one.

Unfortunately, the solution requires knowledge about HTML content models,
which is pretty good but not comprehensive within Tidy - and has been the
subject of several discussions on the development list.

take it easy,
Charlie

Hi All,

Thanks for the several replies.

It is not my intent to disparage Tidy; it is truly a swell piece of work.  I
am simply inquiring about a particular behavior.  I guess I had in mind an
alternate approach.  It's appropriate that <noscript> or any other element
that ought not occur in <head> be placed in <body>. But why should the
head-licit <script> tag suffer the same fate? To put it differently, why not
process all <head> tags, moving to <body> those that are illicit while
leaving in place those that are licit?

Cordially,

Paul

Seems the best place for it. Where were you expecting it to go? 

What it's actually doing is: 1. finding <noscript> outside of <body>

2. inserting </head><body> so <noscript> is in the right place

3. deleting the now-superfluous <body> you supplied

The explanation above covers this case too: Tidy isn't "moving" 
anything, it's inserting the missing <body> prior to <noscript>.
