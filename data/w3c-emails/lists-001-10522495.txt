Thanks...one more question

Is there a method I can call from Tidy that takes the actual tag as the
argument?
Here's the situation: i'm using JTidy in my own Java app to clean a file.
JTidy finds a tag it doesn't recognize and gives me an error.  So, I get the
unknown tag from that error and attempt to let JTidy know that it SHOULD
recognize this tag.
I guess what I'm saying is, I want to make sure I find this easiest, most
elegent way to handle this.

thanks,

ryan
