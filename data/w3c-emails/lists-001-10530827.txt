You have a few ways to go.  Since JTidy is open source, you can hack up
the source yourself to automatically do something with unrecognized
tags.  This may even be a feature request for HTML Tidy, which you can
check on the SourceForge site.

Or, you can have a look at what TagTable.java does for
  defineInlineTag
  defineBlockTag
  defineEmptyTag
  definePreTag

and create the Dict object and install it in the TagTable yourself. 
You'll somehow need to decide what kind of tag the unrecognized tag is.
