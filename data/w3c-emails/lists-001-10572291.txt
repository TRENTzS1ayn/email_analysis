Hello,

I also want to add new tags for tidy, especially JTidy.
Maybe it's not a good question. What's the difference among "empty-tags",
"inline-tags", "blocklevel-tags" and "pre-tags"? (What i want to do is
just to add some tags, currently i think these tags are not uncommon.
Maybe i am wrong.)

I appreciate any kind of help. Thanks.

Chunbo
