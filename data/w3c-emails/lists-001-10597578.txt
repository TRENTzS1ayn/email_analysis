Hi, Gary

I want to add one tag as using "defineInlineTag" method in TagTable.

If I do this by adding one line of "defaultTagTable.install(new
Dict("tagname", (short)448, 0x140010, ParserImpl.getParseBlock(), null));"
just after "defaultTagTable = new TagTable();" inside the
"getDefaultTagTable" method of TagTable.java, after this is done, how
can i compile this TagTable.java to make it work for my application which
use JTidy as "Tidy tidy = new Tidy();...tidy.parse(...);".

thanks.

Chunbo
