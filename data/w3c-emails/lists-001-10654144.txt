Hi, Michael

Thanks for your help on "config.txt". It's good solution.

When i run tidy to clean some html, i got one error indicating that
"<a> missing '>' for end of tag ". But "<a>" is already included in
TagTable.java.
Because of this error, the output as clean result is a zero-length file.
But i want the output file not to be a zero-content file.

Is there any solution to avoid this? Tidy is supposed to overcome this
case, is it?
