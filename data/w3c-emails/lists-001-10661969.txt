Hi, 

almost same thing, error shows
"<meta> missing '>' for end of tag".

But, "meta" is already in TagTable.java.

Can we do something (to make tidy) to solve this problem, then to give
nice output other than zero-content file?

thanks.

Chunbo

Hi, Michael

Thanks for your help on "config.txt". It's good solution.

When i run tidy to clean some html, i got one error indicating that
"<a> missing '>' for end of tag ". But "<a>" is already included in
TagTable.java.
Because of this error, the output as clean result is a zero-length file.
But i want the output file not to be a zero-content file.

Is there any solution to avoid this? Tidy is supposed to overcome this
case, is it?
