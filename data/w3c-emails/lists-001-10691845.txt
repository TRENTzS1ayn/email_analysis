thanks for reply.

Attached files are some html page on some university. I didn't make the
page. I just use Tidy to parse it.

The file "48-washington.edu" gave the error "Error: <meta> missing '>' for
end of tag".

The file "42-upenn.edu" gave me the error "Error: <a> missing '>' for end
of tag".

At the beginning of each file, you can see the url link address for this
url file. I already took out these extra lines before I use Tidy to clean
this url file.

I cannot see any clue to figure out why the error happans.
thanks for help.
