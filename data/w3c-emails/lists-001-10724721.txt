I have seen some horrible HTML generated in my time, but those 2 documents
are terrible, and I'm not surprized Tidy has a problem. Hopefully the HTML
below won't get mangled by the mail.

1) "48-washington.edu" :

(a) There are 3 <body>...</body> which are nested.

(b) The META tag Tidy is complaining about is in the following (line #45) :

line 45 column 16 - Error: <meta> missing '>' for end of tag

<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;charset=iso-8859-1"<BR>

Note the missing >. If you fix this error, Tidy will produce output.

(c) I won't comment on the rest of the horrible HTML code.

2) "42-upenn.edu" :

(a) The A tag Tidy is complaining about is in the following (line #192) :

line 192 column 5 - Error: <a> missing '>' for end of tag
line 192 column 59 - Error: discarding unexpected </a>

<LI><A href="http://www.arstechnica.com/"</A>Ars Technica</A> <FONT
Size=-2>Ars Technica</FONT><br>

Note the missing >. And the extra </A>. If you fix this error, Tidy will
produce output.

I used the current (23 Aug 01) C version of Tidy, so you might see
different behaviour from an older version. But as I see it, Tidy tells you
exactly what and where the error is - all you need to do is look at the
rest of the line that Tidy is complaining about, to see the problem,.

Regards, Terry
