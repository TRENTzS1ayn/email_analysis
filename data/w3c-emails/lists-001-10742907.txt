Hi, Gary

The java file I used to invoke tidy is almost the same one as the example
file offered by Tidy package. It is attached. I am not too sure now
whether i need to set XMLtags to be false explicitly. Because I think the
default for it is already false, is it?

the error message is shown in err output file from tidy. The result is
that the cleaned file as output will be zero length, which i don't like.

thanks for help.

Chunbo
