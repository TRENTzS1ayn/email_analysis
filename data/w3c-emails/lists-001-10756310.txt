The file "42-upenn.edu" gave me the error "Error:  <a> missing

I cannot see any clue to figure out why the error happans.

I've only checked one of these files, the 42-upenn.edu one.

HTML Tidy says the error is on line 195.  So look at line 195, which
I have split inside the second </A> to fit in a reasonable width.

Blow me down.  HTML Tidy told you there is a missing '>'
because there *IS* a missing '>'.  How about that?
The letter "v" points to the place where the '>' should have been.

Not only that, the <A> is ended twice.  It looks as though the first
'</A>' on line 195 should have been '>'.

Note for the discerning:  the appearance of '<FONT SIZE=-2> is an
extremely reliable indicator of a page written by the HTML-clueless,
and so it proves.  This is a page that badly needs the attentions of Tidy.
