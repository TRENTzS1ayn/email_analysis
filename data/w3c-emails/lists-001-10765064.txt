Use HTML Tidy as a component.
Write a little script, in AWK, Perl, Python, or even sh, or whatever takes
your fancy, that turns
<!--exec cmd="Header.pl" -->
into
<!DOCTYPE html ...whichever version you want...>
<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Header.pl</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>

and
<!--exec cmd="Footer.pl" -->
into
</BODY></HTML>

The script should then run HTML Tidy,
then take the output, and replace everything up to and including <BODY>
with <!--exec cmd="Header.pl" --> and everything from and including
</BODY> to the end of the file with <!--exec cmd="Footer.pl -->.

From the use of the .pl extension (which Larry Wall very rudely stole
from Prolog, which had been using it for a long time before Perl was
nightmared of) I surmise that Perl is being used, and it should be quite
easy to whip up a script like this in just a few lines of Perl.
