Yes, but XML isn't XHTML. Understand?

The following is not valid XHTML. It *is* valid XML.

<input><form /><foobar /><tr /></input>

I need to turn really bad HTML into parse-able XML at any cost; that the
result may be complete gibberish with respect to the XHTML DTD's is of no
concern.

I am using TidyCOM.

I have sucessfully accomplished HTML=>XML using the Trident (IE) web browser
control (shdocvw.dll) and iterating the HTML DOM tree. The problem with this
method is that it is extremely slow and processor intensive, and completely
unsuitable for server-side automated robots.

XHTML *is* well-formed XML.

As to a Tidy COM interface, see
