Hello,

I seemed to have gotten on a mailing list for some sort of messege board concerning your website.

I NEED REMOVED.  I have sent messeges several times and can not get off the mailer.  This is a business account and I cannot have all these unnessessary e-mails coming in from a messege board.

Please remove my address from this mailer or tell me where I can do it

Thank you.
