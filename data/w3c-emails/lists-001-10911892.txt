Subject: I need removed from your mailing list


Hello.
I have been receiving several emails concerning "tidy html" and things like that. I would like to ask you to remove my name from your mailing list.
 I never subscribed to html-tidy and I would like to stop receiving emails from this organisation.
Thanks ,


brenda
