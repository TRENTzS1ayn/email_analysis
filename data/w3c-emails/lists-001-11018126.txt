tidy returns

<h1>start of heading</h1>
<p>paragraph within</p>
<p>end of heading</p>

As it should.  No version of HTML since 2.0 has ever allowed
a paragraph within a heading.

This seems consistent with earlier observed tidy behavior,
namely that xhtml1.0 dtd disallows <p> within <h1>. So tidy
closes the <h1>, etc.  But I didn't specify output-xhtml.  I
specified output-xml.  Isn't the input to tidy valid h1 'xml'?
If so, why does tidy seem to force compliance with the xhtml dtd?

Because it is an *HTML* tidier, and it doesn't make sense to put a
<p> element inside an <h[1-6]> element, _whatever_ the output is.

While the input was _well-formed_ XML, to count as "valid", an
XML document must provide a DOCTYPE and conform to it.
