The names suggest that output-xml and output-xhtml affect the output
phase, by which stage the input has already been parsed and tidied. I
think you also need to set the input-xml option, as described in
<http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/>:

    input-xml: bool
          If set to yes, Tidy will use the XML parser rather than
          the error correcting HTML parser. The default is no.


hope this helps,
