I made a slight mistake here; the 8-2000 version of tidy _does_ delete
text nodes which have been trimmed into oblivion _if_ they are not
attached to a td or th node.  (I presume there are good reasons for
maintaining zero length text nodes for those tags, although for the life
of me I can't figure out what it would be).

In any case, here are the revised diffs for parser.c which fix the
mis-trimmed &nbsp; entity.
