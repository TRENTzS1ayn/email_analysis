You're right.  I was confused because I had changed the default for
DropEmptyParas to no for my testing.  The behavior I was describing
occurs when you set the parameter to no in your config file.

"Should" is a religious question, which I tend to avoid whenever
possible; I leave to wiser heads than mine the question of whether or
not <p>&nbsp;</p> "should" be treated differently than <p> </p>.  I
simply stated that I _expected_ them to be treated the same, and for my
particular application I _want_ them to be treated the same.  As I have
already fixed my copy of the code the question is not relevant for me. 
On the other hand, if others desire the same behavior as I do, I have
provided the fix.

Attached.  You will note that the file contains 3 cases:

<code>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  </p>
<p></p>
</code>

Assuming the default configuration (DropEmptyParas == yes), in the first
case the line is returned unchanged, in the second case the spaces are
trimmed, but the tags are returned (resulting in an empty paragraph on
output), and in the third case the line is dropped from the output.  I
would expect the same behavior in all three cases.  What is the
rationale for three different treatments, if that is in fact what is
desired?
