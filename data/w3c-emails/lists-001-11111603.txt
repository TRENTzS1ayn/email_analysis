I'm going to embarrass myself by displaying my ignorance. Can't an empty
table cell be specified by an empty pair of tags, with no enclosed text?
(e.g. <td></td> as opposed to <td>  </td>)

From the HTML 4.01 DTD:

    <!ELEMENT (TH|TD)  - O (%flow;)* -- table header cell, table data cell-->

Since bare text is allowed in a table cell, XHTML must also formally
allow a table cell to be empty.

I do remember having trouble with empty table cells, so I don't ever write
them any more, but it was sufficiently long ago that I no longer recall why.
