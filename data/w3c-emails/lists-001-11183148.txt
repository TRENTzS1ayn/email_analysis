Yes, wait <grin>.

The current version of Tidy being worked on, has support for XHTML 1.1.

But in any case, it appears you might have downloaded an older copy of Tidy
- the currently released version is 04 Aug 00. It seems other people have
also had this problem - I don't know if a link is bad or not - perhaps
someone else can answer that question. What platform did you want Tidy for?

If you want to find out more about the new version of Tidy being worked on,
