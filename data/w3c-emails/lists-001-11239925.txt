Bj?rn, Fred, I am sure we all agree there is no use to start 
a polemic, but I am getting results which don't cope with Bjoern's.
So, I suppose my tidy is different or I use it the wrong way.
So, may I ask which version of tidy you run and the switches you use ?
I run tidy (30th April 2000) on Windows NT4.0 and tidy (4th August 2000)
on
Linux with -i and -raw and I get (ever and ever):

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Frameset//EN">

<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="generator" content="HTML Tidy, see www.w3.org">
    <title>Titre</title>
  </head>

  <body>
<script type="text/javascript">
document.writeln ("<\/frameset><\/frameset><\/frameset>" ) ;

<\/script
><\/body
><\/html
>
</script>
  </body>
</html>

So, I have these four lines that were not in your quote :
<\/script
><\/body
><\/html
>

By the way, why not include the version or build number in the meta tag
generated by tidy ?

Jany.
