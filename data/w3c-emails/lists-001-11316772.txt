Agree.  Attitude goes nowhere.  No need to compound problem...

To the point: Tidy is known to work on Win98, NT4 and Win2K.  WinME should
work just fine.  If anyone runs into a WinME problem, please report it to
the Tidy bug tracker at

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=390963&group_id=27659&func=browse

Click on "Submit New".  No login necessary.

Beta binaries from the SF project (Win32, Solaris and Linux) can be found at
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/

take it easy,
Charlie Reitzel

Actually as a very un-informed Win32 programmer (but
possibly "computer literate" ?) I think this reply is
a tad crass.
