Not as useful; it should replace that with its version if indeed is was the content of the original meta tag.

Well, now, I would have, but according to the authorative source for HTML Tidy (w3.org) tidy.sf.net does not exist.  No mention is made of tidy existing in any other place.  That seems to be a split or rift in the development; I mean, if tidy.sf.net was not a split from w3's version, w3's web content would indicate the existence of tidy.sf.net.

SO... what gives?
