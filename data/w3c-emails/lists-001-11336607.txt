Hello I'm not able to get Tidy to respond at the Dos Prompt. I 
received a copy of tidy through an instruction book I purchased at "Borders 
Books". I was wondering if you can help or if you know where I can obtain 
another version of it.

 

Thanks,

Rodrick Robertson

 

P.S. Tidy isn't responding to any commands
