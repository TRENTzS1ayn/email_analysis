Fair question.  According to Dave Raggett, the W3C is planning to change
references from Dave's personal pages
(http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/) to the SF project home page
(http://tidy.sourceforge.net).   As part of the move, Dave agreed to keep
backup copies of Tidy source on his page.

Dave, has the change been formally approved?  Not that it would change very
much.  Perhaps they are waiting on the first actual release from us.  I
would if I were in their position.

take it easy,
Charles Reitzel

Not as useful; it should replace that with its version if indeed is was the
content of the original meta tag.

Well, now, I would have, but according to the authorative source for HTML
Tidy (w3.org) tidy.sf.net does not exist.  No mention is made of tidy
existing in any other place.  That seems to be a split or rift in the
development; I mean, if tidy.sf.net was not a split from w3's version, w3's
web content would indicate the existence of tidy.sf.net.

SO... what gives?
