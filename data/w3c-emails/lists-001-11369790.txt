I downloaded the tidy source code on Sep 1st and I've found that the code 
that I downloaded is less forgiving than the official release of tidy 4th 
Aug 2000.

I've attached 2 of the files that have been rejected by the new tidy but 
cleaned up by the old tidy.

Is there any reason why the development team had made tidy tighter or less 
forgiving?

It would be nice for tidy to be more flexible and take as much document as 
possible.

Thanks,
Patrick
