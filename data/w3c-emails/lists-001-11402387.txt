Tidy corrects some errors without further notice (this should not
happen) and the Validator is in general better aware of the rules
that apply to your document, e.g. Tidy's checks of proper nesting
and attribute <=> element relationsships are not as good as those
of the Validator. You should give us specific examples to get a
more specific analysis and we could then improve Tidy to flag those
errors.
