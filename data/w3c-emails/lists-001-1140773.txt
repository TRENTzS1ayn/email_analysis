Hi Richard,

Richard: ... There _has_ been a bit of work on automatically learning DTDs 
from examples of marked-up documents, and there is a _lot_ of work going on 
trying to learn approximate natural language grammars from corpora.

Peter: But are corpora based on XML (I know they could, but are they 
actually implemented this way?)

Richard: ... some natural languages cannot be described by context-free 
grammars, and SGML is not even as powerful as general context-free grammars.

Peter: some natural languages, or all othem? Which natural languages can and 
which ones can not? Can you point me to more info regarding this?
