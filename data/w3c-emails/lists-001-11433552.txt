Right, I understand that, but at least the new tidy should take everything that the old tidy takes. Or maybe mostly everything.

In responce to Jany, the purpose of tidy is to take a html file that's not well-formed and clean it up and make it well formed. If the tighter it is, the better, then why not just make a program that checks the html code and return a message saying that the file is well-formed or not?

I agree that there's a lot of Html docs out there on the web are syntaxically garbage. And that's the whole purpose of tidy, I believe, which is take those syntaxically garbage html files that are only understood by the browsers, maybe even not, and make it stick to the real html rules.


Thanks,
Patrick
