Hi Jason,

Can you post a sample file?  I don't know what the WordXP HTML output looks
like.  FYI, we have fixed a couple bugs and generally made Word2000 cleanup
more robust.   You can grab a binary at http://tidy.sourceforge.net.

take it easy,
Charles Reitzel

Good morning everyone, we're finally getting some work done again after this
horrible US disaster (We're in Manitoba Canada)...

And I was wondering if anyone has problems cleaning .htm files generated
from WordXP.

Using Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) with Homesite 4.5.2

Thanks
