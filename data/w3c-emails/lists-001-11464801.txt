Sure Patrick, this is the purpose of tidy. I am probably biased by the
fact that I do not write, HTML but generate it. So, I am very interested
in having a tool (tidy) able to correct the errors, but I do not want it to
guess what I wanted to do if the code is too messy. In this case, I need a
warning to correct my stylesheets.
Actually, I think we agree.
