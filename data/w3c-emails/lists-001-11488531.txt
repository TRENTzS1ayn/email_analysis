I tried one of the files and the error it encountered has to do with Tidy
being a bit over-zealous (imo) about nesting <form></form> tags within a
table.  In my experience, crossing cells is OK for IE and NS, but crossing
rows is not.  This particular error should probably be recast as a warning.
Comments?

take it easy,
Charlie

Right, I understand that, but at least the new tidy should take everything
that the old tidy takes. Or maybe mostly everything.

In responce to Jany, the purpose of tidy is to take a html file that's not
well-formed and clean it up and make it well formed. If the tighter it is,
the better, then why not just make a program that checks the html code and
return a message saying that the file is well-formed or not?

I agree that there's a lot of Html docs out there on the web are
syntaxically garbage. And that's the whole purpose of tidy, I believe, which
is take those syntaxically garbage html files that are only understood by
the browsers, maybe even not, and make it stick to the real html rules.


Thanks,
Patrick
