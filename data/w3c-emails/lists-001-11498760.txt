Hi there, no just the --word 2000

Just enabled the --clean and it didn't make a difference.

Also grabbed the latest build, still nothing...

Any ideas? Does the file I pasted in work on yours?

Thanks

Hi Jason,

I just updated the builds on the home page so it is up to date.  The
Win32 executable is at
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/tidy.win32.v1.9beta.exe

Are you using the --word-2000 and -clean options?

Charlie
