Does this show that the text Tidy is correcting is indeed
non-compliant?  Not just ambiguous but non-compliant, which requires
tidy to clean it to be compliant to either 3.2 or 4.0 ?

In past, I've made each row of a table into a form
(<tr><form...>...</form></tr>) but this is illegal?  What is the
alternative, so that I have table rows of data that can be modified by
replacing the data in the table cells and clicking a "Edit" (submit)
button on the end ?  I have found this very easy for non-tech users to
grasp.
