Now, if the multiple rows of such a markup have to line up, how is that
done?

The structure you've suggested has multiple tables inside forms in each
row; the columns of the table on my row #2 won't necessarily line up
with the columns on the table on row #3.

<table>
<tr><form ...> 
<table><tr><td>..</td><td>..</td><td>..</td></tr></table>  </form></tr>
<tr><form ...> 
<table><tr><td>..</td><td>..</td><td>..</td></tr></table>  </form></tr>
<tr><form ...> 
<table><tr><td>..</td><td>..</td><td>..</td></tr></table>  </form></tr>
...
...
</table>

As is obvious from my original response to Charlie, I do support the use
of specs, but the spec does not currently allow me to do what I'm trying
to do here, so perhaps my past work is stuck being non-compliant.
