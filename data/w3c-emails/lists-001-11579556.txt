Hi Fred,

Thanks for the correction on 3.2.  I'm clear about overlapping block tags.

Not sure about HTML 4, tho.  From
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.2.1

<!ELEMENT TABLE - -
     (CAPTION?, (COL*|COLGROUP*), THEAD?, TFOOT?, TBODY+)>

Clearly I'm no expert, but I read this as requiring at least one TBODY.  But
this is a quibble.

I think the approach Allan and I have used in the past can be considered
deprecated at best.  I have migrated away from this approach because it has
layout problems in IE.  Instead of nested tables, however, I would suggest a
single form and using a bit of Javascript to copy the data into hidden
<input> tags before calling form.submit().

take it easy,
Charlie

Quote from the 3.2 reference spec:

That includes FORMs.

TBODY is optional (implied) and has no effect on the permitted content 
of TD.

In both 3.2 and 4, you can nest a TABLE in a FORM or a FORM in a TD. You
can't have one block-level element overlapping another. (And you can't  have
a FORM in a TD that's inside a FORM).
