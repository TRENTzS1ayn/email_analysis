Dave --

Tidy allows duplicate attribute names inside an element like this:

 <td valign=top valign=top>

It issues a warning regarding the repeated attribute but keeps the
attribute in the document and outputs it in PPrint.

This is causing trouble when output-xml or output-xhtml is on since this
is not legal xml and is being rejected by my xml parser (Xerces).

I propose that when outputting xml, duplicate attributes be eliminated. 
This can be done either in pprint (PPrintAttribute) or in a clean
routine called from parse.

Dave and others, if you let me know where you think it is most
appropriate, I can code up the patches and post them to the list.

Gary
