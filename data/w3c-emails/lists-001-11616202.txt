Thanks for the feedback - the Big5 and Shift_JIS encoding support is
preliminary, is based on earlier code by Rick Jelliffe, and is by default
turned off in the current source (I'm not sure if Charlie turned it on for
the beta builds he release recently). I am currently looking at another bug
I discovered in the process of testing the Big5/Shift_JIS code changes. I'm
not the expert in this area, and I welcome your continued feedback.

Regards, Terry
