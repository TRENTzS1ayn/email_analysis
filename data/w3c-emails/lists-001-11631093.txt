Dear Mr. Raggett!

I just wanted to tell you about a little bug on the HTML Tidy's page (http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/):

There's a sentence saying:
"Microsoft has developed its own optional filter for exporting to HTML, and the 2.0 version is much improved. You can download the filter free from the Microsoft Office Update site."
And the link pointing to "MS Office Update site" points to
http://officeupdate.microsoft.com/2000/downloadDetails/Msohtmf2.htm, but when you get there the server says the page has moved to
http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/2000/Msohtmf2.aspx

So why don't you change the link to the appropriate one?

Also, I would like to say that Tidy is a pretty good program, but IMHO you don't need to include the large support for slide-creating, because Tidy is intended to tidy HTML, not to generate slides. There are a lot of programs for people who want slides. But that's just my opinion.

And the last. I have discovered that tidy changes "?" sign (&mdash; or &#8212; - em dash, U+2014 ISOpub) to simple "-" (&minus; or &#8722; - minus sign, U+2212 ISOtech). I cannot change "?" to &mdash; in the source code, because of the problems in popular browsers, but I still need the long dash. Could you fix this?

And will you please add the support for codepage-1251 (cyrillic windoze)? I suffer from this because I need to publish my docs in windows-1251, but tidy accepts utf-8, so I need to convert my docs in order to get appropriate results. Of course I would migrate to UTF-8 if my hosting will ever let me.
Can I help with this anyhow?

Thanks for reading,
Best regards,
Alexander "Croll" Savenkov.
