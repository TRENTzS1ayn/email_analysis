I'm not Dave, but he forwarded your EMail to the html-tidy mailing list,
and I will respond appropriately.

Like many other things, the Tidy web page hasn't been updated in over a
year, so I'm not surprized some links are out of date. Since the MS page
provides a redirect, I don't see that as a big problem at the moment. But
thanks for pointing it out, and I will endeavour to have future links to
the MS page, updated.

Actually the slide support is only a very small part of the program, and
there have been numerous requests for additional features. But I don't
disagree with your opinion.

This was deliberate, as you say the entities are not well supported in some
versions of the browsers. You didn't have a choice (other than not using
the "-clean" option) in the 04 Aug 00 version of Tidy.

But with the current version of Tidy (soon to be released), you can control
this behaviour with the config option "--ascii-chars no".

At this stage, we don't plan to add support for additional encodings
(although we did add explicit support for Windows-1252 this time round),
but a future version of Tidy is likely to have a more general (plugin)
mechanism for specifying input and output encodings.

If you wish to help with Tidy, I suggest you visit the following site, and
if you are able to, get involved with the development/testing/documentation
of the next and future versions of Tidy.

Hope this helps.
