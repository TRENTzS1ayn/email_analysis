You're missing the distinction between the TBODY *element*, which is 
required (and repeatable), and the <TBODY> *tag*, which is optional:  
<!ELEMENT TBODY O O (TR)+           -- table body --> 

The TBODY element was introduced in HTML4 to allow the separation of 
header and footer rows (the THEAD and TFOOT elements, amazingly!). 

The <THEAD> and <TFOOT> tags are, of course, required if appropriate, 
because all "loose" TR elements belong to an implied TBODY. 

The point I was trying (perhaps not very clearly) to make is that all 
textual content, including its markup, must be contained in TD (or 
TH) elements. And each separate TD element must contain the whole of 
any contained block; they can't span TDs.
