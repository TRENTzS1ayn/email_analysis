Tidy has to put out valid (X)HTML (not considering attribute content
models) or output nothing, unless --force-output yes is used. HTML 4 is
quite clear about where form elements are allowed inside a table, this
is, only inside table headers and table cells, i.e. 'th' and 'td' and
any of their valid descendants where form elements are allowed. So you
can only have either

  <table>
  <tr><td><form>...</form></td></tr>
  ...

or

  <form>
  <table>
  <tr><td><input ...</td>
  ...

NOT constructs like

  <table>
  <form>
  <tr>
  ...
  </form>
  </table>

or

  <table>
  <tr><form>...

or whatever else. This may work for some browsers but there is no
gurantee and certain browsers won't deal with it as users expected.
