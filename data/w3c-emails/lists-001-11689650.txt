I am very interested in the idea of a library version of Tidy - because
that's how I'm using the code. I have created a library that includes only
the parser, based on the 4 Aug 2000 release.

I don't see anything at the Source Forge site about a library version. Would
it be possible for you to let me know when issues like design of the API,
memory management, initialisation/termination, etc. are being discussed?

Thanks

- rick

Yes, thought has been given, but it wasn't a goal for the current
standalone version. We hope to look at doing that for the library version
of Tidy.
