Yes! The TBODY element is required (i.e. every TABLE must have a TBODY 
as its sole mandatory component), but you don't need to mark its 
beginning or end with a tag.

If the start tag is optional, then there has to be some required content 
that isn't shared with any other "competing" (*) element having an 
optional start tag (obviously: otherwise you have an ambiguous 
specification). Here, it's TR: although this can also turn up in THEAD 
and TFOOT, each of those has a required start tag, so if you find a TR 
hanging around loose, it must be part of an implied TBODY.

(*) by which I mean any other element valid in the same context: here, 
immediately enclosed in a TABLE.

(However, "#IMPLIED" is an SGML keyword that applies to *attribute* 
declarations ...)

Actually, the HTML4 spec has a very good summary of the features of SGML 
that HTML uses. Section 3, "On SGML and HTML", and in particular (for 
present purposes) 3.3.3 "Element declarations".
