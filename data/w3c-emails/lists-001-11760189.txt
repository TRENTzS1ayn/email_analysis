Tags delimit elements. The term "tag" is commonly abused and totally
misused, think of things like "img tag" or "alt tag" (=> img element,
alt attribute). There are only three tags using XML terminology,
start-tags, end-tags and emtpy-element tags.

The same goes for the html, head and body element. The minimal HTML 4
document would be something like

  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">
  <title>...</title>
