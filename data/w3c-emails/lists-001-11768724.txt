I just installed tidy and am using it inside XEmacs. Overall, it's a great 
help. Thanks to author.

Unfortunately, tidying little chunks at a time is not so convenient, since the 
code assumes it's fed a complete html doc. I use switches --tidy-mark no 
--doctype omit but it still insists there is no title, and inserts it. I 
re-compiled it after commenting out the HasTitle if block. There should be a 
better way like a simple switch that lets tidy know that only part of a file is 
being submitted. Or did I miss it?
