The "library" is mentioned, but briefly. While some of us have had some
initial thoughts for a library, we really haven't started having design
discussions - that will probably happen after we release the current
standalone version of Tidy.

To be informed of what is going on with Tidy development, I recommend you
get involved by joining the "tidy-develop" mailing list (and move this
current discussion from the "html-tidy" mailing list). You can find more
details at :

<http://tidy.sourceforge.net> or <http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidy>
