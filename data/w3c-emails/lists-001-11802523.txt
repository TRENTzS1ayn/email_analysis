I fully understand what you are saying.  My assertion, though, is that if 
Tidy is changed to "straddle the fence" and generate invalid HTML, then 
Tidy ceases to be a useful tool for me and perhaps for others as well.  
Whether that invalid HTML "works" on IE or Netscape is immaterial to me.

I'm simply pointing out that a change such as you are advocating may have 
deleterious effects on Tidy's user base.
