Hi, Lee

Did you create C++ classes, or did you just get the source to compile as
C++? 

If classes, did you manage to eliminate all globals, so the classes can be
used in a multithreaded environment? Did you separate out the parsing code
so it can be used independently?

If the answer to all these questions is 'yes', I'd be very interested!

Thanks

I have recently successfully completed a conversion of tidy to C++.  Is
anyone interested?
