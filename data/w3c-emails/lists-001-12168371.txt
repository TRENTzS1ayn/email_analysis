I found that the DOCTYPE created by the latest tidy is not the same as the 
one created by the 04aug00 version.

When I turn on "output-xhtml" and set "doctype" to auto the latest tidy 
gives me

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">

where the 04aug00 version gives me

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
     "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

Since the DTD file is missing from the DOCTYPE, it blew up my XML parser.

Although the HTML code might actually be 3.2, since I turned on 
"output-xhtml", shouldn't the DOCTYPE be a XHTML DOCTYPE instead?

Also, uppercase-tags and uppercase-attributes don't seem to be working, I'm 
I missing something?

Thanks,
Patrick
