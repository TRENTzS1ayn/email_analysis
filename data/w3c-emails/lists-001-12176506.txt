There were a lot of problems related to DOCTYPE in the 04 Aug 00 version,
which we have attempted to address in the current code.

The current implementation will output a XHTML DOCTYPE for "doctype:auto"
only if the document is/appears to be XHTML Strict, Transitional or
Frameset.

So I believe Tidy is acting correctly in regards to your HTML 3.2 document.

To quote :

<http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/>

"4.2 Element and attribute names must be in lower case

XHTML documents must use lower case for all HTML element and attribute
names. This difference is necessary because XML is case-sensitive e.g. <li>
and <LI> are different tags."


I'm not the expert in the area of DOCTYPEs, so if you still think there is
a problem, please provide additional details and a test case that
demonstrates the problem.

Hope this helps.
