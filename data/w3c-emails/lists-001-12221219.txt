Is it really necessary to recode yet another fork of Tidy in C++?

I haven't had much time to look at it but one of the guys who worked for me
did a C++ wrapper for Tidy based on the same forwarding model we used for
our very successful expatpp wrapper for expat.

When something is written in a clean OO design (as Tidy seems to be - NOT
back-ported from C++) it's pretty easy to wrap in C++ and retain the
original source to avoid compatibility problems.

If you have really good reasons for forking off a separate C++ development,
that's great and we may be interested in helping, otherwise I suggest the
wrapper approach is superior and given inline method compilation, adds
almost no overhead.

Note: when polished, our wrapper will be contributed back to the Tidy
community, it's just that I've been really really busy with other issues,
mainly MacOS/X driven and I don't let any source out the door until I've
OK'd what's in it.
