The maintenance of HTML Tidy has moved to
http://tidy.sourceforge.net and you are advised to download the
latest version which fixes a number of bugs. You are invited to
submit change requests and details of problems you have found.

Note that Tidy doesn't produce an output file when it comes
across severe errors requiring human attention. Examples of
this are missing trailing quotes in attribute values, and
missing closing ">" for tags.

Barry may well find what he wants if he looks at the configuration
options. Tidy works by applying rules to build a clean parse tree
which it then pretty prints provided there are no severe errors.
