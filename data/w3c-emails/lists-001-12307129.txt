Hi Patrick,

I took a quick look.  I noticed that you had turned off warnings.  There are
many accessibility and proprietary warnings, e.g. "<img> missing "alt"
attribute", etc.  See attached error file.  These HTML 4 issues may be
preventing the assignment of an XHTML DOCTYPE, which presumes HTML 4
compliance.  Can you reproduce the problems with smaller files?

thanks,
Charlie
