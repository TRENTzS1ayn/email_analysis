Hi Eric,

go to the tidy webpage at http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/. There
you'll find a link (section "downloading tidy" to
http://perso.club-internet.fr/dpo/rpm/ which has an rpm package for red
hat linux.

If you are using a different linux and the red hat rpm does not work for
you, just download the source code from the tidy webpage (pretty far
down the page). Make shure to get the Unix .tgz file. Then untar it via
"gtar -xzvf tidy4aug00.tgz" and use the make command "make tidy" to
produce the binary. Then moove the binary to your ~/bin diretory.
