If you go to the home page <http://tidy.sourceforge.net>, you will find
some recent builds for various platforms. Unfortunately I can't access
SourceForge right at the moment, so I can't give you more details.

I am planning on running a nightly cron job that uploads to the web site,
the latest sources (tarballs?) and binaries for the platforms supported by
SourceForge's compile farm. I was in the middle of doing that when
SourceForge apparently wandered away...

Regards, Terry
