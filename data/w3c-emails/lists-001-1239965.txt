You mean SGML and XML DTDs: you can express any kind of structure (that
can be captured as directed, cyclic graph) in SGML and DTD.  A grammar
abstracts away certain aspects to reduce the amount of markup needed.

People involved in this area may be interested in exploring the Schematron 
toolkit, which is a schema language for XML based on making
assertions about the presence or absense of patterns (guarded XPaths) in
an XML document.  This allows non-regular-expression-based patterns in a
document to be reported or required.

It is a very simple language, and people find it pretty friendly.
