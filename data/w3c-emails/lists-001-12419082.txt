[I originally sent this to the Tidy-dev list and got no response, so perhaps
that was the wrong place]

I tried out the enclose-block-text: yes option on the Sep 1 cut (Sep 15
build) of tidy [win32] with these strange results. It seems to be disturbed
by inline elements, only starting the <p> at the first raw text.

While I am here, I didn't see any response to Guillaume Rousse's query about
"spacing between siblings" [html-tidy@w3.org 9 Aug]. I would support the
call for an option to disable the generation of extra blank lines in the
output, or even suppress them entirely. There is "pretty print" and there is
bloated!


Cheers,

Rick Parsons
