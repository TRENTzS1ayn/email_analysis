Hi - and many thanks for an excellent utility: never realised how bad my
HTML was (and is - lots of changes I still need to make!)

A wee bug in the Mac BBEdit plug-in - the following error is reported
when an ampersand is part of an URL:
Warning: unescaped & or unknown entity "&title"

To put it in context, the line concerned (variations of which are used
extensively in my sites) is:
<a href="http://uk2.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?pc=DY102JL&title=Trinity+Methodist+Bookshop,+Kidderminster">Map</a>

Is it possible to make Tidy recognise that the "&" is actually part of
an URL rather than an entity and is therefore acceptable?

Best regards and, once again, my thanks and appreciation,

Phil Groom,
Webmaster, UK Christian Bookshops Directory.
