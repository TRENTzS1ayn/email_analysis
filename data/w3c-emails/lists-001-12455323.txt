Hey, I agree; Tidy showed me where I didn't think I had errors.

Does anyone have an idea of how to do this properly? :

<IMG SRC="..." ALT=".." BORDER=0>

This happens on a number of Apache-generated pages, as well as a ton of
hand-made ages I've seen.

..and how can we really promote proper pages?  Both these questions
might not be appropriate for this forum, so please send big responses
back to me personally if you're in doubt or think I've strayed from the
list here.
