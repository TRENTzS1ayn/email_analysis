No. Try

  <a href='script?a=1&sect=cool'>...</a>

in early Navigator versions, you will get a section sign in place of the
'&sect' as you should. You must encode ampersands that are not meant to
be entity or character references as &amp;, Tidy does this for you and I
am not aware of any browser (expect early Amaya versions) that doesn't
deal with it properly.
