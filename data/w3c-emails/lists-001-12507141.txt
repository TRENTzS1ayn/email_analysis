While I read all such bug reports, I'm not an expert in many of these
areas, so I don't respond unless I have an answer worth listening to.

However, responding to possible bug reports is made much easier if the
person reporting the problem describes in detail the version of Tidy, any
command line options, any configuration file settings, a simple test case
(if possible) that illustrates the problem, and information on what they
tried to find the cause of the problem - saying "it doesn't work" doesn't
get much attention.

And preferably if the bug is reported through the bug trackers at
<http://sourgeforge.net/projects/tidy>, it has a much better chance of not
being ignored.
