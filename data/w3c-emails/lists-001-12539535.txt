Subject: net tidy for mac

To Whom It May Concern:

I am looking for a version of Net Tidy for Mac.  I am running OS 9.1 on
my computer.  Can you direct me to the correct version of Net Tidy for
my system?  Or, if there is not a Net Tidy veersion for Mac OS 9.1, can
you direct me to something comparable  ...preferably free.

THANKS for your advice.  I appreciate your time, effort and advice.
