Does anyone know of a technical document that might discuss the appropriate
behavior by a program parsing html that indicates appropriate alternatives
for handling invalid escapes?  For instance, if a program hits the html
string
<A HREF="http://www.somestory.com/story1.html">hit&run accident</a>

what are the recommended (or perhaps required) behaviors in interpreting
&run?  Some applications seem to leave things alone, some delete the invalid
escapes, and some replace the escape with an 'error' character...  Are all
these 'correct' behaviors?
