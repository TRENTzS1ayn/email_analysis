"&run " is canonically equivalent to "&run; " in SGML with the HTML 4
SGML declaration, thus it would be treated as entity reference.

Section B.1 of HTML 4 recommends "If it encounters an undeclared entity,
the entity should be treated as character data.", i.e. rendered as the
string "&run ". In general it is an error in the document and HTML 4
does not define how to deal with general error conditions.
