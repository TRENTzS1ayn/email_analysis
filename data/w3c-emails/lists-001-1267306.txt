Sami --

My changes to JTidy won't _require_ the Xerces DOM classes, only _allow_
them for people who want to use them instead of JTidy's DOM classes. 
We'll leave it so that they can get the Xerces DOM classes themselves.

I should be able to put those changes in today or tomorrow.  Most of the
method implementations will be null (we won't support DOM 2 (yet)) but
at least the compile will work.
