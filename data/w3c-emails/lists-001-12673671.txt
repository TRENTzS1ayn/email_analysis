Where 'between' tables? Any example?

Hm, unless you provide an example of your input I can badly say Tidy
must not do so, but it sounds like it should not, consider

  <table>
  <tr><th>...</th><th>...</th></tr>
  <tr><td></td>   <td>...</td></tr>
  </table>

if Tidy removes the empty data cell, the table semantics would be
changed.

This sounds to be a problem of "HTMLTransit" not of HTML Tidy?!
