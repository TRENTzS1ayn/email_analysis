Dan, could you be a bit more specific with what version of Tidy you used,
and what config and/or command line options you used.

The reason I ask is that I am currently trying to track down a bug in the
current (01 Oct 01) version of Tidy when using the Big5 or Shift-JIS
encodings (and appropriate options to Tidy) ONLY, where the line wrapping
algorithm has a problem (it causes NULL characters to be output).

Regards, Terry
