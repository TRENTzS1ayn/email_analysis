I found a way to right click my *.HTML file I just wrote anywhere on my
windows 98, and "send to" a batch file in the same directory as tidy.exe,
and it makes files in the directory you are working in. works great,

Is this what you mean?

Is there any way to run Tidy on the entire contents of a directory under
windows ?

Thank you,
