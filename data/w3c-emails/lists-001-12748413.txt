Hi,

I'm very pleased with the tidy.exe tool.
- But I'm not that sattisfied with the way my ServerSide comments are
handled:
 <<CalendarSearch.asp.before>>  <<CalendarSearch.asp.after>>  <<tidy.txt>> 

Cmd:> tidy -config tidy.txt -m CalendarSearch.asp
The paragraph with "<!-- VSS Keywords -->" are all joined on one line

Is it my config-file which is missing some entries, or is TIDY.EXE (vers
30th April 2000) not able to handle this ?

Best regards
Per Balling  (pebal@tdc.dk)
