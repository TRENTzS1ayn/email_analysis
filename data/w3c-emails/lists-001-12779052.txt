I think your problem might be because you are using an older version of
Tidy. I had no problem with your sample on my platform using the 04 Aug 00
version of Tidy and newer unreleased versions of Tidy (admittedly I didn't
use the "-m" option to modify the original input file).

The only other thing I would say, you might want to also use the
"fix-bad-comments: no" option in your config file.

Hope this helps.

Regards, Terry
