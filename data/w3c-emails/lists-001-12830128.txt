Yes XML is supposed to enable the ease of web based development among
other things but poor implementations of standards continue to make a
mess out of our every day work.

Interesting and practical. Can I hope for sourcecode lying around
somewhere on the web?

Let's not talk about forms, I had much trouble building that grid
interface out of xhtml/css2 ;-)

Okie dokie. I am still hoping that the java version of Tidy might be
used instead of the tidy/com wrapper combo after all. The grid interface
should work just fine in Mozilla (and I'm sure there's room for getting
better thanks to a solid CSS support), it would be sad to find out all
this work will be useless in other browsers. Also, Jtidy would be easier
for me to extend.

Anyway, I'll just start experimenting while keeping an eye on the
tidy.sourceforge page. Promise I will report back with any
implementation + documentation to put in the pot as well. Thanks for
your reply.

Kindest regards,

Manos
