hello,

i am using html tidy for a long time now. i must say it is one of
the most importand programms for me. only thing i want to ask is
when there will be a new version for it ? e.g. supporting better
tag formating, indenting etc. this would be really cool and i
really would like to see html-tidy development continues.

greets.
