hello,

just found out of the html-TIDY CVS and checked it out. everything
works fine so far and i am happy that you continue the development
for it (not as i worried in my last mail, but i only knewed about
the homepage with the aug00 release)

but here are some stuff i dont like and i would be happy
if they may be rethought..

- i dont like color="#000000" beeing replaced with color="black"
  (so far i deleted the whole structure in the code to avoid this
   happening)

- i dont like color="#ffffff" becomes color="#FFFFFF" this was
  far better in tidy from aug 2000. i think it really should
  follow the uppercase lowercase flag of tidy.

- when indenting the <br> tag will get addational line and spaces
  looks like this <space>=#

        <br>
########

  the new line with ##### should simulate the space here. its a bit
  annoying.

- one of my html pages have some tags like <select> </select> in them
  i tidy seem not to support them, i would be happy to be able to do
  a mask in a configuration or getting an option in tidy to have unknown
  tags beeing threated as elements that should be indented correctly.
  e.g. tag is unknown but user knows what they do so please indent them
  as you would indent <center> </center> or similar tags. <html> </html>

i am not subscribed to the list so please reply with CC to me as person.
thank you and keep up the cool work.. tidy is cool and most importand.
