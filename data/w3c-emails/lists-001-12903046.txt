Tidy does handle PHP code references between <?php ... ?> as well as the
<script> ... </script> format. Tidy does not clean up code created by PHP
statements such as <? echo "<TABLE><TR><TD>This is incomplete</TABLE>"; ?>

But, feel free to contribute any patches for better PHP support to
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/
