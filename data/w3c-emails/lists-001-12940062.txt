The latest version of tidy automatically replaces hex color values with the 
corresponding names. The code looks as if this was supposed to become a 
configuration option in the future but is currently hardcoded to yes.

I believe the default should be to not replace colors -- "#000000" is just as
valid as "black".

The option probably should allow conversions in both directions, i.e.

        ColorAttributes: symbolic|hexadecimal|asis
