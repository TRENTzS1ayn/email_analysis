Good find.  Thanks.  Have submitted bug #477643.  Bj?rn, it appears you
intended this behavior to be configurable.  Do you agree we should add the
config option?  My suggestion is to make a simple --replace-color yes|no
option to work in concert with your existing code and leave the
bidirectional conversion Klaus is requesting as a future task.

Also, the list of portable color names is much bigger than the 16 HTML4
colors.  See Danny Goodman's "Dynamic HTML" or
http://www.webflex.nl/support/htmltag/colornames.html  Comments appreciated.

take it easy,
Charlie

The latest version of tidy automatically replaces hex color values with the 
corresponding names. The code looks as if this was supposed to become a 
configuration option in the future but is currently hardcoded to yes.

I believe the default should be to not replace colors -- "#000000" is just
as
valid as "black".

The option probably should allow conversions in both directions, i.e.

        ColorAttributes: symbolic|hexadecimal|asis
