thanks exactly my point, it cannot be done.

Macro functions as you suggest could help resolve quoting issues but cannot fix
something like

 <script type="application/javascript" language="Javascript1.2">
 var referer=document.referer; document.write("<"); if (referer)
 {document.write("IMG SRC=some.gif>");} else document.write("SPAN 
 color=red>Invalid source");}; document.writeln("</SPAN>");
 </script>

Code like this is very popular with ad networks to circumvent ad filtering
software, so tidy will almost certainly see something like this on many pages.

Fixing this code would require understanding, and in similar cases even 
modifying the program logic, which for general program code would be
equivalent to solving the Halting Problem.
