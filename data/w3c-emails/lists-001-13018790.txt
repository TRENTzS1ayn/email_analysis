I am not aware of any PHP beautifier, although there is a good chance someone 
has written one. phptidy was given as an example of an "external" beautifier.
Depending on your PHP style, the C pretty printer cb may work.

Since tags and PIs are not valid in attributes, tidy's behavious is correct
(not from a PHP programmer's perspective, of course).

A tidy compatible way that will also survive other editing tools is to change

to

<?php
  $URL = "http://".$HTTP_HOST.$SCRIPT_NAME;
  echo "<a href=\"http://www.tranexp.com:2000/InterTran?type=url&amp;from=eng&amp;to=pob&amp;url=$URL\">translate<a>";
?>
