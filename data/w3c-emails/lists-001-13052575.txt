Color names introduced in HTML 3.2 but implemented by browser vendors before
the spec was finalized.

Netscape 1.1(!) added support for hex values but not for names
<URL:http://home.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/bg/>

Netscape 1.22 interprets all color names as blue
<URL:http://www.htmlhelp.com/design/accessibility/tips.html#body_colors>

IBM WebExplorer 1.2 has color support for hex values but not for names.

No doubt user agents should have supported color names. They don't.

Following the principle that "an implementation must be conservative in
its sending behaviour, and liberal in its receiving behaviour" (RFC 791
Internet Protocol) choosing something all browsers understand, whether
or not they comply with standards, would be reasonable.

IMHO it should be specified what the canonical version of a document is, 
otherwise running tidy multiple times against the same input document will 
result in a different output document every time (which makes it absolutely 
useless in an environment with version control because you end up checking in 
modifications which are just tidy's mood of the day).

Why?
