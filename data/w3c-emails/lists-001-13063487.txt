Use a backend lookup-table (I'd suggest *dbm) and select substitutions
from it.  Devise a new class only if the construct in question hasn't
been seen before.

Then you can have a tidy-css program to generate the required stylesheet
from the dbm.  That's a sufficiently trivial task to be done as with an
hour or so of Perl hacking.
