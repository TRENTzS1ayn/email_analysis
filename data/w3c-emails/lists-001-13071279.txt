Implement a clairvoyance module? It's hard to detect logic in random
tagsoup. In my experience, Tidy does what it can. The option to just
ignore the font tags and drop them from the output is invaluable in the
case were you want to impose a generic site-wide style with class-less
selectors. It would be nice if I could do some easy preprocessing: add a
LINK element to all output, for example. I doubt if it would be possible
to prevent all those c1/c20 classes by mapping them to existing classes
(or element selectors) in linked stylesheets.
