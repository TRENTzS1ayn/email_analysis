Please do (I use Win32).  And if the associated source code explains what 
is being checked or the reasons for specific checks, then please make the 
source available too.

Accessibility checking would be a welcome addition to Tidy.  Currently, I 
implement this in a limited fashion by validating to a "stricter" custom 
version of the HTML 4.01 DTD, but of course that's just a syntax check.  A 
semantic checker would be better.

Which "overview.html" specifically (so that I may duplicate your reported 
results)?

In looking over the sample error report (and bearing in mind that I don't 
have the source document), some of the entries appear a bit odd at first 
glance.  However, I'll wait until I've had a chance to try it myself before 
offering specific comments.
