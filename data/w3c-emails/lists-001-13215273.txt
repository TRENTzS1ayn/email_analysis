I will try to make binaries available in a couple of days. I will post a

The purpose of this discussion is to determine how best to make the source
available - it is not quite ready for release. What I am really waiting on
is documentation - I think that would be more useful to explain what is
checked.

This is the document that came with the "04 Aug 00" release of Tidy.

I'm not the expert in this area, so any feedback is welcomed.
