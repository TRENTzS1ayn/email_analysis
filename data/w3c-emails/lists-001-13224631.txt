At the moment, the Accessibility warnings are similar to those for the rest
of Tidy. There was talk at one time of improving the Tidy error msgs to be
similar to what you proposed above - I think that will have to wait for a
future version.

What I haven't done - in the original code, there was a "-notidy" option to
only do accessibility checking and none of the rest of the Tidy stuff; I
didn't think this was necessary, so I didn't implement it. But what I could
do is add some kind of divider line between the accessibility error section
and the other errors.

Waiting on further info from Mike/Chris regards error msgs.

I guess if you specify "-access 1" and you get no errrors/warnings, the
"level" of compliance would be "A"; similarly for "-access 2"/"AA" and
"-access 3"/"AAA".

Perhaps this is something that Mike/Chris could be thinking about regards
any accessibility error summary.

Perhaps the grammar in the first error could be improved.

As for the invalid file extension issue, I need to be careful not to have a
platform specific implementation of the checking code - I rewrote the
original Windows centric code with a more general solution that I haven't
really checked into since I wrote it.
