I'm curious about some of the uses people are making of tidy.

I use tidy on my own code, or that of co-workers, so that we can improve it.
I even have used it on pages on the web that are crashing my browser - I
then send suggested changes to the authors.

But you list a new use that intrigues me-  running tidy on code that
you didn't write ... for what is this processed html being used?
