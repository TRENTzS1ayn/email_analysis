You raise a basic question: are the W3C guidelines sufficiently general to 
apply to non-U.S.  And, vice versa, are the W3C guidelines specific enough 
so that compliance with W3C accessibility guidelines is sufficient for U.S. 
federal guidelines?  I took a quick look at the w3c link below and didn't 
see any mention of the issue.

wondering out loud,
Charlie
