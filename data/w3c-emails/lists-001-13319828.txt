Documentation would be preferred, but in its absence, and presuming that 
the source indicated why particular errors or warnings were being 
generated, then even "not quite ready" source would help me to make 
intelligent comments regarding the accessibility checks.  Note that for 
this purpose, I don't intend to compile the source, but rather merely read 
it to understand why a particular warning or error is being raised.
