We can identify the priority level of the accessibility error in the
warning/error message if that would be helpful.

Our initial thought was that since you specified the error level on the
command line that you didn't need it for each error/warning message.

We're working on some explanation text for each warning/error and expect it
to be done in 2 weeks.

I'm not sure how this would be integrated with the program. Should we have a
"verbose" mode where you get a about a paragraph of explanation for each
warning/error?
