The reason I ask for the ability to distinguish accessibility messages vs. 
other Warnings and Errors is to give me flexibility in how my application 
responds to the condition.

For example, I personally used Tidy to screen HTML that gets posted to our 
in-house Content Management System (CMS).  I run tidy in a CGI by shelling 
out to a command line and grab the standard error.  I filter this to only 
show Warnings and Errors and throw away the "info" text that sometimes 
appears.  We are not a government body, so I can see an initial deployment 
where we run Tidy to show accessibility priority 1 items, but treat them as 
warnings - i.e. let publication proceed.  Currently, we do not allow any 
warnings at all.  This way, I can raise authors' awareness of accessibility 
issues without unilaterally forcing a large editing burden on them.

How about a compromise?   Treat all accessibility messages as a separate 
severity (e.g. Info, Warning, Access, Error).  This, in combination with 
the existing command line option, will give me all the flexibility I need.

Thinking about it, this change would make a great test case for the library 
version of Tidy.  I.e. it doesn't appear to have required substantial 
changes to the parser or pretty printer.  Thus, in theory, you could use 
Tidy to load the tree and implement the accessibility checker by traversing 
that tree (with an API like we discussed back in May).  If possible, I'd 
like to do just that when we get to the library form of Tidy Real Soon Now.

take it easy,
Charlie
