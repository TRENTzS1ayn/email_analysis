Speaking for myself, that should be sufficient.

I could see a future version of Tidy possibly giving the user more control
over what gets displayed (e.g. identify the priority level of the
accessibility error in the warning/error message; "verbose" mode, etc) - I
would try to do that without introducing lots more new configuration
options - maybe a more general solution to setting configuration variables
(e.g. "--some-option {var1=setting1, var2=setting2}") would be something
that would be useful in a library version of Tidy.

As to solving the problem of "verbose" mode now, I would model it using
what the current version of Tidy does for its summary. I plan to mock up a
starting point for this based on the current accessibility code, and make
the binaries available, so people can get a feel for it, before we get
carried away.
