hi,
I solved the problem spacing using charencoding utf8 - somehow that worked.

Now a lot of sites can be solved like that with tidy. But I recently
discovered that
pages that uses javascript and are uncommented can cause a problem since
these can contain < - chars or similar interuptive characters that causes
xhtml documents to not become well-formed. As a solution you would put 
a CDATA around it...and that would be enough to solve it...I saw some email
commenting on this but I can't find it. Anyone got an answere for this one?
Howard
