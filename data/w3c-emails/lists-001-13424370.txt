Here are 2 examples of the text we are preparing that describes the
accessibility error/warning.

We're not sure if these should be part of the Tidy program of stored in a
seperate file. If stored in a seperate file, this text would be matched to
the Tidy error/warning by a program that calls Tidy. There will be about
70 - 80 of these text descriptions.


Example 1:
Tidy error is:  <img> missing "alt" text
Description is:
Priority 1
All images (JPEG, GIF, PNG, Animated GIF, Image Map, etc.) must include
 "alt" text. Alternate text should be concise (i.e. 10-12 words maximum). If
"alt" text exceeds 150 characters, use the "longdesc" attribute along with a
descriptive link ("d-link") to describe the image. Any words displayed in
the image should also appear in the "alt" text description.

Example 2:
Tidy warning is: "alt" text is suspicious (filename)
Description is:
Priority 1
All images require text equivalents, but "alt" text must also meet certain
criteria, otherwise it may be considered suspicious. For example, "alt" text
may be considered unacceptable if image filenames and/or image file
extensions (i.e. alt="xmas_tree.gif") are used instead of an actual text
equivalent.


Are these descriptions too long or too short for Tidyish messages? Other
comments?
