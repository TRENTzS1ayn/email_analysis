Hi Dave,

I was experimenting with tidy and found a bug. 
When you the `quiet' option is together with the gnu-emacs
option the filename isn't displayed in the errors:

    (null):4:1: Warning: <style> lacks "type" attribute
    (null):47:1: Warning: <table> lacks "summary" attribute

This is because the assigment

    currentFile = filename;  /* for use with Gnu Emacs */

is inside of HelloMessage(), which isn't called when `quiet' is turned on.

Friendliest regards,

Geert Kloosterman
