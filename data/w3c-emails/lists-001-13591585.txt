So would I.

Initially, this may just work on a one file at a time basis. I guess it could be

extended to work on many files, e.g. all the files in a directory, or even
navigating links so as to highlight broken links too.

How about being able to create and save batch files/shell scripts full of tidy
commands, so that inexperienced users can use the GUI to easily put
together regression testing of their pages?

Just a thought.
