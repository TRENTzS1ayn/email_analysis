Greetings ! I am trying to find a tool to not allow certain HTML tags such
as the default class=MsoNormal and other tags that is not in the specified
style sheet. Our users have access to the HTML editor and can view the code
and can add tags. I need to prevent them from adding certain tags. Does your
tool do that?
Please let me know if you have any further questions. 
Thank You In Advance! 


Best Regards!
