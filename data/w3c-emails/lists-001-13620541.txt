CDATA escaping is done in current code base for XHTML output.  But Tidy has
to know it is XHTML.  

Be sure either to use --output-xhtml yes or declare the XHTML namespace as
the default in the <html> tag.

take it easy,

Cheers for the notes on xml-spacing problem...
I've got it under control using encoding...it seems to have done the trick.
The problem with un-commented javascript seems to give another problem.
I can insert a CDATA to get rid of it...

So javascripts that are not commented out...<!-- -->
seems to give an error when I transform with xsl. This is due to
scripts contain expression for comapring like (<,> etc)...thus this
causes xsl to misunderstand the xhtml since it does not become 
well formed .... ideally...this should be commented using CDATA.

Any comments...cheers!!!!
Howard
