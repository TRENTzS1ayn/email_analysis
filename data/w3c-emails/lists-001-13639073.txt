Great idea.  But, no, Tidy won't do that for you.  What Tidy lacks is a CSS
parser, which is a necessary ingredient for what you describe.  There are
Java and Perl CSS parsers.  Look for Simple Api for Cascading Style Sheets,
aka SAC.

Tidy does implement partial CSS matching rules, but I wouldn't bet your
website on them at this point.  I see this as "yet another" excellent
application for the library version of Tidy.

take it easy,
Charlie

Greetings ! I am trying to find a tool to not allow certain HTML tags such
as the default class=MsoNormal and other tags that is not in the specified
style sheet. Our users have access to the HTML editor and can view the code
and can add tags. I need to prevent them from adding certain tags. Does your
tool do that?
Please let me know if you have any further questions. 
Thank You In Advance!
