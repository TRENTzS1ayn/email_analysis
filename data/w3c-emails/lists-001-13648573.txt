Allan is right.  You have to consider who will be reading your page.

The real limiting factor, I think, is the list of entities understood by
Netscape 4.x, which is very limited.  For many folks, this is the current
"Lowest Common Denominator" to which they code their web pages.

After that, the next limiting factor may be HTML 3.2, which does not
recognize as many character entities as HTML 4.01, especially left-right
quotes.

take it easy,
Charlie

Dan;

Perhaps you'll need to ask your question with reference to the standards
to which Tidy tries to conform.  For example, I found that tid yutends
to clean up those characters which are specific to a certain browser but
not accepted by other browsers.  I believe the accepted set of
characters is quite confining.

Is the resulting document unreadable?  Or difficult to maintain
thereafter?

In order to remain as close to compliancy as possible, what do you
suggest?  Do you suggest that someone look into an option to accept
certain other characters (&copy;, &trade;, etc) ?  It might be easier if
you indicate what you'd prefer.
