Hello, Charlie.

Actually I made a GUI and sent it to Sami Lempinen last friday,
and he seemed to like it:

I was now waiting for him to put it into the CVS repository
or give me CVS access.

Meanwhile you can download and look at the GUI here:
http://hjem.wanadoo.dk/~mob18168/jtidy/Tidy2.jar

It's really easy to use, just double-click on the JAR file or type
java -jar Tidy2.jar   on the prompt. (Java must be installed).


I think the GUI is also quite useful for the more experienced,
becaurse you can play around with the tidying options and see
the changes on the HTML 'live'.


If there is interest I'll gladly make my simple GUI into something
more.

It looks nice (I don't have Windows, so I can't try it).
