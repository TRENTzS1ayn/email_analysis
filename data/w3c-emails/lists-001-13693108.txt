Greetings.


  I am considering using jtidy as part of a tool I am creating to 
generate static pages.  Part of my tool requires the addition of tags 
such as <staticpage> within the html documents.

  Now jtidy obviously complains about this since <staticpage> is not a 
valid html.  I began to look at your source code and manage to have it 
ignore any unknown tag under the <body> scope.  I still am looking a way 
for jtidy to automatically generate the </staticpage> so the document 
becomes automatically xml compliant.

  Ok, my question.  Would you accept the addition of an option within 
jtidy which would cause it to ignore additional tags and just process 
them to become xml compliant?  Off course, this option would be off by 
default to keep jtidy backward compatible (and it makes sense to have 
this option off for most usages).  But this feature might be very 
interesting for other projects simillar to mine where they would want 
their tags remain unprocessed (except for making them xml compliant).

  I am asking because the code change will require many changes within a 
few files.  Thus, its not a simple patch.  I cannot therefore fork my 
own jtidy, watch you guys fixing the main tree and adding features and 
then manually add my feature to each of your new releases.  This is why 
I would like my changes to be brought into the main tree.

  And if you have any suggestion on how to implement it, be my guess. 
 Since this is OO, reverse engineering it to understand what is going in 
is a bit difficult, and my solution might not be the most elegant/optimize.

  BTW, jtidy is great.  I'm glad I have discovered it.  Thanks for the 
product.


Sincerely,
Hans Deragon
