I am curious as to the process at this point.  It looks like the problem I
reported is reproducible.  Will this be fixed in a future version?  Is this
issue tracked in sourceforge?  Do I need to open an issue there or does
someone else do it?

Sincerely,
Michael Goldberg

Actually I can reproduce this with both the current and 04 Aug 00 version.
I had a quick look at the source to see if there was something obviously
wrong, but it wasn't that simple.
