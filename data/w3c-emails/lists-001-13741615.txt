It shouldn't complain since <div> and <span> tags are part of the XHTML
strict specification.  BTW, we are using the normal tidy application and not
jtidy.

Before running our html files through tidy, we add these tags to the top of
the file.  Since they are outside of the <HTML><BODY> elements, tidy moves
them inside those elements and make the rest of the html XML conformant.
Now you have a valid XHTML file that you can access with the DOM.  

In your case, since you are using templates, you could place <div>/<span>
tags in various locations throughout your html template and have your code
use the DOM to replace those tags with the values you desire.
