I do not know JTidy at all, but the C version contains an option to add 
"new" tags.  The following is from Dave's original documentation:

<blockquote>
You can teach Tidy about new tags by declaring them in the configuration 
file, the syntax is:
new-inline-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 new-empty-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 
new-blocklevel-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 new-pre-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
The same tag can be defined as empty and as inline or as empty and as block.
These declarations can be combined to define an a new empty inline or 
empty block element, but you are not advised to declare tags as being 
both inline and block!
Note that the new tags can only appear where Tidy expects inline or 
block-level tags respectively. This means you can't (yet) place new tags 
within the document head or other contexts with restricted content 
models. So far the most popular use of this feature is to allow Tidy to 
be applied to Cold Fusion files.
</blockquote>

I would hope a similar options would be available in JTidy.  Note that 
this does not deal with arbitrary unknown tags, but should work if you 
have a defined set of new, non-html-compliant tags.
