Gary asks
So, where should the duplicate attributes be dropped?
(1) In the built tree
(2) In the pprinted output only

There is already a point in Tidy's execution where unknown and
duplicated attributes are *detected*.  That's where GetToken()
calls CheckAttributes().  The minimal change to Tidy would be
to put it in there, so the answer is (1) in the built tree.

One reason why Tidy does the checking where it does is that there
are a number of tidying steps that delete nodes, which would go
unchecked if alternative (2) were chosen.

There's someone here who needs unknown attributes and duplicated
values to be removed, so I'm editing away on another machine right
now, trying to implement this.
