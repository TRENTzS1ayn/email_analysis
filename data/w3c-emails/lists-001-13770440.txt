Give a break with you logical ideas

I get sick of "website, eye whiplash" on text movement as pictures are
down-loaded off the Internet, because the lazy web-masters have not used
"height" and "width"  which is easy to get from any picture,  but when I
posted this idea on this group I got shot down in flames, so as my revenge I
use <table summary=" "> just so it passes the HTML tidy test

By the way were did you get the GUI version of html tidy?

Hi!

I just downloaded the Windows (GUI) version of the Tidy program and it works
fine. But in order to be of any real useful help I would need some way to
configure which warnings and errors I want.

The best way as I see it would be if I could right click on an errror or
worning in the result and select "ignore this warning / error"

basically I am looking for a tool that verifies not the HTML tags but the
structure of the html document (like that the tables are built up corectly
and so on)

is there any plans on adding this kind of functionality or do you know of
any kind of program that might do what I need?
