IDENTIFICATION OF PROBLEMS WITH TIDYCOM

EncodingSpecial foreign chars. The encoding of chars needs to be
specified in the XML-tag (<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>) and
not just <?xml version="1.0"?>
Scripts (JavaScript?s)Commenting out scripts. Currently uncommented
scripts might contain ambiguous characters that are associated with tags
(>)
Duplicate Attribute Nodes Some pages contain duplicate attributes that
need to be removed. Some pages contains mistakes such as having a double
?align? for a tag when the other ?align? was meant to be ?valign?.
XSL-encoding and special charactersWhen applying the XSL we will need to
somehow replace special characters because the JavaScript strings can
misconceive them.
Attributes that are not given quotesThis can cause errors since they are
interpreted, so ?style=font-family:arial? might become
?font-family:=arial? producing errors.

Any comments,
I'd be grateful!
Cheers,
Howard
