Hi folks,

I am trying to "tidy" (X)HTML fragments. The problem is that Tidy
corrects them as documents, adding html, head and body tags etc.
I tried to prevent this using the "input-xml" option, but this disables
error correction.
Is there a way to achieve fragment correction with  tidy?
Please CC me any answers, I am not subscribed. Thanks for your time.

Kindest regards,

Manos
