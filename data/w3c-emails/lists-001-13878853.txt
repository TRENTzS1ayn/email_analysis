I have been using JTidy successfully for a while, and I am now trying to get
my application working with Java Web Start.  When my app is running from
inside WebStart, I am getting the following exception:

Exception occurred during event dispatching:
java.lang.IllegalAccessError: try to access field
org.w3c.tidy.ParserImpl._parseHead from class
org.w3c.tidy.ParserImpl$ParseHTML
at org.w3c.tidy.ParserImpl$ParseHTML.parse(ParserImpl.java)
 at org.w3c.tidy.ParserImpl.parseDocument(ParserImpl.java) 
at org.w3c.tidy.Tidy.parse(Tidy.java) 
at org.w3c.tidy.Tidy.parseDOM(Tidy.java)

I have seen the old messages about this being a problem with MS VMs, so I
took a look at the WebStart settings, and it is pointing to the JRE 1.3
javaw.exe file.  I have tried running my program with this VM, and it works
fine as long as I'm not running it from WebStart.

Does anyone have any ideas?
