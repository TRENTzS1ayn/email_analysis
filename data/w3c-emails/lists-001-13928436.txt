Hi,
I have been testing out some off the features on tidycom and followed this
maillist for a while.
Lately there has been a lot of talk on upgrades. Is there anyone working
on the COM side of tidy
on this ?

I've tried mailing Andr? Blavier  but I've had no respond.
So I'm putting the question to all of you -
TidyMemToMem(sourceString) - invokes Tidy with sourceString. Returns
tidied string content as a string. (Actually uses a temporary file.) 

now..i get
Error Type:
TidyCOM.TidyObject.1 (0x80020009)
Can't create temporary file

when running with this option...and I wanna run it from a string point.
More generally:
Is tidy the option ?
Say you want to extract some html from a site.
You would use XMLHTTP which would give you the responseText or the Ascii
of the site.
You can run this over XSL however since it won't be well-formed....and
this is how I initially
became interested in tidy. I know CF & XML-spy can check similar
stuff...but they don't clean it
up. I have some issues with tidy that I have posed earlier in mails, but
it is a good tools under development.
If anyone can give me a comment on wheter it is the right tool in this
process it would be much appriciated.

Thanks,
Howard
