Dear Folks,

[From an EMail from Mike Lam]

Be aware that I'm having mail troubles with one of my EMail accounts at the
moment. I am copying the lists directly [a little bit of background - some
changes to Tidy were proposed recently, to add more accessibility checking
- Mike is currently cleaning up the code and error msgs, after various
private discussions between him, myself and Chris Ridpath].

Hmmm. I would agree with the principle of keeping the output (and code
size) of Tidy shorter (smaller). On the other hand, the existing
(non-accessibility checking) Tidy summary works reasonably well, and can't
be lost like a separate HTML file.

I had another idea, not specific to accessibility checking, even before you
wrote this EMail, that might make even more sense to look at now. But
definitely something that needs the opinions of others on the list.

Specifically, either by default, or through an option (which I think I
would prefer), the error output (stderr) produced by Tidy, would be created
as (X)HTML rather than plain ASCII text. I might even go so far as to say
that this error output may not even have to be complete/valid HTML. What I
am really looking for is outputting URLs (pointing to error summaries, tips
etc) as HTML links.

e.g. (I don't know how this will look like in your mail client)

line 63 column 26 - <A HREF="access_errors.html#59">Warning [59]:
&lt;img&gt; missing descriptive text (longdesc/dlink).</A>

Then in any web browser etc, clicking on the link will take you to the
appropriate summary (in the local file "access_errors.html") :

[59] : Priority 1
All images require text equivalents, but 'alt' text must also meet certain
criteria, otherwise it may be considered suspicious. For example, 'alt' text
may be considered unacceptable if image filenames and/or image file
extensions (i.e. alt='xmas_tree.gif') are used instead of an actual text
equivalent.


Everyone's thoughts on the matter?

Regards, Terry
