What I'm saying is that before HTML 4, any file with Chinese,
etc. characters in it is illegal and will not pass the validator,
e.g. http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator , so how could tidy say
"looks like 3.2"?

For example take http://www.geocities.com/jidanni/foreigner.html
$ tidy01nov01 foreigner.html > /dev/null 

HTML Tidy for Linux/x86 (vers 1st November 2001; built on Nov  9 2001, at 00:06:22)
Parsing "foreigner.html"

foreigner.html: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
foreigner.html: Document content looks like HTML 3.2

this has nothing to do with ~/.html-tidy
