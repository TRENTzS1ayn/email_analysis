Hi Dan,

Point taken about the character encoding and HTML version.  In principle,
the Tidy config might not have an impact, but in practice, it may well.

I would assume that Tidy is _not_ applying this logic and is regressing the
HTML version due to some other feature of the document.  Are there other
warnings?  I assume that this build has Asian encodings enabled (#define
SUPPORT_ASIAN_ENCODINGS 1) or are you using -raw?  

Btw, can we use this document as a test case for Big5 encoding?

take it easy,
Charlie

What I'm saying is that before HTML 4, any file with Chinese,
etc. characters in it is illegal and will not pass the validator,
e.g. http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator , so how could tidy say
"looks like 3.2"?

For example take http://www.geocities.com/jidanni/foreigner.html
$ tidy01nov01 foreigner.html > /dev/null 

HTML Tidy for Linux/x86 (vers 1st November 2001; built on Nov  9 2001, at
00:06:22)
Parsing "foreigner.html"

foreigner.html: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
foreigner.html: Document content looks like HTML 3.2

this has nothing to do with ~/.html-tidy
