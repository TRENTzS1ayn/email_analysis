No, there is no option to do what you want. When you Tidy the document, the
following error summary is provided :

You may need to move one or both of the <form> and </form>
tags. HTML elements should be properly nested and form elements
are no exception. For instance you should not place the <form>
in one table cell and the </form> in another. If the <form> is
placed before a table, the </form> cannot be placed inside the
table! Note that one form can't be nested inside another!

However thank you for your example - I discovered a minor bug in the
current (01 Dec 01) version of Tidy that didn't exist in the 04 Aug 00
version, that showed up with your example - I will try to fix shortly.

Regards, Terry
