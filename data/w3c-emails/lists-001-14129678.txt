Newer tidy now uses "black" etc. for color names... isn't this
slightly less portable then the #F000000 jazz?  Is there a way of
turning this off without turning other things off?

By the way, I wanted to obfiscate my mailto: as a brilliant spam defense:

<A HREF="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;
Dan&#32;Jacobson&#32;&lt;jidanni&#64;kimo.&#99;
etc.

but of course tidy spoils my fun... too bad I cant do
<!-- no tidy -->  blah <!-- yes tidy --> or "tidy: no" etc.
to get it to not tidy that area... without resorting to the whole file
not being tidyed in this way thru an option.

note: <!-- no tidy--> etc. are probably a bad mess to get into, and I
probably don't want to obfiscate mailto that badly anymore but it was
an interesting topic.  at least answer my "black" issue above.  the w3
site said #F... was accepted by more browsers.
