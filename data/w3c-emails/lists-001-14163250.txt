I assume you are using the 04 Aug 00 version of Tidy. I believe this is a
known bug (#426885Definition list w/Center crashes), which was fixed
shortly after the 04 Aug 00 version was shipped. You might want to try a
beta version of the current Tidy code - visit <http://tidy.sourceforge.net>
for more details.
