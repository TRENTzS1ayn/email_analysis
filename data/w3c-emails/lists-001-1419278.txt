One possibility is that you use a tag that doesn't belong to HTML as
defined in the DTD to which the doctype declaration points, e.g.:

I don't want <nobr>these words</nobr> broken

Or that the tag itself is OK but the attribute isn't, e.g.:

<table bordercolordark="blue">

You might want to run the offending page through
http://htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/ to see what it says about the
troublesome line.
