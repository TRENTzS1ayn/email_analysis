You do have a valid complaint. I think I noticed some time ago the code was
wrong, but didn't really see a big problem in actual use of Tidy.

Anyway, I have now fixed the code to correctly report that "help" (etc) is
not a valid config option.

Thinking that you actually expected "--help" to operate the same as
"-help", be aware that "-help" explains the use of "--" options, and there
is an existing feature request report (#480988) for supporting the
"standard" --option=value format for parameters, which you can look at :

Thanks for the report.

Regards, Terry
