The HTML specs all require that multiple, adjacent whitespace characters be
collapsed into a single space character.  HTML developers everywhere quite
reasonably depend on this behavior.

take it easy,

Gentlemen, are your sure that you always want to collapse two spaces
at the end of a sentence into one?  Perhaps you can let us "opt out"
of it maybe?   Let's see what Stallman says:

File: emacs,  Node: Sentences,  Next: Paragraphs,  Prev: Words,  Up: Text

Sentences

   The Emacs commands for manipulating sentences and paragraphs are
mostly on Meta keys, so as to be like the word-handling commands.

[...]

   The sentence commands assume that you follow the American typist's
convention of putting two spaces at the end of a sentence; they consider
a sentence to end wherever there is a `.', `?' or `!' followed by the
end of a line or two spaces, with any number of `)', `]', `'', or `"'
characters allowed in between.  A sentence also begins or ends wherever
a paragraph begins or ends.

[...]

   If you want to use just one space between sentences, you should set
`sentence-end' to this value:

     "[.?!][]\"')]*\\($\\|\t\\| \\)[ \t\n]*"

You should also set the variable `sentence-end-double-space' to `nil'
so that the fill commands expect and leave just one space at the end of
a sentence.  Note that this makes it impossible to distinguish between
periods that end sentences and those that indicate abbreviations.

[Dan says: can we please not force us to mess with emacs defaults due
to tidy inflexibility?]

[By the way, i'm still to worried about BGCOLOR="black" etc. to use
newest tidy]
