That is good to know.  Thanks.  It makes a lot of sense in the modern,
kerned and variable pitch font world.  The double space thing is really a
holdover from fixed-pitch fonts, going back, I'd wager, to the typewriter.

FWIW, I started out as a layout editor (Quark) for a journal that adhered
strictly to the Chicago Manual of Style. We used a single space after
periods. Journals like Time, Newsweek, The New Yorker, and more all now use
a single space after periods. I think that this is a standard that is in the
process of changing. I believe the MLA Handbook still requires two spaces
after periods, but it's been a while since I checked.

========================

The HTML specs all require that multiple, adjacent whitespace characters be
collapsed into a single space character.  HTML developers everywhere quite
reasonably depend on this behavior.

take it easy,
