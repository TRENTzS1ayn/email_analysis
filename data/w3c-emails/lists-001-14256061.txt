Personally I always use two spaces at the end of sentences. 
Yes, it does hark back to the days of manual, fixed-pitch 
typewriters, but it is the way I was taught and, more importantly, I 
believe it aids legibility.  With no disrespect to Diane, compare her 
brief message below, to Charlie's.

That the HTML specs require multiple white-space characters 
to be rendered as a single space certainly cleans up the resultant 
the layout, especially when there may be extra carriage-returns 
and/or line-feeds in the source, but it does make it more difficult 
for an author to achieve the desired result.  Perhaps we need a more 
common double-width space character?  Meantime, I am disappointed to 
hear that major publications are changing their style to be, IMHO, 
less legible.

But this is getting a bit off-topic - sorry!  As Tidy's whole 
purpose in life is to legalise documents, I think that it should 
replace the double spaces.  If you disagree with the spec, then it is 
that which should be changed before Tidy.

Just my two penn'th,

Peter
