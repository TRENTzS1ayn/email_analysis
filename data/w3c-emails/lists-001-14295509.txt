To Dave Raggett

Hi, My name is Adrian.

A month or so ago I downloaded 1st page 2000 and I have been using it as my 
primary web development tool.

I realise that this may turn out to be an error on my part but I believe 
their may be a small bug in the "tidy format and fix option"

The following anchor seems to be problematic. (It was generated originally 
by 1st page but I edited it in order to get it to work because the original 
tag was also causing errors):


<a href="pics.zip" onmouseover="window.status='From Jacs Photo Album!!!'; 
return true;" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;">Amata</a>

(you can see it in use at:  
http://www.geocities.com/jacquiememorial/thejackster3.html if you want)


When the tidy option is applied the following changes are made:

<a href="pics.zip" onmouseover="window.status=From Jacs Photo Album!!!; 
return true;" onmouseout="window.status=; return true;">Amata</a>

The removal of these apostrophes brings up a "syntax error" message for char 
15 and a "script error" message (expected ';').

I have also had several other problems of this nature with anchor tags.

Thank you (by the way apart from this small glitch the software is decidedly 
cool)
