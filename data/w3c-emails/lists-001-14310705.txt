The base Tidy code of 04 Aug 00 or later does not appear to have this
problem (at least when I tested it on my platform). I don't know what
version of Tidy is integrated into 1st Page 2000 (I wasn't able to discern
this info from Evrsoft's web site), but I suspect they might be using an
older version of the Tidy code. I suggest you contact Evrsoft directly.

Hope this helps.

Regards, Terry
