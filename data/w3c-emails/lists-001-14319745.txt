spaces at the end of a sentence problem: 

why not terminate sentences with dot&nbsp; ?

Example: (I took the message below)


  Personally I always use two spaces at the end of sentences.&nbsp; Yes, it does hark back to the days of manual, fixed-pitch typewriters, but it is the way I was taught and, more importantly, I
  believe it aids legibility.&nbsp; With no disrespect to Diane, compare her brief message below, to Charlie's. 

  <P>

  That the HTML specs require multiple white-space characters to be rendered as a single space certainly cleans up the resultant the layout, especially when there may be extra carriage-returns
  and/or line-feeds in the source, but it does make it more difficult for an author to achieve the desired result.&nbsp; Perhaps we need a more common double-width space character?&nbsp; Meantime,
  I am disappointed to hear that major publications are changing their style to be, IMHO, less legible.</P>

  <P>

  But this is getting a bit off-topic - sorry!&nbsp; As Tidy's whole purpose in life is to legalise documents, I think that it should replace the double spaces.&nbsp; If you disagree with the
  spec, then it is that which should be changed before Tidy.</P>

  <P>

  Just my two penn'th,</P>

I think this is what you wanted.
