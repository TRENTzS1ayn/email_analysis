Subject: Bug in Tidy (with config file)

The procedure seems to have a problem when calling
tidy's main from a program.

I tracked down the problem: The "ParseConfigFile" function fails to
work correctly because "lookup" function cannot find how to process
a property in config file.

In turn the "lookup" functions fails because "hashtab" is corrupted
(all entries are NULL). A work around (not good one, but makes it
work) is to force tidy to recreate hashtab. I commented out code as
following:

void InitConfig(void)
{
    struct Flag *p;

// if (!initialized)
    {
        initialized = yes;
    
        for(p = flags; p->name != null; ++p)
            install(p->name, p->location, p->parser);
    }

    c = 0;  /* init single char buffer */
}

Regads,
Igor Okulist
