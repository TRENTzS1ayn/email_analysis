Hmmm... not sure what happenned there.  There WERE two spaces on my 
original, but I think some line-wrapping must have taken one out 
somewhere.

Other respondents have pointed out that any action is irrelevant, as 
the spec requires browsers to collapse multiple white-space 
characters to just one, so it is easier for Tidy to do nothing. 
Especially as it is not illegal for a document to contain multiple 
spaces.

TTFN,
