Thanks for the detailed feedback.

This is because object is allowed in the document head and hence
Tidy doesn't know that an implicit <body> start tag is required.

Place a <body> start tag before the <object>

This is due to the way Tidy checks for a missing title before
processing the body. In effect, Tidy generates errors during
parsing, and then applies a few more checks afterwards.
A work around would have been to log the error reports found
during parsing and then merge them in line number order with
those found in the subsequent checks. This would be major
refinement to how Tidy works today.

I am hoping that the next version of Tidy will fix this problem by
checking for an empty title element when moving the title from
the body to the head. Maintenance of Tidy has moved to Source Forge
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/ and a bunch of volunteers have taken
over work on dealing with bug reports and enhancement requests.

I think Tidy could do better, and that further investigation is
justified.

Yes, that looks like a bug.

This is in the hands of the folks working on the Source Forge
code base. You can get a prerelease version from the website
and I am hoping that the official release will come shortly.
See http://tidy.sourceforge,net/

I have agreed to change the W3C Tidy page to match when they do.
