Hello

I have 3 Question,

1  Is there any way to run Tidy on the entire contents of a directory under Unix?

2 Do i need a permission from you to run HTML TIDY as web based on our 
server.

3 Meanwhile i am trying to write a web based version of HTML Tidy in 
cold fusion. So far is I have an upload site where the users upload 
their html files and then HTML tidy runs by CFEXECUTE command. This 
works all fine if my plan was to do just one file at a time and if there 
was no other existing files to cause name conflicts, so I end up 
advancing the program a bit by using CFFILE to do all sorts of renaming, 
except now I cant figure out how I can place the new renamed file back 
into CFEXECUTE. I have tried this silly way but it doesn't work, it 
doesn't seems like Cold Fusion puts the variable in the command for 
me... any ideas please ? note Form.ClientFile is the name of the 
inputted file after all the changes. I would appreciate any ones time.

<CFEXECUTE name="/usr/local/bin/tidy"
arguments="-f /home/user/netscape/baz/public_html/test/error.txt -imu
/home/user/netscape/baz/public_html/test/#Form.ClientFile#"
outputFile = ""
timeout="20">
</CFEXECUTE>

thank you
