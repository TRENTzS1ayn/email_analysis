Doesn't TeX do something more involved with end-of-sentence spacing? 
How much bloat would it add to Tidy to make it smarter about punctuation
at the end of sentences, like TeX?  For the record, I used to be a "two
spaces or die" biggot, but I got over it.  Still, it would be nice if
Tidy allowed as much stylistic choice as possible in the internal
layout...
