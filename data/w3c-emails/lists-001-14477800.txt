This Question was passed onto Bjoern, I take he does not know so I ask again
to the group as well


I just went to <http://tidy.sf.net>.
and got transferred to http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidy
then I downloaded " tidy_win32.exe "

I got it to check out (test.htm)
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 2.0">

<head>
<title></title>
<style type="text/css">

<h1>Just testing</h1>
</html>

it said
HTML Tidy for Windows (vers 1st September 2001; built on Sep 15 2001, at
19:16:06)
Parsing "E:\HTML-T~1\TEST.HTM_newver.htm"
No warnings or errors were found.


OK, I think I like the 05-08-00 15:21 release better
