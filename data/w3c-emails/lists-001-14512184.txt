Lee,

I agree with everything you said. Here's the point: Tidy has a bunch of
options each of which control one of two different things: (can you have
an off-topic parenthetical after the second colon in a sentence? Or can
you even have two colons in a sentence? And embedded questions, too? Oh
well...) presentation of the rendered HTML, and layout of the raw
source.

I understood the original problem to be that when Tidy rewraps raw
blocks of text, it doesn't do the two-space two step. I didn't think we
were talking about how browsers render spaces, as that's covered
elsewhere in the appropriate specs (and violated at will by the
browsers).

All the issues you brought up about how to determine the end of
sentences (in various languages no less) have been worked out for years
in TeX, and the code is free for the taking. If it were important enough
to some coder to preserve his two spaces (or "correct" it in HTML from
other authors/sources), then he could take the appropriate part of TeX's
code and incorporate it into Tidy, therefore doubling it's size (or
there abouts -- I'm guessing). I would like such a flag, but I don't
care enough about it to bloat Tidy that much. Like I said, I've gotten
used to one space being sufficient. But the hard work (dealing with the
issues you raised) has been done.

If somebody wants to affect presentation, then ".&nbsp; " is probably
the way to go, unless there's some magic to be had in style sheets that
I'm not aware of. But not only do I not want to work that hard, I don't
want my browser to work that hard either. :-)
