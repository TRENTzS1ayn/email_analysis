Email and answer you questions,

I just went to   http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidy and could only down
load the 04 Aug 00  issue, how does one get the current (17 Dec 01) version

From Eric

I can't reproduce your problem with either the 04 Aug 00 or current (17 Dec
01) version of Tidy. Is there more info about your use of Tidy that we need
in order to reproduce your problem? I don't know what the 05-08-00 version
is, but maybe Charlie built that one.

Here is what both versions of Tidy I tested with, had to say about your
sample HTML :

line 13 column 1 - Warning: content occurs after end of body

Regards, Terry
