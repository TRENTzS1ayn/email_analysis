Depends on whether you want pre-built binaries for certain platforms, or if
you are capable of downloading the source and building it for yourself.

1) Pre-built binaries (betas, for some platforms) :

<http://tidy.sourceforge.net>


2) Source code (current, for all supported platforms) :

<http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=27659>



Hope this helps.
