Folks,

FYI. <http://www.w3.org/>

"MIT Scheduled Power Outage 21-23 December

18 December 2001: On Friday, 21 December, power at the MIT Laboratory for
Computer Science (LCS) will be turned off at approximately 9:00 p.m. EST to
complete retooling of the building's power configuration. All services will
be suspended and the site will be accessible in a read-only state. Mail
sent to W3C archives will be queued, and posted when the power is restored.
Power is expected to return by 7:00 a.m. Sunday, 23 December. We apologize
for the inconvenience."

Regards, Terry
