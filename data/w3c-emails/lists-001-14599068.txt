This can range from straightforward to more complicated depending on your
platform, "shell", and what you are trying to do.

For example my Tidy for Mac OS products employ a GUI, where you can simply
drag & drop files/folders/disks to the application icon to process entire
folders of HTML.

But if you are stuck with a command line version of Tidy, the following
should work (I'm not a UN*X guru), assuming "tidy" is in your PATH :

(a) tidy somedir/*.html

Will check all the HTML files in "somedir".

(b) for theFile in somedir/*.html
    do
tidy ${theFile}
    done

This is for the standard "sh"/"zsh" type shells. You can use the ${theFile}
shell variable to do things like uniquely create output and error files
from Tidy based on the input filename.

(c) foreach theFile (somedir/*.html)
 tidy ${theFile}
    end

This is for the standard "csh"/"tcsh" type shells. You can use the
${theFile} shell variable to do things like uniquely create output and
error files from Tidy based on the input filename.

I am not the authority on this. I don't see a problem, but you should
consult the license agreement for Tidy at :

Sorry, I can't help you with this one.
