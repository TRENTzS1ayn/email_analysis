Will there ever be a real tar file created for some recent set of tidy
changes?  Having access only to a cvs repository is really a nuisance when
what one really wants is to build the code - downloading each individual
piece because one can't get to cvs (firewalls, whatever) means an myriad
of places for things to go wrong.
