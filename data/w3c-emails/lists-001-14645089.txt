I don't use Netscape 6 or X-anything-L, so I cannot comment on the bulk of 
your post, but note that HTML Tidy is not a validator, so Tidying files 
does not then imply that they are "W3C-compliant."  See:

  http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&selm=mXqV6.4110%24aK4.355558%40news.abs.net

and:

  http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&selm=Yu6W6.4233%24aK4.389863%40news.abs.net

The latter post gives an example of invalid HTML for which Tidy reported 
"No errors or warnings."

The beginning of the cited thread mentions a number of available validators 
that can be used to check compliance.
