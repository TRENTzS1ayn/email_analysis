I personally always copy and paste the DOCTYPE declaration constructs from 
one of my templates whenever I create a new page and thus had never observed 
the ones affixed by Tidy. I just ran an old (HTML version 4.0) document 
through HTML-Kit/Tidy -- using the convert to XHTML facility -- which 
produced the following constructs:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">


This is deficient IAW the W3C XHTML 1.0 Specification (the XML declaration is 
missing and the html root element does not include the language attributions) 
which prescribes (for example):

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
