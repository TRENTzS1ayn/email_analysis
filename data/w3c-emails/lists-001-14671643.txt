Mozilla (and I guess also Netscape 6.x) has a "quirks" mode in which it 
attempts to emulate other browser behaviour (particularly Netscape 4.x), 
and a "standards" mode in which it attempts to follow the standards. I 
tripped over something odd to do with colours which worked in quirks 
mode, but not standards mode, as I had not used the standard syntax (I 
think I missed the # from the hex colour attribute). I discovered that 
standards mode is enabled with a doctype declaration, and quirks mode 
without one.

Cheers,
  Scott
