If you want Tidy to take 98% of CPU usage and fill up your 40 Gig HDD in 
less than 3 min do what i did.
Write a Cold fusion script using CFEXECUTE triggering a simple shell  
script such as this
#! /bin/sh
/usr/local/bin/tidy -config /etc/tidyconfig.txt /home/user/HTMLFILES/*
to run tidy over a directory full of HTML files. Then make sure in your 
tidy config file you have this line ==> error-file:  
/home/user/HTMLFILES/ (pointing to the same directory where the HTML 
files are) and run the script. I wonder what happens?

Silly me..been working too hard!!!

By the way this is even more fun when you do it on a major server at 
your work place. Lucky it was during a University holiday.
