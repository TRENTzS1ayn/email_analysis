Definitely when an actual release of the current code is made - we are not
in that position yet.

I was in the process of automating nightly builds and uploads of tarballs
when my access to the SF compile farm got corrupted. I have since got my
access back, but I have been too busy (and there were a couple of problems
automating the uploads I hadn't resolved) to do any more work on this.

I don't find it a nuisance, and you should be able to get the whole thing
with a single CVS command. I personally use a GUI based CVS tool, and it
works great for me.

But to prove that it can be done with a single CVS command, I have copied
the command I used while automating the builds (I have left out stuff that
is not needed) :

cd tidy; cvs -d ':pserver:anonymous@cvs.tidy.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tidy'
update .


(note the period at the end - representing the current directory).

This was on the SF compile farm, using the "bash" shell, mostly on some
version of Linux. It assumes you have a directory called "tidy" in the
current directory.

If/when I get time, I will try to make another attempt to automate nightly
builds and uploads of tarballs.

Hope this helps.

Regards, Terry
