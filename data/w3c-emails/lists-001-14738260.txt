Unfortunately, the cvs command doesn't work through firewalls (at least
some of the ones being used) .

Thanks though for being patient.  Someone the other day mentioned that
if I really wanted sf.net stuff badly enough there's always the full
cvs backup ftp URL that I could use.  Then I just have to build a local
cvs repository for it.

I'm just not certain I am ready to go to that extreme yet.
