I feel your pain, Tim. I asked the same question regarding the extra
whitespace in this thread:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2001OctDec/0118.html

Unfortunately, it's a bug that pops up when handling XML. Hopefully this
will be fixed in a future release.

As far as an alternate solution goes, some folks here are experimenting with
XSL to try and get the XML the way I like it. When they come up with
something that works I'll post it to the list.
