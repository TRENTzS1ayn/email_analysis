FWIW, I have updated the C++ tidy package currently found at 
http://www.dysfunctionals.org/~lee/TidyCPP.zip.  This version is 
up-to-date with the current CVS version, and fixes some bugs not yet 
fixed in the plain C version.  I have also fixed many of the mistakes in 
the conversion, including a really nasty memory leak.

The zip package contains _only_ source code.
