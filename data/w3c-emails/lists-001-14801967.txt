Dear Folks,

To all who have been asking - up to date archives of the Tidy source code
are now available automatically on the Tidy project web site.

Every night (11:55 pm PST), the latest Tidy source is updated from CVS, and
checked to see if changes have been made this day. If so, the complete
source (less test files, and old archives - if you need these, use CVS) is
tar/gzipped, uploaded to the web site, and the home page updated with
today's date - the downloadable file is always available as a downloadable
link using the same name each time, but each archive has an unique name
based on date, and older archives are available.

While I was at it, I updated the home page in general, to include most of
the links to different versions of Tidy that are available. I have NOT
checked most of the links. Please let me know of any broken links, or new
links you would like to see added.

The Tidy source is fairly static at present, so don't expect to see the
source archives change every day. I will probably make some minor changes
to the source in a few days to further test the automated archiving.

Anyway, the place to visit is :

<htpp://tidy.sourceforge.net>

Let me know of any problems you encounter.

Merry Christmas.

Regards, Terry
