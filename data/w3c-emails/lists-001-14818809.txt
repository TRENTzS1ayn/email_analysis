Huh? two different tidy teams?

2. Re: CVS: yes, please make the tarballs, as at 41 years old, I am not
used to CVS :-(

3. Are you sure you still want to generate:
   content="HTML Tidy, see www.w3.org" didn't the address change.  by
   the way, can one turn off the ads if say, one needs to take the
   code on the space shuttle, and every byte counts.

4. By the way, did I mention this below

|We're comparing apples to oranges here.
|
|The HTML specs require that multiple adjacent whitespace characters be

|Therefore, there's no reason why Emacs needs to collapse extra

so please add a "whitespaces after periods" option, with values
1,2,3... or 0[?] meaning "don't mess with them".
