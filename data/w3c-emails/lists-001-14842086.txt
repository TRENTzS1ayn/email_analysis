Hello,

This is regarding Tidy application. I tried using Tidy.exe to clean
up my HTML page but had a little problem with that, my HTML page has
a string like this

<IMG alt="" onmouseover=javascript:alert(' hi') ></IMG> 
    
    which after running Tidy.exe was replaced by

<IMG alt="" onmouseover="javascript:alert(" ></IMG>
