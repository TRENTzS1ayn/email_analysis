Thanks, I never open any attachments when a message could be put into a body
of a E-mail. I just delete them and think "do I need to know, and get a
virus"

AVG anti-virus program is free, gives regular updates, as close as a day
apart, And the advantage is if you get a E-mail with a newer date stamp at
the bottom of the E-mail you can download the next newer version, So maybe
the date stamp at the bottom is not as useless as you think.
