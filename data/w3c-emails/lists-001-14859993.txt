All,

This is probably a "newbie" question, but I discovered tidy while trying
to figre out how to clean up HTML output from Word-200. Tidy does a
great job, except for the fact that the links to images are completely
removed. Am I doing something wrong, or is there an option I haven't set
properly?

Thanks!
