Hi Chaps,

From watching the list, I realise a lot of work has been 
going on with Tidy, and this is much appreciated.  However, do you 
think you could take a pause sometime soon, and release a new full 
(GUI) version please?  Terry - I'm interested in the Macintosh 
version, but I'm sure users on other platforms would also appreciate 
a new version.

Thanks again for all the hard work, and a Happy New Year to everyone.

Peter Vince
