This is a known issue in HTML Tidy and it has not been fixed up to now.
This happens in attrs.c:CheckAttribute(...). The if() construct needs an
additional check for lexer->isvoyager but this will currently not help,
since lexer->isvoyager is false at that point. HTML Tidy only uses the
xmlns Attribute to determine XHTMLness of the input file, not the
document type declaration and the xmlns attribute has not been
processed, since Tidy processes the attributes in reverse order. We need
to improve the lexer->isvoyager checks. To do this, I would need some
code that splits up the document type declaration in HTML and XHTML into
all relevant parts (FPI, system identifier, internal subset, etc.) I
need this for other things also...
