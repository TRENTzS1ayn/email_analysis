Probably because both <HR> and <PRE> are block level elements. Thus <PRE>
should not contain <HR>.

Subject: Problem with <HR> tags


I use a program called GEDPAGE to generate genealogical charts as HTML
pages. When I run TIDY on them I get the following error message and the
<hr> tags are rendered unintelligible.

line 13 column 1 - Warning: unescaped <hr> in pre content

Can anyone please tell me why?
