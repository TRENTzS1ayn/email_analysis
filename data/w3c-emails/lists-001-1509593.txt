According to the latest HTML spec at
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/scripts.html#h-18.2.1

"The SCRIPT element places a script within a document. This element may
appear any number of times in the HEAD or BODY of an HTML document."

Doesn't say the SCRIPT element can appear outside of both.

At http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#h-7.3 the only content
allowed within an HTML tag is HEAD and/or BODY, not SCRIPT.
