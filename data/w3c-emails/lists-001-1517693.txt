Dave,
This perhaps is not a "bug," but it's 'bugging' me.   Why is it that when I
use the "center" attribute in the "img" tag, I have to change it to
"middle"...  and when I use this same attribute in any other tag, I can keep
it as "center."

My dilemma is...shouldn't w3 be consistent...Or is there some other reason
for this incongruity?

Thank you,
-Renice
