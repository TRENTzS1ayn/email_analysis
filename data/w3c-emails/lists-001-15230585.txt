Consider:
  <small><h1>Header text</h1></small>

This gets tidied to:
  <h1><small>Header text</small></h1>


But:
  <span style="font-size: small;"><h1>Header text</h1></span>

Gets tidied to:
  <h1>Header text</h1>


Is there any way to make Tidy treat spans around block-level elements the same 
way it treats small?


I use the Jan 18, 2002 version of Tidy.
