hello

I've a small problem with the warning tidy gives on improper doctypes:

my document begins with:

   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN">

the warning from tidy is:

   HTML Tidy for Solaris (vers 1st April 2002 (no joke); built on Apr  8
2002, at 09:07:35)
   Parsing "TOOLS/index.html"
   line 1 column 1 - Warning: HTML DOCTYPE doesn't match content

   TOOLS/index.html: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01
Transitional//EN"
   TOOLS/index.html: Document content looks like HTML 4.01 Transitional
   1 warning, 0 errors were found!

It seems to me that the first line should be talking about 3.2!

Is this for real or is it a misunderstanding of mine?

Thanks for any comment
