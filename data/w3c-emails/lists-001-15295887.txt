First of all I would like to thank you for your work about this project. I
think HTML-Tidy should be part of every webmaster's toolbox.

However, I noticed that tidy sometimes removes the link tag when I use it in
some of my web pages, where I put a link to my stylesheet. Tidy give me a
warning titled "Warning trimming link" or something...

Everything else is just perfect !
Thank you !
