this may be on the requested feature list already, otherwise may I suggest you 
add this to under http://tidy.sf.net for tracking purposes and to avoid 
duplication of your work -- certainly would make sense to support common paths
(for Windows and OS/2 probably %DPATH%\.tidyrc could be supported too)

I would vote for a single filename though, not multiple filenames.
