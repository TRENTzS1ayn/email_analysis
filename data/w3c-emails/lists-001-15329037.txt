I must be doing something wrong.

I'm Trying to TIDY a Word 2000 file (saved "as web page"). Need TIDY to
output XML format. TIDY appears to get rid of a huge amount of Word 2K junk,
but not references to graphic images. These are left in the XML output file
with a namespace prefix of "v:". But TIDY doesn't put any namespace
declaration in the HTML tag, so the resulting XML file is not valid XML. I
have to go back and manually change the <html> tag into
<html xmlns:v="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml"> and then that works.

As I want to set up some batch processing routines to run automatically, I'd
really like to find some way that TIDY will output valid XML when asked to
output XML from a Word 2K document.

Am I just missing something simple?
