Hi everyone !

When I mailed you a few days ago, I mentioned a bug about a link tag which 
was trimmed.

Here is what I got :


[romale@localhost www]$ tidy -i -m -wrap 80 linktag.html

HTML Tidy for Linux/x86 (vers 1st April 2002 (no joke); built on Apr  6 2002, 
at 20:39:31)
Parsing "linktag.html"
line 10 column 17 - Warning: trimming empty <link>

linktag.html: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
linktag.html: Document content looks like XHTML 1.0 Transitional
1 warning, 0 errors were found!

I put the file "linktag.html" with this mail.
I hope you'll find the solution for this bug.

Thanks a lot for you work !
