I would recommend against ".rc" as the configuration file extension, at 
least on Win32 platforms.  That extension has been used historically for 
Windows resource compiler source files.

I would suggest that ".ini" might be better for the Win32 platform, as it 
is already associated with program configuration files and likely is 
already set up to invoke a text editor.
