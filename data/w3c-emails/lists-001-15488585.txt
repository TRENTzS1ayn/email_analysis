Hi All,

Sorry to spill over onto the main list, but there is a mailer problem on SF 
that has suddenly stopped me from sending mail to any sf.net email 
address.  E.g. the tidy-develop mailing list and Terry.  I have filled out 
a support request and have noticed that others are having the same problem.

Also, I will be away for a week starting tomorrow.  Maybe the mailer 
problem will be fixed by then.

take it easy,
Charlie
