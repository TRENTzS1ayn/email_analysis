you people make NO sense!

You advertise "tutorials"  to laymen, non programers and then speak in "code" with confusing beta links that never lead to html tidy download!

Then you essentially hide all of your contact e-mail addresses so nothing can be accomplished  efficiently.

now, please take me to the html download link - not the "page" = the download link!
