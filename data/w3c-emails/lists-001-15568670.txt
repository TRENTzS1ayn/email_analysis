Dear Sir
thanks for your help,and replying
really my project is developint generalized conversion tool convert HTML to WML
not specific to certain site or file
so now some small html files are conveted and displayed 
in the simulator(nokia toolkit) but the problem with large files
also i want to ask you how can i convert any html file to xml
tidy is a tool just for validation of HTML, is it convert html to xml?
also what about script in html? i don't know how to convert it to be suitable for mobile devices?
i read about XDNL specifications, but i think it is complex because i don't apply it to a certain file i know?
also how can i use java to split file?
also i want to know how to convert table from html to wml without showing border because i use table for good layout in html?

please if you have atime send to me?
thanks
