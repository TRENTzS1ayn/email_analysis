You could try first tidying the documents and then piping them 
through a second filter to pick out the links. It would also be
simple to extend HTML Tidy to pickout the links, but you would
have to define an output format. Note that it would be tricky
to pick out links dynamically defined through scripting.

I have copied this response to the html-tidy list in case
others would find such a change helpful.
