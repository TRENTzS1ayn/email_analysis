Tidy converts HTML to XHTML using the -asxml option, which you can then convert
to any format you like through XSLT or another processor.

Tidy does not convert Javascript to WMLScript, in many cases the different 
functionality will require manual changes anyway.

I suggest you look into some of the existing software products, for example
Websphere Transcoding Publisher, for doing HTML to WML conversions.
