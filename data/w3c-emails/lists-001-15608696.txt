 Hi,
    I am using JTidy to convert html file to XML. But I did find any option
to convert the <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN"> 
    To my coutomized  Document type like : <!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM
"xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

    Note: I tried the setDocType method. ( I did not got clear usage of this
method for XML document type )
 
 Thanks in advance,,,,,
 Ifahs.
