Check out Andr? Blavier's TidyCOM at http://perso.wanadoo.fr/ablavier/TidyCOM/

To go the COM route, it shouldn't be too difficult to bring the Tidy 
sources up to date yourself, should that be necessary.  I did it once, 
without problems.  But, admittedly, there weren't so many changes at the time.

If that turns out to be difficult or if .Net is a priority, you might also 
check out the TidyLib portion of Marc-Andr? Lemburg's Python 
wrapper.  Marc-Andr? says the C lib portion is usable separately.  Then, it 
should be difficult to use Visual Studio to generate a COM or a .Net 
wrapper from the header file.

I Haven't used .Net personally, but my experience with SOAP and Java 
serialization (as well as COM) tells me that you want to make HTML Tidy a 
"local" operation for web use.  I.e. distribute Tidy to each ASP server in 
the "farm" and run it there.  Thus, you avoid network hops and, perhaps 
more importantly, you avoid XML serialization/deserialization.  In the .NET 
configs, look for a flag that "optimizes local invocation" or some 
such.  FYI, the same logic applies to Java servers as well: EJB/CORBA can 
be configured to avoid Java serialization for local invocations as a 
deployment option.

take it easy,
Charlie
