I get an error report similar to the following on all documents  I run
through tidy except on the first time I run it on a new document, in which
case it doesn't show any warnings about the "id" values.  It seems to be
referring to some <a name="xx"> tags which I use to link to specific dates
in my online journal, which tidy added "id" values to per w3c recommendation
for XHTML (I'm confused by this because "id" is use for CSS2 also, so it
could cause conflict) but it seems to think the whole document is on one
line!  Otherwise, I'm quite happy with tidy.  I'm using it through NoteTab
Light 4.85.
