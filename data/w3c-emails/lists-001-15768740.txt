There are no standardized extensions for any MIME type, however it is
common to store
XHTML files with a .html extension still, since that's what most servers
are configured to interpret as HTML, no matter which version.

In short, the DTD specifies the structure of a document, i.e. the
elements and attributes and in which context they can be used. For
example, the DTD specifies that the document element is "html", which
has two children "head" and "body". Within "head", certain elements such
as "meta", "link", "script", "style" etc. are valid, and so on.

See <URL:http://www.w3.org/MarkUp> for details on HTML and XHTML.

A DTD is associated with a document in the DOCTYPE, if you run your page
through HTML tidy and produce XHTML output (by using the -asxml
parameter, or the corresponding option in the configuration file), the
DTD will be added automatically for you.

Note the URL is written in correctly, the slashes should be forward
slashes, i.e. http://www.geocities.com/everneverin/publi1.html

Hope that helps
