Subject: tidy

Tidy almost works, but can't be used safely until this can be fixed:

There's sort of a major problem with tidy in that it by default
places the </td> tag on its own line, which basically destroys any
fine tuned table structure in most browsers out there by adding a
space, this also happens if say you have a block of text ended by
</p> followed by </td>, you hopefully have noted by now in your
career that the space between the last line of text increases
slightly if the </td> is on its own line, as opposed to following
the </p> tag, like </p></td>. This is the reality of most browsers
out there.

Of course, you can run tidy to xhtml specs, then reformat your code
in dreamweaver, setting the break before </td> option off in its
configuration file, but that's getting pretty darned obscure, not to
mention a major pain in the butt, and excludes like 99% of the
world's users, since almost noone can do that, or even knows that
can be done.

Your wrox book too had a bunch of these kinds of very subtle errors
and descrepancies that make me wonder a little about the people who
are making these standards. Not to mention that extremely, to put it
mildly, unfortunate decision to include a free advertisement for
that Mosquito product, whose connection to html and xhtml is distant
at best. Fortunately O'Reilly press sometimes is able to point out
some of these errors.
