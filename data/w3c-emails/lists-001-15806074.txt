It looks to me like this request can be summed up and compressed as:

Feature Request:
please add to html-tidy a method of configuring it not to add newlines
or spacing before tags.

Perhaps this could be like not using "indent".  I doubt this would need
a per-tag configuratoin ability (such would be exhaustive) but could, at
first, use a global config item.
