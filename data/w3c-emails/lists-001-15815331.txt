Tidy already checks the content for td elements to see whether
they have block level or inline content. If the latter, the </td>
isn't moved to the next line.

 <td><p>....</p></td> 

 <td>
 <p>...</p>
 </td>

render the same, although

 <td>some text</td>
 
and 

 <td>
   some text
 </td>

may not.
