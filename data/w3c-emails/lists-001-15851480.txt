To: HTML Tidy Mail List<html-tidy@w3.org>

I'm using Tidy on my Windows XP machine and am accessing it from Evrsoft's 
1st Page 2000. How can I point it to read my preferred setting rather than 
the built-in defaults?

I have set an environmental variable, HTML_TIDY, to point to .tdy file 
which contains my preferred settings but they do not seem to be picked up.
