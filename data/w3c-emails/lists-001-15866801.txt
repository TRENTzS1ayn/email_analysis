I had it set as a user variable, but have changed it to a system variable now.

No errors apparently but Tidy still isn't picking up all my preferences 
rather than the default.

Another problem: Tools -> Tidy HTML Format and Fix... -> Tidy Document in 
1st Page 2000 overwrites my preferences file with onr consisting of

wrap: 200

tab-size: 4

indent: no

indent-spaces: 2

doctype: auto

char-encoding: ascii

write-back: yes

error-file: log.txt

Weird...
