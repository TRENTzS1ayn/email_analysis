href is an attribute of the a element.  In the DOM model
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-DOM-Level-2-Core-20000927/core.html#ID-637646024)
an Attr is -not- a child of the element with which it is associated.  If
you have the Element for a, try getAttributes() which returns a
NamedNodeMap, or getAttribute() which returns a String with the
attribute value for a specified attribute, or getAttributeNode() which
returns an Attr node for the specified attribute.

The DOM specification referred to above explains all of this.  Check the
information under Node, Element, and Attr.
