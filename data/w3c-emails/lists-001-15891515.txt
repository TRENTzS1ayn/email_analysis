  Thanks for this marvellous program.
  Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  I hope these comments will helpt to improve it:

   Running out-of-the-box on a vanilla NT platform

   1. tidy -f errs.txt index.html  outputs a 0 size errs.txt file

   2. with the otherwise vanilla example cfg file supplemented wit an
error-file option:
       // Tidy Config file
      error-file: errs.txt
      indent: auto
      indent-spaces: 2 
      yadda yadda ....

      tidy index.html still puts out an 0 byte errs.txt file

   3. The 2>&1 trick does NOT work to re-direct output.
       I finally used a wrapper program i wrote to launch tidy under it and 
       catch and re-direct it's output. 

   4. The acknowledgements on this page

        are broken, and render as : 

         <<...OLE_Obj...>>
