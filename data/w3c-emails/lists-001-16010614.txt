Hi Tidyers,

I need some help / advice please.

TidyCom is a COM wrapper for HTML Tidy (this just means you can use Tidy
from within programming languages for Windows) and it's based on the
2000-08-04 version of HTML Tidy. TidyCom is no longer being developed or
maintained.

I'm using TidyCom from dotnet's C# programming language and generally it
works fine. However the 2000-08-04 version of Tidy does not implement the
"repeated-attributes" option and this is something I now need as certain
pages that my software must dynamically Tidy have several elements with
repeated attributes in them.

Is there another way of getting rid of these repeated attributes or getting
rid of any section / element that contains them; it would be fine if -say-
the entire element, that contains a repeated attribute, were to be just
completely left out of the Tidied document?

Is there an alternative to TidyCom? In other words some way of Tidying a
html file from a programming language that allows me to output in xml.

Why does the 2000-08-04 version of Tidy not output proper XML when you set
"output-xml" to be true?

Anyone who's interested can find TidyCom @

Many thanks and regards,

..matthew
