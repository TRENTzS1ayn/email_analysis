Hi Matthew,

I'm using VS.net - does that matter?

That would be excellent if you did provide a copy of the code - have 
you thought about putting it on the sourceforge site for others to work 
on?

My background is with ASP.old, but have been working with C# non stop 
since the beginning of the year and would be happy to help out if 
necessary.

I also have a friend who co-authored some of the Wrox ASP.net books and 
is currently working on a book on developing server controls - he is 
very keen to use Tidy for an editor component he has written so may 
also be a valuable source of info.

Do let me know what I can do to help.

Cheers,
