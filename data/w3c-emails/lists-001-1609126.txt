Just trying to get my docs to pass the XHTML 1.0 validation. One part of a
JavaScript is tripping it up twice (one for each &)

{ if ((typeof window.sidebar == "object") &&
Error: character "&" is the first character of a delimiter but occurred as
data

Is there anything I can do manually or via Tidy to change this?
