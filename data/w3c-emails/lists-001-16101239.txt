Thanks Matthew.

One of things that came up in the conversion was that I had to setup 
the java files in a J++ project and then convert - I set it up as COM 
dll - I assume that was right.

The JTidy source I used was based on the Aug 2000 version of Tidy, 
which should be the same as TidyCom.

Let me know if you need me to do any more.

Cheers,
