Hi all.
I did not follow the thread very accurately, but could it be a solution
to break lines "? la OpenJade"?
OpenJade and Jade break the lines in the tags, so the document is not
modified.
Instead of 
<html>
  <head>
    <title>
    ...

You have
<html
  ><head
    ><title

It is maybe not so pretty, but the code is correct and the content not
modified.

Regards. Jany
