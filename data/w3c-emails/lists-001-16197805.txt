The problem is that not every attribute value that can be used for the name 
attribute is also valid as an id, not sure how to best resolve this.

Option 1: The current behaviour, which does not change the id and name values 
but may result in invalid IDs.

Option 2: Change just the id value if needed, which results in id and name not 
being consistent any more.

Option 3: Change both the id and name values, which ensures consistency but can
break links within the document, or from another document.

I believe Option 1 is still the best choice, although tidy should warn about 
the invalid id attribute value right away, not only when running it against the
document again.
