Hi Tidiers,

I have written a simple Win 32 dll, TidyDll, compiled using the latest
source code of HTML Tidy. This will allow Win32 developers to use HTML Tidy
in their own software painlessly. There are no bells and whistles but it
seems to work quickly and efficiently; during testing it never crashed or
functioned incorrectly but the tests were not very exhaustive, any bugs in
the latest source of HTML Tidy will also be in TidyDll. It's available free
and with open source.

It was written due to my need to use HTML Tidy from a .net C# program. I
had been using TidyCOM but now need to use more recent HTML Tidy options
(TidyCOM is based on the August 2000 release).

I have also written a Tidy C# class designed specifically to work with my
TidyDll. This is also available free and is open source.

TidyDll:

Tidy C# class for TidyDll:
http://www.mattstan.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/tidy/tidycs.html

Perhaps the administrator of the http://tidy.sourceforge.net/ site would
link these pages?

I'd love some feedback from anyone using TidyDll or Tidy.cs.

Regards,

..matthew
