I reproduced your issue with the current (18 Jun 02) version of Tidy, but I
also checked the above sample with a Validator, and sorry but it does NOT
validate as 4.0 Strict, so Tidy changes the DOCTYPE to match the content :

-----
Line 9, column 0:

         blah blah blah
         ^

       Error: text is not allowed here; try wrapping the text in a more
descriptive container

       Line 10, column 6:

         </BODY>
               ^

       Error: missing a required sub-element of "BODY"



Sorry, this document does not validate as HTML 4.0 Strict.
-----

If you have sample HTML that validates as 4.0, and Tidy is changing the
DOCTYPE to 3.2, then let us know. There have been a number of DOCTYPE
related bugs that have been fixed since the last official release of Tidy
on 04 Aug 00 (and BBTidy).
