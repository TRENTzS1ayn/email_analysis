Hi,

Anyone ever come accross this tag <o:p></o:p> in an html file? If so what
is it?

What's odd is that I have loads of these tags in an html file I need to
tidy, always looking like this <o:p></o:p> in the file (never with anything
between the open and closing tags). But Tidy only gives me this error 6
times when there are many many more instances of the tag in the file.
Here's the error message:

Error: <o:p> is not recognized!

How should I get rid of it?

Thanks,

..matthew
