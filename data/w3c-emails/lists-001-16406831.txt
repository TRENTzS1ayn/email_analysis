Please tell me how I can download HTML Tidy.  I am struggling with my first HTML document and I am struggling with those pesky tags (and everything else).  I am not a member of World Wide Web.  Do I need to become a member to download HTML Tidy?  If so, how can I become a member. I am an instructor at L.A. Pierce College am trying to design a web page using HTML. 

Thank you for your help in this matter.
