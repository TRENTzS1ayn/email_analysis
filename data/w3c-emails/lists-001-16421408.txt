No, you don't need to be a member of the w3.org to use Tidy.

I suggest you visit the main Tidy web page at :

<http://tidy.sourceforge.net>

to find a version of Tidy for your platform, to download.

There are many resources available on the Internet to help beginners with
HTML design.

You might want to use a search engine using keywords like "Tidy", "HTML",
"course".

Speaking for myself, with the version of Tidy I support on my platform, I
know a number of colleges and other institutions that promote the use of
Tidy in their HTML design courses - you might get some ideas from there.

Regards, Terry
