Just ran tidy for the first time (Included with UltraEdit 9.00c and am
getting a log of the following warnings.

line 155 column 8 - Warning: '<' + '/' + letter not allowed here

Why?the reference line is;

</script>

Looks legit to me???

Other lines creating the same warning contain </font> and other html
delimiters.
