Subject: HTML Tidy

Hi,

I just started using HTML Tidy as part of 1st page 2000 - nice to find some 
web-authoring software for grown-ups.

I am confused by the following:  HTML tidy tidies the following line

<a href="http://www.blah.com" target="merch" 
onclick="openWin('http://www.blah.com'); return false">

(which I use to throw up blah.com in a separate window using a separate 
JavaScript function)  by REMOVING THE SINGLE INVERTED COMMAS.

The resulting tidied code causes an error when previewing it in 1st 
Page2000 (although it seems to work in browsers I have tried).  I thought 
the single inverted commas here were at least desirable.

I'd be grateful if you have time to comment on this.


Thanks,
Toby Bailey
