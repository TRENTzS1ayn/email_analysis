Thanks Bob and Klaus. That makes sense to me. The W3 Validator doesn't like
it either. Unfortunately there is not much I can do about it except to stop
using GEDPAGE. It generates far too many files to change each one manually
and it works OK with all the major browsers. I might try e-mailing the
developer of GEDPAGE and see what he says.
