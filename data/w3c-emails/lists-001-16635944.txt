I am a new user of Tidy and have used it to "tidy"-up WEB page output from
Access 2000.  I am getting some errors that I can't resolve (maybe because I
don't understand what Access 2000 is trying to do in the generated HTML/XML)
  Has anyone done this before?  Can anyone point me in the right direction
as far a any special params that must be set?

TIA
