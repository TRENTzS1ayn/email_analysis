I would just like to comment that I remember that even with all the
bells and whistles turned on, I remember that I still couldn't get
tidy to turn the usual mircosoft html mess document into a html strict
4.01 with _no stylesheet_ and all the <font> stuff somehow
rationalized into <em>, <strong> etc. [if really necessary and not
just "flagrant font flipping"].
