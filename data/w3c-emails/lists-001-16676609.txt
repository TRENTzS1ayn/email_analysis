Horrors!  I feel your pain (and Tidy's, too).  :)

Interesting that Tidy also warns here about "xmlns:..." attributes being
"unknown"; these days and times, is that a good idea?  Xmlns is unknown
to HTML 4, but ...

As to the error, "missing quote mark for attribute value", I'm not sure
what it's thinking here.  I manually quoted the unquoted attribute
values, and it still said that.
