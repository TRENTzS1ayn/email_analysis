To Dave Raggett

When using Tidy CodeSweeper inside HomeSite 4.5.1 I experience the problem that Tidy CodeSweeper converts all special characters to the HTML equivalents in HTML documents. 

At least in the following cases special characters should NOT be converted: 

1. Text in JavaScript alert boxes and other boxes. 

2. Text in the status bar set by the JavaScript defaultStatus property. 

The validation feature of HomeSite does NOT warn you of these special characters. 

Conversely (and strangely) special characters SHOULD be converted when using the JavaScript event handler to set the window.status property. 

What can be done about this? 

Also I am in doubt as to whether non-displayed text in META tags (description and keywords) should be written with special characters or with HTML equivalents. The validation feature of HomeSite does warn you of these special characters. Do you have any recommendations? 

Last problem with Tidy CodeSweeper is the wrapping of lines. Tidy CodeSweeper also wraps quoted strings leading to an error when validating the document with the validation feature of HomeSite. Is there no other solution but to increase the maximum line length? 

Kind regards
