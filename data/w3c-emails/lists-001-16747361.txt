Having searched the listing archive but did not
find something regarding so here:

Is it possible to parse / strictify not complete
html docs but to parse on a per *line* based
strings?

I currently experimented with TidyCOM from Andr?
Blavier and used his TidyMemToMem. But this ob-
viously requires a full blown html doc as input
and ouputs a complete html doc. As I understood
it correct (and saw from the sources) it is
simply a wrapper surrounding TIDY.

The only current workaround I see to circumvent
would be to 'dummy surround' line into a body
tag and after back again. Maybe there is a more
elegant way?

Any suggestions would be highly appreciated

Robert
