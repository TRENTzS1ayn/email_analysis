Greetings,

I am cc'ing your message to the html-tidy list in order to discuss
this in relation to the C version. New features should be implemented
in the C version first and then ported to JTidy to keep the two
versions in sync.

Could a Tidy user (C version) please verify that this problem is
present there also? If yes, should it be altered?

Thanks!

-Sami
