Hello Mr. Dave Raggett,

I am using your tidy tool for converting the HTML file to XHTML standard.I
am using some custom defined sections in <TBODY > tag of <TABLE>.When i am
running the tidy.exe it is giving some warnings like

<reportdata:section> is not allowed in <tbody> element.

and it is putting this <reportdata:section>   tag before   <tbody>   tag and
because of that the structure of HTML file is disturbed and HTML file is not
visible as it was visible before doing tidy.


Can you help me solving this problem..


It will be very kind of you if you can respond quickly.

Thanks & Regards
Pawan Aggarwal
