Did you check the documentation?

You can teach Tidy about new tags by declaring them in the configuration file, the syntax is:

            new-inline-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
            new-empty-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
            new-blocklevel-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
            new-pre-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3

          The same tag can be defined as empty and as inline or as empty and as block.

          These declarations can be combined to define an a new empty inline or empty block element, but you are not
          advised to declare tags as being both inline and block!

          Note that the new tags can only appear where Tidy expects inline or block-level tags respectively. This means
          you can't (yet) place new tags within the document head or other contexts with restricted content models. So
          far the most popular use of this feature is to allow Tidy to be applied to Cold Fusion files.
