Re: my problems with tidy.

1. I have write permissions on the web page I am trying to get tidy
to update.

2. I was surprised to read that tidy treats fixing html and
pretty-printing (moving text around to particular columns, wrapping,
etc.) as the same thing.

3. However, I'm not sure whether that's the whole picture.  Here's
the latest test:

$ tidy -m tst.html

Notice that I'm not providing any config file.  It is my understadning
that this should take the default action - updating the file.

However, tst.html continues to have no modifications made to it, even though
I get the output:


Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) Parsing "tst.html"
line 3 column 1 - Warning: inserting missing 'title' element

tst.html: Document content looks like HTML 2.0
1 warnings/errors were found!
