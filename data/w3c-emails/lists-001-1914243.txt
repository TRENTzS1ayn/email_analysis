    Try:
    
      $ tidy tst.html
    
    ...and see if you get the proper output on the screen.  If 
so, then Tidy is 
    having problems writing the corrected output back to the 
file.  If not, 
    then the trouble is elsewhere.
    
    
I rebuilt the original aug 4 release of tidy on my SPARC Solaris 
8 machine.  I use a relative pathname to make sure I get the 
version I just built.  I see:

 $ ./tidy /tmp/tst.html

Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) Parsing "/tmp/tst.html"
line 3 column 1 - Warning: inserting missing 'title' element

/tmp/tst.html: Document content looks like HTML 2.0
1 warnings/errors were found!

So I am seeing no change in the file or written to stdout.

    It should, in the absence of any implied configuration file.  
Note that 
    Tidy will process:
    
     1. A configuration filename supplied on the command line.
    
     2. A configuration filename designated by the HTML_TIDY 
environment
variable.
    
     3. A ".tidyrc" file, if present in the HOME directory.
    
     4. A compiled-in default filename, if defined.
    
    Perhaps you're still getting "markup: no" from one of these 
sources?
    
    
--------

Ah ha!  There was a HTML_TIDY variable set.  I'm rather surprised 
that there isn't a simple option to override things - even when I 
provide a -config /dev/null, it appears that tidy wants to use 
that HTML_TIDY variable.  Once I unset that variable, things seem 
to work again. 

I wonder if the argument setting is really working as expected; I 
would have expected command line flags to override everything 
else - AND I would expect a command line flag to turn on or off 
the generation of that markup argument.  At the very least, one 
should have the ability to seperately indicate whether 
non-functional changes (line wrapping, etc.) vs functional cases 
(inserting code) should be performed.  In general, I don't want 
tidy messing around moving tags about in my file just to make 
things look pretty.  I do however want tidy to fix broken code.

Does tidy perform character conversions for those Microsoft (and 
Mac) characters that I see so frequently on web pages - the 
'wrong' characters for quotes, dashes, etc. that end up not 
displaying properly unless you happen to have the right font?


    
    (Some time ago, I suggested an enhancement that would have 
Tidy print to 
    the console the name of any configuration file processed.  It 
sure would 
    help to track down "stealth" configuration problems of this 
nature!)
    
That would be nice - another nice feature would be a 'show me 
what values you are using' option.  That way, one could tell 
after having gone thru a variety of files exactly what parameters 
had been set...
