The various configuration file options accumulate, if I recall correctly, 
so "-config /dev/null" doesn't change anything because there aren't any 
options specified.  The order in which configuration options are applied 
is: compiled-in default, then environment variable OR then ".tidyrc", then 
command-line options in order of appearance, including the "config" option.

Note that if the environment variable is defined, ".tidyrc" will not be 
checked.

If you use "--markup yes" from the command line, that would override a 
previous "markup: no" in any configuration file previously encountered.  
Also, the "-errors" and "-e" command option is the same as "markup: no".

Wouldn't that just be a case of selecting the desired options in your 
configuration file?

Agreed.
