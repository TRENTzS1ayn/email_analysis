Luba --

I'm forwarding this note to the html-tidy list.  Dave, this error is now
on line 2085 of the Tidy version of 4aug2000 module parser.c.  The line
as written will always evaluate to false so the parseTag code will never
be executed.  Can you make the correction in routine ParseTableTag?

Thanks,
Gary
