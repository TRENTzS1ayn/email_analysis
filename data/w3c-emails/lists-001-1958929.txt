Just wondering how to handle the insertion of PHP variables or scripts that
occur within a link.

For example:

<a
href="http://digitalhit.master.com/texis/master/search/mysite.html?q=<?php
echo $celebsearch; ?>">

Which grabs the variable celebsearch and inserts it into the link at the
server so all the browser would get is:
<a
href="http://digitalhit.master.com/texis/master/search/mysite.html?q=Bruce+W
illis">

Tidy turns that into:

<a
href="http://digitalhit.master.com/texis/master/search/mysite.html?q=&lt;?ph
p echo $celebsearch; &gt;>">

Which is proper form if the < and > ever made it to the browser, but as PHP
is server-side they never do.

Is there anything I can do to stop tidy touching the <?php and ?> within a
link? It leaves them alone properly outside a link.

Thanks.
