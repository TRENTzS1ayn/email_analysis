Bug:

I just converted some documents and noticed that pages with a
Frameset declaration are sytematically re-written as Transitional
even though Tidy reports the document "appears to be Frameset".
This is using the MiNT port of Tidy 4Aug00.

Request:

It would be nice if Tidy converted attributes to lower-case,
whenever an attribute only has standard values.  For instance,
valign="TOP" should be converted to valign="top" instead.
