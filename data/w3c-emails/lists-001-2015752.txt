I've just started playing with HTML Tidy and came across an ideal use
if HTML Tidy supported it: cleaning HTML fragments.  HTML Tidy seems to
require complete HTML files, which makes sense 90% of the time; however,
I do a lot with building HTML output from various pieces and it would be
great to be able to clean up those pieces as pieces rather than as a
complete HTML file.
For example, I'll have a CGI read in a template table row and use that
to output database data; that template is in a separate file and being
able to run HTML Tidy on it would be great.  Another example is files
used in server side includes.
Just a thought.
Thanks for what looks like a great tool,
-David
