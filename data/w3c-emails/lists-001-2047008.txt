When we extract a DOM tree of a stream from an URL, we can't use it with
Xerces, because we have org.w3c.tidy.DOMElementImpl element instead of Node
element. Is there any cast available in any code fragments ?
 
Actually, I write the DOM on disk, and re-open it as a XML file, it works
but use too many i/o instructions.

Thanks for your help

I would add that HttpUnit does exactly this, using JTidy. It is open source
so that you can either use it as is, or study it for examples of how to do
this with JTidy:

 It's a bit tricky, since you have to accumulate the contents of many DOM
 nodes, but once again, HttpUnit provides methods to do this.
