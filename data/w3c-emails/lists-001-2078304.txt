 I am trying to use the JTidy libraries to modify a DOM tree, and
 am not having much success.  I need to take attributes out of a node, but
the
 methods in org.w3c.tidy.DOMAttrImpl to do this are all stubbed out (and
return null).  
 I noticed there is an extensive release history for this file, but there
appears to be
 very little implementation.  I checked some older versions of the archive
(I am
 using version 1.11, 2000/08/16 Tidy Release 4 Aug 2000), and this
 functinality appears never to have existed.  Is there any
 other known way to modify (or better yet remove) attributes?

 Here's the code I have been using:
//some desired transformations:
      //<A VLINK="xxx">  --> <A>
//<HR NOSHADE> --> <HR>
NamedNodeMap    attributes  = node.getAttributes();
Node            toRemove    = null;
toRemove = attributes.getNamedItem( mAttribute.toUpperCase() );
             if ( toRemove != null )
             {
                 toRemove.setNodeValue( "" ); //works, but I get
 //'element=""', where I want absolutely nothing
                 attributes.removeNamedItem( mAttribute.toUpperCase() );
 //has no effect at all, regardless of what case I
change mAttribute to
             }


 Thanks for any advice you might have.
