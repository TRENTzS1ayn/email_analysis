I'm afraid I have no idea how this patch works (and would appreciate some
help on this), but think that it may be useful to me as I have come across a
similar problem with custom tags (re: "Problem with custom HTML TAGS using
HTML TIDY", a message I sent to the list previously).

The problem that I was having was that although I'd included my tags as
in-line or block-level (in the config.txt file) to get tidy to recognise
them, tidy would perform some additional processing above what I would have
wanted that in the block-level case was to add unwanted formatting <p> and
<br> tags to the document. - in the in-line case tidy would split <font>,
<b>, <u> etc.. tags around my custom tags.

What I'd ideally like is to be able to turn this additional formatting off
for the custom tags.

Greetings.

I was using tidy to process an XML file that used some custom entities.
Since tidy wasn't aware of those entities, it refused to generate a
tidied file. I did a little rooting around and modified the code just
enough to produce the desired effect. There are some TODO comments in
the code to point out where it is suboptimal. Nonetheless, I'm posting
it here in case anyone else wants to make use of it or in case someone
wants to tidy (ahem) it up for inclusion in the next release.

Enjoy.
