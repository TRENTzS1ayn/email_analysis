It's a consequence of bad HTML writing: <a> elements can only have inline
contents, but <h3> is block-level. When Tidy gets to the <h3> start tag, it
assumes missing </a> and </p> end tags to get back to block level, then deletes
the empty elements formed. After the heading it ignores the extra </a>.

It could also be considered a bug, as it should be obvious to Tidy that you
meant:

<h3><a href="toto.html>blabla</a></h3>

That isn't related to this.
