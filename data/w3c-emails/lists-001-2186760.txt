I use 1st Page 2000 from Evrsoft (http://www.evrsoft.com/) to compose my
HTML pages. This includes the Tidy HTML tool. I have two problems when I use
Tidy HTML in 1st Page 2000.


PROBLEM 1
I find that Tidy HTML reports the following line as an error:

<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">

giving the the following error message in Tidy HTML Analysis Results:

Warning: <meta> unrecognised attribute value "http-equiv"

and 'corrects' it to the following:

<meta content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">


PROBLEM 2
Any occurence of "&amp;" is changed to "&mp;".

Consequently, a further Tidy HTML parse reveals the following error:

Warning: unescaped & or unknown entitiy "&mp;"

Worse still, it alters the code to "&mp;mp;". Further parses will continue
to append "mp;" to the erroneous code so after a couple more parses, the
code is changed to "&mp;mp;mp;mp;", whilst continuing to show the error
message above.

I hope that this is of use, and apologise if these problems have been
reported by others before.
