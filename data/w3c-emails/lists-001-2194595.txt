I downloaded TidyGUI for the first time yesterday.

I am primarily interested in detecting syntactic errors, e.g., detecting 
omission of  </TABLE>. I am not interested in stylistic thingees, such as 
when to (ab)use <P> or <BR>.

Is Tidy the wrong tool for my interests?

I am puzzled by  some of the spacing decisions being made by Tidy. Is there 
available a complete description of what Tidy does?

For example, I have the following construct in a number of files (Note that 
the URLs below are not, as far as I know, actual URLs):

<P><BLOCKQUOTE><B>Usage Note:</B> If you have difficulty accessing 
ftp.DoesNotExist.com, you may try ftp.MaybeThisExists.com.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The intent was to get an indented block as follows:

         Usage Note: If you have difficulty accessing ftp.DoesNotExist.com, 
you may try  ftp.MaybeThisExists.com.

Running TidyGUI, this gets converted to:

<blockquote><b>Usage Note:</b>
<p>If you have difficulty accessing ftp.DoesNotExist.com, you may try
ftp.MaybeThisExists.com.</p>
</blockquote>

This breaks the run-in/dictionary style.

Why was that done?
