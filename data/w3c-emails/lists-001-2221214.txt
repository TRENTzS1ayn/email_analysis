According to http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/text.html#edef-P the
only elements allowed inside a <p> tag are defined by %inline;

%inline;, in turn, is defined at
http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/sgml/dtd.html#inline and does not include
<blockquote>.  Tidy has made a guess at what you wanted and changed your
HTML to legal (or "tidied") HTML.
