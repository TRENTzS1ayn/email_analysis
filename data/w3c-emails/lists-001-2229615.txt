Tidy is overzealous because the current draft of HTML 4.01 that I 
downloaded does not preclude empty paragraphs, rather it only discourages 
their use.

Tidy should have an option to retain empty paragraphs, since they are 
currently syntactically valid, and offer an option of deleting them. 
Presently, there is no way to retain empty paragraphs with Tidy.
