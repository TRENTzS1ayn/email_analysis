I downloaded TidyGUI on 2 December 2000

I have installed a shortcut on my Win 2000 Pro desktop that has

Target: D:\HTML\Tidy\TidyGUI.exe -c TidyConfiguration.txt

Start In: D:\HTML\Tidy

The configuration file is located in the same directory as  TidyGUI.exe and is:

// HTML Tidy configuration file created by TidyGUI
error-file: TidyErrors.txt
tidy-mark: no
enclose-text: yes
enclose-block-text: yes
drop-empty-paras: yes

When I click on the desktop icon, TidyGUI does start with the configuration
file loaded, however, when I then browse to select a .html file and press
the Tidy button, the error file does not get written to the disk.

If I use

tidy -config TidyConfiguration.txt

from the command line, the error file does get written.

When running from the command line, I put the .html file in the same
directory as tidy.exe.

What do I need to do to produce the errors file?
