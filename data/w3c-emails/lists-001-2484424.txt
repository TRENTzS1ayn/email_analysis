Hi Dave

By now I should know, (I have been remind many times) to include
summary=" "  into tables
& alt=" " into picture <img>.

It appears to be on the web a lot of web sites that have text movement after
you start to read it and the picture begins to loads.

Is it possible the have a reminder for height=" " width=" " in the <img>
tag,  included in the future HTML tidy.

From Eric
