Right.

No, it changes <center> to CSS too.

It works fine here.  If I run Tidy on a file containing:

  <center>
  <p><font face="Arial">this is text</font></p>
  </center>

...in the body, I get:

  <style type="text/css">
   div.c2 {text-align: center}
   p.c1 {font-family: Arial}
  </style>

in the head, and:

  <div class="c2">
  <p class="c1">this is text</p>
  </div>

in the body, which is what I would expect.
