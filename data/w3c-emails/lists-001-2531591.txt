Hi,
Developing my first site using tables for page layout and coding the HTML by
hand in Notepad. Trying to make the site cross-browser compatible but have
been tempted to use a (small) internal style sheet to control table
positioning, table data font, BG colour, cell dimensions etc.
All works fine in IE 5 but in Navigator 4.75 it's a disaster !
I've read that Netscapes' implementation of CSS is patchy to say the least
but it seems I have no alternative but to code pages uniquely for each
browser - or forget about CSS completely until the specification is fully
implemented in the main two browsers.
Examples of what's going wrong include:
-correct rendering of cell bg colours
-incorrect cell dimensions
-refusal to centre top table (of 2) in window - despite trying <DIV
align...,
<CENTER>.....</CENTER> as alternatives to alignment
through the style sheet
- strangely, the lower table on the page does get centred,
using the style sheet

Oh, and at no time has html-tidy had any problem with my coding except for
<ALT>'s etc which I'm inserting later on.

Any advice would be most welcome.
Cheers,
Steve
