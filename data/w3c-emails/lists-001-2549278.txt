Could you give us some examples of your problems? I code web pages every day
and, though Netscape 4.x is a pitiful browser, I find that I can usually get
it to cooperate ;).

Briefly going through the list, though:
* BG Colors usually work fine. Beware, though, that Netscape doesn't render
empty table cells. You may have to put, for instance, a 1x1 transparent gif
into an otherwise-empty table cell for it to be displayed in Netscape
* As far as table cell dimensions, don't try to control the height. But, for
width, make sure that each cell has width specified (whether that's through
exact pixels (yuk), or percentages)
* As far as centering a table, try applying the ALIGN=CENTER tag to the
table to center it.
