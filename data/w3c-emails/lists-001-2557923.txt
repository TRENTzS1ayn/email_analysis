Problem: If I use "automatic" file redirection, I get an EMPTY file. In
fact, as I was not careful enough, I **lost** the original file, as I
usually copied the "new" file over the "old" file, to get a better
formated version !

So with batch processing, as I do, there is much danger. In fact, the
code was written as part of a commercial guestbook ( good old Lpage)
entry. So there IS software which generates this faulty code or at least
allows the generation of such faulty code !

---> so think about a default-enabled option that such en error does NOT
result in an empty output file !!!

Sincerely
Rolf
