This came over a JTidy discussion forum but it is really a Tidy issue.

Dear all,

i'm a new user of JTidy and have found that it doesn't fix up comments
properly
when outputting XML.  in the XML spec (at
http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210)
in section 2.5 it says "For compatibility, the string '--'
(double-hyphen) must
not occur within comments".  it would be very useful for me to have
JTidy handle
this, say by converting any '--' in a comment to '**'
(asterisk-asterisk). 
anyone point me at where in the code this should be done, or offer a
fix?

Cheers,
Matt
