For details of the level of CSS support in various browsers, look at the 
Master Compatibility Chart at:

  http://www.webreview.com/style/css1/charts/mastergrid.shtml

and also at the CSS Pointers Group:

  http://css.nu/index.html

Finally, general questions about HTML and CSS that don't relate 
specifically to HTML Tidy will be better addressed on these newsgroups:

  comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html
  comp.infosystems.www.authoring.stylesheets

...if only because the folks there address questions of cross-browser 
compatibility daily.
