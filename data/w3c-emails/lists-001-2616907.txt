Hello Richard,

Ha ha!  I sympathise with your viewpoint, as I, too, have found that the
various combinations of different platform and browser give different
results.  The trouble is, tables do more or less exactly the sort of
layout that I often want.  And we are still sufferring from HTML having
been pathetic in its early incarnations in terms of layout.  You say that
HTML isn't DTP - so it would appear, but I think that that is what we
really want, so we still have to resort to tricks to get the lumbering
old HTML to produce the required layout.  It does seem a huge shame that
the manufacturers can't get together and agree on some standards - screen
dots-per-inch for example.  However, that wouldn't cope with your other
well explained problems of variable width windows or paper sizes, I quite
agree.

That said, I would love to "do it properly" - but don't know how.  I am
slowly converting to CSS, and TIDY has been a huge help in that respect
by automatically converting some of my inline <FONT> tags and so on.  Do
you have any recommendations on how to emulate the layout functions
otherwise provided by tables, but with CSS?  Or perhaps you know of a
good web site that talks about it with some easy examples?

Many thanks,

Peter


PS You suggested using a 1 pixel transparent GIF to force Netscape to
colour the background of a cell - I use an "nbsp", as this saves the HTTP
overhead of yet another file to download, and still renders correctly if
the user has images turned off.
