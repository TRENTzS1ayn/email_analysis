Thank you, Richard, THANK YOU!

I printed out your message, marked the most significant parts and 
distributed it amongst my colleagues.
Chances are that they will ignore it (though paper is not as easy to ignore 
as email, that's why I printed it out) - but at least I tried...

I myself abuse tables for layout (I grew up with it, I started using the 
internet in late 1995, when Netscape had just introduced tables as 
proprietary extension to HTML), but I try hard to get rid of it. And I try 
talking my colleagues into it, but it's a long way to go.

The main problem that I see is that pages are designed by graphics 
designers (in photoshop), and not by people who understand what HTML is all 
about. And this is also what the customers expect.
Now does anybody have a satisfying solution for this? I doubt it...


I will keep on forwarding your messages though, Richard, if there are more 
to come of this kind... thanks again!
