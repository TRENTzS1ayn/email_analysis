Aggreed. Nevertheless I'd like to make some specific comments on 
Steve's problems:


>-correct rendering of cell bg colours

Try to stick to the named HTML colors. This is 
not a CSS issue.

>-incorrect cell dimensions

Don't try to do this with CSS.

Centering tables on the screen works in CSS with

body {text-align: center} in your style sheet. 

However, now you have to set the text-align 
attribute for all other elements of your page 
individually, because they may or may not 
inherit it from the body element (except tables, 
but do not rely on this)

Tidy just checks if your code is in accordance 
with the specified doctype. Incomplete or wrong 
implementation of HTML or CSS in browser 
software is not Tidy's fault.
