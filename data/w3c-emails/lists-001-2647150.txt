I agree pretty much with everything that Peter wrote in reply to Richard's 
nice email. Regarding the &nbsp; entity in order to have table cells 
rendered in Netscape:

This of course causes trouble if the desired cell height is less than line 
height (so in that case, you'd have to go back to the 1px transparent GIF), 
however, if the line height problem is not an issue, I'd rather use <BR> 
than &nbsp;, because <BR> has the same effect without rendering this stupid 
lone space on the page when you "select all" text (CTRL-A/APPLE-A) on the page.
