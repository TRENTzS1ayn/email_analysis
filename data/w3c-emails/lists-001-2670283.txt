Hi,
I'm new to HTMLtidy and I have seen a couple a references to a shortcoming
of HTML tidy.
It does not look like you can get clean HTML to XHTML conversion, the
<script> tag being one of the culprit.

XTML requires a CDATA section within a <script> block, HTMLtidy neither
complies nor discard the <script>.
I know I am not the first one to face the issue ( cf. the "Notes on pending
work" )

My question is :
What is the status on this problem ?

TIA,
Philippe
