I just now downloaded the file myself and it unzipped fine.  Can you
verify that the file you downloaded is 658,320 bytes in size?  Did the
unzip itself indicate any errors?  Did you get all of the files but
they're just zero length or did you not get some of the files when you
unzipped.  What OS and platform are you running?
