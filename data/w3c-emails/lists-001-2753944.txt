Does anyone know when this bug is likely to be fixed.

I am currently working with JTidy...what a fantastic set of classes.  I run
into a similar problem with text within <TD> tags,

for example

<TD>This is some Text</TD>

can get rendered as

<TD>T his is some Text</TD>

Keep up the fantastic work

Regards

Ian Gratton.
