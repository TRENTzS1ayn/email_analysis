Ian --

I ran my sample HTML through the current CVS build which contains
post-r5 fixes.  Unfortunately, I just tried running my same sample
through 04aug2000r5 and I didn't get the problem there either.  Can you
send me the HTML you're using so that I can run it through both versions
on my system and verify that this really is the fix that I was thinking
of.
