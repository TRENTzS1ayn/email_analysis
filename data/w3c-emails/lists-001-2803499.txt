I'll resist the considerable temptation to pontificate about (i.e.
regurgitate my own favorite cliches about) the future of browsers, and
instead point anyone interested toward the "Masterclass" section of
http://www.richinstyle.com/ . (Yes, this man also uses tables for
non-tabular material, the font tag, etc., but I've found that his
advice is sound.)

(And if you think NS4.x is bad, try MSIE 3.x.)
