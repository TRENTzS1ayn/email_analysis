Hi,
        This is regarding JTidy.
Does Jtidy support Japanese Html documents..
that is when i give some doc which contains japanese characters, will Jtidy
convert it as required.??
If it doesn't what do I have to do to make it understand Japanese
characters??

Thanks in advance,
Bhagwandas jakhotia
