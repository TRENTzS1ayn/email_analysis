I'm really not familiar with this portion of JTidy but it should mirror
the support in Tidy itself.  Perusing the documentation page, the
"char-encoding: iso2022" configuration option looks like it may address
this issue.  You might try that and let us know the results.

Perhaps someone more familiar with this than I am will jump in here.
