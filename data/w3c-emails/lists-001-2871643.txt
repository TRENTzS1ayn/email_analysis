tidy does not convert attribute values to lowercase. As for the method 
attribute I am somewhat surprised to see that only a fixed set of values is 
allowed and is required to be in lowercase since methods are generally written 
in uppercase, and I recall some older browsers wouldn't even handle 
method="post" correctly.
