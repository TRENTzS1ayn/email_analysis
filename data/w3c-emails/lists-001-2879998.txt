Either way of writing URL references is valid, and which one is better depends 
on your site structure, for example I personally favour using absolute paths 
for content in another branch of the site tree, instead of using 
../../../../../otherbranch/index.html from one file and ../../../../../../otherbranch/index.html
from another.

Depends on how clever the program downloading the files is, it may be able to 
replace paths, for example with Netscape you can get paths changed by
editing the page, then saving it locally.
