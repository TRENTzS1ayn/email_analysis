I have defined my own custom tags using the config.txt file (see attached). However, this has caused me problems as detailed in one of my previous mails to the list (as yet not entirely resolved). - though I haven't tested with r6 yet ...

  Hi all,
   
  I want JTidy to recognize <zone> tags I placed in code and not deleting it. How can I do ?
  I've got another question, how forcing JTidy to put <title></title> in code when there's no title in the document instead of <title/> ?
   
  Thanks for your response
