On the same note (sorry to bore anybody who may have read the previous mail from me on the same subject).

Can anyone tell me why jtidy changes the following html ('heading' being a custom in-line tag) in the way it does (when converting to valid xml)- I guess it may well be that the html doesn't conform ?

( is it illegal for an in-line tag to appear within a font tag ? ).

INPUT HTML:
<font>
    <heading>
        <b>Some text</b>
    </heading>

    <b>Some more text</b>
</font>

OUTPUT XML:
<font>
    <heading>
        <font><b>Some text</b></font> 
        <b>Some more text</b>
    </heading>
</font>


Thanks,

Dominic Jackson

  Hi all,
   
  I want JTidy to recognize <zone> tags I placed in code and not deleting it. How can I do ?
  I've got another question, how forcing JTidy to put <title></title> in code when there's no title in the document instead of <title/> ?
   
  Thanks for your response
