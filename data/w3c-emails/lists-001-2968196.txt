This is indeed pretty bizarre behavior.  In this case, it looks like the
inner class ParserImpl.ParseHTML is trying to accesss field _parseHead
directly.  However, the code in ParseHTML only accesses this field
through an accessor method but that method is not shown in your stack
trace.

I have seen wierd behavior like this in Microsoft JVMs.  What platform
are you on and what JVM are you using?  Try turning off the jit (-nojit)
and see if you still get this behavior.

HTH,
Gary
