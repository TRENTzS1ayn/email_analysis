Sorry, but I can't offer any help with JBuilder or J++ since I'm not
familiar with either.  What I can recommend is (a) install an alternate
JVM for testing when you run into problems like this -- IBM's is very
good and (b) download the latest fixes to the MS JVM from
http://www.microsoft.com/java/vm/dl_vm40.htm

HTH,
Gary
