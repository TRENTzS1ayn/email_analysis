4-Aug-2000 Tidy creates duplicates of enclosing inline emphasis tags
inside of user-defined inline tags.  This isn't what we were expecting.
I thought it was just us, but apparently not:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2000JulSep/0266.html

I had changed our internal copy of Tidy to suppress the "extra" inline
emphasis tags.  Now that I realize it's not just us, I'd like to ask
Dave to consider incorporating this change into the mainline Tidy.  I
don't know if there are instances where the inline emphasis propagation
is desirable, but at least now we have three instances where it is
undesirable.

NOTE: This change requires the CM_MIXED bug fix I recently submitted:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2000OctDec/0315.html

Assuming that bug fix is in place, the following change suppresses the
"extra" inline emphasis tags:
