It's right to do so. There is no attribute by that name in HTML.

Ah, I think you have misunderstood the syntax of <label>'s attribute list.
IDREF is the type of the attribute called 'for', and is a special SGML
keyword. (See <http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-idref>.)

What you mean is:

<label for="name">Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="name" />

Is outbind: a real URI scheme?

hope this helps,
