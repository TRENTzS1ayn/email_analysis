That's because the attribute you are looking for is called "for".
The HTML4 spec says:

 The for attribute associates a label with another control
 explicitly: the value of the for attribute must be the same as the
 value of the id attribute of the associated control element.  More
 than one LABEL may be associated with the same control by creating
 multiple references via the for attribute.
