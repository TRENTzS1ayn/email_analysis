Hello Dave,
your tidy program is really great. The WWW would be a better palce with
less browser problems if everybody would use it.

I found however a little problem that tidy has with cgi-bins:
The following is a perfect link to a cgi-bin:
<A HREF="http://www.linuxfocus.org/cgi-bin/lftalkback?anum=141&lang=en">...

Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) will say to that:
line 374 column 67 - Warning: entity "&lang" doesn't end in ';'

I think that warning does not make sence at all.

Regards
 Guido
