Indeed it would.

It's not perfect: ampersands ("&") need to be converted to "&amp;" in
HTML, because "&" is used to start entity references such as "&lt;",
"&amp;" and "&lang;". You should use this:

<A HREF="http://www.linuxfocus.org/cgi-bin/lftalkback?anum=141&amp;lang=en">

HTML4 defines an entity called "&lang;" for left angle brackets.
Tidy thinks you meant to use "&lang;" but missed out the ";".
