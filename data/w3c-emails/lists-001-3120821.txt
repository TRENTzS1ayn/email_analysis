Hi,

First, thanks for the tidy program.  Very useful.

I'm using Tidy COM in my application.  When I give it this HTML file
(created by MS Front Page 2000), it produces invalid XML.  I have turned on
the "Output as XML" flag and tried various switches to fix the problem.  I
have been able to make it work.  MS XML DOM and XML Spy cannot open the file
due to the "<!DOCTYPE" line.

Happy holidays,

Ken
