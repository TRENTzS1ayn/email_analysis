I think it is very easy to find correct dimension of any picture, in just three steps.

(1) open picture with Internet Explorer (a very popular program)
(2) save as (filename.bmp)
(3) open *.bmp picture with MS paint (comes with windows 95, 98 ....?) get height & width dimensions from
there

what could be easier, almost as simple as saying "I don't understand"

what's the matter with everybody?

: Maybe some of this could be controlled by a "fussiness" parameter? Leaving these attributes off results in
the image being displayed at its default dimensions, which is usually correct. Specifying the wrong value,
OTOH, causes nasty distortions - that may be fine for static sites, but is really a pain for dynamically
generated HTML.
