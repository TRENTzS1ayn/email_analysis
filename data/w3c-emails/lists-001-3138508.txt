I'm not sure why you think this is relevant.  I have worked on many web sites in which there was not always perfect coordination between the HTML coders and the artists.  It is not that it is difficult to determine the dimensions of a single picture (as long as you are running Windows, anyway - some people do not).  It is that when you have dozens of images, it does not happen automatically - and using the wrong dimensions is worse than using no dimensions.
