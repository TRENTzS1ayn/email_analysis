Why so complicated?

With MS Internet Explorer (at least versions 4+, not sure about older), you 
simply right-click the image that you want to check, and select PROPERTIES. 
The appearing pop-up will tell you about the image's dimensions.

In Netscape (checked with version 4.08 on WinNT5, but I think it's valid 
for all versions on all platforms), you have two simple ways: right click 
the image and select "view image". In the TITLE bar you will find the 
dimensions.
Alternatively, right click into the page and select VIEW INFO (Or select 
PAGE INFO from the VIEW menu). You will get a list of all images contained 
in the page, and for each image you can retrieve detailed information (like 
original dimensions and scaled size).


HTML Editors like Allaire's HomeSite automatically add height and width 
attribute values of the image's natural dimensions to edited image tags. 
I'd be surprised if, for example, Emacs did not offer similar functionality.


Merry Christmas!
