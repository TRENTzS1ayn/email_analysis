and similar suggestions may be useful for a small number of images, but
they fail with large numbers.  Suggestions to "right-click this or that",
or use any technique that requires the poor user to take multiple
individual actions with each image (locate image, right-click image, note
dimensions by hand) are impractical there.

As an aside, this is one area in general where Microsoft tools fail the
test of "enterprise-readiness": they're mostly built on the assumption that
there is always one user doing one thing on one object.  If you use
Microsoft tools for business, ask yourself how you'd handle this real-life
example using only MS tools: remove the notes from every page of 50
PowerPoint presentations and also print them in color to PDF files.  Or
this one: find and record in a single text file the dimensions, color
characteristics, and other meta-information about every image on a given
computer running Windows.

Those are realistic circumstances.
