Thank you Sebastian & Klaus

Just for the record, I have checked the following.
you can right click picture, MSIE #5 and Opera 5.01
Opera tells you how many color bits

display picture in Netscape 4.76 & 6 (or 5?)   see in "go" or it tells you at the top of the picture.

I must add I have never gone to the trouble to check image the first method I said, I just knew it could be
done if needed
now thanks to everyone, I know there is a quicker and simpler way.

From Eric
