Tidy is warning that you have tables that should have a "summary" attribute 
added to them to comply with accessibility recommendations.

From the C version of Tidy:

  The table summary attribute should be used to describe the table
  structure. It is very helpful for people using non-visual browsers. 

From the HTML 4.01 specification:

  Attribute definitions

  summary = text [CS] 
    This attribute provides a summary of the table's purpose and structure
    for user agents rendering to non-visual media such as speech and
    Braille.
