To Whom It May Concern-

I am writing in regards to your software program HTML Tidy. I recently tested it on my PC and could not get the necessary changes that I implemented to save to my document. I looked at your website literature and cannot find a command that allows you to save changes to the original HTML document. Does such a command exit? If so, what is the code and how do I implement it? I could do most of the other commands listed in your literature, but could not get these changes to show up on my original document. FYI, my operating system is Windows NT. If you could get back to me regarding this issue as soon as possible, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Thank you,
Erik J. Akelaitis
