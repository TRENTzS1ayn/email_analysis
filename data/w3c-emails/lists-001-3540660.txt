I ran tidy on a file and noticed some very big problems.  If you'll notice
that on line 26 of aftertidy.html there is a line that should not even be
there.  I know that the documents state that there are some bugs handling
embedding php coding.  Lines 64-68 are perfect examples.  These files are
direct before and after pictures.  Let me know if you need more info.

Thanks,
