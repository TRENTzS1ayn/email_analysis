Has anyone managed to get Tidy working on Mac OS X? I got it to compile by 
modifying the makefile to use cc and tweaking platforms.h. It works fine 
on HTML files with UNIX line ends, but it gets confused when I try run it 
on an HTML file that uses Mac line ends.

The obvious workaround is to always use files with UNIX line ends. But is 
there a simple way to get tidy to recognize Mac line ends properly (either 
at compile time or run time)?
