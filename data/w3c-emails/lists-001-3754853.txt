When I put an html document through tidy with missing end tags, the tags
are inserted by the "cleaning" function, but no errors or warnings are
reported.  I'm not interested in the "cleaned" copy, only in knowing the
errors/warnings.  Is there any way to get Tidy to report these errors?

Thanks!

Carolyn
