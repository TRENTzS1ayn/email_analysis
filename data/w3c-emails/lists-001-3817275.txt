I'm using Tidy to convert some ActionPoint files to XML.  ActionPoint uses 
input files that are HTML, more or less, but with some additional 
attributes to note the linkage of XML schemas to certain input elements in 
the HTML.  I want to be able to manipulate these files with XSLT, so Tidy 
seemed a natural choice to convert them to XHTML.

However, while it's easy to add new elements to Tidy's awareness, there 
doesn't seem to be a way to tell it to leave _AP* attributes alone.  I've 
checked the list archives and the doc, and haven't come across anything 
that looks likely.  Does anyone know a way to do this?  Or has anyone 
already patched Tidy to do it?  If not, any code pointers would be 
helpful.  (I could do this with Perl and HTML::Parser, but so much of that 
would be reinventing the wheel...)

Thanks in advance,
Chris

P.S. I read this list through the Web archive interface, so a courtesy copy 
would be appreciated, but isn't necessary.
