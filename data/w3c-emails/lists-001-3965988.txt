Hello,

Whenever "output-xhtml" is on, every document is stamped as
"XHTML Transitional" regardless of what the source was. This
means that documents created as XHTML "Strict" or "Frameset"
systematically get stamped as "Transitional".

I'm just wondering if this bug has been fixed and when will the
bugfixed version be available.

***

Secondarily, has Tidy been upgraded to recognize "XHTML Basic"
documents yet?

Thanks!
