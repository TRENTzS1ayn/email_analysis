make a  " BATch " file with copy and paste and save using NOTEPAD or
some other text editor.
and save this file in the same directory as tidy.exe

rem ============ file called "check_file.bat ==========
find /v /n "" %1%2 > %1-%2_num.txt
copy %1%2 oldver.htm

tidy.exe -config config.txt -f %1-%2_notes.txt -modify %1%2

copy %1%2 %1new.html
copy oldver.htm %1%2
del oldver.htm
rem ================ eof =================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
right click "start" from windows 95-98 desktop
and select "explore"
go to C:\WINDOWS\SendTo
right click from that directory select "new" then "shortcut"
"browse" until you find the batch file you just made and saved
select "next" change name if you like, then "finish"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOW from any directory in you computer, you can right click
you HTM file and send it to tidy.exe via the batch file you just made

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
if you would like to know what the batch file does, to save someone
asking.

As it is running "CHECK_FILE.BAT"
A file called "fileName-html_num.txt"
Then it copies "fileName.html" to "oldver.htm"
Then it runs tidy
& makes notes to file called "fileName-html_notes.txt"
& fixes errors and modifies "fileName.html"
Then it copies you modified version to "new_fileName.HTMLnew.html"  (or
something like that)
Then it copies your original html file back to your original
"fileName.html"
Then it deletes the file it made called "oldver.htm"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

keep coding good.
in case you don't know
you can use that "send to" feature to send any file to any program

Examples are:
*.gif and or *.jpg or *.png to Internet explorer, etc ,
unzipped *.txt or *.html, file to Wordpad (so you can read them),
*.cpp file to Notepad or Wordpad
*.HTML file to Internet explorer, Netscape, &/or opera to see how it
looks
