**THANK YOU** for this hint.

BTW, I'm not sure if this applies in Win 95/98, but in Win2k, I did not find
the SendTo folder right away. Windows help explained: "Important: The SendTo
folder is hidden by default. If it is not visible, click Tools, click Folder
Options, click the View tab, and then click Show hidden files and folders. "

Also in Win2k, the SendTo folder is located off the user's folder (e.g.,
c:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\SendTo), not off the windoze
directory.
