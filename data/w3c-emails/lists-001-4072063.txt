Hi, first off - great tool.  Our organization is moving to HTML for all
internal documentation, and I've just began to use Tidy to clean up Word
2000 files.

There is one problem I'm having though - in netscape/ie, tables look
weird when there are empty cells (no regular border resulting in a large
blank patch in the middle of the table).  The original word2000 files
used to put a &nbsp; in the empty cells to fix this, but unfortuantely
Tidy strips this out.

Is there an option to make sure tables appear regularly gridded?  (I'm
presuming a space or character in every cell is the only way to achieve
this right?

While I'm here - anyone know of a decent wysiwyg HTML editor for windows
for the non-techies in our orgnaization?

Thanks,

nick
