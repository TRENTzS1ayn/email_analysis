Thanks Sebastian, I believe either a space or br will work.  My question
however was was if there is a way for Tidy to strip out spaces?  Asking
all Word users to manually break each cell of a very large table so
there exists a <br> instead of a space is hardly an option.

My fault - I should have said we need a free/open-source editor, not a
commercial site manager.  Dreamweaver doesn't really cut it for
site-management here - no support for CVS versioning or ssh/scp
syncronization.
