Hello Nick,

well, do you have Perl available?
I would use a small Perl script to post-process the Tidy output and fix 
things like your empty table cell problem.

a regular expression like the following should do the job:

# put a <BR> into empty table cells
$tidied_data =~ s/(<TD[^>]*?>)\s*(<\/TD[^>]*?>)/$1<BR>$2/gsi;

# replace &nbsp; with a <BR> in otherwise empty table cells
$tidied_data =~ s/(<TD[^>]*?>)\s*&nbsp;\s*(<\/TD[^>]*?>)/$1<BR>$2/gsi;

# do both at once and for table headers as well
$tidied_data =~ 
s/(<T[HD][^>]*?>)((\s*&nbsp;)?\s*)(<\/T[HD][^>]*?>)/$1<BR>$3/gsi;


Regarding the Editor, I have no better suggestion, sorry.



Have a nice day, Nick... we shouldn't be working on a holiday... ;-)
