This error is not unique to Jaap.   But see GUI note later.

I'm also running NT4.0 Sp 5, w/ Tidy from 4 Aug 2000.
With the line drop-font-tags: yes in a configuration file, I get the exception error
but only after the following warning appear on screen (the error file isn't created
-so I ran the job a bunch of times and finally gleaned the error list since even
Pause isn't effective):

Unknown attribute "old"
Unknown attribute "bookman"

When I comment out the drop-font-tags: yes line in the configuration file (using //),
the job finishes fine.
This occurs with or without the Clean: yes option specified.
The input file has the following line which is causing the error:
<center><font face="&lt;font face=" bookman="" old="" size="5">How
Hunting Regulations are Established</font> <font face=
"Bookman Old Style" size="4"><br>

I tried specifying the --drop-font-tags:yes on the command line with the -config
option but still got the exception error.
===================
I can run the file through the GUI version of Tidy (V1.1.4) using a configuration
file built by that program and that contains the drop-font-tags: yes line.   The job
runs fine and shows the same two warning lines shown above followed by a few more
with the next one being about a different input line and saying "warning: trimming
empty <font>"

I am converting old files to CSS so really need this option (drop-font-tags).  Since
I am converting a complete site, I have many files and am wanting to use the wildcard
feature of Tidy - which the GUI version doesn't support. Plus I want to just dump the
new (tidied) file in the old one.
