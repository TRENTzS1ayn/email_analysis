Dear Darren,
        By the way, I love your products (FireWorks, Flash and Homesite).
They're great! I don't know how Visual C++ works but i noe that the tidy
compiles to a .lib file. Can i use this .lib file within delphi? if so how?
I don't know any thing about the MFC and stuff like that. I only know delphi
and vb :). So can you please help me out?  Thanks in advance.
            From Aaron
