The easiest way probably is to run the markup through Tidy, then strip 
everything up to the <body> tag, and everything from the </body> tag.

Note this will still give you a <p> tag, depending on your fragments you may be
able to simply discard it, or place some "marker" tag to denote the start of 
your content.
