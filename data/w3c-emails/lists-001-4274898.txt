Gregory,

That's interesting - because the version I have here (installed with HomeSite/Studio) advertizes itself as "(vers 4th August 2000)" when I start it from the command line (without giving any command-line parameters).

I went looking at the web site when I wondered if there was a newer one I found the same date on the web page. I did not try to re-download for that reason. I don't know when this version was downloaded (by Allaire) for inclusion with HomeSite/Studio, but it was in release 4.5.2 - December 2000.
