aloha, marjolein!

the page from which i re-downloaded the executable does proclaim that the
version is 4 august 2000, but the executable itself claims that it is the
30 april 2000 version...  this could be due either to faulty mirroring, or
to simply having forgotten to update the executable's verbiage to reflect
the correct release date...

so, i guess what i'm saying in plain english is that i did download
tidy.exe, but instead of reporting that it was the 4 august 2000 release,
it reports that it is the 30 april 2000 version... 

in any event, it runs flawlessly on the Win2k platform...

gregory.

interesting - because the version I have here (installed with
HomeSite/Studio) advertizes itself as "(vers 4th August 2000)" when I
start it from the command line (without giving any command-line
parameters).  > > I went looking at the web site when I wondered if there
was a newer one I found the same date on the web page. I did not try to

(by Allaire) for inclusion with HomeSite/Studio, b ut it was in release
4.5.2 - December 2000.  > > > At 12:39 2001-05-07 -0400, gregory j.
