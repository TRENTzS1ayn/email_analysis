Aaron,

HTML Tidy is written in straight C code, so you could simply write a Delphi
wrapper around it. I did some work a while back to compile it into a Win32
DLL to call it from Delphi. We (Macromedia, formerly Allaire) wrap HTML Tidy
with our Homesite and Cold Fusion Studio products, but we eventually decided
to just call it via CreateProcess so our users could provide their own hot
fixes by downloading the latest .EXE.

Regards,
Darren Forcier
