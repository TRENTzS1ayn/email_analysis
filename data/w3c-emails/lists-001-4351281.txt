I didn't respond to the earlier messages as I wanted to see what other
people's responses were first.

Tidy in its present form causes me extra work (which I don't feel has to be
necessary - although I would say the majority of the code is very portable
to different platforms) to port to Mac OS. I was waiting for a future DOM
based Tidy to make major architectural changes to my code. Specifically I
am looking to have a single Tidy engine that I could use with multiple Mac
OS user interfaces, communicating via Apple Events (which would allow
external scripting of the engine by 3rd parties). Apple's recommended
scripting implementation is known as the Object Model - while this is not
strictly object orientated, having the guts of Tidy being separate from the
UI (which it is not now) with a defined API would help. So perhaps an
event-driven model like expat would work for me (although I haven't looked
at the expat code).

Yes, I would agree. And a proper bug database would make the following
unnecessary.

I stopped after I had released my updated versions based on the 04 Aug 2000
source, and was waiting for the mythical Mar 2001 update before updating
the bug report collection again (i.e. the pages were getting long, and I
was hoping that I could retire most of the bug reports once they had been
fixed in a maintenance release).

However... I lost my hard drive to a crash last week, including all my
html-w3 EMails. I hope to get my data recovered by a drive recovery
company. Yes, I know I can go through the online archives, but I would
rather spend my time on other things right at the moment. So the bug report
update will have to wait.

I agree. I would like to get involved (to help make the port more portable
and/or add Mac OS support into the base source code), but I know I am busy
too. I am just coming up to speed with cvs, but I have a lot of experience
with multi-person development teams/project on various platforms (including
open source).


Anyway, I am listening - keep the discussion going.

Regards, Terry
