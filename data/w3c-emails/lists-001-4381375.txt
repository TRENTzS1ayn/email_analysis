This has been a known problem since the beginning of this year.  See:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2001JanMar/0082.html

Unfortunately, it appears that it has not yet been fixed.  However, you may 
download the source ZIP file from:

  http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy4aug00.zip

It contains the current (4 Aug 2000) executable in addition to the source 
files.
