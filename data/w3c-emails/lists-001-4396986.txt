I was waiting for a future DOM

Er, why would any sane programmer *WANT* a DOM-based Tidy?
The DOM may very possibly be a good way to expose a browser's internal
representation to a script, although I have very serious doubts about
that, but if there is a worse representation for actually *doing*
anything with an XML document I have yet to see it described in print.

I hope that my article about problems in the DOM will soon be available
on the Web; it's been accepted, reviewed, the contract's signed, and I
just have to clear up the reviewer's points.  Trouble is, the DOM has
so _many_ problems that it's quite a big article.

Let me put it this way:  the fact that people prefer JDOM to the DOM
says really terrible things about DOM.
