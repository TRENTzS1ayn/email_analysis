I don't quite see the put of using TABs.
The thing about spaces is that everyone knows what they are,
whereas outside the UNIX world (where a TAB is 8 columns, by fiat)
it's open slather.  Tabs might be _anything_ from 1 column to 40 (and yes
I have seen 40-column tabs once).  Even in the UNIX world, there are too
many people who think it's ok to use the TAB key in VI instead of using
VI's native indenting commands, with the result that their code is unusable
by anyone else.

If you really REALLY have to do this, you don't have to change Tidy.
Just pipe the output through "pr -t -iN" where N is the number of columns
per tab you think is the right amount.  There are open source versions of
pr around, even for Windows.
