Hi, Michael --

I believe that subsequent reports of the IllegalAccessError have
revealed that the problem can be fixed simply by recompiling the code. 
The source is downloaded with the java version and there are not too
many .java files.

It seems like this had to do with some sort of compiler incompatibility
with the compiler that we used to create the .class files.  It should be
fixed for future releases but this should get you by for now.

HTH,
Gary
