Hi Dave

I have tried clicking on Download Tidy from your
http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/#download
without success. Nothing seems to happen except a page refresh. Should I
expect a normal download pattern.

Your application sounds great. I am a web design student studying at
college in Australia. If you can point me in the right direction it
would be most appreciated. Thanks for your help.

Sincerely
David Butler
