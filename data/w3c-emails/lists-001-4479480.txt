Hello Basim,

I have such a web based version running on http://www.sl-chat.de/Tidy and 
in our intranet. I plan to make some changes to it once the next version of 
tidy gets released and then make the source code of my perl scripts 
available on the mentioned page.

at the moment, the code is not really in a "releasable" state ;-)


You can use my online version in the meantime.
If you intend to develop your own solution, please feel free to ask me if 
you need assistance.

Maybe the first chat site that validates as HTML
4.0 even though user input may contain HTML codes.
