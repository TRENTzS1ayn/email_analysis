"Downloading Tidy" on http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/ should take
you to http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/#download , which should
present you with a list of alternative binaries. Which of these links,
when pressed, merely causes a page refresh?

If you're using Windows, avoid tidy.exe (out of date, the last time I
looked) and instead look further down the page for tidy4aug00.zip. This
contains the most recent source and executable.
