I have cleaned my HTML code until Tidy reports no errors or warnings.  I have checked
several of these files via W3C validation programs and each has checked out fine.
It would take me quite a while to validate each file since I have a few web sites and
a good number of files.  I would like to place the W3C validation GIF on my sites.

Question: If I get no errors w/ Tidy GUI 1.1.4 which uses Tidy Version 4, August
2000, will these files also check out without errors (using HTML 4.01 Transitional)
at the W3C validation site - which would mean I can use the GIF without running each
file through the validation program?
Thanx!
