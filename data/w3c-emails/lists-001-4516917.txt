Well, not necessarily. Tidy finds most errors in HTML documents, but
there is a not so small number of errors, that Tidy doesn't find; also
there is a number of SGML constructs, Tidy couldn't parse properly, so
don't rely on HTML Tidy.

You can use http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/ or
http://arealvalidator.com/ to check whole sites to insure your pages are
really valid.
