Hello,,
   i am trying to converting an html document to xml. In the intial, my document conversion was fine until when i used XT parser to parse the resulting xml ouput . I have the obtained the following error.

    xml:154: reference to undefined entity "nbsp"


   I have following setting in the jtidy-04aug2000r6/src/org/w3c/tidy/

# sample config file for Java HTML tidy
indent=auto
indent-spaces=3
wrap=72
markup=yes
clean=yes
output-xml=no
input-xml=no
show-warnings=yes
numeric-entities=yes
quote-marks=yes
quote-nbsp=no
quote-ampersand=yes
break-before-br=no
uppercase-tags=yes
uppercase-attributes=yes
smart-indent=yes
output-xhtml=yes
char-encoding=latin1

I want to know is there a way not by HTMLTidy or that will no prevent the &nbsp from printing out to the output file...

Help is greatly and pointers from all of your all is greatly appericated.


Yours Sincerely

Erik Tan
