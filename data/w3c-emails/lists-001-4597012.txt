Hi Richard,

Have a look at my previous posting.  I'd be curious what you think.  My
basic thinking is that Tidy couldn't use a DOM, because the whole point of
Tidy is that you can throw all kinds of mal-formed slop at it and produce
nice clean code.  

But it seems to me that Tidy would be great to produce a DOM.  

Bjoern's approach of traversing the internal Tidy tree and emitting SAX
events seems like a good one in principle, but I wonder if you can
adequately capture HTML in SAX events (designed to present XML).  That said,
a Tidy-To-DOM filter seems like another great application for a Tidy
library.

I look forward your article when it comes out.  Will you post a link?

Charlie

Er, why would any sane programmer *WANT* a DOM-based Tidy?
The DOM may very possibly be a good way to expose a browser's internal
representation to a script, although I have very serious doubts about that,
but if there is a worse representation for actually *doing* anything with an
XML document I have yet to see it described in print.

I hope that my article about problems in the DOM will soon be available on
the Web; it's been accepted, reviewed, the contract's signed, and I just
have to clear up the reviewer's points.  Trouble is, the DOM has so _many_
problems that it's quite a big article.

Let me put it this way:  the fact that people prefer JDOM to the DOM says
really terrible things about DOM.
