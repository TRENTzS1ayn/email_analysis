I think this DLL is the glue code between HTML-Kit and their own, custom
tidy library.  Tidy GUI has one, too.  If you're looking for a standalone
Tidy DLL, there isn't one.  

This is why some of us are looking to refactor Tidy as a freestanding
library plus a command line driver that uses the lib.  Currently, they're
both combined into one piece.

take it easy,
Charles Reitzel
