nbsp is just one of the special characters tidy can't handle. (Or tidy can,
but your xml parser won't). The best thing you can do is to replace the
special characters to character code. At least the most common ones, like
nbsp, copysign, ampersand etc..
So change "&nbsp;" into "&#160;" .  You can simply do this in Java with a
replace function.

look here for more special characters and their codes.
