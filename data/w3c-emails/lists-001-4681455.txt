Mahendra --

Sorry I didn't reply sooner.  Checking the documentation page
(http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/), it looks like including the
configuration file property
  uppercase-attributes: yes
will result in outputting all of the attributes in upper case.  To
preserve the existing case, it looks like you'll have to output your
results as XHTML or XML.

HTH,
Gary
