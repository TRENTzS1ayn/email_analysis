Using your config file, I get a character with hex value A0, which is
correct for latin-1 encoding.  I don't know why you're getting "&nbsp;".
However, if I delete the "quote-nbsp=no" from your config file, I get
"&#160;" instead, which may be what you want (we use Tidy to output
XHTML this way and it has been working just fine).
