VAN BRUWAENE Kris <Kris.VANBRUWAENE@VRT.BE> asked:
When using Tidy to convert from html to xhtml I find that it
replaces & within url's with &amp;

Yes, it must.
This looks somewhat unexpected to me.

It shouldn't.

Is it a bug or is there a reason for it?

Yes, there IS a bug in the document, no, Tidy is NOT buggy for correcting it.

<a href="search.pl?key1=value1&key2=value2"> becomes
<a href="search.pl?key1=value1&amp;key2=value2">

And so it should.  Tidy has fixed a serious mistake in the document.
