Hello

I have a possibility of implementing a couple of improvements for the
current tidy release. 
First one: the tidy apparently is not thread-safe and is not usable as a
thread-safe library/component. This could be fixed.
Second one: add the more comprehensive encodings support for tidy. This task
is also quite interesting.

If someone would like to participate pls. answer. Also the web-hosting
support is required. If someone has no objections about deploying such a
modifications on his/hers web-site this would be most appreciated.
