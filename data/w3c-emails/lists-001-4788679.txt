There's agreement about naked & being invalid in the specs.  As a note, it's
worth checking to see how you *really* have Tidy configured to catch
unexpected behaviour from it.

The AdjustConfig function will overwrite the setting of some variable to
ensure that Tidy's config is "sensible".  The original email mentioned that
xHTML is being output.  Here's a snippet from AdjustConfig

 /* XML requires end tags */
    if (XmlOut)
    {
        QuoteAmpersand = yes;
        HideEndTags = no;
    }

It's worthwhile checking your configuration after AdjustConfig has been
executed to see how it's really configured to run.
