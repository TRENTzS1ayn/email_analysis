Just FYI.  We do have JTidy set up at SourceForge and SourceForge has
been working well.  We strive to maintain compatability with Tidy, bugs
and all, but we do have JavaDoc that shows the interface designed by
Andy Quick who developed JTidy, if that's of any use to you.

I definitely think that JTidy and Tidy should be kept in synch as much
as possible.  For example, the Java version is not thread-safe either! 
Do you plan to keep the discussion here at html-tidy or will you move it
to SourceForge.  Please keep this list advised.

Thanks,
Gary
