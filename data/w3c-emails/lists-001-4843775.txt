As Gary said, there is already a JTidy project setup on Source Forge.
It's the Java version, were you thinking of setting up a parallel one
for the C version?

It would be good to join in with the JTidy project and keep code forking

In any case, I am also interested in helping.  I have disk space, ftp
site and a web site that I am willing to offer for keeping the unofficial
patches that I've seen floating around on the list.
