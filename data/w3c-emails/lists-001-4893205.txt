I don't know, but I hope you realize that Tidy is doing a valiant job of
attempting to parse it, and totting up well over four hundred errors in
the process -- to see this list of errors, just add "-f errors.txt" (no
quotation marks) to the command line.

I'd start by converting all the unescaped "&" to "&amp;" and removing
"<blogdateheader>" and "</blogdateheader>". Then try Tidy again.
