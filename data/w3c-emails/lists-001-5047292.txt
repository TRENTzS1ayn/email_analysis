Hmm, good point.  The separate lib was one of the things that started
everyone down this path in the first place.  I'd hate to see enthusiasm
wane due to a "bug fix first" approach.

Perhaps a good middle ground might be to just apply previously posted
bug *fixes* (those that can be reasonably verified) while file names,
line numbers, etc. still match up.  Then go ahead with the refactoring
without necessarily pausing for a release.
