Hi Dave,

Would you be willing to join us in the Source Forge version?  It would be a
real boon to the project. Or would you prefer us to track your updates?

Charlie

I have been working in Tidy on and off for the last few months but
didn't want to issue a new release until the major issues were dealt
with. After a US trip next week, I will at last get a respite from
travel over the Summer months, and plan to focus on the following
areas:

 * A major overhaul of how Tidy figures out the doctype based
   on the elements and attributes in the document content

 * When o/p to XHTML ensuring that the content of script and style
   elements are wrapped within CDATA marked sections using the
   appropriate comment syntax to hide these from non-XML browsers

 * New option to enable/disable propagation of inline emphasis

 * Cleaner separation of front-end/back-end so that Tidy can be
   used as thread-safe library

 * Other miscellaneous bug fixes
