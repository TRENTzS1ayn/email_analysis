This is great.  May I propose that we start our CVS source files direct from
Dave Raggett's 4 Aug, 2000 version and apply your diffs?

Does everybody want to move this stuff over to the project developer's
forum?

Although I did lose a lot of my work recently in a hard drive crash, I do
still have current copies of source to my various implementations of Tidy
for Mac OS. I could provide source (to an unsupported command line version
for Mac OS, that I use for testing purposes) that has all the bug fixes
referred to by my "tidybugs" page above. It has very few Mac OS specific
changes.

I am at a developers conference all this week, so I won't be able to get to
it for a little while - do you want me to import/add it directly into CVS
at SourceForge, or would you rather do that? - I guess I could send you
"diffs" of my code and the 04 Aug 00 release.

I suppose I should look at what it would take to import existing bugs
reports into Perfect Tracker.

I imagine eventually more of this type of discussion will move to SF's
forums instead.

Regards, Terry
