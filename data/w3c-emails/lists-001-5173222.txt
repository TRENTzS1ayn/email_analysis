+1.  As long as we maintain momentum on a library, I'm ok w/ an interim "bug
fix only" release.

Hmm, good point.  The separate lib was one of the things that started
everyone down this path in the first place.  I'd hate to see enthusiasm
wane due to a "bug fix first" approach.

Perhaps a good middle ground might be to just apply previously posted
bug *fixes* (those that can be reasonably verified) while file names,
line numbers, etc. still match up.  Then go ahead with the refactoring
without necessarily pausing for a release.
