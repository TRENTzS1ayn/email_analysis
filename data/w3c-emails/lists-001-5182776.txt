Hi Valeri,

I was shooting for pure ANSI C.  But, it is a rough draft and may not
compile!  I'll try to build it tonight and update the document in the
project (see Project Documentation under
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidy).  

As for DOM compatibility, this is a fairly complicated topic and something
I'd like to avoid saddling the project with at this early stage.  

If we do our job right, you should be able to use the library to write an
adapter that emits SAX events.  In general, if you can emit SAX events, you
can load a DOM.  It may even be possible to implement a DOM wrapper
directly. 

For C/C++, however, you can't assume source compatibility w/ any DOM.  I.e.
there are no standard w3c header files for a C++ DOM.  Also, C++ linkage is
not portable between compilers.  Thus, we would need a separate Tidy-To-DOM
adapter for each C++ DOM implementation: Apache, GNOME, others?  All in good
time, I hope.

All that said, I like your diagram very much.  I think you have captured
Bj?rn H?hrmann's original idea very well.  All I would change is to replace
the name DOM w/ "Tidy Document Tree".  In this scenario, a SAX event stream
and/or DOM wrapper is another output "format".

See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2001AprJun/0027.html

Btw, Tidy currently performs "optimization" as part of the parse.

Charlie

Hi Charlie

What have you sent? :) Is it C or C++ code?
Let's decide what language we will use. I stand for strict ANSI C.

What about DOM core level 1 implementation? Actually tidy has it's
proprietary DOM tree but _may_ be it would be better to implement a standard
one? Tidy then could be splitted into following parts: DOM tree building
(input), DOM tree optimisation, DOM tree saving.

Something like that

Tidy
+--DOM tree building module
|  \--Input stream (character codec or 'pseudo' character codec)
|
+--DOM tree 'optimisation' module
|
+--DOM tree saving module
|  +--Output stream (character codec or 'pseudo' character codec)
|  +--XHTML
|  \--HTML
|
+--Other?
