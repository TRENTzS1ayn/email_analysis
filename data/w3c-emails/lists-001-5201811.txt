I am grateful for other people who are prepared to take up
the baton for supporting Tidy as I know that I don't have
enough time to do this myself. I have been doing a fair
amount of work over the last 8 months, but never got to the
point where I felt comfortable making a new release. 

How about:

 a) I commit to finishing off in June the major things
    that I have already started on

 b) We use email to discuss the design changes needed to
    separate Tidy into a front end and a thread-safe back
    end library

 c) I remain available to consult on design changes/bug
    fixes, but the majority of the work is picked up by
    others

 d) The W3C tidy page directs people to Source Forge

With increased man power, perhaps it make sense to think
about test suites and regression tools (at least for the
common sets of option values). I never had the time for
this, and had to rely on all the users out there to
do the QA job. I do use Tidy on a daily basis though.

p.s. if this works well, I have another project ready to
go open source for rendering math on the web.
