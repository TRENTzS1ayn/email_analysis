Hi,

   let me first say I've asked Masayasu Ishikawa to point Dave on the
recent discussions regarding the future development of HTML Tidy since
we liked to hear what he thinks about this. Thanks Masayasu.

I think we'd greatly appreciate a list of the things you've
changed/fixed. This would ease to go through the archives to
collect bug reports/feature requests/bugfixes.

Sounds great. We should move to a sourceforge mailing lists
for b) since not all subscribers to html-tidy@ will be
interested in this.

Yes! I focussed on what Tidy should do (and sometimes
doesn't :-) in the past, I'd happily work an a testsuite
to monitor this.
