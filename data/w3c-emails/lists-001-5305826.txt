Dear Dave Raggett,
  I have frecuently experience that when I input the Tab key, the Homesite 4.5.2 (originally 4.5.1 width 4.5.2 update) make down a line (like an Enter) and move the last character from the actuallly line to the new line.
Sorry for the bad description.  I don't speak well english, but when you want, I can report the bug better in Spanish or in German.
Thanks for all,
Poper
