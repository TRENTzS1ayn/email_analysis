    We're running the 4th August 2000 release of HTML Tidy on
Linux with 2.2.19 kernel.  We have the following in our config file:

doctype: strict
alt-text: "[Image]"

    With both of these options enabled, Tidy segfaults on the following
file (apologies about the length).  With just one of these options
enabled,
Tidy tidies (albeit with appropriate warnings/errors).  Is this a Tidy
bug?

  <P ALIGN="LEFT">This August, Bloomington Parks and Recreation is
offering
  children a chance to get up close and personal with a school bus, fire
truck,
  cement mixer, crane and more. Children will be able to look, touch and
possibly
  sit inside of the trucks they see every day on the roads. Just imagine
the
  delight as kids are told that it is ok to touch a truck! For more
information
  or to pre-register your group call Leslie at 349-3748.</P>
