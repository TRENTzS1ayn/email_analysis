Hi
This example checks out OK with Tidy, and had be rewritten just to show
an example.

Now the problem, I had two tables, while I was making it up as I went, I
put everything inside another third table
The picture in the right table disappears in Netscape 4.73 but can be
seen in Internet Explorer 5

To fix the problem, the align="right" is removed, and any other aligns
can be removed in this example as it does not serve any purpose.

Could readers of the group report code that might not work from browser
to browser, so Tidy could give a warning,  or is this two much of a
worry and everyone should always check out their work on all browser,
just to keep them busy. And maybe I should not make thing up as I go
along. (just like this posting)
