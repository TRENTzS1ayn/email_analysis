Dear sir,

I'm trying to use tidyGUI on my pentium III in windows 2000 Pro and I
find that your program uses a single character for end of line even when
the eol is already two bytes. I end up with three character eols. How
can I fix this obvious error. Is there a setting somewhere?

Best Regards,
Ephraim F. Moya
