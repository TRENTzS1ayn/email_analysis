Hi,

Our agency maintains the Intel webpages in Europe, and is preparting a
HTML > XHTML transition for all its pages (to start with: 1600 html
pages).

These pages heavily use Javascript, SSI and sometimes dynamically
connect to a database of customers.

I have found out Tidy is the W3O approved tool for this, but having seen
the many and detailed discussions about bugs and problems with Tidy
makes me a little bit apprehensive to start using is (but is there any
alternative?)

1stPage2000 only has an option "Convert to XML" (do they mean XHTML?),
but this does not handle the pages well (if at all, obviously because
part of the code is not recognized?).

Also, the Beautify HTML option in 1stPage2000 gives fine results on
screen, but in a browser it gives ugly white spaces around gifs. Any
trick to get rid of these?

So question: how to proceed with a large set of complex pages with this
conversion?

Any help is greatly appreciated.
