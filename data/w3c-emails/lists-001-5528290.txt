Hi,

To add to my earlier mail.

We produce Intel web pages in several European languages: French,
Italian, German, Spanish, Polish, Turkish and sometimes Russian.

We use the ISO charsets for these, resp. 1, 2 and 9, except for Russian,
for which we use Windows Cyrillic.

How does Tidy handle non-Latin charsets? Does anyboday has experience
with this?

Thanks,

frank
