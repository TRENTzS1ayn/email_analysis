Using MixedContent seems like a reasonable solution.
I think it is worth extending ParseText to discard
all inline tags not just font. For textarea, is it
worth escaping all instances of < and & in the content?
Isolated ones will be already, but what about the case
where the users will be allowed to type markup in to
the textarea box, and the author wants to include some
as the default value for the field.
