Briefly, I want to validate documents as XHTML 1.1 (Tidy "validates"
as XHTML 1.0 Strict, so I know I'm close), and yes, I'm sure the next
version of Tidy will support it in some way, but I'm looking for a more
general solution that I can re-use when a new DTD appears that I would
like to use.

I understand that Tidy is not a generic XML validator. Does anyone have
pointers to good resources for validating an XML file for which I have a
DTD?

I recently took a look at James Clark's SP ... heavily technical, but I
can use it. Or at least I could, if I could comprehend what's happening
with the XHTML 1.1 DTDs ...

Are these posted online as .dtd files? How do I reference them in a 
DOCTYPE line? I tried saving the "xhtml11.dtd" section of the spec as a 
local text file for validating against, but it contains all kinds of
references to other online files, which don't seem to quite work the way
I want them to ... What to do?
