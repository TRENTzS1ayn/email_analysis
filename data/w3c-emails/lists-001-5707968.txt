It doesn't look like HTML allows a "height" attribute on <tr>.  I
checked the HTML 4.01 and 3.2 specs.  So echoecho is right.

As for Tidy, there is a known problem with its checking of illegal
attributes.  The problem is that in most cases, Tidy does not check
attributes on a per-element basis.  Because "height" is allowed on
certain other elements like <img> and <object>, Tidy ends up allowing
it on ALL elements.

And your HTML book seems to be wrong.  Unfortunately, many HTML books
contain mistakes like this.
