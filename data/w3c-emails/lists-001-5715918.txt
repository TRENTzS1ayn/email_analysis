In Netscape's defense, it's doing what you asked!
You asked the cell in line 14 to span across the right cell which contains the
embeded table.
Simply move the width statement (13) to into the td (16) containing the table,
where it belongs.
Also http://validator.w3.org/
It's actually IE that's not displaying it as it's written.
Predicting what a browser does in quirks mode would be pretty tough.
