I got terrible, and very simpple, problem.
However, I can't handle it by myself, so maybe you can help me 
whit this problem.

The question is; how I can handle command (c:\tidy.exe -f 
c:\tidy\error.txt -config c:\tidy\config.txt c:\tidy\file.htm > 
c:\tidy\cleanfile.htm)? I've tried every way to handle this 
command, but tidy can't handle this kind command when it have 
inserted from VB. 

If I insert this command from Command Prompt it's allways works 
perfectly. 

Errorfile says: C:\Program Files\tidy.exe: can't open file ">". 
So, can you tell me what might be the problem?

Greetings from Finland
Tarmo
