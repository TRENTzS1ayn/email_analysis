Hi Zac,

I think you're on the right track w/ sp.  Any validating XML parser should
do the trick.  You may, however, need to do a bit of work to get the parser
to locate the DTD file based on the Formal Public Identifier (FPI) for XHTML
1.1.  The XHTML 1.1 spec includes an SGML CATALOG for this purpose.  As an
SGML parse, I'll bet a nickel that sp supports catalogs.

See 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xhtml11-20010531/xhtml11_dtd.html#a_xhtml11_ca
talog

You can probably download the dtd file and map the FPI to this local file.

If you're doing the validation in your own code, you can write an entity
resolver that returns the DTD when it sees the public ID of "-//W3C//DTD
XHTML 1.1//EN"

Hope this helps,
Charles Reitzel

Subject: Validating other DTDs (i.e. XHTML 1.1)



Briefly, I want to validate documents as XHTML 1.1 (Tidy "validates" as
XHTML 1.0 Strict, so I know I'm close), and yes, I'm sure the next version
of Tidy will support it in some way, but I'm looking for a more general
solution that I can re-use when a new DTD appears that I would like to use.

I understand that Tidy is not a generic XML validator. Does anyone have
pointers to good resources for validating an XML file for which I have a
DTD?

I recently took a look at James Clark's SP ... heavily technical, but I can
use it. Or at least I could, if I could comprehend what's happening with the
XHTML 1.1 DTDs ...

Are these posted online as .dtd files? How do I reference them in a  DOCTYPE
line? I tried saving the "xhtml11.dtd" section of the spec as a  local text
file for validating against, but it contains all kinds of references to
other online files, which don't seem to quite work the way I want them to
... What to do?

Zac
