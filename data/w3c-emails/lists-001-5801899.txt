Hi Tarmo,

I use Andr? Blavier's TidyCOM (comes w/ TidyGUI) from VB.  It is very useful
for batch Word2000 conversions from VB.

Get it at:
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/ablavier/TidyGUI/

Caveats:
1) I can only get the Debug version of TidyCOM to build (but this might be
fixed in Andr?'s latest build).

2) There is a tidy bug that breaks Word2000 conversion.  The fix is very
simple, however.

In clean.c, line 1806, 
change:
                node = list->next;
to:
                node = list;

Hope this helps,
Charles Reitzel

Subject: Question about cleaning file from VB6.0


I got terrible, and very simpple, problem. However, I can't handle it by
myself, so maybe you can help me  whit this problem.

The question is; how I can handle command (c:\tidy.exe -f 
c:\tidy\error.txt -config c:\tidy\config.txt c:\tidy\file.htm >
c:\tidy\cleanfile.htm)? I've tried every way to handle this command, but
tidy can't handle this kind command when it have  inserted from VB. 

If I insert this command from Command Prompt it's allways works perfectly. 

Errorfile says: C:\Program Files\tidy.exe: can't open file ">". So, can you
tell me what might be the problem?

Greetings from Finland
Tarmo
