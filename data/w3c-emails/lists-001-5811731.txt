You'd win that bet.  The problem is locating the *actual* DTD files themselves, 
outside of an appendix to the spec (W3C recommendation).  I did eventually get 
SP (nsgmls) working by using the xhtml11.dtd URL listed in an example from 
Section 2 of the XHTML 1.1 recommendation.  I just found it odd that there 
were no links to the actual .dtd URLs anywhere in the spec ... the catalog 
references a file "xhtml11-flat.dtd" ... I couldn't find that one except by 
guessing what the location must be.  I'm only 90% sure that I'm linking to 
the right URL.

Now that I have the link, though, SP is very useful for validating my code.  
I'm surprised that I haven't seen it integrated into editors, like Tidy is.

I'm thinking that it might be nice to have it linked into Tidy!  But I
suppose you can run SP on Tidy's output with some pretty basic redirection.
