Retraction: Expat doesn't validate (I knew that).  I use XML::Checker from
Perl on a regular bases, which is layered over Expat.

Xerces/C++ and GNOME libxml are validating libs.

Now that I have the link, though, SP is very useful for validating my code.

I'm surprised that I haven't seen it integrated into editors, like Tidy is.

<creitzel>When using code on XML, everyone and his brother (well, lots of
people anyway) uses James Clark's Expat library.  Now a Source Forget
project at http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat.
