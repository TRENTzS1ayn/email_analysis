We would love to have you involved!

We haven't discussed any release schedule yet - there is plenty more to do
with what is already on our plate.

But speaking for myself, I was thinking the following :

1) Finish importing known bug reports up to 1st June 2001 - I expect this
will take another week or 2.

2) Get as many of these bugs fixed as possible (Sebastian Lange will be
back from vacation tomorrow, hint hint <grin>).

3) Import Dave Raggett's latest changes into the source code base.

4) Release a new version. I can't see that happening at the current rate
until probably August.

5) Import bugs reports from past 1st June 2001.

6) Start seriously thinking about a library version of Tidy.

7) Fix more bugs, possibly implement some of the feature requests, and
items on Dave Raggett's pending list.

8) Release, lather, rinse, repeat...


Comments?
