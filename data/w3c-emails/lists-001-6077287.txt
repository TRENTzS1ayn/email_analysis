Dave Raggett:

I have sent you bug report based a line in HTML tidy.

I have been using MAX'S HTML BEAUTY ++ ME for about a week.   I am a novice
at creating a web page.   This is a wonderful editor.   I created a very a
basic web page several years ago which had a countdown calendar.   The page
looked good to me until I used HTML tidy and founds so many errors, I was
amazed that my page ever ran.  I am now in the process of correcting all
those errors.

Please let Marko Njezic know very happy I am with this free software.

Since using this program, I have had problems on two occasions.  The first
time that I received error messages had to reboot my machine to run the
program.  I kept on getting a repeated error message and the program never
closed.  I forget what the message was. The second time I received the error
messages, I was able to run the program by double-clicking program shortcut
icon after the last error message.  At this time, the program closed.

Please  forgive my very basic language.

On both occasions, I received at least 4 error dialog boxes.  The attachment
to this e-mail is a copy of each error dialog box in order of appearance,
listed in Word 97 which I copied using shift/alt/print screen.   I also
typed out under each dialog box, the error message.
