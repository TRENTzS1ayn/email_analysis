I was wondering if there exists any version or variant or configuration of
Tidy which could deal with an XML/HTML hybrid? More specifically I need to
just deal with the stuff that would appear inside the BODY tag, without adding
the HTML, HEAD, and TITLE tags. I have tried a lot of configuration options
for HTML Tidy, but have had no success so far.

If anyone could point me in the right direction it would be much appreciated.
