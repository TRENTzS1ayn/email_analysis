I have the same type of thing in mind.  It is the kind of thing you should
be able to accomplish with a library version of Tidy.

In the meantime, if you preserve the original input, you should be able to
simply subtract N lines from the _reported_ line numbers  - that is, I am
assuming, the N lines of header you put in front of the user's input.

take it easy,
Charlie

The problem is that I need to do the HTML cleanup; I need to clean up a
pseudoHTML document entered by the user, and this document will only contain
a piece of an HTML page.

While that works for the output stage (Oh no! select="html/body"! The
horror! :P ), I would also like to provide entry-time verification and
cleanup of code. Having to search for /line ([0-9]+) / and subtracting when
displaying errors to the user, while not difficult, is something I'd like to
avoid.
