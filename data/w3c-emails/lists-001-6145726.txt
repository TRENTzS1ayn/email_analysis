Submitted for refinement is a patch for doing almost exactly the original
requirements. It defines another configuration option ("body-only") that skips
generation of the <html> node and all header tags in parser.c.

The only problem seems to be that if it actually encounters <html> and/or
header tags, well, it dies a horrible death. If somebody could take a look at
the patch and clean it up that would be much appreciated.

Me take it easy? Riiight... :)
