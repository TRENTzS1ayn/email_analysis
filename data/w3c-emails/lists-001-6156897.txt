Great idea.  I'd try a somewhat different tact, tho.  Rather than mess w/
the parser _or_ your input.  I'd just feed the prospective <body> contents
to Tidy as is.  Let the parser merrily add
<head><title></title></head><body> your stuff! </body>.  Then, if the
--body-only option is set, call  a new PPrintContent() function in pprint.c.
This function will call PPrintTree() for each member of the body->content
node list.

The important point here is you can safely add functionality without
changing w/ the inner workings of the parser.  Even better, it will report
the line numbers correctly for any errors/warnings it emits.

take it as easy as you can stand it (which is qualified by noting that I am
an uptight east coaster.  It's one those "do as I say, not as I do" kind of
things),

Charlie

Submitted for refinement is a patch for doing almost exactly the original
requirements. It defines another configuration option ("body-only") that
skips generation of the <html> node and all header tags in parser.c.

The only problem seems to be that if it actually encounters <html> and/or
header tags, well, it dies a horrible death. If somebody could take a look
at the patch and clean it up that would be much appreciated.

Me take it easy? Riiight... :)
