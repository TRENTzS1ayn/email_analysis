First, let me say that I have never used HTML-Tidy, and I only came here
after being asked to investigate xhtml for a standards document.

Nonetheless, I was slightly concerned when I read this on the page
http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/:

-----------------
Examples of TIDY at work

End tags in the wrong order are corrected: 
   <p>here is a para <b>bold <i>bold italic</b> bold?</i> normal?

is mapped to

   <p>here is a para <b>bold <i>bold italic</i> bold?</b> normal?

------------------

I would have thought that the text between </b> and </i> in the first
example should have appeared in italics (certainly that's the effect I've
seen in every browser I've owned), and thus overlapping html tags such as

<p>here is a para <b>bold <i>bold italic</b> italic</i> normal

should have been mapped to 

<p>here is a para <b>bold <i>bold italic</i></b><i> italic</i> normal

Doesn't this make more sense?
