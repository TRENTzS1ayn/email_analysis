In all actuality, it doesn't matter to me whether a) or b) happens. I use XSLT
in the front end so it's all good. However, I do believe that having the
ability to omit or even rename the body tag is a good feature. I'll start work
on it tonight.

How does this sound:

A new configuration option, "body-tag", a string that can have either "OMIT"
or the actual tag you want to output in place of <body> and </body>. This
feature will only be available when "body-only" is active (because that's
probably the only time it would make sense).
