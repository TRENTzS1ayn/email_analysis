How about we just go w/ a)?  Because, in practice, it's much easier to add a
<body> (or any other) wrapper than it is to remove it.  If removed, one
doesn't need XSLT (which is slow at run-time) to do a lot of things.
Regular, old server side includes will do the trick.

On the flip side, since you are using XSLT, you don't need the new option at
all.  What's wrong w/ select="html/body" at the output stage?  All you need
to do is have Tidy emit well-formed xhtml.  

Skip the wrapper on input and let tidy do it's thing.  Rather than supress
the "no title" warning, have users submit full documents (<html>...</html>)
and just use XSLT to pull out the <body> contents.  This way, documents can
stand on their own as well.

In all actuality, it doesn't matter to me whether a) or b) happens. I use
XSLT in the front end so it's all good. However, I do believe that having
the ability to omit or even rename the body tag is a good feature. I'll
start work
on it tonight.

How does this sound:

A new configuration option, "body-tag", a string that can have either "OMIT"
or the actual tag you want to output in place of <body> and </body>. This
feature will only be available when "body-only" is active (because that's
probably the only time it would make sense).
