a) it is.

The problem with XSLT on the output stage is that it still doesn't cover the
problems at the input stage. The users of this application are... uh, how do I
put this nicely... NOT the most computer-literate people in the world. While
they might (?)  be willing to learn a little HTML, it can't be reasonably
accepted that they will follow the W3 specs to the letter. That's where HTML
Tidy comes in. I intend to have a verification feature that uses HTML Tidy,
but I don't want to concern them with all the nitty-gritty of the specs
(i.e., header and body tags).

On top of all that, the users don't really need the pages to stand on their
own. Why would they want that when they're paying someone else to host the
compound pages? ;)
