You should also have a line in the <style> element that says:

 div.c3 {left:0px;top:0px;width:181}

Tidy has cleaned the document of presentational markup, including style
attributes (making it easier to read and maintain as well as reducing the
size in the process). If this is a problem, turn off the 'clean' option.

hope this helps,
