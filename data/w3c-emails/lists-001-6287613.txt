when you look at a table you see from the browser
<thead>
<tbody>
<tfoot>

so why when you write it, it goes
<thead>
<tfoot>
<tbody>
has it has a road accident or something, I thought I would spell table in
the subject line the HTML way

By the way HTML tidy misses the correct order, and would give a ok not only
for the correct way but also the logical way
