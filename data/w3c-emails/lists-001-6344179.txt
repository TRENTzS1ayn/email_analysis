Dear Dave,

I would like to let you know that I've used Tidy to validate a HTML
3.2-compliant page and it warned me about a missing "summary" attribute in a
table. I've checked the reference specification for this version and I
couldn't find such attribute, so I think Tidy shouldn't issue a warning...
It has correctly identified my page as HTML 3.2.
By the way, Tidy is a great tool!
Kind regards,

Miguel.
