I think the only way to supress this message is to include a 3.2 DOCTYPE
statement.

From http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">

but you should actually use (no "Final"):
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN">

Dear Dave,

I would like to let you know that I've used Tidy to validate a HTML
3.2-compliant page and it warned me about a missing "summary" attribute in a
table. I've checked the reference specification for this version and I
couldn't find such attribute, so I think Tidy shouldn't issue a warning...
It has correctly identified my page as HTML 3.2. 

By the way, Tidy is a great tool! 

Kind regards,

Miguel.
