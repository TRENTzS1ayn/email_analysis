Hi, Major.  It is definitely possible to have the output from JTidy in a
JTree although there is no support built into JTidy for this.  JTidy
does have a somewhat complete DOM Level 1 implementation and you can
navigate the DOM tree to build your JTree.  See the DOM specifications
at <http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/level-one-core.html>.

You might want to look at the Xerces TreeViewer Sample
(http://xml.apache.org/xerces-j/treeview.html) for an example of viewing
a DOM tree as a JTree.

HTH,
Gary
