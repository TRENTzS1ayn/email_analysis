Dave,

In my world, I use an IDE called Tango (www.pervasive.com) to develop
applications that connect databases to users via html pages and forms.
Tango is a drag-and-drop development tool that generates the html code.
Tango has many 'metatags'  that are processed by the Tango server, for
example, <@include /header.html> inserts the header text file into the
Tango file so at run time the Tango server resolves the included file as

part of the Tango file.  Likewise, <@appfilepath> resolves to the
absolute path to the application file.

I like to use Tidy to clean up and verfiy the html generated by Tango.
Unfortunately, when I run the Tango generated code it converts the '<'
and
'>' marks to '&lt;' and '&gt;' respectively.  This is not what I need.

Similarly, we use a product called NetCloak (www.maxum.com).  This
product acts in a manner similar to server-side includes.  You put into
your html code the NetCloak command and, at the time of serving up,
NetCloak makes the appropriate subsitution.  For example, <insert_time>
will insert a time (depending upon the parameters you choose).  The
point is, in my environment, these character strings do something
useful, but they are not 'valid' html.

To me these are useful and valid codes.  I would like the ability to add

certain character strings to Tidy and have it ignore that character
string when it finds it in a file it is examining.  It should do nothing

to it.  No changes.  Just leave it alone.

Perhaps I have missed a setting, if so, please tell me.  Otherwise,
please consider adding this capability to a near-time build.

Thanks,
