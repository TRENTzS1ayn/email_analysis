Hmmm, the way I would read that recommendation is that the W3C is 
trying to encourage HTML 4 standards.  For example, the use of Style 
Sheets rather than the use of embedded <FONT xxxx> commands.  I am 
open to persuasion, but none-the-less feel sure that a filetype 
should always be specified as the minimum version necessary for a 
reader to be able to decode it - else why bother with the declaration 
at all?
