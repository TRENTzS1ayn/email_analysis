Dear Sir,

Great thanks to your kind help. I am heavily lost in tidy package now.
Where can i get the whole class relation diagram? I cannot see the
relation among so many java files. When I see the two java example files
to use tidy, it is not easy to see how they use tidy. Especially, Node and
NodeList are interfaces, i haven't find the implementation of the methods
in them. PLease do kind help on me.

I just download "tidy-4aug00-1.i386.rpm" from
http://perso.club-internet.fr/dpo/rpm/.

I am using java on Linux machine. But, when I run 
"rpm -Uvh tidy-4aug00-1.i386.rpm" or "rpm -ivh tidy-4aug00-1.i386.rpm" or
"rpm -i tidy-4aug00-1.i386.rpm", I got same error message:
failed to open /var/lib/rpm/packages.rpm: Permission denied

error: cannot open /var/lib/rpm/packages.rpm



How to deal with this?
Looking forward to your kind help.

Major
