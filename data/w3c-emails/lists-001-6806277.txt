Dear Sir,

Great thanks for your kind help.

When i use TestDom.java, I find the number of the child generated by it is
not correct in html tree. The actual code is 
         NodeList children = node.getChildNodes();
         if ( children != null ) {
            int len = children.getLength();
            for ( int i = 0; i < len; i++ ) {
               print(children.item(i));
            
Here, it seems that "len" is the number of children, but it is not
correct. Is this problem solved? how?

Thanks a lot.

Best regards,


Major
