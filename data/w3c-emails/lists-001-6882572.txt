Okay, Chunbo, I've found the problem.  My clue was the warning messages
received from running TestDOM.  I received the message:

line 10 column 1 - Warning: unexpected </head> in <meta>

This was a hint that something was wrong since </head> seems to be
perfectly okay.  Upon reviewing TestDOM.java, I see the line:

  tidy.setXmlTags(true);

This tells JTidy to treat the input as XML, not as HTML.  If you comment
out this line, then the input will be treated as HTML and everything
will behave as you expect.

HTH,
Gary
