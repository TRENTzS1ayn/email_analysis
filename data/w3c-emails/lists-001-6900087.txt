Hello, Gary

very sorry to trouble you again. I already have no food or drink for
almost the whole day up to now. Would you please still help me?

As to your guide, i comment the setXmlTags() line. The result in the
attached treef.txt looks very good now. But, please see the attached
out0.html which is used as the input for TestDOM.java, the children of
<body> should be 5, but in the output treef.txt, it is 6. Why? how to fix
it?

i think <body> has 5 children: 
 "If you were not...", <br>, "Please go to:", <a...>,<p....>.
am i right?

Thanks.


Major
