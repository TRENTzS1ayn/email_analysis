Major --

<head> is not allowed to have text content so any text content in the
<head> element is just ignored.  That's why the blank line does not
create a text node child of head.

It causes the child number to be affected because an actual text node
child is created in the HTML parse tree.  If you want to filter out text
nodes containing only whitespace, you can modify your java code to
ignore those whitespace-only text nodes in the count.  I do not believe
that Tidy itself has this feature.

This looks okay to me at a casual glance.  Did you have a particular
question?
