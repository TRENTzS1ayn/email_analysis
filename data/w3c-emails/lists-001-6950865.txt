If you use XHTML as HTML, with a MIME type of text/html, the built-in entities 
of the browser can be used.

When you use XHTML as XML, with a MIME type of text/xml or application/xml, all
entities would need to be defined (no other XML processor would process an XML
document with something like &auml; either)
