How do I influence whether the MIME type text/html or text/xml is
used? Isn't that what the content-type header is used for?  I
configured my tidy to output xhtml but *not* to produce xml.
The document in question starts like this:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" />
...

I checked the tidy-configurarion file and noticed that add-xml-decl
has been turned on.  Will it be sufficient to remove the <?xml ...>
declaration at the very beginning of the file go get the file to
render correctly in MSIE?  

On the other hand the XHTML doc at http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/ says
(just below the first example):

Note that in this example, the XML declaration is included. An
XMLdeclaration like the one above is not required in all XML
documents. XHTML document authors are strongly encouraged to use XML
declarations in all their documents. Such a declaration is required
when the character encoding of the document is other than the default
UTF-8 or UTF-16.

Are there any MSIE specific mailing lists or newsgroups I could take
this problem to?  They may have a FAQ which covers this..
