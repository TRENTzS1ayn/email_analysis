It's fixed a problem with your code. Comments come between *pairs*
of hyphens, so your comments are parsed like this:

  "<!--"    start of comment
  "- "      comment
  "--"      end of comment
  "->"      syntax error

HTML Tidy changes it so that there is no double hyphen until the
(intended) end of the comment:

  "<!--"    start of comment
  "- ="     comment
  "-->"     end of comment

I suggest you change <!--- and ---> to <!-- and --> respectively
throughout your code. (Is it being generated by HomeSite?)
