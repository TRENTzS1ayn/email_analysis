Yes (e.g., see section 7.4.4 of the HTML 4.01 Specification), and it 
appears that your server is honoring the header when the page is requested:

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Date: Wed, 10 Jan 2001 16:06:00 GMT
  Server: Apache/1.3.14 (Unix) PHP/4.0.2 PHP/3.0.17
  Connection: close
  Content-Type: text/html

(This is via http://www.delorie.com/web/headers.html -- the "HTTP Header 
Viewer" -- a very useful resource.) 

But perhaps IE isn't utilizing the returned Content-type header?

You might try:

  microsoft.public.windows.inetexplorer.ie55.browser
  microsoft.public.windows.inetexplorer.ie5.programming.xml
  microsoft.public.xml

at the NNTP server:

  msnews.microsoft.com
