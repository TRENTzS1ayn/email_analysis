Dear all,

I think tidy is really good program, but 
I have one complaint.

- when I wrote code something like 

<?= $test->testvar ?>

Then tidy kindly translates 

&lt;?= $test-&gt;testvar ?&gt;

This is very annoying...could anyone suggest the walkaround,
or is this because my config is wrong?


Really thanks in advance,
Ken'ichi
