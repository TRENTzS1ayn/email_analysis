Hi,

JTidy is a great HTML to XHTML conversion tool. For cleaning real-world HTML, 
there is also the requirement to preserve most of the functionality of an 
existing HTML page according to existing browsers. Using JTidy for this 
purpose, I discovered that there are some problems with alignment and scripts 
which are moved out of tables, because JTidy is designed to be as close to 
the XHTML standard as possible, while currently available browsers are not. 

What to do? For our application, I decided to patch JTidy to do the following:

- preserve attribute align=center instead of style=text-align:center
- preserving scripts in tables to keep the original HTML functionality (e.g. 
the incredible document.write hacks of JavaScript fans).
- extract inline scripts and styles for later use (e.g. writing them to local 
repository)

If anybody is interested to get the patched version, feel free to send me a 
mail.

J?rg
