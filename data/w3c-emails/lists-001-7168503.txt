Which version of HTML Tidy are you running and on what platform?  Running 
"tidy -v" should tell you, assuming you're running the stand-alone C 
version.

Tangent to this, I have an enhancement patch to Tidy that lists the 
configuration file(s) used when Tidy is run (Tidy can actually use more 
than one config file in a given run).  I'll post this to the list in a day 
or two.

Without seeing your command line and the contents of your config file(s), I 
can't determine the problem.  However, to diagnose, I'd recommend that you 
strip your config file down to just:

  write-back: yes
  keep-time: yes

...and see if that works.

The comment parsing in "config.c" is a little...uh...loose.  If I read it 
correctly, Tidy is looking only for a "/" as the _first_ character of a 
line.  If it finds that single slash, the rest of the line is interpreted 
as a comment (even if a second slash does not follow).  Also, a line 
beginning with white space and then a comment delimiter (i.e., "//") will 
*not* be seen as a comment.  Nor can comments appear on the same line as 
configuration commands.

So all of your "<tab>// etc." lines are being parsed as config commands.  
However, Tidy doesn't report invalid config commands (I have another patch 
for that :-), so these lines are being silently ignored when they don't 
match defined commands.  Therefore, even though Tidy isn't seeing them as 
comments, they shouldn't be causing your problem.

Note that if you're listing *every* config command in your config file, 
there's a bug in the current (4-Aug-00) version that causes the "alt-text" 
and "doctype" commands to be parsed improperly.  I haven't investigated to 
see if this might cause your trouble, but you could verify by removing or 
commenting out those commands if they are present.  See:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2001JanMar/0013.html

for details.

Note that Tidy will process config commands from these sources and in this 
order:

 1.  A compiled-in default filename, if defined.

 2a. A configuration filename designated by the HTML_TIDY environment
     variable, if defined, or...

 2b. A ".tidyrc" file, if present in the HOME directory.

 3.  A configuration filename supplied on the command line.


Perhaps you're getting "keep-time: no" from one of these sources?
