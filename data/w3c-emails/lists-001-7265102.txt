Hi Dave...

I'm working on coding my first web site and a friend told me about Notetab and Tidy. I will say this that both are a very nice program for those who want a little more control over coding HTML. But I think I've found a problem with Tidy.

I've coded a page in Notetab and then ran the same page through Dreamwaver. Which I then brought the second page into Notetab and ran tidy on both.

Please find attached both files. "Intro.html" & "Intro2.html" along with the error reports for both of these files.

Now I am no expert in coding web pages or the like but as far as I can tell what the error log is saying is wrong isn't. But that is why I'm sending you these files in the hopes that maybe you can clear this up for me. As well as if there might be a little bit of a bug with tidy then maybe you can find it. I like this little program very much and find it a valuable tool.

David Gauld
