I just looked at your pages.  Sure enough, in intro.htm all I had to do
was put in an alt="whatever" in the <img> tag of the offending line to
get Tidy to agree that there were no errors or warnings.

Then I looked at your error log for intro2.htm and Tidy saw an empty <p>
in line 70 of intro2.htm.  But when I ran Tidy myself, I didn't get that
message.  When I fixed the other warnings, Tidy said it was html 4.01 with
no warnings or errors.  Here are the changes I made manually to get Tidy 
to say "no warnings or errors."  I used tidy4aug00 compiled from source
under RedHat Linux 6.2.


Change <script language-"JavaScript"> to

<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript">

Then, line 37, add an "alt" to your <img> tag, as in 
<img alt="whatever" src="whateverelse" ...>

Line 78, change & to &amp;

All the changes above are required by html 4.01, so near as I can tell,
Tidy's doing the job.
