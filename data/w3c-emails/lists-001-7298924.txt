Here's a nice config script that will make a pretty printed XML file from a
file full of messy linebreaks, tabs and spaces:

char-encoding: latin1
indent: no
input-xml: yes
markup: no
output-xml: yes
wrap: 0
write-back: yes

However, this is not what I want today. Today I don't want indentation, but
the indent and markup settings doesn't seems to work as I expected. Is it
any way to turn indent off?

Regards,

Gustaf Liljegren
