JTidy do a straight translation of the C version of Tidy which including
its own routine to handle character encoding. Currently, Big5 isn't
supported by the JTidy. A solution to convert Big5 to UTF8 is developed
in XMLC (xmlc.enhydra.org) which use Tidy as the default parser.

We are using XMLC to parse Chinese HTML document into DOM.
