Dear Dave,
    I grabbed HTML tidy in order to help me to convert my files to
XHTML. One of the new requirements is for everything to be in lower
case, isn't it? And yet the first 'error' Tidy threw at me was 'line 1
column 1 - Warning: SYSTEM, PUBLIC, W3C, DTD, EN must be upper case'
    The second message was 'line 15 column 37 - Warning: missing </b>
before </h1>' and yet the offending line was '<H1><B><FONT
color="#3333FF" size="+3">If you suffer from anxiety, depression or
other emotional problems:<BR>Contacts, Links and
Resources</FONT></B></H1>'
    So now I am wondering. Did Tidy put the </b> in there when I
activated it? If yes, how come it didn't convert the first line into
capitals? And if XHTML doesn't like capitals within tags, why does
Tidy put them in that way?

    It would be REALLY helpful if Tidy came with a Help facility like
most other programs. Just looking at its black screen, I had
absolutely no idea of what to do with it. All the menu items and
buttons seemed to refer to the screen's appearance. I didn't even see
a command for accessing a file to work on. fortunately, I use Note
Tab, and this program has a facility for using Tidy. I moved Tidy into
Note Tab's folder, and it worked in automatic. But surely Tidy should
work as a stand alone facility?
All the best,
Bob Rich
