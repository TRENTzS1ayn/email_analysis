How do I get Tidy to leave my entities alone ?

e.g., if I have an entity in my HTML doc. instance that is not recognized
by Tidy (not in entities.c), Tidy changes the ampersand to &amp;, which I
do not want it to do.  I want the entity to pass through Tidy unscathed --
i.e. it ought to leave:
  &num;
  &ast;

alone, but instead, it erroneously changes them to:
  &amp;num;
  &amp;ast;

Also, what if I want it to change a literal " in CDATA into &quot;  ??

thanks,
-carole
