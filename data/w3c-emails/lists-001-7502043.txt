OK, this helps to leave &foo; and &num; and &ast; alone, but I DO also
want NAKED "&" to be changed to &amp; (which this does not do) -- is that
possible, or is it too much to expect both?

Also, both using AND not using --quote-ampersand no, Tidy changes by
&quot; to a literal " mark, which is extremely annoying.  I'd think that
at least one of them would leave it untouched.

Help !

thanks,
