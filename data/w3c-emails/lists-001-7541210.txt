Hi:
I'm enclosing a file which I'd ran through HTML Tidy (Win GUI version).
I noticed that it added in an extra <title> tag.

I'm not sure if this is a bug. The other bug which I've noticed is that
there are files which I've ran through and HTML Tidy adds in <language="javascript">
for a tag originally written as this:

<script type="text/javascript" src="../../uniscape-web-spanish.js"></script>

At times, the result is:

<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript" src="../../uniscape-web-spanish.js"></script>

It doesn't dump in the <language="javascript"> all the time and I am
unsure why it does this randomly.

Thanks,
Bobby
