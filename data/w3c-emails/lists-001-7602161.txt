This page (http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/wilbur/table/td.html) indicates
that <FORM> is valid within <TD> tags.. Is that not correct, or am I just
missing something?

PS Before visiting htmlhelp.com, I first tried to get the answer from the
source (http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#edef-TD). However,
(and maybe it's just me), I just couldn't understand their notation
regarding which tags are legal within other tags. Could someone explain
that, if it's not too complicated?
