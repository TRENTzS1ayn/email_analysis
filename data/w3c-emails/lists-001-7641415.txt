When I check my homepage with tidy I get one warning/error. But I created 
it as shown in http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/html4/ and it it valid as 
shown in 
http://validator.w3.org/check/referer?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdeluxe.bluehash.de

When I check http://deluxe.bluehash.de/index.html I get this output:
line 5 column 1 - Warning: <html> has XML attribute "xml:lang" 
index.html: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
index.html: Document content looks like XHTML 1.0 Transitional
1 warnings/errors were found!

I think this is an error.
