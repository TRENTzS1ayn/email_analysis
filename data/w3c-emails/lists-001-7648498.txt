The snippet of SGML at the URL cited indicates that TD elements can contain 
zero or more (denoted by the asterisk "occurrence indicator") flow 
entities.  A flow entity is defined (click on the link to obtain the 
definition) as either a block or an inline entity.  A block entity consists 
of a number of alternate items, one of which is the form element.  So a 
form element may be contained within a TD element.
