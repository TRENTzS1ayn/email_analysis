This page (http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/wilbur/table/td.html) indicates
that <FORM> is valid within <TD> tags.. Is that not correct, or am I just
missing something?

<!ELEMENT (TH|TD) - O (%flow;)*>

    TH and TD elements
    "-" must have a start-tag <TD>
    "O" do not need to have an end-tag </TD> (but may if you want)
    "(%flow;)*" have as contents zero or more of the things listed
        under %flow;

<!ENTITY % flow "%block; | %inline;">

    Something is allowed in "%flow;" iff it is allowed in "%block;" or ("|")
    "%inline;"

<!ENTITY % block
     "P | %heading; | %list; | %preformatted; | DL | DIV | CENTER |
      NOSCRIPT | NOFRAMES | BLOCKQUOTE | FORM | ISINDEX | HR |
      TABLE | FIELDSET | ADDRESS">

    Block elements can be P or ... or ADDRESS.  One of the options is FORM.

So a TD may indeed contain a FORM.

However, while
<td><form></form></td>
and<td><form></form>
are legal,
<td><form></td>
is not, because 

<!ELEMENT FORM - - (%flow;)* -(FORM)   -- interactive form -->

tells us that a FORM "- -" must have an end-tag as well as a start-tag.
