That is correct, because <code> is *not* the same as <pre>.  See:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/text.html#h-9.1

It says, in part:

   For all HTML elements except PRE, sequences of white space separate
   "words" [...].  When formatting text, user agents should identify these
   words and lay them out according to the conventions of the particular
   written language (script) and target medium.  

And:

   The PRE element is used for preformatted text [p.97], where white
   space is significant.

"Wrap: 0" does not mean "leave the lines exactly as in the source file."  
It means, "do not wrap the lines after processing."  See:

  http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/

...and look under "Layout style" to see why this is.

You must put your <code> element inside a <pre> element if you do not want 
it to wrap:

  <pre><code>ab -n 1000 -c 10 -t 30 -v 3 -w \
  http://ubik.inria.fr:8080/index.html</code></pre>
