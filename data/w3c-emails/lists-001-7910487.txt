On the contrary, this is quite a good feature. If the <a is left at the end
and in the correct place WRT white space in the body text, you don't get all
the problems with a forced NL before the <a> tag causing non-required
whitespace to be generated. If this is done carefully we could avoid all the
hanging blue underline and spacing problems caused by in-appropriate white
space in sequences such as

<a><img></a><a><img></a>

It annoys me when HTML-Tidy leaves the "<A" at the end of one line, and puts
the "HREF=.....>" at the beginning of the next. I'd like an option to never
wrap within tags.
