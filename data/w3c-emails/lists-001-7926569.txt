I'm new to Tidy _and_ to 1stPage.

I'm trying to use Tidy under 1stPage, and to accommodate a
new tag that provides a server-side-include for me, but I
can't seem to get Tidy to accept it. I added the following
two lines to the .tdy file being used:

     new-empty-tags=isml
     new-inline-tags=isml

But it's not working. What's the secret?

BTW: I assume these are the right type of new tags. The ISML
tag has no end tag, and may include arbitrary markup,
including block or inline.
