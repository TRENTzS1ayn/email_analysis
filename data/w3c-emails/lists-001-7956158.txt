Well, the "<!--"/"-->" commenting style isn't allowed in XHTML Strict. The
new syntax is, as I understand it: <[CDATA[comment goes in here]]>

Also, with Strict, deprecated attributes are not allowed (CSS must be used
instead). On the IMG tag, these include align, border, hspace, and vspace.

And, of course, your DTD should be set to "strict" as well. So, I dunno if
that'll solve all your validation problems, but it's a start :).
