Hello,

I have recently moved the Tidy386 page to another site. I've taken the opportunity to update links and add a local copy of the DPMI server for those who may require it. 

The new url is now:
http://ca.geocities.com/nickbeee/tidy386/index.htm

You should automatically be redirected from the old site.

Regards,
Nick B
