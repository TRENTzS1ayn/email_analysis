Looks fine to me

I must be looking at a different site.... I see the HTML Tidy link along with all the links that were there before. I don't see any hoo-haw intro stuff?

Not sure what you're saying about about the design for new users.... does this mean it's so simple experienced users can't find anything? :))

  What is with the W3C website?  I went on there to direct some of my students to tidy and the whole site is changed. 
   
  It is impossible to find the stuff that was normally very easy to access.  
   
  It seems that whoever took it upon themselve to redesign the website planned this thing for new users, not experienced users who don't give a crap about all the hoo-haw intro stuff.
   
  What gives?
   
  The damn search engine doesn't even work.  Put in tidy and it comes up blank.
   
  This sucks.
