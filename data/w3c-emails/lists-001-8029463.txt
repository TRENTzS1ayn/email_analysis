To Whom It May Concern-

I am writing in regards to a few questions I have regarding your program, HTML Tidy:

1. How much RAM is required to run the application?

2. What type of processor is required for the application? (e.g., AMD, Cyrix, Intel, or risk-based)

3. How much hard diskspace is required to store the application?

4. What are the recommended  PC resource requirements  for RAM and hard diskspace?

If you could get back to me with the answers to these questions at your convenience, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Thank you,
Erik Akelaitis
