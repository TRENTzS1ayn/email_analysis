Ok, ok! It looks like the egg is on me ;). Sorry about the apparent
mis-info, guys. I was only going on information from an XHTML tutorial I
discovered (http://htmlgoodies.earthweb.com/tutors/xhtml.html). (See item
#14 there)

So, I suppose I should email the author of that page and politely let him
know. But, again, I apologize for my mistake there.
