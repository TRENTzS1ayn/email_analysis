Hmmm. I searched for the word 'tidy' and got 81 results. The first pointed
to the Tidy home page. 
 
I see a clear list of links -- including one to HTML Tidy -- to all areas of
W3C activity, as well as news on recent project updates and changes. I don't
consider that 'hoo-haw intro stuff'. 
 
My only real complaint about the new version thus far is the lack of link
indicators in the news-style presentation on the home page.

What is with the W3C website?  I went on there to direct some of my students
to tidy and the whole site is changed. 
 
It is impossible to find the stuff that was normally very easy to access.  
 
It seems that whoever took it upon themselve to redesign the website planned
this thing for new users, not experienced users who don't give a crap about
all the hoo-haw intro stuff.
 
What gives?
 
The damn search engine doesn't even work.  Put in tidy and it comes up
blank.
 
This sucks.
