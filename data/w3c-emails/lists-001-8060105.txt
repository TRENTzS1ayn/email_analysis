Hey Alex, thanks for the info regardless...It's all good...

Except for NS4.5 it doesn't look like he'll behave with something like:

/*Images*/
.images{border:0px;}

in css to get rid of borders in my xhtml. Which is annoying to say the
least...

Is there another way around this?

I'd love to have this file validate as strict, but it has to look the
same in all browsers as well..
