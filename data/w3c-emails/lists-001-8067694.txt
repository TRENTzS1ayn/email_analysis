Yes, Netscape 4.5 is a mess -- always has been -- not at all HTML standards 
compliant. One of these days it will be off most PCs -- as will the other 
propriety noncompliant Browser versions. In the meantime, web page authors 
must "jump through hoops" in an attempt to make their pages viewable in as 
many existing Browsers as possible -- and hope that users upgrade/install  
Netscape 6.x, Opera 4.x, MSIE 5.x/6.x, etc. Browsers on their PC's.
