The correct CSS method is to use:

  margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto

...on your DIV, i.e.:

  <div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 400px; ...>

From the CSS1 spec, section 4.1.2 (Horizontal Formatting):

  "...If both 'margin-left' and 'margin-right' are 'auto', they will be
   set to equal values. This will center the element inside its parent." 

That works correctly on Opera 5 and Netscape 6.  It fails in IE 5 and 
Netscape 4 due to browser bugs.  A workaround for these is to enclose your 
existing DIV with another DIV and put the text-align on that one, i.e.:

  <div style="text-align: center">
    <div style="width: 400px; ...>
      ...
    </div>
  </div>

But this is ignored in Opera 5 and Netscape 6, as it should (the CSS spec 
says that text-align "...describes how inline content of a block is 
aligned" -- note the restriction to *inline* content).  Combining the two 
methods will work in all four listed browsers.

(This is a bit off-topic for the HTML Tidy list; excellent advice for CSS 
is available on the "comp.infosystems.www.authoring.stylesheets" USENET 
newsgroup.)
