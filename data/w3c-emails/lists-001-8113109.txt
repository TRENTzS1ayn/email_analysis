Hi, Gary

I am TRULY glad you still remember me. You are so kind. I think we
will definitely have a chance to talk in the future. May be very soon,
maybe within this year. Or even face to face ? I hope I can say thanks to
you directly like that.

You exactly hit the point of my question.

I have some knowledge of interface and implements in java. I am still not
clear enough about my question in last email to you. Because when I see
inside of the source code of Tidy.java, the return type of parseDOM() 
is org.w3c.dom.Document, which is not org.w3c.tidy.DOMNodeImpl. 

I know dom.Document extends dom.Node, which means dom.Document is a
dom.Node. And I also know tidy.DOMNodeImpl implements dom.Node.......I am
totally confused with all these "cross" relations. (because the
implementation of the methods in dom.Node interface is in tidy.DOMNodeImpl
class.)

Help me.

By the way, what is the difference between tidy.Node and dom.Node?

Thank you VERY much.
