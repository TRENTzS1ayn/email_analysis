Yes.  This is very confusing.  DOMDocumentImpl extends DOMNodeImpl (and
implements org.w3c.dom.Document).  So a DOMDocumentImpl is a Document as
well as a Node.  To really sort this out for yourself, you should take
each of the classes in the JTidy source and create a simple class
diagram that will show you the inheritance relationships of each of the
classes.

These are two completely different classes.
