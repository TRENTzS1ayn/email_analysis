Whilst I can see that it might look off-topic it has always been one of
the few things I've disliked about Tidy that it takes my <div
align="center"> lines and turns them into a CSS text-align styles that
don't do the same thing for, for example, aligning tables.  [And I do
use CSS for everything that I (and enough browsers) can].

And I won't ask how to get access in a 21st century way to something as
pre-gopher as a usenet newsgroup...
