The primarily problem with using ALIGN is that it's deprecated
(http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/present/graphics.html#adef-align), and thus the
code wouldn't validate for 4.01 Strict (IIRC).

So, I then have a question for the group: what method can I use to center
block-level elements (such as tables) such that the code will validate to
4.01 Strict or (even better) XHTML 1.0 Strict?

I'm fairly fluent with CSS, but the only somewhat-applicable property that I
see is "text-align" which, obviously, has no effect on images, tables, and
the like.
