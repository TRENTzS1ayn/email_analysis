I must admit that I don't see how anything directly related to the 
operation of HTML Tidy can be considered off-topic for this list, and 
indeed Tidy appears to be a bit naive in its substitution of CSS for 
presentational HTML in some cases.

I recently used Tidy to help in the conversion a 100+ page site into HTML 
4.01 Strict in preparation for manually adding CSS, and Tidy was unable to 
completely remove all presentational attributes.  It would be ideal if Tidy 
could make thorough CSS replacements for presentational HTML, but it would 
still be a worthy enhancement to have Tidy at least offer to strip all 
vestiges of deprecated elements and attributes.

Still, for what Tidy did do, I am quite grateful, as it saved a bundle of 
time!
