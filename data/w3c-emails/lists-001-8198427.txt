Deja.com offered free newsgroup access via the Web, or at least they did 
until they folded two days ago.  I would imagine, though, that there are 
other similar services around.  An Altavista search for "+free +usenet

See:

...to see if there's anything of interest.  Also, there are a number of Web 
resources available.  A good starting point is the "CSS Pointers Group" 
site at:
