Hi, Sami

Yes, I really hope you can send the reverse-engineering result. If I
receive your UML diagram, besides MagicDraw, what kind of other tools I
can use to see the diagram? Can Rational Rose work?

I visit your web site frequently, and I know you are the source for jtidy
now. So everytime I send a question, I always send you a copy and hope you
will help me. Anyway, thanks a lot.

Looking forward to your diagram.

Major
