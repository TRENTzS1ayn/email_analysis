A question came up at work recently about whether
there was a quick and dirty script to remove all HTML
comments from a page.  I figured, well Tidy must do
it, but didn't see any option.  

In the pending tasks, I saw this:

  Mark Modrall has extended Tidy to support
selectively stripping out listed tags and attributes,
see his email of March 14th.

but couldn't find the referenced e-mail.  Does anyone
have this patch, or know of another good way to do
something like this with Tidy?

thanks,
