pprint.c has a routine for printing comments:

  static void PPrintComment(Out *fout, uint indent,
                   Lexer *lexer, Node *node)

You can disable comments by disabling output in this route (or add an extra 
option to remove comments, might be a nice addition for the tidy base also)

Keep in mind that some comments may not really be intended as comments, e.g.

<script>
<!-- 
  ...
// hide this from old browsers -->
</script>
