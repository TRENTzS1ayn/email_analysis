We have some long  element attributes which by  default Tidy places
on a single line., sometimes  400 characters wide, which causes problems
elsewhere.

The config.txt file contains entries such as

wrap: 40
wrap-attributes: yes
wrap-script-literals: yes

To quote from the documentation

"If set to yes, attribute values may be wrapped across 
lines for easier editing. The default is no. This option can be set
 independently of wrap-scriptlets "

When applied to  e.g. (expand a really long string to about  120 characters)

    <object data="a.html">
      <param name="long"
      value="a really long string...." />
    </object>
     <a href="a really ...">
    text</a> 
    <a href="somewhere.html"
    onmouseover="document.status = '...some really long lines ..';">
    test</a>

and passed through either JTidy or BBTidy no wrapping occurs
on either the attribute or the script.  Other
config.txt definitions ARE acted upon.

Can anyone reproduce, is it just  JTidy and BBTidy that have this problem,
or is it generic in the Aug 4 source?
