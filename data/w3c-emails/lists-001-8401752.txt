    Announcing http://check.theinfo.org/

    With the increasing complex maze of formats and systems, we often forget
    to make sure that our files follow appropriate standards. This site will
    attempt to provide services to allow you to validate your files and
    insure that they are compatible with other systems.

Basically what I've done is built simple Web interfaces to some command line
programs. Right now you can run your XML files through xmllint and your HTML
files through HTML Tidy. Suggestions and comments are appreciated. I'm
willing to add new features if people are interested. I plan on adding RDF
and RSS validation soon.

Enjoy!
