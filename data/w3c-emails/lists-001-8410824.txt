The archives of the HTML Tidy mailing list are at:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/

...and they may be searched for particular content.  However, if you're new 
to HTML, then you will likely wish to augment your reading of this list, 
which specifically concerns the operation of the HTML Tidy program, with 
one dedicated to general HTML questions.  For example, the USENET news 
group:

  comp.infosystems.www.authoring.html

...would be directly targeted to your HTML questions.

There are a number of HTML resources on the Web.  The primary source is the 
HTML specification itself.  For example, the HTML 4.01 Specification is 
available at:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/html4

...and the BR element is described at:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/text.html#edef-BR

(The index of the full specification lists all of the elements, such as BR, 
and attributes, such as CLEAR.)

Other useful HTML resources are at:

What specific command line did you use?  Using, e.g.:

  tidy -f t.err t.html

...will indeed write errors and warnings to the "t.err" file, and will 
write the tidied markup to the screen.

Personally, I load the file to be tidied into a text editor that provides  
the position of the cursor (i.e., row and column) in its status line.  
Alternately, I use FrontPage (carefully! :-), as its "HTML view" also 
reports the cursor location.  So when Tidy gives me an error, I can locate 
the offending construct from the location information reported.

I'll defer that question to Tidy's author.


> My fifth question is "Why did Tidy erase my comment lines ?".

I have not observed that Tidy removes comments.  Were your comments 
syntactically correct?  Note that one of Tidy's jobs is to make invalid 
HTML valid, so if you have a malformed comment, Tidy could make the file 
valid either by correcting the comment or by removing it.  Perhaps the 
latter is happening?

At the top of the HTML 4.01 Specification (see the preceding link) are 
links to versions of the standard in various formats.  For printing, I 
would recommend obtaining either the PDF or Postscript versions.

You're welcome.
