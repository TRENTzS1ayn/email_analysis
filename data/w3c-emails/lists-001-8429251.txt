With the 4 Aug 2000 console version of HTML Tidy, the VALUE attribute value 
will not wrap.  The ONMOUSEOVER attribute value wraps, with backslashes 
added to each intermediate line.

Note, though, that lines 404-406 of "attrs.c" contain this code:

    SetNoWrap(attr_alt);
    SetNoWrap(attr_value);
    SetNoWrap(attr_content);

...which explicitly prohibits the contents of the ALT, VALUE, and CONTENT 
attributes from being wrapped.
