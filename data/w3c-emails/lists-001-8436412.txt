There were some previous versions of Tidy (on most platforms) that had a
bug that caused an empty errors file to be created - the current 04 Aug 00
version does not have that bug.

Also I have noticed that the order of the arguments on the command line can
make a difference when involving error files - I defer to Dave that his
example above as being the correct way; you should check for yourself to
see if order matters for you.

Hope this helps.
