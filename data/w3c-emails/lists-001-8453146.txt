HTML 4.01 spec says that href attribute takes a URI as an value and a URI is
of type CDATA and that a user agent should replace character entities in
CDATA sections?

[Subject: "Character references" explained; Date: 16/Feb/2001.]

... "On the other hand, especially when URLs with query parts, such as
http://www.server.example/cgi-bin/x.pl?foo=bar&copy=42
occur in HTML documents, you need to take into account that
an HTML parser (a correct one at least) will recognize anything
that starts with & and a letter as an entity reference, even if
it is not terminated by a semicolon. In the example case,
&copy is taken as an entity reference that denotes &#169; which
in turn denotes the copyright sign, which is not allowed in a URL,
but I digress. To prevent this, replace that & by &amp; which is
an entity reference that denotes &#38; that denotes the & character
as such (i.e. as not to be taken as a constituent of a character
reference or an entity reference)."
