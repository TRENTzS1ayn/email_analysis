Try this,


(1)  the <style> tags are not correctly indented (using -i).
(2)  it would be helpful to have the name of the attribute that has an
erroneous value (e.g. "null"), especially because the line
numbers are not correct for the replaced code (I would like to use <! ..
> or <!- ... -> to insert line numbers, but they get
erased).
(3)  list separators are sometimes a space and other times semicolons:
what rule governs which applies ?

Thanks,          R. Keir

Also 
Does (or can) summary get auto-inserted, as in <table summary=" "> 
so when you get reminded that you forgot the summary,
 you can just fill in the space.

Then there is height, width, as in  <img height=" " width=" "> 
to stop moving text when you first visit a web site, 
(but if it starts a argument again, disregard this idea)

DISCLAIMER
OK I can take a hint!, if there is no feedback I will assume that 
this is a stupid suggestion and promptly forget who wrote this.
