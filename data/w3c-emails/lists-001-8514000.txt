I can't comment on your other issues, but constructs like <!123> and
<!-123-> are not legal comments in standard HTML.  Try <!--123-->.

Perhaps Tidy should convert things like <!123> and <!-123-> into legal
comments instead of discarding them.  However, despite the optimistic
subject of this thread :), it's not as simple as it seems.
