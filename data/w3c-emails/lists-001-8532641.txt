To: HTML Tidy List<html-tidy@w3.org>

Hi,
I'm working with the Java version of Tidy.
Giving, as input of Tidy, HTML files with syntax errors (like non-closed
tags, or ">" inside attribute values), makes Tidy generate an error and
the abort of creation of the "tidied" file (the output file is empty).
Does anyone know how to let Tidy skip syntax errors in HTML code and
always generate an output file (without tags that caused errors, for
example)?
Thanks.
