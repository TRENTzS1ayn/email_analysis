The link you cited is supposed to point at the latest (4 August 2000) 
version of HTML Tidy, but I see that it still references the 30 April 2000 
version.  Dave?

You don't need to compile it.  The ZIP file contains not only the source 
code but also the Tidy executable (i.e., TIDY.EXE).  Just extract that one 
file from the archive after downloading (or unpack the entire ZIP file into 
a directory, move the TIDY.EXE file out to another location, and delete the 
rest of the files).
