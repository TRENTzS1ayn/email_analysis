Franco --

I apologize for taking such a long time to respond to your email.  I
tried your example with the official version of Tidy, which is the c
version, and it fails in the same way as JTidy.  Unfortunately, I do not
have time to debug this problem in Tidy operation.  Perhaps Dave will be
able to incorporate a fix for this in the upcoming c Tidy release.
