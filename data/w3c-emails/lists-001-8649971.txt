Hiroyuki Okamoto is worried about Tidy changing
<pre>AAAAAAA
</pre>
to
<pre>
AAAAAAA
</pre>

He should not be.  HTML is an application of SGML, and
linebreaks immediately after start tags
or immediately before end tags
ARE NOT REALLY THERE as far as SGML is concerned.

The two examples are required to behave identically.  What's more,
they are both identical to
<pre>AAAAAAA</pre>
and
<pre>
AAAAAAA</pre>

XML has different rules, so if this were an XML to XML transformation
it would be a real problem.  But for HTML it is not.
