Hi all,

I'm new to using HTMLTidy and to this mailing group.
I'v just downloaded COM wrapper and made some tests to see how overlapped
tags are corrected.

I usend this code for cleaning:
<html>
<head>
<title>Test</title>
</head>
<BODY>
<br>
<p> This is just a test<b><p><i>next paragraph</b> and next text</i>
</body>
</html>

and I got:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN">
<html>
<head>
<title>Test</title>
</head>
<body>
<br>
<p>This is just a test</p>

<p><b><i>next paragraph</i> and next text</b></p>
</body>
</html>

--------------------------
I know that HTML code cleaning is not simple, but if you take a look at
first (wrong) code, it would make a sense not to change order of closing
tags </b> </i>, but of opening ones. If you do it manually, document than
looks the same as if rendered by using the wrong code. Is there a way how to
make HTMLTidy to modify code such way?

Thx
