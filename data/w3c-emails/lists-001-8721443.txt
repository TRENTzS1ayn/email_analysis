It's a bug, but it would appear to be in your browser, not in HTML Tidy.  
See:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/appendix/notes.html#h-B.3.1

...which states, in part:

 "SGML (see [ISO8879], section 7.6.1) specifies that a line break
  immediately following a start tag must be ignored, as must a line break
  immediately before an end tag. This applies to all HTML elements
  without exception."
