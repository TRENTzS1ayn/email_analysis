No, your explanation has no bearing here.

Whatever is between <textarea> & </textarea> is the *initial value* that
shows up in the multiple-line textbox. So the extra spaces that Tidy inserts
between <textarea> & </textarea> become part of the initial value, and this
is not good, for the reasons I stated in my initial email.

This is a bug, pure & simple, unless Dave Raggett tells me otherwise. It
should be fixed.
