Platform: tidy 4th august 2000, linux

 - I downloaded this page 
<http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/protocol/issues.html>
   to the local file issues-orig.html
 - I ran tidy with the command
tidy -xml issues-orig.html >issues.html

The resulting issues.html had a size of 0 bytes, and tidy complained
about errors that needs to be fixed, but all error messages seems to
be warnings.

The return code is 02, which the manual says means that errors have
been encountered.

(but aside from this little bug report I must say that I find tidy a
delightful tool, that saves me from hours of hand editing...:-) )

Error output follows:

This document has errors that must be fixed before
using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version.

Characters codes for the Microsoft Windows fonts in the range
128 - 159 may not be recognized on other platforms. You are
instead recommended to use named entities, e.g. &trade; rather
than Windows character code 153 (0x2122 in Unicode). Note that
as of February 1998 few browsers support the new entities.
