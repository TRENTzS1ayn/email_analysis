FWIW, the Mac OS version of Tidy (built with CodeWarrior 5.3) gives the
same results as described in your EMail EXCEPT the following line - the Mac
OS version word-wrapped the content to the next line (that may or may not
be my bug).

Probably some subtle side-effect of expression evaluation order, word size,
code optimization, or standard C library differences. Try recompiling with
different optimization options, if that is an option for you. I will try to
investigate more when I have time.
