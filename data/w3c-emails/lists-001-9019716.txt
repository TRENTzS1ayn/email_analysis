Yes, I do this too.  However, you have to watch out for a few 
things that Tidy changes without warning you about - double quote 
marks (") changed to &quot;, apostrophes to &#39;, and lone 
ampersands (&) to &amp;.

While sympathising with the original request, I think it is 
outside of Tidy's original remit, which is (as I understand it) to 
correct an HTML file so it is legal.  This necessarily entails 
disassembling it, and the corrected result can only be re-created to 
some defined standard, as indentation may HAVE to be changed to make 
the file legal.

I think Tidy should be treated as a "first pass" engine, and 
if you want to re-edit the output to your indentation standard, then 
that is up to you.  Incremental code changes can then be re-checked, 
errors noted, and the original files corrected by hand.  As Mr.Evans 
says, this is a rather laborious approach, but once done, incremental 
changes are easier.

Or, of course, you could learn to love the standard output 
style adopted by Tidy. :-)
