Hi All,

I am trying get an URL content from
"http://weather.yahoo.com" , apply Tidy to get 
XHTML content.

In the well formed  XHTML , I find some special
character  "&#0;" in XHTML 
content.

Can anyone help out with this problem.
( Please respond directly to me as I am not yet on
mailing list)

Regards
Subbu
