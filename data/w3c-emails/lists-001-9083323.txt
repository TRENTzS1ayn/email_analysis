Good afternoon,

1. BUG in the program "TIDY"
--------------------------------------

It's now (this afternoon march 17 2001) the first time I'm trying "Tidy".

In the .htm document I'm testing, I immediatly receive a BUG : the program
replaces :

<FONT face="times new roman">

by :

<font times="" new="">

Rather stange, isn't it ?

2. What is "summary" attribute ?
--------------------------------------

Tidy gives me repeatedly the warning: <table> lacks "summary" attribute.
For the fun, I've also tested the Dave Raggett's Introduction to CSS.htm.
TIDY gives three times the same warning !

What could be this so important "summary attribute" ? I've searched on the
net, without success. TIA for answering.

Yours faithfully
