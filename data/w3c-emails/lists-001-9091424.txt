hi

i'm trying to use HTML Tidy to convert my .jsp pages to XML or XHTML. i'm 
having a ton of problems. is it possible to do this? html tidy is having 
problems with the <% tags. this is invalid xml anyway so is there XML 
equivalent tags for this? and if so how would i get html tidy to not remove 
them (to ignore these). would i use a DTD? sorry for these basic questions 
but i'm new to this.

thanks.
