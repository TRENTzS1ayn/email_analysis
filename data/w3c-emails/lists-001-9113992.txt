1. BUG in the program "TIDY"
--------------------------------------

It's now (this afternoon march 17 2001) the first time I'm trying "Tidy".


Yes, but WHICH VERSION?

<FONT face="times new roman">
is replaced by
<font times="" new="">

Doesn't happen in Tidy (vers 8th July 2000) in a test I just did.
Is there a preceding element with a missing quote?


2. What is "summary" attribute ?
--------------------------------------

What could be this so important "summary attribute" ? I've
searched on the net, without success.  TIA for answering.

It is clearly spelled out in the HTML specification, which
is very easy to find at http://www.w3c.org/ .  That is the first
place to turn with *any* question about HTML.

In summary, the "summary" attribute, like the "alt" attribute, is a
way for you to plug in a description of a table (summary) or image (alt)
for the benefit of audio browsers.  You definitely want to check the
guidelines for web accessibility, also to be found at the W3C site.
