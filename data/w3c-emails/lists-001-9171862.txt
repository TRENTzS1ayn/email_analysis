I know this is slightly off topic but...

Can anyone recommend an on-line (or printed) reference for some of the CSS 
tags out there?

For example, I remember that there is a tag I can use that will eliminate 
the padding under a form's buttons (I think it came up in here as an 
alternative for doing something like... <FORM><TD><INPUT 
TYPE=SUBMIT></TD></FORM>

What I really need is a way to suppress the padding after <INPUT>s when 
they're inside a Table element.

Thanks!

Matt
