I've been using tidy and and recommending it to others, but I wanted
to know if anyone had integrated it into a proxy? Some HTML problems
prevent the browsers from displaying stuff correctly, and a tidy-ing
proxy would allow them to view the masses of incorrect HTML out there.
A case in point today was pages with literal spaces in the image
src URLs.

Thoughts?
