Why is it each time I check my script, I am always wrong.

On the first line there is,
-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SO I GET TIDY TO CHECK IT OVER, AND I GET THE MESSAGE BELOW

Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) Parsing "file.htm"

file.htm: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
file.htm: Document content looks like HTML 4.01 Transitional
no warnings or errors were found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SO THEN I TAKE OFF "//EN" THEN IT SAYS

-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional

Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) Parsing "file.htm"

file.htm: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional"
file.htm: Document content looks like HTML 3.2
no warnings or errors were found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SO THEN I CHANGE 4.01 TO 3.2 AND GET THE NEXT MESSAGE.

Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) Parsing "file.htm"

file.htm: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Transitional"
file.htm: Document content looks like HTML 3.2
no warnings or errors were found

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
VERY STRANGE? OR WAS IT A 3.2 ALL ALONG,  IT'S JUST THAT I WAS FORCED TO
CHECK IT OUT THREE TIMES.
