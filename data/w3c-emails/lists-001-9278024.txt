I am trying to run HTML tidy on a number of HTML files. These files are
stored in folders with long names e.g.
c:\home\a long folder name\*.html
When I try to run TIDY it comes back with:
tidy can't open file "c:\home\a"
tidy can't open file "long"
tidy can't open file "folder"
tidy can't open file "name\*.html"
Is there a way to get round this?
