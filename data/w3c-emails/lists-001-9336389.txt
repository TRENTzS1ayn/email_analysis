See the following option as described on the Tidy page:

keep-time: bool 

If set to yes, Tidy won't alter the last modified time for files it
writes back to. The default is yes. This allows you to tidy files
without effecting which ones will be uploaded to the Web server when
using a tool such as 'SiteCopy'. Note that this feature may not work
on some
platforms.
