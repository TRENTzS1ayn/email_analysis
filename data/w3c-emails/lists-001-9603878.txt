Works fine for me with the 04 Aug 00 (and later) version of Tidy (although
I cheated a bit to get that char sequence into the document). You need to
specify UTF-8 as the char encoding when using Tidy - depending on your
platform, this may be as simple as specifying "-utf8" on the command line
(otherwise the default "-ascii" will give the results you described above).
Perhaps you have some conflicting options set in a config file.

Hope this helps.
