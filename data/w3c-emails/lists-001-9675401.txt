HTML Tidy is generating correct HTML but not optimal HTML.

Given incorrect HTML, my understanding is that Tidy should attempt to 
correct it in such a way as to reproduce (where possible) the behavior of 
the incorrect HTML on common browsers.  So given that the original 
structure:

  <td><a><center></center></a></td>

is invalid (anchor elements cannot contain block elements, i.e., <a> cannot 
contain <center>), Tidy corrects this to:

  <td><a></a><div></div></td>

where the <div>s plus CSS take the place of the <center>s.  This is 
correct, but a better translation, i.e., equally correct and closer to the 
original behavior, would be:

  <td><div><a></a></div></td>

or specifically:

  <td width="150">
    <div class="c1">
      <a href="Kasse.htm">
        <img ...>
      </a>
    </div>
  </td>

Note that the correction suggested by the original poster:

  <td><a><div></div></a></td>

is invalid.


> Would <span> be ok?

<span> would be syntactically correct, as it is an inline element, but then 
the CSS would be invalid (the class="c1" that Tidy generates includes a 
"text-align" property, and "text-align" applies only to block elements).
