I received a notice of a problem from someone in Canada who is using JTidy and get the following error:

>java.lang.Error: java.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find resource for
>base name org/w3c/tidy/TidyMessages, locale en_CA


I had not realized that Tidy was localized, but even if it is, shouldn't the en_US locale have picked this up?
