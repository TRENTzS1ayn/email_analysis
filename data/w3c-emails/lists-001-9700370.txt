Yes. This should work.  I've seen this problem on some 1.1.x JVMs,
notably the ones with OS/400.  They seem to have trouble loading
resources from .jar files.

Try to extract the TidyMessages.properties file and place it in a
directory on the CLASSPATH and see if this solves the problem.  If so,
it's time to upgrade the JVM.

HTH,
Gary
