A good thing in general.

Maybe "valid" but not "conforming", the recommendation restricts the
value further to match the Name production in XML 1.0 and "1" doesn't
do so. Upcoming Tidy versions will include better checks for name and
id attributes.

"deprecated", it already was in HTML 4.01.

_Required_, the name attribute only may be used for better
compatibility. Newer XHTML versions don't include the name attribute
at all.

There isn't and I don't see any good reason to change that.
