I have absolutely no clue how to run Tidy.

I've tried based on the instructions on the wc3 page. 
but it just sits there, doing nothing!

I am using Win2000 (against my will and better
judgement).  I've had ALOT of problems with other
Unix-based programs.  Even a simple telnet command
causes my computer to scream out in protest!

How do I get around this?
How do I use Tidy???
