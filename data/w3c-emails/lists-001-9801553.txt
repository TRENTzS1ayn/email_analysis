Well, Win2000 is pretty good (at least by Microsoft's dubious standards)
and certainly way ahead of WinMe (a real pile of shinola).  More to the
point, I routinely and successfully use Tidy under Win2000.

When you say that the program just sits there, doing nothing, do you
mean that you can't even run it, or that it appears to run but does
nothing of use?  If the former, you have a Tidy-unrelated problem and
you'll have to figure out for yourself how to get a command line prompt,
etc.  If the latter, just what does it do?  (Error message?)
