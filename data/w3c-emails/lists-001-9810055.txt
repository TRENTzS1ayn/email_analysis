Tidy of 4.th August 2000 does not like:
> line 165 column 1 - Warning: replacing unexpected </comment> by </noembed>
> line 165 column 1 - Warning: trimming empty <noembed>
> line 167 column 1 - Warning: replacing unexpected </noembed> by </comment>

> line 247 column 1 - Warning: html doctype doesn't match content

>From practical point of view, the solution to combine both Netscape
Browser EMBED type and Microsoft Browser OBJECT type is o.k:
It works

Even if I delete the tags
<COMMENT>
</COMMENT>
</EMBED>
as I am used to do since some years, as I have the same problem with
embeding Real-Audio/Video files into HTML pages,

and if I insist in the docfile tag
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
, I still get a error message

line 241 column 1 - Warning: html doctype doesn't match content

respectively if I delete the doctype line, I get still get the message

Document content looks like HTML proprietary
no warnings or errors were found

It would be great if future versions of Tidy would accept such
solutions.

How about an extra "switch" for Tidy to avoid this error message, for
all webmaster who must integrate combined object and embeded tags ?

If the makers of Tidy refuse to obey ( :-) ), dear makers of Tidy, how
about starting a discussion with the Sun/Java staff for "better HTML
coding proposals" :-) ?  This is not my turn...

Any proposals for me as webmaster and HTML coder, any proposals for the
makers of Tidy by
other mailing list members ?

Topic #2
My document tag in all my HTML documents is
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
as I once learned when I started with Tidy in 2000.

If I parse an HTML document with such a tag with Tidy, I get the message
Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
Document content looks like HTML 4.01 Transitional

If I parse an HTML document without such a tag with Tidy, it includes
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
and I don?t get such a message.

So why is my once-learned solution "worse" than the new solution ( worse
as it causes an extra message ) ?
What progress did I miss ? Especially, is it useful to delete the URL in
the document tag, after all ?

Sincerely
Rolf
