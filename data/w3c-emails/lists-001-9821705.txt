The COMMENT, NOEMBED, and EMBED closing tags are switched around. That is an
error in the HTML and Tidy tries to fix it. The effectiveness of the fix is
another matter...

EMBED isn't part of HTML 4.01. Not even Transitional.

Are you looking for the "-q" switch? Also, errors are output to stderr.
Ignoring them is really easy, and you can check the return code to determine
whether or not any errors or warnings occured.

See my previous comment, although you're right about the extraneous message
appearing with the DOCTYPE URL.
