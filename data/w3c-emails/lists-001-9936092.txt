TidyGUI finds 129 errors that must be fixed in a small document
before it can tidy it.  This is a title page created with Word
2000; it contains lots of hyperlinks.

Ideas, in no particular order:
(1) Tidy is right.
(2) For small documents, it isn't worth the hassle of using Word.
(3) For large documents, it isn't worth the hassle of using Word.
(4) Try downloading Amaya from the W3C site, free open source code
    for Unix and Windows, quasi-WYSIWYG interface for HTML editing,
    shows errors in the "Structure View" window in red, so easy to
    find them and fix them.
(5) In the future, use Amaya for creating such documents.
