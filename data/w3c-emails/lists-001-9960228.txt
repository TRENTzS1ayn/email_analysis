You can do it with XSLT, you just can't necessarily do it cleanly.

Pardon my XSLT; I don't have my reference in front of me right now:

<card>
  <xsl:for-each select="tr">
    <xsl:apply-templates select="."/>
    <xsl:if test="(position() mod 10)==0 and !last()">
      <xsl:text
disable-output-escaping="yes">&lt;/card&gt;&lt;card&gt;</xsl:text>
    </xsl:if>
  </xsl:for-each>
</card>

And don't use &nbsp; with XSLT; use &#160; or &#xa0; instead.
