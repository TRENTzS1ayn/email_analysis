Yeah, that's how I ended up pulling an old copy of Tidy from the "wrong"
site. The search engines also give priority to Dave's old site. BTW, thanks
again Dave for a great tool (and the rest of ya'll). I can only hope that
keeping up with the ability to "Tidy" the crud out of MS-Word will continue
to be a priority.

Thanks!
