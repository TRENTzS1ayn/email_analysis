line 28 column 1 - Warning: <table> attribute value "0" must be lower case for XHTML
line 28 column 1 - Warning: <table> proprietary attribute "height"
line 42 column 2 - Warning: <table> attribute value "0" must be lower case for XHTML

zero has no case and line 

Line 28-29
<table width="100%" height="100%" summary="sideformat"
cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">

Line 42-43
<table width="90%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"
                  summary="formattering">

2)
