Dear Folks,

Just a heads-up : even though the <http://tidy.sourceforge.net> web page
might show that all Tidy executables which are automatically built, have
been updated, you may find that most haven't been updated.

I am still fighting various problems with the cron shell scripts that
didn't show up in manual testing. The Tidy executable for Linux/x86 seems
to be reliably updated.

Fortunately the changes in the source recently have been fairly minor, so
you are not likely to be missing much.

Hang in there - the problems will be solved eventually.

Regards, Terry
