I constantly get an error in Tidy using First Page 2000 Text Exceeds Memo Capacity.

The default is 200 and I want 400.

I can manually change it to 400 and run just one html doc then it reverts back to 200.

I want the default to keep 400 always and not 200.

It is very tiresome to constantly input 400 all the time for each and every html doc.

how do I fix Tidy for this problem.

how do I change memo capacity to keep a new capacity ?

Trox
