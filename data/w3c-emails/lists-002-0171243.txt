Not quite. Unless MS have also "invented" .war files (not to
my knowledge), they're a Sun-ism for containing packaged Java 
Enteprise Edition applications (just like .jar files can hold J2SE 
application code). Both jars and wars are indeed in zip format and 
there is of course nothing to stop .WARs from holding web-pages 
only (without any java code).
