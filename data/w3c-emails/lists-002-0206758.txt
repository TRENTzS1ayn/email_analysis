HTML Tidy does not confine itself to tidying up HTML.
It *also* probides accessibility tips.
Yes, I know that a page which contains relative URIs and does not have
a <base> element is perfectly valid.
It is also a collection of links that haven't broken YET (so a link
checker probably wouldn't notice any problem), but are just waiting
for a chance to happen, and that's a usability problem.
It's the kind of thing Tidy *could* detect quite easily,
and it's very much in the spirit of things that Tidy *does* detect
and warn about.

Note that I did not ask for Tidy to report this as a fatal error,
or to change the resulting HTML in any way, simply that I'd like it to
"complain", meaning to write a warning message (if the user requested it).
