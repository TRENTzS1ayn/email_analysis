Relative vs. absolute URLs, or the presence of a <base> element, have 
nothing to do with accessibility or preventing broken links from failing.

Quite on the contrary, the <base> element is usually a bad idea because it 
limits the portability of a page: 

* Moving the page to another site (even from a development server to a
  production server) or just another directory breaks all
  links.

* A page with an http:// base does not display properly using https://

Absolute links break as often as relative links -- if the content goes away it 
does not make a difference if you referenced it as ../greatoffer.html or 
http://www.domain.com/greatoffer.html.

No -- Tidy detects problems in and corrects the structure of markup, not the 
content. Besides there is no way to tell from a file where it will be hosted.

If you want to enforce a certain style you could validate against a custom DTD 
requiring a <base> element, or for attribute values against an XML schema which
only allows absolute protocols.

There is nothing to complain about relative URLs or lack of <base> elements.
