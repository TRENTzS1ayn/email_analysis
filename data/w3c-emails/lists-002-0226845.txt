HTML Tidy does not confine itself to tidying up HTML.
It *also* probides accessibility tips.
Yes, I know that a page which contains relative URIs and does not have a
<base> element is perfectly valid. It is also a collection of links that
haven't broken YET (so a link checker probably wouldn't notice any problem),
but are just waiting for a chance to happen, and that's a usability problem.
It's the kind of thing Tidy *could* detect quite easily, and it's very much
in the spirit of things that Tidy *does* detect and warn about.

Note that I did not ask for Tidy to report this as a fatal error, or to
change the resulting HTML in any way, simply that I'd like it to "complain",
meaning to write a warning message (if the user requested it).
