This was on a Macintosh.  The "Web Archive" file in question didn't have
_any_ extension, neither ".war", ".jar", ".zip", or any extension at all.
Its icon appeared at first and second glance to be the same as the icon
used for simple Web pages.  The Macintoshes in question didn't have MPW
installed, so writing a script to unpack the thing and feed the parts through
the (non-command-line!) MacTidy application would have been _rather_ tricky.
