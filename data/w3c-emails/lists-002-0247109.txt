Just to add what another poster said - I did discover the ".war" format is
used by J2EE applications - I chose to concentrate on how MSIE was using
the archive format. I didn't debate who came up with the format first.

Yes, I know it was on a Macintosh <grin>. I didn't say such a file would
have an extension (although of course it could). I assumed you were using
iCab Web Archives, and not IE Web Archives.

I guess I was thinking more StuffIt and AppleScript than anything else. Of
course I assume you are aware of my MPWTidy tool...
