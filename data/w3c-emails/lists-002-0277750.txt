Perhaps I have been missing something all these years.

I have never come across a recommendation that pages SHOULD contain a <base>
element for usability or any other reason. Indeed, I have sites that depend
on it not being there. That is the way I get mirrors to work. If there was a
<base> it would need changing on each mirror site. A missing target is a
missing target whether addressed absolutely or relatively.


Cheers,

Rick Parsons
