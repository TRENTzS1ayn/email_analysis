OK you asked for it.

I right click why wonderful HTML file I have just been writing from any
folder on the hard drive and "Send To" my batch file in the same folder as
the "tidy.exe" (and config.txt for that matter) download I got many months
ago.

------------Start of batch file --------------
find /v /n "" %1 > %1_num.txt
copy %1 "%1_newver.htm"
tidy.exe -config config.txt -f %1_notes.txt -modify "%1_newver.htm"
-----------End of batch file -----------------


----------- to set up right click ---------------------
1 . Right click the "Start" button
2 . Click on to " Explore".
3 . Open the "Send To" folder normally   "C:\windows\SendTo" or
"C:\windows\ShellNew\SendTo"
4 . Right click inside the folder on the white space below were the files
are listed and select "New".
5. Then. Select the "Shortcut".
6. the " Command line:" is empty.
7. Browse for the program you are making the shortcut for. In this case it
is *.bat ,
8. Then click on to Next >
9. If you are happy with the name click "Finish".

---------- if you are confused over my reply ask ------------

And if you live in New Zealand, watching your Microsoft windows defrag
program is more exciting than watching the free to air television stations
believe it or not..
