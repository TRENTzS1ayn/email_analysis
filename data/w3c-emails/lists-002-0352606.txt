Sorry if you are not sure how to make a batch file,
copy the three lines below and make a text file it might be called
New Text Document .txt then rename it to "xyz.bat" that is the file you look
for when setting up "Send To" .

Were xyz is any name you like up to eight characters long.


------------Start of batch file --------------
find /v /n "" %1 > %1_num.txt
copy %1 "%1_newver.htm"
tidy.exe -config config.txt -f %1_notes.txt -modify "%1_newver.htm"
-----------End of batch file -----------------

And if you live in New Zealand, watching your Microsoft windows defrag
program is more exciting than watching the free to air television stations
believe it or not..
