That's not a bug.  In XHTML, *all* tags (element names) and attribute
names have to be lowercase.  See

http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#diffs

Judging from your snippet above, though, it doesn't appear as though you
really want XHTML -- you have an attribute named "buttonType" which
doesn't appear in any of the XHTML DTDs.  Perhaps what you want is an
HTML-ish type markup of your own, but expressed in XML syntax.  In that
case, I would use "output-xml", not "output-xhtml".
