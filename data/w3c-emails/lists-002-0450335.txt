To be as specific as possible, see:

One thing to be aware of when converting to XHTML is that your in-line
Javascript (or VBScript or what have you) may conflict with reserved XML
characters.  Browser script functions within <script></script> tags are
CDATA escaped so that ampersands(&) and less than/greater than signs (<,>)
are passed to the scripting language unaltered.  But it is not possible to
do this for in-line event handlers (e.g. onclick="if ( a > b && c < d) { a =
d; }; return false;").  You will have to modify these handlers to make a
simple function call and move the actual code to a <script> tag.

take it easy,
Charlie
