no disagreement on the intention to create valid HTML and do as little harm to 
the document as possible.

Changing tidy will break pages that rely on the current processing, which is
treating the content of PRE as text and escaping tags (not sure if anyone has 
used it for that but comes handy when writing *ML code samples, just write them
between <PRE> ... </PRE> and tidy formats them with &lt; and &gt; entity
references) -- might introduce yet another flag to indicate how tidy should 
process <PRE> sections.

Another item for discussion, since other block level elements, and IMG, OBJECT,
BIG, SMALL, SUB and SUP are not allowed in PRE context either, should these get
moved outside of the PREformatted section as well?

In theory that's correct, however browser implementations vary in their support
for vertical spacing of block level elements.
