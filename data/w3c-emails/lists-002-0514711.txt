There is "current processing" in tidy, and tidy users may have used this tidy 
feature to generate valid markup from an input source with misplaced tags in 
<pre> sections.

There is formal specification for how tidy reads and process a page so it 
cannot be wrong. In fact a specification could say that any tags between <pre> 
and </pre> are converted by tidy, providing the filter you mentioned above.

Um, not according to the HTML standard, which allows inline elements minus the 
elements I listed.
