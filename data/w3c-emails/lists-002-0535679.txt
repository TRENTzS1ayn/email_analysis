The output was different from what one Tidy user had expected, other
users may have used Tidy to clean up different code bits, like this:

HTML Example:

<pre>

  <h1>This is a headline</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>And a list, too</li>
  </ul>
</pre>

which Tidy turns into a valid, nicely formatted example of HTML code:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
<body>
<p>HTML Example:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;h1&gt;This is a headline&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;And a list, too&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
</body>
</html>

Which version of Tidy failed? I have tried this with the current
version, including noshade attributes (which gets stripped off, that's
definitely a bug!) but haven't manage to actually kill Tidy.

Tracker record for this bug:

On the other hand I have not been able to reproduce the desired output
which you showed either.

See above -- I don't think that flaming each other is going to help
anyone determined what the best behaviour for tidy should be. If you
believe you have a solution that satisfies everyone don't hesitate to
provide a patch to fix Tidy, though.
