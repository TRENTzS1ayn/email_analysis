Lee> output-encoding: big5

does this work in the dec01 asian version?  not for me.

anyway, we use -raw because we must make big5 web pages... it is not
unicode time yet here.  Also, I have some web pages that are pure
ascii.  With -raw I don't have to change the tidy switches for each
file depending on its coding system.

Anyway, I still use aug00 tidy because you haven't put back the
#FFFFFF color stuff.
