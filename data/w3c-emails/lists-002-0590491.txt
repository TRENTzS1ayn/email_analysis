The output was different from what one Tidy user had expected, other
users may have used Tidy to clean up different code bits, like this:

No.  The problem is what I said it was.  It was not unexpected output,
but no output.


HTML Example:

<pre>

  <h1>This is a headline</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>And a list, too</li>
  </ul>
</pre>

which Tidy turns into a valid, nicely formatted example of HTML code:

No it doesn't.  Here is the actual output just pasted from another window:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html>
<head>
<meta name="generator" content="HTML Tidy, see www.w3.org">
<title></title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>
  
</pre>

<h1>This is a headline</h1>

<pre>
  
</pre>

<ul>
<li>And a list, too</li>
</ul>
</body>
</html>

This is just right.  It's the best output Tidy could possibly
produce for this kind of input.  Having it produce what you say
it does would be an EXTREMELY SERIOUS MISTAKE.

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
<body>
<p>HTML Example:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;h1&gt;This is a headline&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;And a list, too&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
</body>
</html>

If there is now a version of Tidy doing this, that's pretty disastrous
and really MUST be backed out PRONTO.

Why?  Well, amongst other things, there are all those tags that ARE allowed
inside <PRE>, so changing ALL tags to &lt;...&gt; would definltely break
legal pages, which Tidy isn't supposed to do, while changing just some of
them couldn't possibly satisfy the people who want an ersatz <![CDATA[[]]>.
Nor would this change make the behaviour of the output resemble the
behaviour of the input in any browser I've been able to try out.
