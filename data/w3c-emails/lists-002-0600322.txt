Suffice it to say that
 - the output I observe from Tidy is nothing like the output Klaus Rusch
   observes
 - if any version of Tidy *does* change block-level tags <FOO> to
   quasi-CDATA &lt;FOO&gt; inside <PRE> that's a really disastrous mistake
   + if it changes all tags, that will break legal pages
   + if it changes some tags but not others, that will NOT have the
     "poor-man's CDATA section" effect that he says is wanted
   + in any case, the transformed pages will not look in common browsers
     at all similar to the original pages, which defeats the principal
     goal of Tidy, which is to clean things up while preserving appearance
     as far as is reasonable.
     
The nearest thing I have ever seen to a "display some kinds of tags right
and others as literals" is the botch in Microsoft Word where <ABBR> tags
are displayed, highlighted, as errors (as indeed is the <!DOCTYPE...> line).
