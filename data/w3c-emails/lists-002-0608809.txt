I have some free time at the moment so I've started retrofitting the
HTML Tidy changes into JTidy.  At the same time, I plan to remove any
JTidy-specific emergency fixes that were designed to fix the same things
that are fixed in the new HTML Tidy code base.

After reviewing the diffs between the 4aug00 HTML Tidy release and the
current CVS code base, I realize that this is going to be a somewhat
larger task than I had hoped so I am getting started now rather than
waiting for an official HTML Tidy release.  When that comes, I'll just
have to do the catchup between now and then and it should be much more
manageable.

After I've finished retrofitting the changes, I'll commit everything to
CVS.  I don't want to commit the intermediate work because it won't
compile and there are too many loose ends.

It would be great if someone (Sami?) could "Ant"ize the automated
testing that the HTML Tidy folk have done so that we can verify that our
version is in sync with theirs.

I don't expect my work to end up too pretty but it will work.  There are
far too many statics in JTidy as it is and a lot of places where fields
are public.  I'd like evaluate whether we should "privatize" those
fields and access them only via setter and getter methods.  Once
everything is in JTidy and working, I plan to refactor the whole deal to
make JTidy more java-like (ie more object oriented).  At the same time,
I will remain faithful to the HTML Tidy structure so that we can
retrofit future upgrades.  It is a key goal that JTidy produce the same
ouput as HTML Tidy.

Once the refactoring is complete, JTidy should be in pretty good shape.
At that point, I'll start adding the features that have been discussed
before.

Those are my plans.  Please chime in if you have any questions,
comments, etc.

Gary
