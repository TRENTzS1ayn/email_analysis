Cool. I think that is probably the right approach. Hopefully the pace of
changes to the base Tidy source code is slowing down. I knew it wasn't
going to be easy <grin>.

Although I haven't completed them, I have been working on the release notes
for the next version of Tidy. The release notes give a fairly good overview
of what has changed in each source file, as well as a summary of all bugs
that have been fixed. While I may not intimately understand all the changes
made, I have a pretty good idea of what was changed for what reason. If you
think the release notes would help you do the conversion to Java, let me
know, and I will try to bring the release notes up to date, and send them
to you.

Regards, Terry
