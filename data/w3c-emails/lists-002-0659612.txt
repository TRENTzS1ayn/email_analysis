Here is a topic from the Tidy documentation -

       This is something you then have to fix yourself as
       Tidy is unsure of where the > should be inserted.

Are there example web pages or markup where tags missing their TAGC
cause ambiguity?

I had simply assumed that under SGML rules, tags were closed
when a new STAGO was seen, exempli gratia:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
<html
   <head

     <title</title>

   </head
   <body

   </body>
</html>

and it was never possible to be "unsure" where the TAGC belonged.

An introduction to this topic has been written by Jukka Korpela
<URL: http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/html/empty.html >, but to
be fair to both the author and potential readers, I suspect that
you would need to go to the technical documentation before you
had a deep understanding of the the issues involved.

To repeat, are there any simple examples of ambiguity
owing to missing TAGCs; if not, what is HTML-tidy driving
at here?

Ben.
