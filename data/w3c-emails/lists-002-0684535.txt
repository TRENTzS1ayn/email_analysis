Applying the 80/20 rule, you'd get a lot of mileage by just re-using the 
test input, config and output files.  These are all available by anonymous CVS.

I'd go further, It would benefit all of us to keep a single test case 
repository.  If anyone on the JTidy crew wants to add to the test cases, 
let us know.  Worst case, just send the files to tidy-develop list and I'll 
drop 'em in.  Ongoing, I don't see a problem adding you guys as committers.

Thoughts?

take it easy,
Charlie
