Can you explain how the tests work? It looks as though you are passing the input files through Tidy and comparing them to something, but there are not nearly as many output files as input files...

A further complication is that JTidy does not simply correct input files. It also outputs an XML DOM - and the tests need to verify that as well.  I don't see how the Tidy tests do that.
