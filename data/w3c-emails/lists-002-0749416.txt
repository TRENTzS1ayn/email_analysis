I don't know what version of the base Tidy source code, TidyCom is using,
but there were a number of bugs in the base Tidy source code related to
DOCTYPEs, including issues with "doctype: omit", that we believe have now
been fixed.

You may have to wait for Andr? to update TidyCom to use the latest base
Tidy source code (if it is just a matter of updating a Tidy executable that
TidyCom uses, that is even easier - I don't know enough about TidyCom to
help further). I don't know of any workarounds.

Hope this helps.

Regards, Terry
