It does help -- thanks Terry.

For my purposes I need only the html 'body' so I thought using the
show-body-only option would be an effective workaround; since doctypes
are positioned even before the <html> tag I would get rid of them.

However show-body-only being set to true also does not seem to work in
TidyCom, perhaps I am not using TidyCom properly or have there also been
problems with that in earlier versions of the base Tidy source code? --I
am pretty sure my code is correct because the other options I am using,
such as outputting in xml, indenting and wrapping, all seem to work
well.

I have written some code to provide me with 'just the body' today so I
don't need to use TidyCom to do this or to get rid of the doctype tag
anymore. Still I'd be interested to know what the current and past
status of these options are within Tidy and TidyCom.

No word from Andr? yet, I guess he's busy (fair play TidyCom is free
after all) or maybe taking a holiday in the alps, although I hear France
is a little short of snow this year. I'm CCing this to him anyway.

Thanks and regards,
