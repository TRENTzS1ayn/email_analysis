Hi,

I was wondering if I could use TidyGUI to clean up and validate my html document using my DTD file?

I know there is an option in TidyGUI that allow you to use custom DTD (I think), but some how I was unable to use it.

Could somebody please help me? Any helps are greatly appreciated. Thanks

Best Regards,
Kevin
