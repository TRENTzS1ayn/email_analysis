Does it work for you?

The archives are not (obviously) downloadable as for
example these archives are.

Almost all guides on asking questions suggests searching archives

it is a good idea to follow a bit the mailing list or to
read some of the mailing list archives before asking, to get
aquanted to the culture of the list and not to get
flamebated imediately. Often the list etiquette is

subscription reply.
