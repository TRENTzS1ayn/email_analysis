I understand that English may not be your first/native language, but you
need to give us a bit more specific information before we can really help
you - like what hardware, operating system, and compiler you are using.
Then what version of the source are you using - did you get the latest from
CVS, or download the source archive from <http://tidy.sourceforge.net>?

If I had to take a guess, you want to build a Windows binary executable of
Tidy - I don't know if this is possible with JUST the source you download -
you probably need a specific build script, Makefile, or project file for
your development environment. I can build the Win32 binary using the
Metrowerks CodeWarrior cross-development tools on my platform, but the CW
project file is not part of the standard release.

You may wish to join the "tidy-develop" mailing list (details on the Tidy
project web page), and move any development related questions to that list,
where you may be better served.

As for "algorithm or pseudocode" - apart from some comments in the original
Tidy HTML documentation about what the various source files are used for
(their names are fairly self-explanatory), I believe the only documentation
for the code, is the code itself - I can't claim to understand all the code
either, so if you decide to document what you learn from the code, it would
be welcomed by others.

Hope this helps.
