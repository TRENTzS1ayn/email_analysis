As a general principle, if Tidy is being used in a write back mode
that alters the original file, then greater caution is required to
avoid loosing the author's work through unsafe guesses.

As a general principle, no sane programmer _ever_ destroys an original file
until the replacement has been thoroughly checked.
It would never in a lifetime have occurred to me that this might be an
intended mode of operation.

Obviously, such an inherently highly dangerous mode of operation should be
as conservative as possible.  Indeed, considering the number of things a
script might conceivably depend on, the only non-unsafe transformation would
appear to be the identity.

This is, however, no argument against the use of heuristics in a safe
operation mode.
