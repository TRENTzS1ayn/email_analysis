I hesitate to take a position contrary to a co-author, and probably
the senior author of the relevant documents, but my
reading of <URL: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/appendix/notes.html#h-B.3.7 >
suggests that the relevant features are certainly allowed
in HTML and are not even deprecated. the only warning is that some
browsers do not support them.

Do you have a URL for this?
