I meant the latter. I thought that it was tidy's job to normalise
SGML like this. If it is not, then I am simply wrong.

The documentation for tidy includes this ambiguous text:

Perfecting lists by putting in tags missed out:
   <body>
   <li>1st list item
   <li>2nd list item

is mapped to

   <body>
   <ul>
   <li>1st list item</li>
   <li>2nd list item</li>
   </ul>

1) Tidy is not 'perfecting' it is 'correcting', 'amending' or my
favoured term 'repairing'.

2) It has done two distinct things:
a) Added a missing <ul> start tag
b) Normalised omitted </li> end tags

It is this 'passing over' or paraleipsis which is the rhetorical
term <URL: http://www.chem.leeds.ac.uk/roget/entries/460.html >
of normalising the <li> element there that would suggest that
tidy normalises tags as a matter of course.

Independent of the argument in favour of normalising a tidied
document to a canonical form; the benefits of including the
end tags I mentioned include coddling a bug in Netscape which
sometimes fails to render table content when presented with
legal markup omitting these end tags (some 'wysiwyg' editors
omit these tags as a matter of routine),

Logically, to make a page 'tidy' we should either omit all
omissible tags, or include all includable ones, I prefer the
latter, and believe that I can support that preference, perhaps
you differ.

Surely 'first do no harm' is one of the most definite rules that
there is; which is why I used that form of words.

The docs give ten examples, including the <ul> container element

All right. You have convinced me. I had thought that there was
a general issue here, but I now see that it is fairly specific,
and you are right.

I was taking human nature into account. I suspect that many people
would run the document through tidy and call it a day. Many people
are minded to take the output of computer as 'vox dei'. I would
doubt that in the real world the results would be rigorously checked,
and I suspect that often would not be checked at all.

In the case in point, the check might have to be done in a text editor
rather than an HTML editor.

Ben.
