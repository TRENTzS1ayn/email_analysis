Which raises an interesting point (well, it interests me!). How *do* 
people use Tidy?

I do a lot of what I call "consolidation": I get text from a bunch of 
different people and have to update various web pages with it. I 
paste it in with a text editor, add appropriate markup, run the 
result through Tidy, and then open it in a browser to check the 
appearance. In this mode, I can be reasonably sure of catching 
anything that Tidy has corrected to the "wrong" choice. I am 
occasionally surprised by the result: for example when I left out a 
leading <ol>:
 <p>...
 <li>listitem1
 <li>listitem2
 </ol>
Tidy kindly made it a UL for me!

I wouldn't dream of accepting Tidy's (or anyone else's!) corrections 
to a page without checking its appearance.
