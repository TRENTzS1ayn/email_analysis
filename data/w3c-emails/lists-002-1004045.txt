Thanks for jogging my memory. The HTML working group wanted to
support the widespread practice of omitting quote marks around
attribute values when these didn't include spaces. This forced
SHORTTAG YES even though none of the browsers supported the other
features implied by SHORTTAG YES.

My advice is not to encourage authors to rely on short tags.
Please don't extend Tidy to fully support shorttags.
