For what it's worth, Tidy embodies knowledge that in Netscape
and Internet Explorer, list items that aren't enclosed in
<ul> or <ol> are terminated by block level markup like <p>

Thus

 <li>foo
 <li>bar
 <p>It's been a long day ...

is tidied to:

 <ul>
 <li>foo
 <li>bar
 </ul>
 <p>It's been a long day ...

Originally, I added a CSS style property to outdent the
list items when the <ul> was implied in this way, so as
to duplicate the rendering behavior on NN and IE, but
sadly, some browsers had problems with negative margins,
so I dropped this.
