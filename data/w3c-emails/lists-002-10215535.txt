Hi, I would like to know if there is support, or plans to do it, for 
tidylib under php. It could be immensely useful. If not, I would like to 
add from my own because I need it in a complicate setup that needs 
performances - usig the command line version with a process being 
spawned at every access to the php page is not that efficient.

bye, thank you
as
