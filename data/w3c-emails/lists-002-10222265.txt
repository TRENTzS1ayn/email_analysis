The only thing i want the list owners to do is to not send me any more
mail of any kind.



attached mail follows:
       32740 schmedininkeywest@webtv.net
schmedininkeywest@webtv.net

You have been removed from the list.

If this wasn't your intention or you are having problems getting yourself
unsubscribed, reply to this mail now (quoting it entirely (for diagnostic
purposes), and of course adding any comments you see fit).  Be sure to
include some indication of what you want the list owners to do, since they
are unlikely to be able to divine it from the message.

Transcript of unsubscription request follows:
