Hi

We are currently building a CMS and want to allow users to create html content
through a webbrowser. We are currently using one that relies on IE (eugh!!)
which works ok but, now this may come as a shock to you all, the html is not valid.

The idea was to pass the output through tidy to get a valid output to fit in
with the rest of the site.
The problem I am having is with font tags.

Some of them are defined as <font color="#f00"> some as <font style="blah">.

If I set drop-font-tags=on the all go obviously, if I set clean=on the font tags
that contain the color element get changed to span tags with their color value
added to the header, but the font tags with a style element get changed to just
<span> so it removes the style element from it.

Is the removal of the style elements a bug or a feature? Is there any way round it?
Is there a way I can get the font tags with color element to be changed to span
tags with inline styles? so I get <span style="color:#f00"> instead of it being
added to the head.

Also it would be nice to have html tidy work on some html without adding the
head body tags etc.. so it thinks the stuff is there and work under that basis.

Many thanks for any of your time and comments.
Please CC me I'm offlist

Cheers

Matt
