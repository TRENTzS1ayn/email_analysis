Hallo,     
        my current job is to generate an XHTML file from HTML with HTML Tidy, then using XSLT to transform XHTML into XML. But the problem is that in the newly generated XHTML File, <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> the namespace is added automatically by HTML Tidy.  With this declaration, the XSLT won't work at all.  Does anyone have any idea, how could it be worked out using the config.txt from HTML Tidy or other approaches?  Any help will be appreciated, thanks in advance.  

Regards

Ming
