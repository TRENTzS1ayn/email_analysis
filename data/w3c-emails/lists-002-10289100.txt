You need to declare and use the XHTML namespace in your XSLT document,
e.g.

  <xsl:transform ... xmlns:x='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>

    <xsl:template match = 'x:p'>
      <!-- do something with paragraphs -->
    </xsl:template>

  </xsl:transform>

However, what about a boolean 'xhtml-namespace' config option?
