Hmm,

  <p><font style="blah">...</font></p>
  <p><font color=red>...</font></p>
  <p><font color=red>...</font><font style='blah'>...</font></p>

gets (-clean)

  <style type="text/css">
   span.c4 {blah}
   span.c3 {color: red}
   p.c2 {color: red}
   p.c1 {blah}
  </style>
  ...
  <p class="c1">...</p>
  <p class="c2">...</p>
  <p><span class="c3">...</span><span class='c4'>...</span></p>

You run into trouble with -clean if you use both, font styles and the
style attribute, e.g.

  <p><font color=red style="blah">...</font></p>

where the style attribute is indeed removed, but you don't have this
case, do you? Do you have a small self-contained of what you think does
not work properly?
