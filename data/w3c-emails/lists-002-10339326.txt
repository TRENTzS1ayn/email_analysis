Hello,

Thank you for the reply. You are correct, this is the behavior of tidy with
HTML files. I am actually using tidy to clean up internal XML files that
have some HTML markups.

So it's not strictly HTML. The following:
--
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" standalone="yes"?>
<dtbook>
   <book>
    <bodymatter>
    hello, <em>how</em> are you <strong>doing</strong> today. 
    </bodymatter>
  </book>
</dtbook>
--

is output as:
--
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" standalone="yes"?>
<dtbook3>
  <book>
    <bodymatter>hello, 
    <em>how</em>are you 
    <strong>doing</strong>today.</bodymatter>
  </book>
</dtbook3>
--

Is there a way to configure tidy to treat the XML tags as if it were HTML?
or is this spacing behavior limited to files identified and markedup as
HTML?

I am using the Cygwin port of HTML tidy dated '1st February 2003', no
version number is specified so I'm unsure if it's with current sources.

Thank you,

Ivo

I am unable to reproduce this behaivour. Using current sources I get

  hello, <em>how</em> are you <strong>doing</strong> today.

Do you have a complete test case?
