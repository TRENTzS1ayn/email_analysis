We did the same thing you are trying to do.  Our solution involved removing
the "xmlns" attribute from the "html" element after running the HTML through
tidy.  We've never had a problem since.

Subject: how to remove the namespace declaration in the XHTML generated from
HTML Tidy


Hallo,     
        my current job is to generate an XHTML file from HTML with HTML
Tidy, then using XSLT to transform XHTML into XML. But the problem is that
in the newly generated XHTML File, <html
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> the namespace is added automatically
by HTML Tidy.  With this declaration, the XSLT won't work at all.  Does
anyone have any idea, how could it be worked out using the config.txt from
HTML Tidy or other approaches?  Any help will be appreciated, thanks in
advance.  
 
Regards
 
Ming
