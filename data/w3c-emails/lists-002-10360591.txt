Thanks for your respond

Yes exactly,
I get 
  <foo>
    <baz>
    </baz>
  </foo>
but I want 
  <foo>
    <baz></baz>
  </foo>
with no space or carriage return between the two empty tags


By the way, I also use tidy as an object in my DELPHI project, the tidy function
is called within my Delphi Application.

Joseph

So you have

  <foo><bar/><baz></baz></foo>

and want

  <foo><bar/><baz></baz></foo>

but Tidy gives

  <foo>
    <bar />
  
    <baz>
    </baz>
  </foo>

and that's a problem?
