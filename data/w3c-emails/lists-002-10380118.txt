Hi peter

Thanks for the reply

I want to change

<font style="blah"> to <span style="blah">

and

<font color="#f00"> to <span style="color:#foo">

Currently htmltidy will replace all font tags with custom style classes and 
places the the style definitions in the header. but I would like to put all 
the style definitions inline. This is because only the html inside the body 
tag gets used, the rest will be deleted.

Regards

Matt
