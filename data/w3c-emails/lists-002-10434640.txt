Hello,

I am a beginner of XHTML and I want to use "Tidy.exe" to correct my XHTML 
files. Now I downloaded the "Tidy.exe"(Ver 2000). But according to your 
advice, I should download the latest source code. Would you tell me in detail 
how to use the source code to update the older version and how to use it.

Thanks a lot

xdt
