Hi,

I am interest in understanding the underline architecture of Tidy as I want to hack and add features to it such as support coversion to xhtml-print.  I could not find any documentations that can help me in this.  Does any one has any or knows where I can get my hands on the developers guideline or something in that nature.

Thank you,

Peter
