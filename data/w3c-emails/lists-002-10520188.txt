hi All,

i've been using DocBook a lot lately with JEdit, and use Tidy to pretty my 
XML files. One problem for me is that i sometimes need to prevent (or would 
like to) certain elements from being placed on a newline.

For example, i might have as XML:

<para>and it was very <quote>purplish</quote>.</para>  <-- Note the period 
outside the quote.

When i tidy this, i get:

<para>and it was very
<quote>purplish</quote>

.</para>


This causes problems when i use the DocBook automatic XSLT to create HTML. 
There is a space before the period.  It's not huge, but except for that, i 
can seamlessly publish to HTML from DocBook XML without human intervention.

What i'd like is to be able to exclude certain elements from being placed 
on a newline (even when i remove the blank line, the period is in the wrong 
place)

Any suggestions??

Thanks,
mark
