Hi,

I've got a problem tidying a html document when trying to output as xml.

The problem is that a form is started in a table after the first <tr> but 
before that <tr>'s first <td>. Hence the following errors and warning.

line 183 column 25 - Warning: missing </form> before </td>
line 427 column 17 - Error: discarding unexpected </form>
line 498 column 9 - Error: discarding unexpected </form>

The HTML snippet looks like this:


<table class=yellow border=0 width=210 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr>
<form method=post action="taken out" id=ipfform name=ipfform>
<input name=nosonpage type=hidden value=5>
<!-- several more inputs removed by me -->
<td class=blue width=1><img src="/images/a.gif"></td>
<td class=blue width=1><img src="/images/a.gif"></td>
<!-- several more <td>'s with <input>s removed by me -->
</tr>

There are now several more <tr>s each with lots of <td>s and all of which 
start and end correctly. Finally the problem bit ends with:

</form></tr></table>

You will notice that <form> ends in apparently the correct position, that 
being before the </tr> which, in turn is correctly placed before the </table>.

The problem seems to be the starting point of the <form> being before the 
first <td>.

How can I make this get tidied. -- I am stuck!!

Thanks guys, regards,

..matthew
