Thanks. I just worked this out a few minutes before your email arrived, but 
my problem is that I need to Tidy a lot of these pages - too many to do 
manually. Does anyone know how I can get HTML Tidy to tidy this without 
having to change it manually? What options could I use? Or, since I don't 
actually need any of the data in the forms, how I can remove them? Any 
other ideas?

BTW: There are in fact 3 tables in the document that incorrectly have 
<form> after the start of <table>.

Many thanks and regards,

..matthew
