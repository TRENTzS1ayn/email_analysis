Thanks. I believe sed and awk are UNIX commands. I use HTML Tidy in some 
screen scraping software I've written. The html is downloaded and tidied 
into xml using tidied using Charles Reitzel's .net Wrapper for HTML Tidy, 
then I run some xslt on the xml to extract the useful information. I don't 
want to have to run an extra non-tidy routine to tidy my data. Is there no 
way to achieve what I want from within Tidy?

Thanks guys and regards,
