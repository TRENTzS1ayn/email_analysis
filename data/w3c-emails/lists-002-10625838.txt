Thanks for the info. Dave.

One possible way around this problem for me would be to remove all form 
tags, is there a way to tell Tidy to do this? All I really need is to get 
valid xml outputted. So if I could simply tell Tidy not to process 
<form...> and </form> tags then I'd be sorted even if the <input> tags 
remained making the output invalid html -- I just want valid xml. Is this 
or something like it possible?

If not I'm going to have to write my own supplementary tidy routine to do 
this. :-(

Many thanks for your help everyone, regards,

..matthew

PS. Dave -- Thanks for creating Tidy, it is very useful to me, and I 
appreciate your placing it in the public domain a lot.
