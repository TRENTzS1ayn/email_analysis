I hope someone can help me here.


Here's what I need: An upload php program for the submissions section of the 
site. It needs to allow users to upload a variety of files to our webserver. 
It also needs to limit the type of files capable of upload (no .exe, .php, 
.asp etc.), and also have a notification email sent to the admin's email 
address with a description of the file that the user uploading gives. Also, 
if the file already exists, then give it an alternate name or some other 
option. Currently I am using a form mail php script that allows me to do 
most of this, minus the file type filtering and same name situation 
handling. Let me know if you have any suggestions. I've found php programs 
out there that do one or more of these things, but not all or very well.
