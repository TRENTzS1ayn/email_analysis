I am new to Jtidy as i got it when i was searching for information for parsing html.
I liked JTidy a lot.
I have an Java application which retrieves contents from the web and store it as an html file. 
I have to transform the html to XML to give input to an other application.
I saw the sample code in JTidy site which uses parses the html to DOM , i'm also following the same. i was able to convert the whole HTML to XML with some errors, as the HTML is a huge one.
But in the generated XML i need only some particular data . so the final xml should contain only that particular data. How do i go about it. how do i form a XML from DOM object. 
Pl guide me the procedure involved.

Sundar
