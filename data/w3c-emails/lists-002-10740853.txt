Not sure who to send this to, so hello list and forgive me if you don't 
want to read this.

On the main webpage I'd like to make two minor observations:

1. Another application that integrates Tidy well is Topstyle Pro 
(http://www.bradsoft.com/). I think it uses Tidy Classic, but I don't 
know for sure (need to check with mailto:info@bradsoft.com)

2. Accessibility is spelt with two ss.

Rick :-)
