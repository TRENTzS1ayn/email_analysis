Sorry, but it doesn't indicate that. If you're referring to section 
4.10, what it's saying is that the "name" attribute is deprecated for 
all the elements listed. This has nothing to do with which elements 
are allowed in which flavour of XHTML.

Take a look at <http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/dtds.html>. IFRAME is not 
allowed in the Strict DTD, only in Transitional and Frameset.
