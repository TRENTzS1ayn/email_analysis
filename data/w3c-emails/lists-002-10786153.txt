hi, so far I've been able to use jtidy alright, but
I'm kinda stuck.  What I want to do is read a static
html file from disk, then go through a table and
remove some <tr></tr> elements depending on
<td>text</td> inside. so... say there was a <td> in a
<tr> and in the <td> was the text "foo", I would want
to remove that whole <tr>.

if (td.getText().equals("foo")) {
 parent.removeChild(tr);
}

this is just an example, so syntax is made up. but ya.
the problem is, I dont know how to get the text
between 2 tags.  And lastly, I want to write the
modified document back to disk.  How can I do that? 
Thank you so much!!!!


Neil
