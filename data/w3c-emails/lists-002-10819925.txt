Hi All,
I've been on the induction diet for three weeks now.  I tried it a while
back.  I stayed on it strictly for three weeks that time and lost no weight.
This time I lost three or four pounds so far.  What I'm doing differently
this time is eating more fat.  As a matter of fact, I did the fat fast for
two days (lost one pound doing that.)  I obviously lose very slowly.  I
guess I'm one of those who is metabolically resistant.  My question is:  If
you are metabolically resistant and manage to lose weight, will it be a
constant struggle to keep the weight off, or does your body become better
able to burn fat the longer you stay on the diet?  Thanks for the info.
Sheila
