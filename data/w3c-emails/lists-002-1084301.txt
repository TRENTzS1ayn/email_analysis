Liam Quinn <liam@htmlhelp.com> pointed out that people checking HTML
with nsgmls can use the -wmin-tag option on the nsgmls command line.

Many thanks for that, my scripts now do this.
Interestingly enough, the test cases I tried (real web pages) have
now convinced me that Tidy _shouldn't_ be made to clean up NET.
Reason:
    <STYLE type=text/css>
This is in the "Hacker's Digest - Ten Things not to do if Arrested" page.
Given the prevalence of / in URIs and things like this, and the prevalence
of incorrectly omitted quotations marks (I've even seen pages generated by
well known commercial HTML editors where there are attribute names with
spaces in them...) it's obviously right that Tidy should treat / like a
letter and not like NET.

I therefore withdraw my remark that it would be nice if Tidy cleaned up
SHORTTAG stuff in general.

However, I _have_ run into <br<br> and the like in real pages, so it's
still a good idea to handle unclosed tags as well as possible.
