Julie,

 

Don't use a lot, but the picante sauce only has 1.5 or 2 carbs.  Worth it to me!

Thanks, Connie.  I will try that!  Is it OK to have the Picante sauce?
Julie

finally, after talking with a woman at the grocery store, I was in!  It is
tough finding foods I can eat the first two weeks - I too would like
suggestions!  I know you said you don't like eggs much, but I find this
really tasty - scrambled eggs with cheese and a little Pace Picante Sauce -
yummy!  Good luck to you!

> Hi!  I am Julie and I just started the Atkins diet yesterday.  I want to
lose about 30 pounds.  This is the first time I have ever tried a low carb
diet.  I am craving everything that I am NOT supposed to eat!  Cookies,
cake, chips, etc.  I need some help with some suggestions to eat, especially
for breakfast, and snacks, too.  I am not hungry until after I have been at
work for about an hour or two.  I took cheese and SF jello and hard boiled
eggs so far.  I don't like eggs much, especially hard boiled ones plain!  I
am looking for some easy, quick foods I can eat during induction and
anything I can buy packaged is even better!  Thanks!  I know this will get
better, right? LOL
