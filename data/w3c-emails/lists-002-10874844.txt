Hello everyone!
I am new to the list but not to the Atkins diet.  I had lost 25 pounds on Atkins 6 years ago, but then got careless until I gained everything back.  There were not as many wonderful low carb items available then, and it got really hard to stay on it.  Now of course, I'm encountering the "one golden shot" effect, and am not losing at all.  I have had to cut back my carbs to almost nothing just to get into ketosis.  But I have to admit I feel great!  The brain "fog" from eating carbs all day - gone!  I used to get cold sores almost every two weeks.  I haven't had one since I went back to low carbing.  I am looking forward to being on this list and finding support from it.  If anyone has any advice about being on Atkins the 2nd time around, I'd love to hear it.
Thanks,
Lee
