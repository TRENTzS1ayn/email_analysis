I am getting that diet mailing list stuff too. 

The name of the diet group that is using the html-tidy e-mail list is at
yahoo! groups (http://groups.yahoo.com/). The specific group is the
Atkins diet group "cuynetatkins." 

The URL to report Unauthorized Subscription abuse such as this is:
http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/groups/cgi_abuse . This will probably
get your name removed from the cuynetatkins diet mailing list - Stop diet
spam. <no pun intended>
