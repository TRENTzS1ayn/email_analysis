I've spent a fair amount of time on an off during the last couple of 
weeks looking at "mshtm" output from Word 2000.  While it has many, many 
flaws, over-abundance of  non-breaking spaces is not one of them.  I 
suspect that the --bare option was more designed to allow people to 
gracefully downgrade from the most advanced named entities more than to 
clean up Micro$ofts mess -- that's what I use it for.

Along these same lines, another recent named entity that Word 2000 seems 
enamoured with, and which many of my older browsers support only 
half-heartedly, is &hellip;.  So I would like to add some code to the 
MakeBare option which will convert that entity to &#160;.&#160;.&#160. 
(that's three periods delimited by three non-breaking spaces).

Unless I am faced with vehement objections, I'll check in these changes 
about this time next week.  In the meantime, I'm going to continue to 
explore how we can deal with mshtm more effectively.
