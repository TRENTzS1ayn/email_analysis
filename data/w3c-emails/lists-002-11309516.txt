on the HTML Tidier home page
http://mindprod.com/projhtmltidier.html

there is an example that does exactly what I need to do.

converting:
You can read up on the <a

calculating the expected check digit.

You can read up on the rules [see 
http://www.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/isbn.html] for calculating the

it also mentions rendering <b>Wow!</b> as *Wow!* which would be cool

but, there aren't really any examples of how to do this in JTidy.

I've got it tidying my text no problem. There was an example for that. 
How do make what I just mentioned happen?

Thanks in advance,
