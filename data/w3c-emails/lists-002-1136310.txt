Hi,

I am using your JTidy code for converting html to xml.
                                                                            
 My java program has a line:                                                
 URL sourceURL=new URL                                                      
 ("http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/techDocs/Newsletters/2002/nl0131 
 .html");                                                                   
 When I ran this program, I got an error message:                           
 java.net.UnknownHostException: developer.java.sun.com.                     
                                                                            
 I am connecting to Internet through proxy server and in browser I am       
 getting the page but while pinging it is not giving anything.              
                                                                            
 I am getting same error in:                                                
 InetAddress theInetAddr = InetAddress.getByName ("java.sun.com");          
                                                                            
 Is it a problem of my network configuration or something else?             
 Pls Help...                                                                
                                                                            
 Thanks and Regards,
