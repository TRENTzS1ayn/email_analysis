<disclaimer>
I am not a programmer, and my understanding of compiler and compiler
options is limited to tinkering. These RPMs are based on the Tidy RPM
for Mandrake based on the 20020902 sources. If I should be making
changes to the spec files let me know, especially in light of tidylib.

I have not tested tidylib on RHL 8.0, but the binary seems to work just
fine.

HTML Tidy RPM for RHL 8.0:
http://steamedpenguin.f2o.org/goodies/tidy-20030108-2.redconcepts.i386.rpm

HTML Tidy source RPM:
http://steamedpenguin.f2o.org/goodies/SRPMS/tidy-20030108-2.redconcepts.src.rpm

HTML Tidy RPM spec file:

http://steamedpenguin.f2o.org/goodies/SPECS/tidy-20030108.spec

The source RPM should be easy to rebuild for Red Hat Linux 7.3, if there
is interest I would be happy to do that.

I will try to keep up with releasing a new RPM for tidy every month or
so, but if there are particular releases that I should be packaging
mention it here or email me.
