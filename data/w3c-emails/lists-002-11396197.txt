I recently upgrade my installation to the latest version of Tidy (I use the
Cygwin platform for which Tidy compiles OOTB).

I've found that:

(1) The blank lines that used to be inserted to make the markup more
readable before <hN> tags,  <p>, <tr> etc aren't any more.

(2) <td>&nbsp;</td> is converted to <td> </td>

Is there a configuration option that affects the insertion of blank lines
for the former? The latter I consider to be a bug.  It certainly causes me
pain because I can't then feed it into htmldoc
(http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc/ - I had to use a <td><font
color="white">-</font></td>, not pretty at all).

Tidy has served me well for years until these recent changes.  I'd like to
be able to point out exactly where the changes came in, but there doesn't
seem to be a change log maintained.

Phil
