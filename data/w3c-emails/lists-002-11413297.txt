Can't argue with that logic.  Ideally I'd like it as a config option, since
when I'm creating a web site I want minimalist and when I'm writing a
document I like whitespace - but then there's the danger of too many
options.

Is there a change log somewhere that I've missed? At least then awkward folk
like me could decide whether or not they want to upgrade based on the
features/fixes.

Done, testcase included. I wasn't sure whether it was a parser issue or a
pretty printer one - I couldn't spot anything obvious in pprint.c, but then
again I didn't have very long to spend on it.

Cheers,
Phil
