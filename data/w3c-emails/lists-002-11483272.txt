How do I get HTML Tidy to stop changing web addresses (URI/URL)?

Fix-URI does not work:
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#fix-uri

It is NEVER correct to change a web address. That's because a web site 
designer can use any string of characters to express a method of 
accessing a database, for example. I agree they shouldn't use weird 
URIs, but they do, and Tidy ruins them, so that links become non-functional.

This was discussed before. It was apparently decided that there was no 
problem:

I'm using the Windows HTML-Tidy binary:
