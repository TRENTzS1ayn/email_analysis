The Microsoft Word 2000 clean up options drop marked sections, we
already have a DropSections(...) that should be able to do it or could
easily be updated to consider additional sections, but Tidy will AFAIR
call it only if the document has been identified as beeing Word output.
We could add an option to drop them independently. You should add an
enhancement request to the feature tracker on
<http://sf.net/projects/tidy>.

Replace <! with &lt;!.
