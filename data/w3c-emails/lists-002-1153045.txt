I saved a Word 2000 containig only the word "Hello", (with red color) as htm file.
Tidy created a well-formed htm file (using the configuration file),  from the Word 2000 original htm file,
but the color attribute was missing.
Can some parameter in the configuration file fix it ?
Any ideas ?

Thanks

RanZ
