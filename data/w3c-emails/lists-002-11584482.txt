Sun  February 2, 2003 


Dear ,

A successful friend of mine tipped me off on a brand new online 
marketing system that is helping ordinary people earn 
extraordinary incomes in just months.

I've checked it out myself now and am totally blown away by 
what they're doing. 

Right now, you can position yourself for FREE, like I did, 
and benefit from the efforts of an entire team that is literally 
willing to build you a business before you are asked to spend 
even one red cent.

Best of all, from what I can tell, it can be done on a part-
time basis. Once I have even more first-hand knowledge over 
the next couple of days, I'll get back in touch with you.

But if it's anything like what happened to me, you'll begin 
seeing immediate results.

Thanks for your consideration!!

Sincerely,

Denis Brinson

P.S. Please contact me if you have questions.
