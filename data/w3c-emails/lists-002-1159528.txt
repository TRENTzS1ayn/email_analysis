 During editing I decided to insert a blank line after certain close tags
and also delete excess blank lines.  After running Tidy the insertions and
deletions were ignored.  I finally copied Output to Editor and edited the
blank rows, saving from there.  Looked in Preferences but could not see any
switches.  Is it possible to reflect blank row changes in the Output ?
Otherwise really impressed
