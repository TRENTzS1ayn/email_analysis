My point was that the markup in question is not invalid XML. or rather,
that Tidy has no way of knowing that. Given that Tidy offers the option of
translating HTML into XML, which I'm sure is the reason many people use
this tool nowadays, "fixing invalid markup" does not mean, or should not
mean IMO, the same as "making markup compliant with *some* version of
HTML". Naturally, if what you're saying is the Dev Team's point of view
then I have no other way but to accept it. However, not relocating markup
in HTML->XML translation still seems a plausible config option to me.

Thanks for your time,

   Piotr
