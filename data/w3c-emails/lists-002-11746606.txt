I highly recomend a tool called "Search and Rreplace" by Funduc 
software.  You could easily write a script that would grab all the 
text between ">" and "<".  you could further customize it to suit 
your needs.  I have successfully used to to strip out all the Word XP 
proprietary tags and such, while leaving the text formatting like 
bold and italics.

here is a link to the company's site:
