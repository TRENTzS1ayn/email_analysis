Hey Charles, I'm sure you hear allot of complaining, always remember, this program kicks some serious ass and I use it everyday. It's fantastic...

I think I'm the only developer who doesn't like indenting..<G>

So:

indent:auto
indent-spaces:0
indent-attributes:no

Works well, no indenting and still have the empty lines, perfect...


One question tho, when new version of tidy are built, is there ever an announcement that new entries in the config file are needed? Such as indent-attributes, hadn't seen that one before...

There are three settings for --indent: yes, no and auto.

For yes and no, Tidy does not print any empty lines.  For auto, it still 
prints an empty line between  many block elements, but not as many as it 
used to.  We complaints no matter what we do ... <grin>.

-i is equivalent to --ident yes

See http://tidy.sf.net/docs/quickref.html#indent

take it easy,
Charlie
