Kind of you to say.  Of course, complainers play a vital role.  How else 
would anything happen in software?

I think there are many like yourself, so this is helpful.  Btw, 
indent-attributes is off by default.

I am getting the message from various folks that the Tidy development team 
needs to do a better job of communicating with the user community.

A change log would be a good start.  Does anyone know of a script to build

assistance.

take it easy,
