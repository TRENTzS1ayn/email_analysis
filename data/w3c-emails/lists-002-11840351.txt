Hi
I need to add a Node to Html dom tree,

The node can be an input element or a script to the form ,
how can i do this,
please help me

more clearly i need to create a node say <input type = text value = 
"renjith">  after form element.
So a new Text input  is inserted to the form.

I am pretty sure that this can be done.
Because this is how html is parsed and created a DOM tree
  but i couldnt catch the functions that creates a node from reading "< 
input " etc....



Renjith.
