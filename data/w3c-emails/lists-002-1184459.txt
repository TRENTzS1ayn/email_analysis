Subject: Minor Patch to tidy

Hello.

Running "tidy -show-config" would core-dump on my Solaris 8 Sparc when
printing the current slide-type.  I've attached a patch for config.c
which makes sure that if there is a null pointer for any "Name" it is
converted to a pointer to an empty string.

Perhaps instead tidy_out should check to make sure a string isn't a
null pointer, but this was the easiest for me to quickly fix.

Thanks.
