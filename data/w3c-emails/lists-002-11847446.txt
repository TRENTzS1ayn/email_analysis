That function is usefull for me ,
I have set the value of an attribute of the node by NOT using public 
interfaces.

How can i set the value of a node ?

Note that even though public functions are not available i have set value 
to attribute of a node by following way ,
how can i apply this technique for our problem ?
Which structures which member variable should be updated ?

AttVal *controlVal;
controlVal = GetAttrByName(child, "value");
controlVal->value = "renjith";


Renjith.
