Is anyone aware of a publicly available program that uses the MSHTML API to convert an HTML file into XHTML? If it is performant, I think this would be a great alternative to Tidy.

If one assumes that the ultimate version of Tidy is one where it can parse pages in as fault-tolerant a manner as the popular browsers such as IE, then wouldn't it make sense to actually utilize the DOM exposed by the browser itself in order to create the XHTML?

A script-based version of this is at:

Obviously this would be way too slow in a production environment, but via C++ and MSHTML probably not.

Even if Tidy were as fault-tolerant as IE, that wouldn't mean that its interpretations of coding errors would be the same. It seems a difficult task to try to second guess the popular browsers, so why not use the browser itself?
