Ok,

New RPMs are available for Red Hat Linux users, although recompiling
should be straightforward for other RPM-based distros.

These RPMs are of the February 3 2003 sources.

The man page also works and there were no compile time issues.

Get the goods at: http://rpm.redconcepts.net/

or

Feedback can be sent to rpm (at) redconcepts (dot) net

Yours
