Hello,

You can try if you want with the Mozilla Parser (the gecko engine). I 
use the XPFE of mozilla platform and it parses the HTML and creates the 
DOM structure as expected.

After parsing the previous example (bad html) it creates the following DOM:

<HTML>
    <HEAD/>
    <BODY>
        <P>
            1
            <EM>2
                  <STRONG>3</STRONG>
            </EM>  
            <STRONG>4</STRONG>
        5
        </P>
        <P>6</P>
 </BODY>
</HTML>

I realy use it from some time now to create XML from HTML (to make it valid)

Regards Nikolay
