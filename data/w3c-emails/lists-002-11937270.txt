Hi Renjith,

Sorry to be a drag, but you are better off discussing the internal APIs on 
the developer list.  Also, please be aware that the internal APIs are not 
supported.  Meaning there is just a few of us working on the project and we 
split our time between actual development work and helping folks like yourself.

That said, the short answer about how to update nodes would be to look at 
ParseSelect() in parser.c.  The other things to keep in mind are that 
_text_ _node_ contents (hint #1) are kept in the Lexer buffer (hint #2).

Try this: fire up an un-modified tidylib and have it parse some markup with 
a SELECT element.  Have a look at the tree structure produced and what text 
is individually allocated (e.g. w/ tmbstrdup) or kept in the Lexer buffer.

hth,
Charlie
