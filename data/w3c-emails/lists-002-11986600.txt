Hello,

I'm curious if there is anyway to use a style sheet that has been
specified with the <ling href="blah.css". Is it also possible to update
the included style sheet over adding it inline?  If it doesn't exist
already is there any plans to implement this in the future?  Any help
with this would be appreciated.

Regards,

Nathan
