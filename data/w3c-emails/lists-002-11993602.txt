To All Who Can Help,

I have been using HTML Tidy in TopStyle Pro 3 for some time now. I
haven't been able to discover a way to keep </TD> tags on the same line
as the last line of content. IE doesn't like it, apparently, when </TD>
tags occupy their own line and it messes up the table slightly. Is there
a way I can add my own code to prevent this? Or is there an option I
missed?

Thanks,

Trip
