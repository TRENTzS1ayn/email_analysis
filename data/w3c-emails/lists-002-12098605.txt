When running HTMLTidy from NoteTab Pro, I get the following error:


Error: Can't open ""C:\TIDY\config.cfg""

Info: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
Info: Document content looks like HTML 4.01
0 warnings, 1 error were found!

This document has errors that must be fixed before
using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version.

To learn more about HTML Tidy see http://tidy.sourceforge.net
Please send bug reports to html-tidy@w3.org
HTML and CSS specifications are available from http://www.w3.org/
Lobby your company to join W3C, see http://www.w3.org/Consortium


Coming from a programming background, my gut feeling is that the nested 
double quotes are probably gumming up the works.  At any rate, the necessary 
config file is where it's supposed to be, and it's not read-only.  Any 
suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Steve
