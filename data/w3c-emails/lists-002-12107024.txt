hi everybody

is this is a really stupid question please bear with me
i just started checking out the new XHTML and HTML standards
anf found out the <embed> has been deprecated

now my problem is that Flash MX generates HTML code containing the
<embed>-tag
so  I stripped the code, and made it XHTML-valid.

but now netscape doesn't load the Flash-object, although I have the latest
Netscpae and latest plugins installed (both shockwave and flash)

here's the object-code


<object classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"
codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.c
ab#version=6,0,0,0\"
width=\"$width\" height=\"$height\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\">
 <param name=\"movie\" value=\"$movie\" />
 <param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\" />
 <param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#$bgcolor\" />

<h1>You don't have the ShockWave Flash-plugin installed.</h1>
<a
href=\"http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Versio
n=ShockwaveFlash\">
Please click here to download it.</a>

</object>

please mail me any suggestions as to why this isn't working in netscape and
how to make it work

grace
