Tidy does warn about changes it makes to the document structure, e.g.
adding missing tags.

The output may be different even when the structure of the document is
unchanged, and no entities have been converted -- in essence, tidy
parses the document, builds an internal tree representation of the
document and serializes the internal tree as HTML.  There is no single
"canonical" form for an HTML document, so even when no errors or
warnings are reported you should always expect the output to look
different from the input.
