Hi Vladimir,

Yes, the behavior of the -i command line option was changed to match its 
historical behavior, namely --indent yes. For details, 
see  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=2512745.

To get the prior output, use this:

--indent auto

See http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#indent

Note, --indent yes (and, therefore, -i) is deprecated because the liberties 
it takes with whitespace are known to cause layout problems in browsers.

hth,
Charlie
