WEDELMUSIC-2003 aims to explore these major topics in music-related
fields, to address novel approaches for distributing music to
larger audiences, providing wider access and encouraging broader
participation.  Legal aspects and the impact of these developments
on cultural heritage will be considered, together with their
availability to people with limited access to classical archives
and libraries. In particular, proposals and solutions benefiting
visually-impaired people are encouraged, to let everybody access
this large and hidden cultural heritage. Tools for disabled people
will contribute to broadening their music playing and enjoyment.

The conference focuses on both the challenges posed by the Internet in
its role as a major player for business changes and music
distribution, as well as opportunities as a new infrastructure for
enabling technology. In addition, this conference seeks to promote
discussion and interaction between researchers, practitioners,
developers and users of tools, technology transfer experts, and
project managers. Of particular interest is the exchange of concepts,
prototypes, research ideas, and other results which could both
contribute to the academic arena and also benefit business and the
industrial community. WEDELMUSIC-2003 will bring together a variety
of participants to address not only different technical issues, but
also the impact of Internet on the preservation of cultural heritage.


Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to, the following
aspects:
 * Protection formats and tools for music
 * Transaction models for delivering music
 * Business models for publishers
 * Legal aspects
 * Copyright ownership protection
 * Watermarking techniques for various media types
 * Formats and models for distribution
 * High quality Audio Coding
 * Music manipulation and analysis
 * Music and tools for impaired people - Braille
 * Publishers and distributors servers
 * Multimedia streaming and delivery
 * MPEG-7 and MPEG-21
 * Viewing and listening tools for music
 * Music editing and manipulation
 * Music education techniques
 * Databases for institutions: publishers, libraries, theatres, etc.
 * Content based retrieval
 * Conversion aspects, techniques and tools
 * Music imaging, music sheet digitalisation, techniques and tools
 * Music and pervasive computing
 * Music transcoding
 * Music and cultural heritage valorisation
