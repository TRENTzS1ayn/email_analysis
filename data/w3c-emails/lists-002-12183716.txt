David - I had the exact same problem, and I could not get any filter 
(not even Microsoft's own word filter) to remove those tags or the 
smart tags that M$ thorws in there.

My final solution was to use Funduc Software's  Search and replace 
tool:
http://www.funduc.com/search_replace.htm

The app is VERY useful and by using regular expressions (which can be 
learned via the the apps documentation, which is very good), i 
constructed a .bat file that automatically runs the Search and 
Replace app and removes all of the offensive word2002 formatting and 
other problems. 

let me know if you get the app and I will share my script file with 
you.

peace,
dude
