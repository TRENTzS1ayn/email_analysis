Thanks for the feedback guys.  What I have been doing is using Tidy to
remove the unwanted HTML garbage then using search and replace in
notepad to remove the namespace tags (<o:p></o:p>).  This seems to work
fine, but I was hoping Tidy would pull off that removal.  Anyhow, thanks
again for the help and good luck!

David

I found that if you remove the namespace tag <o:p> and </o:p> magically
disappear, but without removing it, they keep coming back even after
being
removed with a regualr expression. This was probably caused by MSHTML in
my
case.
