I find it easiest to run Tidy from *inside* a text based editor. NoteTab has a
command 'Tidy HTML code' that calls the tidy program. See
http://www.notetab.com/
This is easy to setup.

There's also a standalone user interface for Tidy, see
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/ablavier/TidyGUI/


If you don't want this, you can run Tidy from the command line. Press the start
button, choose 'Run', enter the command. Depending on your file locations,
something like this:
  c:\tidy\tidy.exe -config config.txt c:\to_be_tidied.html > c:\tidied.html
... were config.txt contains the config options, and is located in the C:\tidy\ 
directory.

I can send you a complete config.txt file off-list, were all options are 
explained on
separate comment lines.

If you want the file to overwrite the original (think about backups in that
case...) use this command:
  c:\tidy\tidy.exe -config config.txt -m c:\to_be_tidied.html

... or set the switch
  write-back: yes
in the config.txt, then you don't need the -m parameter in the command line.
