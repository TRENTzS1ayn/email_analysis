Thanks for your reply!

Yes, this improves things, but not completely fixes them. For example,
there's no newline after </pre> element. 

So the question remains: is it always possible to get behaviour of the 
previous tidy version by tweaking options and where do I learn what 
options must be tweaked. 

I would like to always use up-to-date tidy version to catch problems,
but OTOH, if each version changes formatting, it's not that usable to
minimizing differences between versions of HTML document stored in
CVS, which is the primary use for me.
