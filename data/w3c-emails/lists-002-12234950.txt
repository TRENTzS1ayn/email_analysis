No, there is no 4th indenting option.  In fact, the new "auto" mode fixes a 
number of problems with the previous version.  Not problems with 
compliance, but things that could make visual changes in browsers.  Also, 
we received a steady stream of complaints about too many blank lines.

An excellent idea which, unfortunately, will not work this 
time.  You  could continue to use Tidy, but will incur a one-time monster diff.

Just thinking out loud here but, for this use, I'd suggest --indent 
no.  You could use --indent auto before you work on it and --indent no 
before you check it in.

take it easy,
