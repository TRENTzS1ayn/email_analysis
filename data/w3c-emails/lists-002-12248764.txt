Hi all,

I am new to the list, so apoligies if this has been dealt with before.
I did search the archives but couldn't find anything.

I have a situation where double spaces in a URL are being converted to a
single space.  If I have fix-uri on, then it gets converted to a single
%20.  No other options appear to make any difference at all.

I am using TidyATL 1.0.0.1 and can reproduce this using TidyUI.  

Example:

<img src="/images/photo  one.jpg"/>

Becomes either

<img src="/images/photo one.jpg"/>
Or
<img src="/images/photo%20one.jpg"/>

In both cases the link is now broken.  It appears to have exactly the
same issue with <a> tags.

Any advice appreciated.

Thanks
Ben
