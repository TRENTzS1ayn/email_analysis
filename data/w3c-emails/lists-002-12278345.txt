I am trying to use the latest COM\ATL wrapper in ASP.  I have registered the
DLL and are trying to create the object...


set tdy = server.CreateObject("TidyATL.TidyDocument")


and are getting the following error?

Server object, ASP 0177 (0x800401F3) Invalid ProgID.

Is this the correct syntax for creating the object?  Also is there any
documentation for the methods, properties exposed if they are different to
the original august 2000 version. 

Please - any suggestions...
