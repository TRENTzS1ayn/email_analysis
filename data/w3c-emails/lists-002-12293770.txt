Hi Ben,

I think you will find it difficult to maintain double spaces anywhere with 
Tidy as the parser condenses whitespace up front.

No matter, Fred is right.  Just use %20 for each space within a URL.

IE has always done this for you automatically.  It is only recently that 
Netscape and Opera started escaping URLs before a GET.  Not sure about 
Konqueror.

take it easy,
Charlie
