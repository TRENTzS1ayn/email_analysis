I don't know if you have seen it, but TidyUI is a great way of visually
playing with the tidy settings and instantly seeing the results.  Great
for troubleshooting layout issues like this one.  It even has a link to
the tidy docs for each setting.

(Nice work Charlie)

Hi everybody

This is the first time i have use tidy, and i found it very very
usefull, it is an amazing HTML utility.

This is my original code:

<TABLE border="0" width="100%" height="70" cellspacing="0"
cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#E4E4E4">
            <TR>
                <TD height="21" bgcolor="#C0C0C0"></TD>
            </TR> 

This code was generated by Tidy

<HTML>
<HEAD>
    <TITLE></TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
    <TABLE border="0"
           width="100%"
           height="70"
           cellspacing="0"
           cellpadding="0"
           bgcolor="#E4E4E4">
        <TR>
            <TD height="21"
                bgcolor="#C0C0C0"></TD>
        </TR>
    </TABLE>
</BODY>
</HTML>

and it is very nice, however i want the code to look like this 

<TABLE border="0" width="100%" height="70" cellspacing="0"
cellpadding="0" bgcolor="#E4E4E4">

instead of:
    <TABLE border="0"
           width="100%"
           height="70"
           cellspacing="0"
           cellpadding="0"
           bgcolor="#E4E4E4">

and
<TD height="21" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">

instead of
<TD height="21"
                bgcolor="#C0C0C0">

wat do i need to configure?

thanks in advance
