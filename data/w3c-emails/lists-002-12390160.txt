First, this may be more a NoteTab problem than a Tidy problem, so you might
get better answers in the NoteTab mailing list at

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/notetab/

NoteTab expects the config file to be "Tidy.cfg" in the NoteTab Pro
directory.  Where it's picking up that ""C:\TIDY\config.cfg"" from is beyond
me -- have you by some chance set an environment variable (i.e., HTML_TIDY)
that overrides the default?  If so, I would either remove that variable
altogether and use the default location and name, or remove the extra double
quotes around the path name.
