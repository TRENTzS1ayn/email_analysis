Hi Dan,

Thanks much for chasing down the particulars.  Should be easy to fix now.

I am quite sure that this is a different bug than 
http://tidy.sf.net/bug/560380.  The old bug was on the Tidy Classic code 
and was verified to be fixed in TidyLib.  Also the conditions are a bit 
different.  Can you re-close that bug an open a new one?

take it easy,
Charlie
