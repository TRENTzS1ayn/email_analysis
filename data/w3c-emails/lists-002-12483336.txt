i am not positive that the "lang" attribute is part of the HTML 4.0 
specification or not.  I do not use that attribute, so I am not 
really familiar with the issue.

however, I am very familiar with useing MS Word's "save as html" 
feature and find the proprietary HTML that M$ uses to be annoying and 
frustrating.  What's worse is WordXP, which has now introduced 'smart 
tags" which clutter up and litter each document with vast quantities 
of unneeded proprietary XML markup for all sorts of idiotic things.  
It would be nice if M$ could truly make the tags "smart" by allowing 
them to be turned off so that those of us who do not like them can 
opt out of their brand of HMTL.  

Its truly rediculous.  Once you remove the proprietary HTML, the 
document size is reduced by 5-10 fold.

peace,
dude
