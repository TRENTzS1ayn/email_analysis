Hi Julian,

My experience has been with a company that wanted their writers to use MS
Word to author their documents. I wrote a tool for them to export the Word
.doc files to HTML.

I wrote an application that did these basic steps.

1. Allows the user to select a folder.
2. App identifies all the appropriate .doc files in that folder.
Loop through each document doing the following.
3. Open the document and make some adjustments so it will export corectly,
then export it as HTML.  Then close the document.
4. Run some custom cleanup on the document to prepare it to go through HTML
Tidy.
5. Run Microsofts "Filter" application on the file with some specific
switches active to further prepare the document for HTML Tidy.
6. Run the html through HTML TIDY with the configuration file set up to
output XHTML.
7. Do some more custom cleanup on the XHTML output.
8. Transform the XHTML using XSLT.  I used the Saxon parser because it is
more powerful the Microsofts built in MSXML.dll

Things I learned along the way are...
- MS Word is evil (actually I allready knew this, now it is firmly seated in
my brain).
- HTML Tidy and Saxon are wonderful tools.
- There are tools out there that attempt to export Word documents to HTML
but I couldn't use them because I needed more customization than they
provided and I suspect that many people will have the same problbems I did
- Even though I created a tool to export the documents, it was still
imperative for the writers to strictly use the correct styles and formatting
in their Word Doc's in order to get the desired results.
- C# and .net are cool.  But for my app, I didn't find a need for it.  So
much of it was just calling other proccess's.  I decided to keep it simple
and able to run on any Windows computer instead of requiring that the
computer had the .net framework installed.

Hope that helps. If you have specific questions feel free to ask.

Fred
