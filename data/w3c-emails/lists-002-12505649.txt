Hi Julian,

Writing your own app is a good idea.  I did a batch Word converter in VB 
one time using Andre Blavier's old TidyCOM.   Worked well.

I did TidyUI using C++ and MFC which, with careful linking, keeps the 
result relatively small, fast and free of dependencies.  But for quick 
scripts at work, I'd recommend either VB or Perl, depending on your 
skill/preference.

take it easy,
Charlie
