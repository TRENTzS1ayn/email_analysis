I noticed when using TidyCOM that cleaning a string (TidyMemToMem) with
the "word-2000" option that much of the word generated class attributes
and span tags are left in the tidied HTML.  Tidying an external file
with TidyToMem produces perfectly tidied HTML.  Comparing two exact
sources, one as a string and one as an external file, yield the
following results:

 

ORIGINAL SOURCE:

<p class=MsoNormal>This is stuff that gets <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>put

in by word</u></b></p>

 

TidyToMem OUTPUT:

<p>This is stuff that gets <b><u>put in by word</u></b></p>

 

TidyMemToMem OUTPUT::

<p class="MsoNormal">This is stuff that gets <b class='c412'><u>put in
by word</u></b></p>

 

Anyone know why this happens?   Why is a class attribute generated under
the bold tag where there never was one?

 

Thanks!
