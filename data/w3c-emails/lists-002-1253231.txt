No, afraid not. There is a message on the TidyCom web site saying he's
no longer able to maintain TidyCom and asking if anyone would like to
continue his work. --I wish I had the time!

I have written a method to provide me with just the body of some html.
It's in C# and you're welcome to a copy, but if you're capable of using
TidyCom then I am sure you are capable of writing this small bit of code
too.

Let me know if you hear of anyone taking over TidyCom please.

Andr? -- Many thanks for TidyCom, it's really useful to me.
