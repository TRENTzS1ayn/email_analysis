It's easy enough to find out, in all conscience.

<!ENTITY % LanguageCode "NAME"
    -- a language code, as per [RFC1766]
    -->
<!ENTITY % i18n
 "lang        %LanguageCode; #IMPLIED  -- language code --
  dir         (ltr|rtl)      #IMPLIED  -- direction for weak/neutral text --"

Practically every element type in HTML 4.01 that can contain text
has 'lang' and 'dir' attributes.  (Some characters in Unicode are
inherently left-to-right, others inherently right-to-left, and some
don't specify a direction but adapt to it.  The comment on 'dir'
suggests that it doesn't override inherent direction, but supplies
context for charcaters that need it.)

Why would Tidy ever remove a legal attribute if not told explicitly to do so?
