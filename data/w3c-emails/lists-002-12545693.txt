Hi Fred,

Thanks for the feedback.

I've already had to convert 12,000 word docs that didn't use any set 
stylesheets and know what a pain it is.

I found a reasonable one, with a lot of options that is also available as a 
dll which I am toying around with using until I get the time to do my own.

I'm going for C# mainly because it is what I know.  I know the framework side 
of things is a pain, so may consider an alternative if there is enough 
interest.
