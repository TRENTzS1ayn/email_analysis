Certainly from my point of view, once the data is in the CMS all the on going 
maintenance is via the CMS that uses eWebEditPro for the editing, which is 
pretty good and has some reasonable paste from word capabilities.

I considered that, but when processing existing html page I also need to pick 
up page titles and META tags so will use some regular expressions to extract 
those and the main body html.
