Whilst I am trying to clean up a some files, a couple of questions have 
arisen.

1. How can I use the Win32 version to clean a batch of files in a 
directory and sub directories, I cannot find any info on the command 
line instructions anywhere.

2. Is there a tidy setting to strip out blank lines?  If there isn't 
one what do I need to do to put this on the wish list?


I know I can deal with the above when I get around to writing my own 
tidylib wrapper, but my priority at the moment is to tidy up this 
current load of documents.

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,
