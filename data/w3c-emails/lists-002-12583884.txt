Hi Charles,

> RTFM.  There is scads of docs on the command line tool on the project 
> page.  See

OK when I first looked, all I found were docs on the using the API.

I have now found the right docs, but have hit a couple of problems.

I have created a config file (with the help of your UI) as follows:-

indent-spaces: 0
wrap: 0
write-back: yes
indent: auto
output-html: yes
logical-emphasis: yes
drop-proprietary-attributes: yes
drop-font-tags: yes
wrap-sections: no
wrap-asp: no
wrap-jste: no
wrap-php: no
enclose-text: yes
enclose-block-text: yes
word-2000: yes
tidy-mark: no

I ran several test using your UI and it was doing roughly what I wanted, 
however I then tried running the latest win32 build using the following 
command line:-

c:\tools\tidy\tidy.exe -config c:\tools\tidy\InitialCleanUp.tidy -m 
filename.htm -f errs.txt

and it produced an error..

Fatal Error:
Panic - tree has lost it's integrity

Also, now your UI no longer works.

Any ideas why this would have happened.

Also a pointer towards doing a batch convert would be appreciated.


Thanks for all the help so far.
