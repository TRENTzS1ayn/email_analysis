One of my colleagues is using tidy under cygwin:
Package cygwin tidy-030201-1.tar.bz2 from mirror site:
ftp://ftp.mirror.ac.uk/

As he needed some help, he typed tidy -h and got:

tidy [option...] [file...] [option...] [file...]
Utility to clean up and pretty print HTML/XHTML/XML
see http://tidy.sourgeforge.net/

Options for HTML Tidy for Cygwin released on 1st February 2003:
.../...

That's fine. When he copied-pasted the URL, he arrived at
http://tidy.sourgeforge.net/
If you try this, you wil probably be surprised.

I guess that the authors of this site tried to hijack the tidy page.
Could it be possible to correct the output of tidy -v, in order to have
a correct URL?
