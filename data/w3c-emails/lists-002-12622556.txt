OK, now I know what you are talking about, I was getting a bit lost there.

I have cobbled together a batch file as follows:-

FOR /R %%a IN (*.htm) do c:\tools\tidy\tidy.exe -config c:
\tools\tidy\InitialCleanUp.tidy -m "%%a" -f errs.txt

This cleans one document and then seems to stop.

Any ideas?
