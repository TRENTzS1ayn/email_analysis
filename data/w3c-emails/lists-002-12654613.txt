OK, i have now managed to resolve my problems with the batch files and 
have started processing my documents.

The latest problem I have now is that Tidy keeps on hanging on a 
particular document.

The only obvious problem I can see is that there are 4 </font> tags in 
a row a few lines after the last warning.

I have tried running the page through TidyUI, but that fails.

Cheers,
