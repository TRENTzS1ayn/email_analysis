Hi Dave,

I've noted some ambiguity with respect to the disposition of HTML Tidy on 
SF. I can't find any copyright notice in:
  http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/tidy/
and on: 
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidy
it does not state the owner, and mistakenly (?) states MIT License.

The SF FAQ states that the author of the materials is the owner [1] and one 
should avoid the misconception that, "software does not actually have a 
license holder, because of its free nature."

[1] http://gro.clinux.org/docs/site/faq.php#whohost-owns

If the software, or some part, is owned by the W3C, it should have a 
document describing the ownership, for example:
  http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software-short-notice
  http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software
and the SF project should be tweaked to reflect the W3C Software License is 
the operative license.
  http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=320

(If this is not the case, again, it would be useful to have a document 
making this clear.)
