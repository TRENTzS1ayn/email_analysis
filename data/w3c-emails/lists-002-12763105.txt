Hi -

I've got a problem with MacTidy that I hope you can help with. - I
apologize for sending you such a wordy email about it!

I'm the webmaster for the Borough of Swarthmore PA.   I use Netscape
Communicator 4.78 on a Power Mac.  I've been creating and updating pages
for our website by working with Word text files, putting in HTML coding
by hand.  But now it looks like I'm going to have to cope with Microsoft
Word-created HTML files, heaven help me!

My first such file arrived the other day.  I managed to get it up on the
website in fairly decent shape, but it's full of coding that I'd love to
get rid of so that I know what I'm doing when I have to revise it.

By Googling around, I discovered HTML Tidy, and downloaded MacTidy
1.0b13.  But when I tried to clean up my file, I got the following message:

This document has errors that must be fixed before using HTML Tidy to
generate a tidied up version.

It didn't tell me what errors needed fixing,let alone how to fix them.


With more Googling, I found the HTML Tidy discussion list
(html-tidy@w3.org), which had several postings about this, one of which
took me to

http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#force-output - This said:


force-output:
Type: Boolean
        Default: no
        Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0
        This option specifies if Tidy should produce output even if
errors are encountered. Use this option with care - if Tidy reports an
error, this means Tidy was not able to, or is not sure how to, fix the
error, so the resulting output may not        reflect your intention. 


However, I couldn't find any way in MacTidy to use this (or any other)
configuration option, so I need your help.

Is it possible to use configuration options with MacTidy? And if so, how
do I go about using the force-output option ?  If I can't use this, then
how do I figure out which errors need fixing so I can get rid of them by
hand before trying MacTidy again?

Any help you can offer will be very much appreciated!

P.S.:  I'm also sending this email to  html-tidy@w3.org  because
there've been other postings there about this problem.
