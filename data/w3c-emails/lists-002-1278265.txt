in using "Tidy to convert html file to xml file"
"the <FONT> tag and <NOBR> tag" are missing from the result.

And so they should be.
<nobr> is not in http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd
(XHTML 1.0 transitional) and for that matter wasn't in HTML 3.2, HTML 4.0x
transitional, or HTML 4.0x strict either.

<font> is not in http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd
(XHTML 1.0 strict), although it _is_ in XHTML 1.0 transitional; it was
in HTML 3.2 and HTML 4.0x transitional, but not in HTML 4.0x strict.

In short, if you are converting to XHTML, you really really WANT Tidy
to eliminate the <font> and <nobr> tags.
