Sorry about the confusion, but the split option is no longer supported.  It 
just didn't fit into the TidyLib I/O model and it needs to be removed.

I would recommend using XSLT.  Most implementations (not MSXML, however) 
have an extension that allows producing multiple output files from a single 
transformation.  Also, XSLT will give you much more flexibility on how you 
break up your docs (Tidy was fixed on H2 elements) and the format of the 
output - especially slide navigation.

Your worst case is a transformation that produces a script that executes N 
transformations: one for each output file given an XPath expression to the 
starting element.

Alternatively, you could use the 04Aug2000 version of Tidy, which is still 
available on the project page.

take it easy,
Charlie
