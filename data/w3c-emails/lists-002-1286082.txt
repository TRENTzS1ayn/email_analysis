Tidy not telling me that it changed > into &gt; means that I have no

So, neatening the blanks, wrapping, etc. is fine and I don't need to
be told about that.  However, let's say the postman is so nice that he
corrects addressing mistakes and adds extra stamps needed for my
letters, but is too courteous to tell me.  I want to be told!  Add an
option!
