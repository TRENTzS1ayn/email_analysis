There is another reason for a tidy comment to be helpfull here: Often
the string <br or p> were meant to be html tags but a typo occured. A
similar thing can be said for entities where &amp is transformed to
&amp;amp ... Here, a tidy comment could be usefull. For me I would like
to have an option which I can switch on that tells me when tidy
parses entities in one coding but prints them out in a second coding.
