The following document tests the recurrent nested tags parsing.
When I tried to parse it whith JTidy (04aug2000r6) an StackOverFlowError occurred, exiting the process with code 128.
I tried with differents stack sizes with the -Xss non-standar option of the java Interpreter.
I am using :
 java version "1.3.1_02"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.3.1_02-b02)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.3.1_02-b02, mixed mode) 

And OS Windows 2000.

With 400K of stack, 3560 nested tags are supported. Increasing to 500KB they can be supported, but what will it happen when no more stack can be used?.

Has anybody any idea to control Tidy to avoid this stack overflow ? Please, let me know.

Regards,
Carlos .
