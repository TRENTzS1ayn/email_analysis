hi everybody!

i'm currently developing a xml-parser in php, having problems with not
wellformed html/xml. problems i could solve by myself, but with an amount of
time i don't want to lose if there is already a program that can do it for
me.
so my question is: is there a version of html tidy for php implemented or
planned?

thx for support

mac
