Hi all,

I posted this a while ago, but didn't receive any response so here goes
again.

I use tidy to check all my XHTML files.

I encode email address on my page with ASCII codes in the form &#123; This
seems to be a valid way to avoid spambots listing the email addresses.

Tidy doesn't seem to like this encoding and insists on changing my encoding
to chris@xxxxx.net etc.

Can somebody tell me how to change my Tidy config file to make it leave my
encoded addresses alone?

Chris Harris
