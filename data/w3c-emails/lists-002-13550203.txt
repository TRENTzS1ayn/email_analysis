Hello,

I have been using the tidy tool for about two months now, and I have
stumbled across a behavior that I do not understand.  

In the case of the following markup:

             <td bgcolor="#000000" colspan=4><p class="centBoldWhite"><i>
Some Text</i></p></td>

tidy generates this:

             <td bgcolor="#000000" colspan="4">
                <p class="centBoldWhite_c1">Some Text</p>
             </td>

Please note the "_c1" which has been appended to the existing class name
"centBoldWhite".  This refers to a new style definition which tidy creates
as follows:

               <style type="text/css">
                  p.c1 {font-style: italic}
               </style>

It appears to me that tidy is trying to append the contents of the new class
"c1" onto the existing class "centBoldWhite".  While this seems like a very
useful thing to be able to do, neither IE nor Netscape wil actually render
the new "centBoldWhite_c1" construct.  

Is this an error, or is the "_" really supposed to join classes?  If an
error, how does one assign multiple classes to an element?  If it is
supposed to work, can you suggest an explanation for why it doesn't work for
me?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,

Glen Browning.
