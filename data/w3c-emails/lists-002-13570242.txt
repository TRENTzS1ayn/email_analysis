It is certainly better to avoid underscores in ID-type attributes, as
they are, according to SGML standards, NAME tokens.
A NAME attribute has the following characteristics :
 Case-insensitive
 Max length : NAMELEN (see in the SGML declaration)
 First character: A..Z
 Subsequent characters: A..Z, 0..9, period, hyphen
So, underscores are *not*allowed* in ID attributes.

class being usually a CDATA, there are no syntactical constraints, be a
bit discipline canb't be a trouble.
