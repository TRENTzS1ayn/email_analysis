Take a look in the archives, I got an answer to this a few months back.

Use one batch file (clean.bat) to run/configure Tidy, like follows:

c:\tools\tidy\tidy.exe -config c:\tools\tidy\InitialCleanUp.tidy -m %1

and then another (startclean.bat) to loop the request like this...

FOR /R c:\serverroot\%1 %%a IN (*.htm*) do c:\tools\tidy\clean.bat "%%a"

I would then 'clean' a site by typing 'startclean.bat siteroot' at a command prompt - with siteroot being the name of the root directory.
