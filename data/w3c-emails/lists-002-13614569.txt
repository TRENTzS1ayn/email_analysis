Has anyone else had problems displaying a web page in Mozilla after
running it through tidy, outputting xhtml? Specifically, there seems to
be a problem loading stylesheets embedded in javascript. The weird thing
is that the stylesheets are loaded without a problem in IE. Any help
would be appreciated. Thanks.
