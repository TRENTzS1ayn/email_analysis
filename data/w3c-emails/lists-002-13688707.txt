AFAIR Mozilla does not support various DOM features if the document is
identified as XHTML document. I suggest you try asking on a mozilla
mailing list / newsgroup / forum / whatever with a sample document that
it doesn't handle as you expect. The problem is most likely more XHTML
related than HTML Tidy related.
