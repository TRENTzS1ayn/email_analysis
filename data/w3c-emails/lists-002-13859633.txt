Hello list,
I'm  currently in a project where I need to convert HTML files into well formed XML to 
extract information from it.
I have been using TidyCOM and the C# wrapper made by Matthew Stanfield. 
Unfortunately, after playing around several times with the configuration file, the tidy 
output file is not a well formed XML.
I have also searched this list archives looking for similar requests and solutions. I 
recall an email sent by Bjoern Hoerhrmann

//The Gnome XML library is able to do so, see http://xmlsoft.org/

In my case I have well formed HTML, my option file looks like this:

add-xml-decl=yes
bare=yes
clean=yes
drop-font-tags=yes
drop-propietary-attributes=yes
indent=auto
indent-spaces=2
wrap=72
markup=yes
output-xml=yes
input-xml=no
show-warnings=yes
numeric-entities=yes
quote-marks=yes
quote-nbsp=yes
quote-ampersand=no
break-before-br=no
uppercase-tags=no
uppercase-attributes=no
smart-indent=no
output-xhtml=yes
char-encoding=latin1
join-styles=yes
word-2000=yes

but I still get several unclosed tags in the output files, like the img  and link tags.
Do I have to use the xmlsoft libraries to accomplish this or Tidy can do the work? If 
so, can anyone tell me what is wrong with my configuration file?

Thanks a lot!

Lizet.
