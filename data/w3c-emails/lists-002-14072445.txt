I recently started using Tidy on the W32 platform. I like it 
tremendously, but found
that, because Tidy lacks a GUI, the useability could be improved. So, I 
wrote this little wrapper
app. I cannot judge if this is useful for other people, but if so, I am 
willing to make it available
for general use. In any case, I am interested in any comments.
