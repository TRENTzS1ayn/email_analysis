Hello,

is there anybody out there, who could help me out with a working mingw
makefile to compile the tidysource with mingw? I've seen the gmake version
in the source but I'm not  comfortable with gnu compilers and can't do the
necessary changes to use it on a windows machine with mingw.

Thnaks a lot

P.S. A working *.dev file for dev++ would be a great alternative of course.
