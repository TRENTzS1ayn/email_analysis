I am NOT saying that converting everything between <pre> and </pre> as if it 
was a CDATA section is desirable but it is the output I get from the current
tidy build.

I would in fact argue that the functionality is a bad idea, however rather than
taking your wish for tidy to behave differently and possibly break another 
user's use of tidy, I would like to (1) understand why the implementation is as
it is now and (2) what the best output for tidy would be.
