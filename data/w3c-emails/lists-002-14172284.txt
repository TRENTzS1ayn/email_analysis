Last time I heard from JTidy developers they were waiting for the C
version of Tidy to make a release to backport it later. Tidy-C however
has not been updated for almost 3 years now, at least we did not make a
stable release, experimental sources and binaries are available from
tidy.sf.net. Note that some people worked on JNI interface for Tidy,
try searching the archives.
