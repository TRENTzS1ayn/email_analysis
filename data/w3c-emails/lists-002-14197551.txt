Hmm. Looks like some joker has subscribed html-tidy@w3.org to this
oddball Yahoo Group[0]. Perhaps the listmom would care to either forge
an unsubscribe message from the list address, or use the form at
<http://add.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/groups/cgi_abuse> to report it and
get the list unsubscribed?

It also sometimes happen's AFTER I've already come out of the 
hypnogogic state, and I'm just lying there awake with my eyes shut. 
Usually He/she/it communicates through vision's, but about 20% of the 
time through word's clearly written on the screen of my mind. I 
believe it's just my own higher self.
