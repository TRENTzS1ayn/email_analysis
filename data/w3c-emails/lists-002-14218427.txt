Hi, 
 
I am trying to use html tidy for my assignment.
However, when i type this in the command prompt
tidy -asxhtml c:\xml\index.htm > c:\xml\output.htm
 
the output.htm is always empty.
 
And i  am trying to clean the original file before converting to XHTML or XML, It does not work.
 
What kind of configuration should i include in my config.txt?
 
I will deeply appreciate it if you could reply me asap.
 
Regards,
Miao Ting
