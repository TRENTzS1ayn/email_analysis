So, we have someone who has HTML fragments that are to be treated
as parts of a <body>, including all comments.

Surely the simple thing is

    (echo "<body>"; cat TheFile; echo "</body>") | tidy

to _tell_ Tidy that the contents of TheFile are supposed to be treated
as part of a body?  No changes to Tidy are required.
