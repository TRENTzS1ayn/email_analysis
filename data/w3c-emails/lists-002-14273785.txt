Hi,

When I use HTML-tidy to clean an html file, all the <table>s contained in
such a file get moved to the end, after the </body> tag.

Example:

<body>
<table summary="sum">
<tr>
<td>col_1
<td>col_2
</table>
<h1>header</h1>
<p>Text
<br>Text
</body>

Would become something like:

<body>
  <h1>header</h1>
  <p>Text
  <br>Text
</body>
<table summary="sum">
  <tr>
    <td>col_1
    <td>col_2
</table>

As you see, my layout gets completely messed up like this. What am I doing
wrong?

I am using a clean installation of HTML-kit, with the HTML-tidy plugin
installed from scratch, with the default options.

If you wish, I can send you a file that doesn't parse correctly when run
through tidy.

By the way, the "bug tracker" links on the Tidy FAQ page on scourceforge
are void: they point to nothing
(http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/faq.html).

I'm not subscribed to the html-tidy@w3.org mailing list: is this necessary
to read the answers to my question? I just clicked on the "mailing list"
link on the above mentioned page. If I need to subscrobe, can someone
please tell me how to do so?

Thanks in advance fior any help,

Boudewijn Waijers (bwaijers at tiscali.nl).
