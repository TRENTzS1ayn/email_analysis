>So, we have someone who has HTML fragments that are to be treated as parts
of a <body>, including all comments.

I have a website with dozens of small files lying around - each containing
fragments of valid HTML which get pulled together in real time by
server-side include technology. As each file often gets messy over time
through much editing, I wish to tidy them. I want Tidy to check the
structure of and format them but without removing any content whatsoever.
The command I am using is below however the first three comments get
stripped. If I should be using another command, please advise. Any help
would be appreciated.

  `tidy --show-body-only yes document.txt` 

----------------------------------------------------
Here is an example of the typical document.txt file:

In reality the file would have a lot more <h?>, <p>
elements.

I only want to tidy exactly what is below!
