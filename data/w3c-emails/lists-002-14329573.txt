The TR is optional in HTML 4, so it shouldn't matter. A long time ago, I 
also found that Tidy messed up tables when you set (as Boudewijn did, or 
HTML-Kit did it for him):

hide-endtags=yes

... and then ran Tidy on HTML code that was already missing the optional 
end-tags. But I can't replicate that in a recent build.
