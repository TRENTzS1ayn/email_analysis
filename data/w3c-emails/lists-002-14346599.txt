All,

I'm trying to use HTML tidy to clean up the HTML output from a
web-based editor. The output needs to be XHTML strict, however despite
the doctype in the content and me setting the doctype in the tidy
configuration file, the resulting output seems to be XHTML
transitional.

Input file: http://development.incutio.com/tim/tidy/input.html
Output file: http://development.incutio.com/tim/tidy/output.html

The output file still contains several tag attributes that don't exist
in XHTML strict (see the validation errors:
<http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fdevelopment.incutio.com%2Ftim%2Ftidy%2Foutput.html>).

This is the contents of the config file I'm using:

tidy-mark: no
wrap: 0
output-xhtml: yes
doctype: "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
quote-marks: yes
enclose-text: yes
write-back: no

Note that the doctype in both the input and output files is given as
XHTML strict.

In the command line output when running tidy I see:

Info: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
Info: Document content looks like XHTML 1.0 Transitional

Does this mean tidy is deciding that the content looks more like XHTML
transitional and is therefore ignoring the doctype I'm telling it to
use? Or is this a bug in tidy itself?

Any help would be appreciated!
