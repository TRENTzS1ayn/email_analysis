Hi, my name is Pat and I just happened across this site today while looking for information on the Atkins Diet.  What a great place this seems to be!!  I am a 61 year old grandmother of four and work full time for a law firm.  I was purchasing clothes in larger and larger sizes and decided it was time to do something about it.  I have tried other diets but could not stay on them or just didn't like them.  I have been on Atkins for six weeks now and have lost 15 lbs.  I can truly say, this is something I will be able to stay on!  It's not a diet, it's a lifestyle change and I love it.  I have arthritis and fibromyalgia and since starting Atkins, the pain has diminished quite a bit.  My doc even said that if I keep going like I am, I may not require total knee replacements, which he said I probably would have had to have done.  I feel good, my attitude has changed and I truly can say Atkins has made me a much happier person.
