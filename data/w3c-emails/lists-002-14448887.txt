Hi everyone,
 
I am fairly new to this list, and fairly new to Atkins.  I tried it
before over a year ago and did well, but then went back to eating carbs
and junk.  Now I am heavier than I have been since I was pregnant.  
 
The two things I am having difficulty with and did before also is nausea
and not wanting to eat.  Does anyone know why I am nauseas? Anyone have
that difficulty?  As nice as it is to not feel hungry, at the same time
I know I have to eat, so I basically have just been forcing myself to
eat.  
 
Thanks to all who post, I have gotten some good ideas from you.
 
Namaste
 
Teresa
