Welcome to the group Mary!  You are not alone.  I started the Atkins diet on July 22nd with 55 lbs. to lose, and I've already lost 15 (40 to go!).  I have never felt better, have more energy, and more self confidence.  I also joined Curves ~ for exercise ~ and love it!  Don't allow anyone to tell you, that you are any less than fantastic!!!  Keep your chin up!  Teresa

  So, why did you sit there and listen to her for 2 hrs?  My husband
  married me this fat, and is glad I have lost almost 16 lbs. But he
  married me for my mind and heart, not my body. I hope your fiancee was
  not present when that was happening, or else I'd be asking myself if
  this is the right one....and if I will have his support in the
  future....
  Just my point of view. I AM on your side, don't let people do that to
  you. Us fat people are just as beautiful as any other, we just have more
  luggage to carry... :-)
  Take care Mary, welcome to the group. You will loose slow but your will
  be able to stick to this diet without cravings...it's the first time for
  me in my life. 5 months, no cheating!!! Stick to it, you will be glad.

  Hello, My name is Mary, I found this group while surfing for 
  information on the Atkins diet. I will be starting the diet Monday 
  (tomorrow). All my life I have been a big girl, continually yo-yo 
  dieting without lasting effect. My weight problem has brought me to a 
  very uncomfortable place within myself. I have become socially 
  withdrawn with very low self esteem. I have lived a life time of 
  teasing, ridicule and being made to feel that just because I was 
  obese I wasn't as good as a "thin" person. I am intelligent and 
  realize this is an inner problem but I just can't live this unhappy 
  anymore.A friend told me about this Atkins Diet and knowing many who 
  have follwed it I decided to give it a try. One day I am hoping that 
  when I look into the mirror instead of seeing eyes full of tears and 
  frustration I will see a happy thinner me. Just the other day I had 
  to sit for two hours and listen to my finacee's friend tell me how 
  disgusting fat people were and that we were all just lazy. I am 
  determined to lose at least 50 pounds and am hoping this diet is the 
  answer. Any suggestions would be much appreciated or advice.
