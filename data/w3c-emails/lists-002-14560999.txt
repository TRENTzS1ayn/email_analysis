Does anybody have this quote? It was Susan B. Anthony. I used it years ago, and it's always been a favorite of mine, but I can't remember it all:

"Cautious, careful people, always casting about to preserve their reputation, can never bring about a reform. Only those who are willng to be . . . [this is where it starts breaking up] everything and nothing in the world's estimation . . ."

Thanks,

Anne Follis
