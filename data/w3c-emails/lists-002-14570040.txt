My wife and I just returned from Cap d'Agde in southern France (a 
three week vacation). We had a negative experience in the only nudist 
hotel in the nudist area and are looking for a different place. We 
want to find a nudist hotel with pool--a hotel where nudism is the 
norm in all places and at all times--and a hotel that is in walking 
distance to a nudist beach. I find hotels (clothing required) not far 
from nudist beaches, nudist beaches, apartments for rent, etc., etc. 
But is it possible to find a hotel, pool, and beach--all nudist and 
in the same place. We are willing to travel anywhere in Europe 
(Croatia, Greece, France, Spain, Italy). Any suggestions? Richard
