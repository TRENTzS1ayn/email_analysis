Hello,

I am using the tsWebEditor, which uses the TidyLib, and I am seeing a
behavior which I don't understand.  The following line of HTML code:

<hr align="left">

gets replaced with

<hr class="c1">

where c1 is defined as

hr.c1 {text-align: left;}

This works fine in IE, but in Netscape, the hr returns to it's default
center alignment.  Apparently, Netscape doesn't recognize the text-align as
applying to anything but text.  Of course, I know of several ways to force
this to do what I want, but what is the "officially recommended" method for
aligning something like this using CSS.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
