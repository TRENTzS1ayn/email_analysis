I have a problem with tidy

after running some xml thru it

This is fine
            <audio src="prompts/null.wav">aa</audio>

This is not fine, I would like not to have a new line here
            <audio src="prompts/welcome.wav">
            </audio>

Here, smarty keeps putting new lines betwin the elemnts
            <audio src="prompts/intro.wav" />

            <audio src="prompts/intro.wav" />

I would like to have something like this, what options I should pass to 
tidy, to get this output, I went thru all the options but I did not find 
anything which could be of help.
            <audio src="prompts/intro.wav" />
            <audio src="prompts/intro.wav" />


My tidy command is
tidy -i -xml -n -wrap 0 --char-encoding raw --indent auto 
--indent-spaces 4 -m

Thanks in advance, please cc me, am not subscribed to this list
