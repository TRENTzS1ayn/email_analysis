Which Netscape are you talking about? If you test with Netscape 4, you 
should not be surprised at anything.

Without a value for 'width' set, I wouldn't expect any visible effect of 
aligning HR. If I also add a width, I can confirm thaat Netscape 7/Mozilla 
does indeed not align the rule (not even in Quirks rendering mode), while 
MSIE 6 and Opera do.

It could be argued that the proper CSS should instead be:

   hr.c1 {margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;}

It depends on whether you see the line that is drawn as inline content of 
the HR element, or more like a collapsed border of the element. Or as 
something that transcend all categories. The style above works in Mozilla, 
but has no effect on MSIE 6 and Opera (even in Standards mode rendering).

So a cross-browser solution would be:

   hr.c1 {margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: left;}


... but I'm not sure if Tidy should be changed in such a way.
