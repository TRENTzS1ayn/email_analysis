Stupid Question
Really Stupid Answer
------------------------------------------------
Our first day at a resort, my wife and I decided to hit 
the beach.  When I went back to our room to get something 
to drink, one of the hotel maids was making our bed.  
I grabbed my cooler and was on my way back out when I 
stopped at the door and asked, 
"Can we drink beer on the beach?"

"Sure," the maid replied, "but I have to finish the rest 
of the rooms first."

FEMALE PRAYER 
------------------------------------------------
Before I lay me down to sleep, 
I pray for a man, who's not a creep. 
One who's handsome, smart and strong, 
One who's loves to listen long. 
One who thinks before he speaks, 
When he says he'll call, he won't wait weeks. 
I pray that he is gainfully employed, 
When I spend his cash, he won't be annoyed. 
Pulls out my chair and opens my door, 
Massages my back and begs to do more. 
Oh! Send me a man who'll make love to my mind, 
Knows what to answer to "How big is my behind?" 
I pray that this man will love me to no end, 
And never attempt to hit on my friend. 
And as I kneel and pray by my bed, 
I look at the creep you sent me instead. 
Amen. 

MALE PRAYER 
I pray for a deaf-mute nymphomaniac with huge boobs 
who owns a liquor store. 
 Amen.
