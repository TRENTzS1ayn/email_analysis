Hi jgpac, I, too,  am in my 60's..soon to be 67 but feel 40's. Like you,  I
have so much energy now, since this way of eating, and my  IBS is gone.
Three years ago, I felt like an old woman, and lo and behold, I outrun my
stepchildren and the grandchildren. I now teach in a Dutch school for
handicapped, and disabled/and abused  children, and love every minute of it.
I have no trouble following the diet, other than I wish I could buy pumpkin
here, as I fell in love with the little pumpkin thingees. I had brought a
can of pumplin from Calif last year, and now it is gone; guess what I'll
bring back in October...more pumpkin. They hit the spot and only 2.5 grams
per muffin.
Thanks to everyone for there comments, and advice. It helps to have someone
to compare and share with, doesn't it?  Barbara in Holland
