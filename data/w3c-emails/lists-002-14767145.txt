  I'm new too.  My husband and I are trying it.  He hasn't weighed himself, but after 5 days I am down 6 pounds.  This weekend is proving tough though.  HELP!!!

  Hello!  I just started the Atkins diet 5 days ago.  I'm finding that
  I 
  really enjoy the diet so far.  Whenever I get hungry for carbs I eat 
  10 green olives, and that seems to satisfy my taste buds. I 
  purchased the banana bread mix and found that it leaves an off 
  taste...does anyone have any solutions for that?  I found the 
  same thing happens with the shake.  I stepped on the scale this 
  morning to discover that I was 5 pounds lighter!  I'm very excited 
  about this!!  I know that it's water weight now, but soon i'll be 
  melting away the fat.  My goal is to lose 35 pounds...only 30 
  more to go...
  One more question...I tried the chat link but it just brought up a 
  blank page? Does that have anything to do with the fact that I use 
  an apple computer? Or is there only certain chat days? 
  I'm doing very well right now, but I know in a few days I'll really 
  start craving some breads/pastas, and I want to be able to chat 
  when that time comes...any help would be great! Thanks!!!
  Angie
