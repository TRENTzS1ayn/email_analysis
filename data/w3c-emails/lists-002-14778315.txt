Diane two things could cause the bloating.  Cycle time and sodium aka salt intake.  Also believe it or not water intake affects it as well if you do not drink enough.  The daily recommended for an average person is 64 oz.  However the actuall amount you should be drinking  is half your body weight in Ounces of water.  As you loose weight you can decrease how much water you drink. 

Water can cause hunger pains as well.  Your body isn't craving food it is craving water in some cases.  I drink 128 oz of water a day because i have about 140 lbs to loose and i just started.  I have researched and gone on so many diets and programs it isn't funny.  Even weight watchers and jenny craig.  Anyway watch the salt/sodium content in the precooked meats and what not that you are eating.  Also make sure you are drinking the right amount of water to wash what salt you do have in your food out of your system.  If it is cycle time you just have to let it run its course of course and then you should be ok. 

Hope this helps
