You can grind it in a coffee grinder.  I use my vitamix.  When I couldn't
grind my own the health food store ground it for me.  I don't know how to
describe the taste.  A little nutty.  I like flaxseed quite a bit.  I make a
flax crisp that is just water, ground flax, and a little salt.  It's
microwaved and very easy.  Just don't go overboard or you will be in the
bathroom alot.
