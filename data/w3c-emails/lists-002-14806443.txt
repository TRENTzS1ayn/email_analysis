Thanks for the recipe Danu.  I'll have to give that a try.  I picked up whole flax seed in bulk at the Whole foods market here in Houston.  I'm also buying one of those thunderstick pros this week from ebay.  Alot cheaper then buying off the tv if you only need one however I saw an ad for 2 for $40 just yesterday.  I still think I got a great deal though for $23 with shipping.  I think Handy kitchen gadgets like this is going to really help me to cook more at home.  My bulkey old mixer drives me nuts*grin* cause when I say old I mean like 70's model if I'm not mistaken giggles. 

Anyway I have been coming up with many great new recipes and have found quite a few helpfull sites.  Has anyone seen www.lowcarbluxury.com.  Great site with many wonderful recipes.  

If you like whole grains and soy products like soy nuts you might want to look into co-op groups in your area.  You can pick up whole food pulk items for cheaper and sometimes your neighbors who do it too are willing to split some items.  THis is what my Mom does.  

Take care, Live Safe, Play in the Shadows, and Search the Night for the Wondering Fire Fairies.
