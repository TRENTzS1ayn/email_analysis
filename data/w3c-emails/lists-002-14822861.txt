Due to the number of spam messages and the emails I keep getting back 
every time I post here I am setting my membership to no mail.  If 
after sending this message I still get the spam messages I am going 
to just leave it all together.  I like this groups but I can't afford 
all the space the spam is taking up in my inbox.  Whoever has the 
virus really needs to take the time and clear it off their computer.

Take care,

Vamptasia
