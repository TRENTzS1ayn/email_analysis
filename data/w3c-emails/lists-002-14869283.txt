Hi,
I lost my copy of Tidy when my computer was tampered with by children!!.
I've tried to download another copy (Dublin mirror) but just get a strange file which I cannot 'read'
tidy4aug00.tgz
All links to download tidy lead back to the same web page sourceforge.net
I would really appreciate another copy of Tidy as I found it very useful. Even if it is an older copy.
