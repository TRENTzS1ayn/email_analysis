This is a tar-gzipped archive. I deduce that you're running on some 
flavour of Windows and therefore have nothing that handles a .tgz 
archive; but it wouldn't be any use to you anyway.

If you go to <http://tidy.sourceforge.net> and scroll down, you'll 
find a section headed "other builds" - the first entry there is for a 
27-Feb-2003 Windows version, in a zip archive.

If you want the 4Aug00 version, you are welcome to download it from
<http://www.fred.bone.dial.pipex.com/Storage/tidy4aug00.zip> if you 
can't find it anywhere else. You would, of course, be taking my word 
for it that this is an unmodified copy of the original.

Either way, you'll need an unzip program (unless you're running 
Windows XP which I gather can do zip archives all by itself). If you 
don't have one, look for PKZIP, WinZip or PowerArchiver. Or, if 
you're reasonably computer literate, InfoZip's WiZ.
