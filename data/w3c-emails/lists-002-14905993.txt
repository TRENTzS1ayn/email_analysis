HABit Tidy is a GUI wrapper for HTML Tidy for Windows

I have now more-or-less completed HABTidy and would very much 
appreciate any comments and suggestions.

I have done quite a bit of work on it since the initial release 
3 weeks ago and it now has a comprehensive Help file.

HABit Tidy was developed quite independently of Charles Reitzel's 
Tidy UI and although they share a number of features, they work 
completely differently. HABit Tidy is being made available as a 
"lighter-weight" alternative. 

Also, IMHO, it may be easier for the uninitiated to use.

HABit Tidy is available for download from 
http://www.hotkey.net.au/~hambar/habit/files/habtidy.zip 
(230 Kb)

Installation details are in the enclosed Readme file.
