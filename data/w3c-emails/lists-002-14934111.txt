Problem with extra Carriage Return in Windows.
=========================================

I find that carriage return-linefeeds (CRLF) are getting converted to CRCRLF, an extra carriage return.

This causes ever-lengthening text with Windows tools which expand a lone CR into CRLF.

Have pity on us poor Windows users, in thrall to the Evil Empire.

If Microsoft makes something that doesn't suck, it'll be a vacuum-cleaner
