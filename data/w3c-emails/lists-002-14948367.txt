Dear colleagues,

We are a software development company from Tomsk, Russia. We have been
working on the Russian IT market for quite a long time and completed many
projects. 

Now we plan to work with western software companies to become its
outsourcing partner here in Russia. As you know such corporations as IBM
and SUN Microsystems cooperate with Russian companies because it greatly
reduces their 
costs as the labour force in Russia is a lot cheaper than in the west.
Moreover Russian programmers are in high demand worldwide.

you are interested we are ready to become your partner in developing any
kind of software. 

Actually there are two ways we can cooperate.

That is we'll be doing offshore programming for you on the terms we'll have
discussed or

2. We can become your affiliate where our programmers we'll be working.
