I can confirm that there does appear to be a problem/bug in Charles
Reitzel's HTML Tidy for Windows dated February 17 2003.

When used in write-to-file mode, eg "tidy -i mypage.old > mypage.htm",
it produces line-terminators of the form CRCRLF

Subsequent passes through Tidy do not further change the
line-terminators.

In-place conversion, eg "tidy -im mypage.htm", works correctly.

The "Original" August 2000 WinDos HTML Tidy (tidy04aug00.exe) does not
exhibit this behaviour.
