To whom it may concern: today I downloaded and paid for WinMX v3.31. after downloading some songs and getting familiar with the site , I realized that it is just 
not what I was looking for. I would greatly appreciate it if I could get my credit card
credited and remove this site. Please let me know if you can help me , and I thank 
you for your time.                                             Sincerely,
                                                                     Dawn M. Manges
