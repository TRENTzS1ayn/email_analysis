Latest HTML Tidy (http://tidy.sf.net) will give you

  <tr>
  <td><font>This is a</font> <font>text</font></td>
  <td>test 3</td>
  <td>test 2</td>
  </tr>

You are strongly encouraged to avoid leading and trailing white space in
inline elements. Anyway, Tidy's behaivour should only cause problems, if
your second font element (you are strongly encouraged to avoid font
elements at all, by the way) has a right-to-left directionality (as I've
noted before...) Why is Tidy's behaivour a problem to you?
