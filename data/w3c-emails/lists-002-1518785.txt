 I m also having similar type of problem. Consider the html below
<body>
<font face=verdana size=3></font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</body>
when this html is converted using tidy into xml. XML after conversion is given below:
<html>
<body>
<font face="verdana" size="3"></font> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</body>
</html>
When this xml is opened in Internet Explorer 5.0. The following error comes.
error: cannot identify &nbsp; between <p>.
Does anyone know what is the problem..
waiting for your reply.
thanks.

You are strongly encouraged to avoid leading and trailing white space in
inline elements. Anyway, Tidy's behaivour should only cause problems, if
your second font element (you are strongly encouraged to avoid font
elements at all, by the way) has a right-to-left directionality (as I've
noted before...) Why is Tidy's behaivour a problem to you?
