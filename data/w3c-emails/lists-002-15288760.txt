and I forgot to mention also, using Doxygen so that C
comments and documentation have some meaning and using
a Java-style capitalization standard.  The thing is
that there must be many more techniques in there that
I would like to learn from, but I might not be seeing
them or understanding them just by looking at the
source, so that's why I'm wondering if there is a book
or some articles that describe some of this.
