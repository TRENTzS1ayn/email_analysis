Hi,

I've just compiled html tidy on win 2000.  The make file for building a dll
seems to be broken with a stack of unresolved symbols W3CAttrsFor_*.  It
doesn't include attrdict.*.  Attached is a patch that fixes the problem, at
least I think it does, the perl module didn't compile;(.

Thanks for the work in making html tidy, it's proving quite useful.
