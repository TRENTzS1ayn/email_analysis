Hi all,

I have written a short python script to check local HTML files using 
'tidy'. It checks all the files in one or more directories, recursing 
down the tree if necessary. It produces varying levels of diagnostic 
reports according to need, finishing with a summary. Its exit value 
gives the number of errors found.

Is anyone interested in me releasing this as open source?

Being a command line tool, I anticipate it to be useful from Ant, Make 
or whatever. It should work on all python-supported platforms although 
I've only tested it on Windows.

Rick :-)
