Specify --ascii-chars no

From the Quick Reference 
<http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html>

ascii-chars
Type: Boolean
Default: yes
Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0char-encoding
Can be used to modify behavior of -c (--clean yes) option. Defaults 
to "yes" when using -c. Set to "no" to prevent converting &emdash;, 
&rdquo;, and other named character entities to their ascii 
equivalents.
