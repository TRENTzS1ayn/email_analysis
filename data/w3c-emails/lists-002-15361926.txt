Hi!

There's no email adress at tidy.sourceforge.net to its webmaster, so I post mail here.
I would like to announce that latest version of HTML Tidy for Windblows (compiled with gcc) should always be available at:

http://hno.freeshell.org

There's version released on 1st October 2003. It's ready to be placed at tidy.sourceforge.net with author e.g.
<A HREF="http://hno.freeshell.org">HNO</A>
I posted info about previous version at
tidy-develop@lists.sourceforge.net, but got no response.

Please, somebody answer my e-mail.

Bye!
