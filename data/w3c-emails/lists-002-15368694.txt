Hi,
 
I have been looking at jTidy for the last couple of days and notice there
is a serious lack of activity there by anyone associated with the project
(sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy).
Does anyone here happen to know if jTidy is still being worked on? If so
do you know if they are working on a port from tidyLib or from classic
tidy?
 
The java version of the library would be great to have as it seems the
jTidy library currently doesn't do a great job.  Any information any of
you have on the status of the jTidy
project would be helpful.
 
I have already looked at their forums and there are no answers to
questions similar to this one there. The jTidy webpage suggests using this
mailing list for further info.  Thanks
 
I imagine the answer to all of these questions is - "nobody knows" or
"nothing is happening with jtidy" but I figured i shoud at least ask.
 
Thanks in advance,
 
Bill
