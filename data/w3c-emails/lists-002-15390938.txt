'align=top' is not a proper attribute/value pair, you probably meant 
'valign=top'. See the HTML 4 spec for what attributes are available and 
what their possible values are.

'align=center' is OK, as long as you use a 'Transitional' Doctype. For 
'Strict', all presenatational attributes should be removed. Which is 
something Tidy can do for you, BTW, if you use the 'clean' option.
