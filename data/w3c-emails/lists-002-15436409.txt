Well since there is no response whatsoever to my questions about jTidy I
don't know if anyone will care about this - anywhere - but I have a new
java and coldfusion wrapper for the jTidy library if anyone at all wants
it.  After this post I will be unsubscribing from the list but you can
still reach me at the email address listed with this post if you want the
wrappers.

Cheers,
Bill Rawlinson
