Hi again;

I just experimented a little more, and found out that
new-pre-tags has nothing to do with the problem I
described in the previous email.

Briefly, if I have have the following in my XSL
stylesheet:

<pre>

lkjasd flkjsadf
       lkjasdf<foo bar='baz'/>
</pre>

tidy will obstinately convert it to:

<pre>

lkjasd flkjsadf
       lkjasdf
<foo bar='baz'/>
</pre>

Is there a way to make tidy to ignore <pre> or some
other tag contents ABSOLUTELY!  So that it won't even
try to parse and indent stuff within <pre>.

Thanks again.
