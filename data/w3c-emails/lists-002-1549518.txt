If the file is served with a MIME type text/xml (usually with an extension .xml)
the problem is that &nbsp; is an undefined entity.

The same file will work okay with a MIME type text/html (with an extension .htm
or .html).

XHTML is XML plus HTML entities, and browsers render XHTML as HTML.

XML does not know about HTML entities so &nbsp; is an undefined entity. If you 
want to use the file as XML, you can define the entity, like this:

<!DOCTYPE html
[
<!ENTITY nbsp "&#160;">
]>

and Internet Explorer should render the page okay as XML.
