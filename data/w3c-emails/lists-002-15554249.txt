I don't remember the name of the file, and I got it from the sourceforge web 
site. I remember now that it said it was a "source code," so maybe what I 
downloaded wasn't Tidy HTML, but I remember that was part of the name. This is so 
confusing that I think that I'll deal with it all another time. I was even 
getting errors for the sitemeter on my site, which I want to keep. So I doubt 
I'll be able to have an HTML 4.01 Transitional web site. I also wanted to keep 
the sitemeter "hidden," so I used a lot of <.br> tags to put it way down at the 
bottom. But thanks for asking.
