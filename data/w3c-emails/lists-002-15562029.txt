In which case you need to compile it in order to produce the 
executable version. 

If you aren't into compiling software, then you should instead 
download the ready-made executable from tidy.int64.org (a pointer to 
this is on the Sourceforge page: the first thing listed under "Other 
builds" near the bottom of the page). You want the one called "tidy-
exe.zip" and you'll need an unzip utility to extract the files.
