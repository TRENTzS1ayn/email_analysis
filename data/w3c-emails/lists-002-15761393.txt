hi i'm someone who doesn't know much about computers. I downloaded this 
video from kazaa and it wouldn't play because i didn't have a xvid codec or 
something like that. So i searched the internet looking for it and i ended 
up downloading Xvid 0.9.2 or something. My computers is telling me i need 
ICM.XVID so i was just wondering if you could tell me what to do or how to 
use 0.9.2 so i can watch my videos?
