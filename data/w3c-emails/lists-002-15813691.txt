Hello Folks,

I am relatively new to the uses of Tidy.  I've been reading through some 
of the documentation from Tidy and some of the archives for this list 
and I can't seem to find what I am looking for.  I am sorry if this 
topic has already been covered.

Is it possible convert HTML to XML using a XML template?  By template I 
mean a outline of how you want the XML to look or how you want it 
formatted.  If this is possible how would I go about doing this or could 
you point me to where I can read up on this?

Regards,
Jeff
