OK.

What do you mean?  Do you mean generic XML, or XHTML?

Your "XML" looks suspiciously like HTML or XHTML. ...

I'll take a guess -- your resultant filename is something like
"myfile.xml", and there is no DOCTYPE declaration?

If that's the case, what do you expect?  Generic XML only knows about
four "built-in" entities:  &lt;, &gt;, &quot;, and &amp;.  Now you're
throwing it one it's never heard of: &nbsp;!

You haven't been clear about what you're trying to do.  *Why* have you
given your file a .xml extension (if that's the case!)?  What are you
trying to do with it?

If you really want it to be .xml, then make sure it references a DTD
where nbsp is declared (like, say, one of the XHTML DTDs. :).
