I been using Tidy to clean Word 2000 documents and get them ready for the
Web.
Tidy seems to be doing a great job, the only tags that are left that I still
want to get rid of are the class attributes:

<body class='c10'>
  <div class="Section1">

<li class="c4">

How can I do this either in the UI for Win32 or command line Tidy?
