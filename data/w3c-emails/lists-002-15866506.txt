i don't think this is possible[1]. :( 

try either: 

 - textism's word html cleaner[2], or
 - roll your own perl solution with MKDoc::XML::Stripper[3] 

warning: the perl solution requires xml input, so you'll need to run it 
through tidy first with the output-xhtml option (if you're throwing it 
html).
