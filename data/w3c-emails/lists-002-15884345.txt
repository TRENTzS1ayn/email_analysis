Hi,

We have a problem in tidy in which it does following unexpected things.

    1. Truncates content page
    2. Inserts html tags to be visible after applying tidy.

Does anybody faced similar situation? If yes, can you please let me know
what I need to do for this.

thanks in advance
Subbakrishna
