Hello everyone.=20 I am new to jTidy.  I am using jTidy to
convert parse a HTML from a URL = to XML.  but I am getting a

project.  Appreciate any help rendered!=20

You don't show us the page you are converting.

the following are the generated error log from jTidy.=20

Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) Parsing "InputStream"=20
line 11 column 1 - Warning: <style> isn't allowed in <html> elements=20

This means you have
    <html>
      <style> ... </style>
      <head> ... </head>
      <body> ... </body>
    </html>
but <style> is NOT ALLOWED as a child of <html>.  Instead you should have
    <html>
      <head>
        <style> ... </style>
        ...
      </head>
      <body> ... </body>
    </html>
If you don't have an explicit <head> element, better put one in.
<head> is where <style>, <meta>, <link>, <title>, and a few
other things can go.

line 56 column 1 - Warning: <table> lacks "summary" attribute=20

What it says:  each <table> element should have a summary="text" attribute
saying what the table is about.

line 67 column 1 - Warning: <div> isn't allowed in <table> elements=20

What it says:  <div> is NOT allowed inside a <table>.
<table> may contain these and ONLY these:
 <caption>- a label for the whole table
 <col>- a way of specifying attributes for an entire column
 <colgroup>- a way of specifying attributes for a group of columns
 <thead>- a group of rows to appear at the front, and if the table
  is split across pages, at the top of each following part
  of the table
 <tfoot>- a group of rows to appear at the end, and if the table
  is split across pages, at the foot of each preceding part
  of the table
 <tbody>- a group of rows, not to be repeated.  The main part of the
  table.
 <tr>- a single row.
No other elements whatsoever are allowed as direct children of a <table>
element, they would make no sense at all.

line 69 column 5 - Warning: <td> repeated attribute=20

This means you have an element <td foo="X" foo="Y" ...>
where some attribute (foo in my example) occurs twice.  This is not allowed
in any SGML document, and still isn't allowed in XML.  (Although thanks to
the great "namespaces" cock-up, it _is_ possible to have two attributes with
the same URI and local name...)

line 222 column 1 - Warning: discarding unexpected </div>=20

Probably caused by all those illegal <div> start-tags.
