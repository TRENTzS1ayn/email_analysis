Hello all,

Bjoern Hoehrmann's solution worked for me.

Alternativey, I've just received Henry Bartlett's HABTidy, which can be
found here:
http://www.hotkey.net.au/~hambar/habit/habutil.htm#juHABTidy

It works great, does have a checkbox interface to create a standard tidy
config file, does multiple files in multiple subfolders, etc.

For the benefit of fellow googlers and windows-locked desperates like me,
I'm also posting a step by step here on using a DOS batch.


Tidy multiple files and folders on Windows using DOS batch
----------------------------------------------------------

1. On your Windows folder, place tidy.exe and your config file (a .tidy
file).
(you place these on your Windows folder so you can run it from any other
folder)


2. On your Windows folder, create a text file called tidyall.bat, with the
following line in it:
for /R %%a in (*.htm*) do tidy -config C:\winnt\xhtml.tidy -m %%a

(check the path to your .tidy config file according to its name and location
of Windows on your system)


3. Open a DOS prompt, go the folder of your HTML files, and run tidyall.
NOTE: use a DOS-compatible folder to place your html, like "C:\myfiles\" and
NOT "c:\documents and settings\myName\etc" because something gets messed up
and tidy won't find your files.


That's it. It worked for me.
