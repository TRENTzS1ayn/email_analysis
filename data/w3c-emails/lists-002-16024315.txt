Dear Sir,
   I've written a function to handle two large matrices , the function 
executes successfully for the first time, but when I try to free my memory 
and call the function again, I get the error : Cannot allocate memory.
It seems that deleting the matrices is not successfull. I tried "free" and 
"freemem".
Would you kindly advise me on this matter?
Thanks a lot in advance,
Yours faithfully,
Shadi Rajabi,
Mechanical engineering junior,
Sharif University of Technology
