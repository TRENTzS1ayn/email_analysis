First of all, people should know that HTML Tidy does not actually validate  
HTML or XHTML. It tries to output valid code, but it is well known that it  
doesn't force the content to match the constraints imposed by the chosen  
Doctype.

The XHTML notation for empty elements like <img .. /> and <col .. /> is  
valid in the XML syntax used for XHTML, but invalid in the syntax used for  
HTML. It should be <img .. > and <col .. > instead. And this syntax is  
invalid for XML, which requires either an explicit closing tag (</img>),  
or the /> notation to close the start tag of the empty element.

So when going from XHTML to HTML, and the other way around, the closing of  
empty element like IMG, COL, META and LINK has to be adjusted. If Tidy  
doesn't do this (IIRC, Tidy only fixes it when going from HTML to XHTML,  
not the other way around), the author has to manually do this. A search an  
replace of "/>" with ">" should do the trick.
