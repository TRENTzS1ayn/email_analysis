Dear Thomas, when you run tidy against the file where you have changed the 
doctype, do you get any informational or warning messages?  Did you submit
the output of running tidy again to the W3C validator, or the input document
in which you had manually changed the doctype?

HTML 4.01 Transitional and XHTML 1.0 Transitional are very similar, except that
HTML is parsed according to SGML parsing rules whereas XHTML is parsed 
according to XML parsing rules.

Elements with empty context models must not have end tags in HTML, but have end
tags in XML, so

HTML 4.01:  <br>
XHTML 1.0:  <br></br> or, for better compatibility with HTML browsers, <br />

Unless you need to use HTML 4.01 Transitional, I would recommend that you go 
with XHTML 1.0 Transitional instead, which is recognized by all current 
browsers, and when following the recommendations for backwards compatibility 
outlined in the specification, also by older browsers.
