RE:  Reg #  AP2237311805
 
Dear Dave Raggett,
 
I am still having a problem with my "web gem" music files on the site, www.Jans-Place.com 
 
There is an error on the page where I am trying to delete and add music files.  I had previously worked with Jarrod Smith, with APlus.Net.Support (please see attached messges to and from him).   

I tried everything that Mr. Smith recommended, and I last replied to him on December 11, 2003, stating that it still isn't working. He hasn't replied yet.  
 
At this time, there is only one music file added, which I want deleted.  Also, I am not able to add other music files.  I am not a computer tech and I have no idea what the problem could be.  Will you please advise me as to what you or what I can do to fix this problem as soon as possible?  Thank you for your time.
 
Sincerely,
 
Cynthia Gaines

Hi Jarrod,
 
First, I click on "Webgem," to add music files.  Then, when I get to the menu to select which music files to add, I try to upload a music file...but it doesn't work. 
 
When I try to add a file, I keep getting this pop-up box telling me there are "Java Script errors on the page."  It asks me if I want to continue running scripts on this page, and I click, "Yes," but it keeps popping back up, so then I click, "No," and it still keeps popping back up.  I click the "X" to close the box, but it comes right back again.  
 
There is one old file there that never played right before, so I tried to delete it.  It got hung up or something because it didn't budge.  I have tried numerous times to delete but it won't go away.  
 
I believe I originally had this problem for about a week, when I tried to upload from a CD. Nothing would play at all...I spoke with you and I did the other thing you suggested, something about unchecking "Protected Content," in the "Copy" box under "Options."
   
Does this help in the trouble shooting?  I believe I did the "Enable" script" functions correctly in the Internet Explorer "Tools," "Options," "Security," "Custom Level," and "Scripting" sections. 
 
Thank you for your time.

Tonight I attempted to try again, no luck.  Still getting the "Script error" message in a pop-up box...I did go to tools on Internert Explorer and I "enabled" Active Scripting, etc...including Java aqpplets.  Does this have anything to do with my problem?  It didn't seem to help me at all...Thank you for your reply.

Subject: webgem - cannot add music


Dear Customer Service;
 
I once loaded music files with your "web-gem," but it wouldn't play. Now I am stuck with a song title I tried to delete but it won't work.  I cannot add new music, because I keep getting an annoying "script error" pop-up message, asking me if I want to continue running scripts on this page.  It continually pops up and won't stop.  I am not able to delete one song from the selection list nor add any new songs. I think the "script error" pop-up is a message from Internet Explorer.  What is happening here?  Can you help me with this problem?  I am not able to figure out what to do. Thank you for your help on this. Please email me at your earliest convenience at:  cynthia_gaines@sbcglobal.net
 
Sincerely,
 
Cynthia Gaines
