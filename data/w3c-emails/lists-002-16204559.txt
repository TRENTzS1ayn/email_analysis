Subject: editor with Tidy integration

Hello!


 I was wondering if, perhaps, you'd like to add a link to my code 
editor with Tidy integration - VenPad - to the Tidy Overview 
(http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/Overview.html)?
 VenPad is a one-stop web/code editor, which is quite popular in 
Latvia (especially amongst latvian php developers), and, I think, 
could be in some other countries, if You'd help ;) ). It is freeware 
though not (yet?) open source.
 Please have a look: http://venom.times.lv/VenPad.zip

Respect,
 Venom
 the SCGroup
