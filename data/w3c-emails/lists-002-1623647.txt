Jeff Hennick <JHennick@mindspring.com> proposed (in effect)
changing <pre> to <div style="font-family: monospace">.
He says

    It now works, is legal HTML, and TIDY says so.

All of that is true, but the display is then wrong.
It is necessary to specify 'white-space: pre', otherwise
line breaks will not be respected.

If your generator program won't do it, a simple filter program
should be able to "fix" your files in bulk.

I note that a simple filter program converting
<HR ...>
to</PRE><HR ...><PRE>
has been suggested, tested, and worked.
