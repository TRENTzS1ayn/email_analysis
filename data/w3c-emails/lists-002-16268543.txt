Dear Musician,

I am glad to announce the releasing of my newest instructional
video course "GospelKeys 101: The Basics and Fundamentals to
Playing Piano By Ear!"

If you're a church musician (or aspiring to be), you can't miss
this information!

Here is what you'll gain by studying with me:

*Learn my 3-step process to playing tons of hymns,
congregational, and basic songs by ear! I show, step-by-step,
how to take a song from just a one-fingered melody to a
full-sounding arrangement!

http://www.hearandplay.com/gospel101.html

*Learn how to determine melodies in songs in less than TWO
minutes. I believe that learning songs shouldn't take days and
weeks! In fact, I specialize in learning songs in less than 5 to
10 minutes! I'll show you EXACTLY how to pick up basic songs by
ear in no time! http://www.hearandplay.com/gospel101.html

*Discover ways to harmonize virtually ANY melody with just SEVEN
chords! By learning how these chords work with the various tones
of a major scale, you'll never have a problem finding the right
accompaniment to a melody. I learned this technique over SEVEN
years ago and haven't stopped using it since!

http://www.hearandplay.com/gospel101.html

*Learn how to determine which bass notes to play when
harmonizing a melody. Learn what I call the "common bass"
technique and how to apply it when learning hymns,
congregational songs, and more!

- and much much more!
