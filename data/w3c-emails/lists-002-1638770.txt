Why not let Tidy allow me to code the "at" sign as &#64; and list web-page
e-mail as 
 
me&#64;mydomain.com 
 
rather than Tidy auto-converting it to  <mailto:me@mydomain.com>
me@mydomain.com . This would offer simple, moderate protection against
robots that harvest e-mail addresses.

I would support a request for feature to that effect. Go to
