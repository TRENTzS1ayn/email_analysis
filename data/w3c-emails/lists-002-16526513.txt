I guess this is caused by

>input-xml: yes                                    

This configuration option should not be used for HTML/XHTML documents.
I admit the name is a bit counter-intuitive and a number of users had
this problem... Think of it as "just XML" as opposed to something more
specific like (X)HTML. Please let me know if setting it to 'no' or
removing it does not help, I'll have a closer look then.

regards.
