I am an ignorant newbie that usies NoteTab for text editing and basic HTML
coding. Note Tab has an option to "Tidy HTML" that apparently uses the
program tidy.exe but I can't figure out how to get tidy.exe.  I went to
SourceForge.net and downloaded SOMETHING, but Windows 98 doesn't recognize
it as an executable.

What am I doing wrong???

TIA,
