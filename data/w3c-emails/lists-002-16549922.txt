Well, what *exactly* did you download? There's a whole bunch of stuff 
at sourceforge, some of it entirely inappropriate for the Windows 
environment (as with many things there).

Try <http://tidy.sourceforge.net/trt/tidy_win32.zip>, which you'll 
need to unzip. That should, at least, get you an executable, albeit a 
little out-of-date (July last year).

Or maybe Notetab is looking for a DLL, in which case go looking at 
<http://htmltrim.sourceforge.net/tidy.html>. Here you'll also find 
the latest (month-old) version.
