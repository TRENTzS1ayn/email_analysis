Hello,
I am trying to convert a HTML file to an XHTML using tidy. I am using
the following commandline -

tidy -asxhtml -o out.xhtml in.html

This runs and gives out a lot of warnings and errors regarding
unrecognised tags etc. But on windows, the out.xhtml file is created,
whereas on linux, it just prints out the errors and warnings and quits.

I downloaded the recent versions of tidy from http://tidy.sf.net

What am I missing?

TIA
