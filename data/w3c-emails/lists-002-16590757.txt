Doh!  It seems there was a change from the 15th to the 18th that fixed this
bug.  I usually don't update the windows binaries if the source changes in
that little of time.

I've uploaded new ones: http://tidy.int64.org

Pick up source code of any site. I just did this -

lynx --dump --source http://www.yahoo.com > /tmp/yahoo.html

Then ran tidy on it -

tidy -asxhtml -o test.xhtml /tmp/yahoo.html

It prints out a ton of warnings and errors and the test.xhtml file is not
created.
