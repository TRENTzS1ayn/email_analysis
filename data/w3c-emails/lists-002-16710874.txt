Hello,

a while ago I've already asked with no success. Since I still have the  
problem and couldn't find a solution elsewhere I ask again:

given markup like
<div class="t1">
<div class="t2">
test
</div>
</div>

tidy results per defaults
<div class="t1 t2">
test
</div>

Is there an option that makes tidy keep the <div>s (or other elements)  
separate?
If not I'd wonder why tidy does merge them...?


regards
Steffen
