You mean, you have e.g.

  <div>
  <p>...
  <p>...
  <p>...
  </div>

and want Tidy to emit e.g.

  <div>
  <p>...</p>

  <p>...</p>

  <p>...</p>
  </div>

without indentation? Hmm... It's (close to) what old versions of Tidy
did, we changed it for some reason and later introduced an experimental
boolean config option 'vertical-space'... A March 2003 build would
indeed generate the above using `--vertical-space yes` but current
builds do not... I'll have a look at it.
