A remark: the div are not consecutive. One is inside the other.

I tried this:
cat test.html | tidy -i

with test.html:
<body>
        <div class="t1">
                <div class="t2">
                        test
                </div>
        </div>
</body>

and got this result:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN">

<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="generator" content=
    "HTML Tidy for Linux/x86 (vers 1st March 2002), see www.w3.org">

    <title></title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="t1">
      <div class="t2">
        test
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

which seems perfectly correct.
Could you show us your config or command line?
And give the version you are using?
