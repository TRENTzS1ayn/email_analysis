Yes.  I see this is becoming a FAQ here too, so ...

Q.  Why doesn't &nbsp; (or &copy;, or &Whatever;) work in XML?

A.  They *will* work if and only if you've referenced a DTD that
declares them for you, such as the XHTML 1.0 Strict DTD at

http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd

or you have declared them yourself, as in ...

   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <!DOCTYPE doc [
     <!ENTITY nbsp "&#160;">
     <!ENTITY copy "&#169;">
     <!ENTITY alef "&#x05d0;">
   ]>
   <doc>
      <p>A non-breaking space is invisible, 
      but if you could see it, it would look 
      like this: &nbsp;.</p>

      <p>The first letter of the Hebrew 
      alphabet is &alef;.</p>
