I agree with many of the fine suggestions Richard has made over the years,
and to make the point, I have now added a Tracker for the Tidy project to
track user contributions :

<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=27659&atid=451767>

And have entered Richard's suggestion for obfuscating the "at" sign, as the
first item in this Tracker.

In time, I suspect we will create a User Contributed Scripts directory in
both CVS and the Tidy releases. But I will wait for a few more
contributions before doing that.

Have at it (maybe someone else would like to browse the Tidy mailing list
archives for such suggestions...). Let me know of suggestions of how to
improve the Tracker categories and groups.

Regards, Terry
