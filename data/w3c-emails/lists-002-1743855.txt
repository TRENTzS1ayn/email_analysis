Hi everyone. 

I am facing this problem with meta tags when I am trying to convert html to xml.

[Fatal Error] :52:8: The element type "meta" must be terminated by the matching
end-tag "</meta>".
error in extraction process!

can anyone tell me what i should do? what config file setting should i use?

thank you very much.

Best Regards,
ray
