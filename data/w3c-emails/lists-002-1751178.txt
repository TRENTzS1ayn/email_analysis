Ray, I'm no Tidy guru but you could try this (I am assuming you are aware
that option: 'output-xml' must be true).

Use the 'new tag' options adding 'meta' to each one like this:

new-blocklevel-tags: meta
new-empty-tags: meta
new-inline-tags: meta
new-pre-tags: meta

It's possible only one of these needs to be set. I know not which one.

Doing this sorted out similar problems I was having with the 'script' tag
using TidyCOM.

Like I said this may not work but give it a go anyway.

Regards,

..matthew
