error in extraction process!

can anyone tell me what i should do?
what config file setting should i use?

Hang on a minute.  The message here is certainly wrong.
<META> elements in HTML not only do not require an end-tag,
according to the rules of SGML they MUST NOT EVER HAVE ONE.
That is, <meta ...></meta> is not legal as SGML, because
the declaration is
    <!ELEMENT META - O EMPTY>
    <!ATTLIST META .....>

I think you should at least show us the HTML line in question.
