While I believe this conclusion is just wrong, how should we integrate
such a feature into HTML Tidy? Add a new option

  keep-at-sign-escaped: yes | [no]

This would just bloat the configuration possibilities in HTML Tidy, it's
been hard enough to get an overview on them even before I started to add
options. I don't see the actual benefit.
