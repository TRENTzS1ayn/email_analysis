This is exactly the reason, why Tidy puts out only numeric character
references when the document type declaration is ommited. I think this
is a little buggy at the moment, but in general it should work in latest
builds.

... You may also import the entities from XHTML 1.0 like

  <!DOCTYPE html [
  <!ENTITY % HTMLlat1 PUBLIC
     "-//W3C//ENTITIES Latin 1 for XHTML//EN"
     "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml-lat1.ent">
  %HTMLlat1;
  
  <!ENTITY % HTMLsymbol PUBLIC
     "-//W3C//ENTITIES Symbols for XHTML//EN"
     "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml-symbol.ent">
  %HTMLsymbol;
  
  <!ENTITY % HTMLspecial PUBLIC
     "-//W3C//ENTITIES Special for XHTML//EN"
     "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml-special.ent">
  %HTMLspecial; 
  ]>
