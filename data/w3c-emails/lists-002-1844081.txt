When we look at the text in question, we find
<P class=MsoNormal><?xml:namespace prefix = o /><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P></TD>

In SGML, processing instructions begin with '<?' and end with '>'.
In XML,  processing instructions begin with '<?' and end with '?>'.

If the input is supposed to be XML, then Tidy would necessarily have
swallowed the rest of the input at this point looking for the closing
'?>'.  Does Tidy need a flag to treat '/>' as if it were '?>' ?

I note that this is NOT how you declare XML namespaces.
In XML, you can't have a name space prefix without saying what URI
the prefix represents.  If the whole thing is a single DIV, you'd
have
    <DIV class=Section1 xmlns:o="http://www.msdn.com/foo/bar/ick.asp">
or whatever the URI was.
