I was able to reproduce your problem on my platform with the current
version of Tidy. It appears to be recursing infinitely until it consumes
all available memory. Richard quite correctly isolated the piece of HTML
that is causing the problem. The 04 Aug 00 version of Tidy doesn't have
this problem.

It is recommended that you enter a formal bug report into the Tidy
project's bug tracker on SourceForge.
