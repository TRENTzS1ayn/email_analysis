Hi,

A great many thanks for making tidy ;-)

My little question is why it (seemingly) is not possible to
capture the output of tidy in a pager program. If I do

tidy -e foo.html | most

it is as if the output stream is terminated just before the
pager program is launched leaving it with an emty buffer?


Thanks,

Morten
