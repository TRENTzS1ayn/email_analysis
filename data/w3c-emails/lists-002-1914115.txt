Hi,

Thanks to those who replied. To those of you using Lynx I now
have this little tip on validating pages "on the fly" I'd like
to share. If you place these lines in your lynx.cfg

  EXTERNAL:http:lynx -source %s | tidy -e 2>&1 | most:TRUE
  EXTERNAL:file:lynx -source %s | tidy -e 2>&1 | most:TRUE

you can then validate the current page by pressing "," or
validate a page pointed to by a link by pressing "."  

This requires Lynx to be compiled with the ./configure option
--enable-externs. I think that's the default on most
precompiled packages.

"most" is my pager program of preference. Change it to
more/less or whatever suits you.

I have the line below in lynx.cfg to feed the validation output
to my mail program with the purpose of documenting html
problems to the webmaster of the site in cases where the
problems are so grave that they impede navigation.

  EXTERNAL:http:lynx -source %s | tidy -e >/tmp/tidy.tmp ; mutt -s "HTML problems at you site" -i /tmp/tidy.tmp

Even if it only helps writing webmasters once in a blue moon
one should still do it, I think ;)


  
Regards,

Morten
