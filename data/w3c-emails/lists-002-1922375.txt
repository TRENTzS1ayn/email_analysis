Hi everyone,
 <p> and <br><br> tags when used to provide extra spacing
between list items, gets added as a separate list item ,
when tidied. 
 
 For eg:
 
 <li>Item1</li><p>
 <li>Item2</li><p>
  
When the drop-paras option is set to no, tidy converts the
above to 
  <LI>
             Item1
          </LI>
          <LI style="list-style: none">
             <BR>
             <BR>
          </LI>
          <LI>
             Item2
          </LI>
          <LI style="list-style: none">
             <BR>
             <BR>
 </LI>
 
 Setting the drop-paras option to yes does not help either
'cause <p> tags are dropped and the spacing between the list
items are lost when tidied.
 
 I would really appreciate if anyone can give me a clue to
get around this.
 
 Thanks
 Aravind.
