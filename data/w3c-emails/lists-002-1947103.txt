I suggest we move this discussion to the "tidy-develop" mailing list
(although I suspect someone on the "html-tidy" list could offer some
solutions that don't require you to modify the Tidy source).

Visit <http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tidy-develop>

(which you can also get to at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidy>,
clicking on the "Mailing List" link
<http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=27659> and finally clicking on the
"Subscribe" link)

Regards, Terry
