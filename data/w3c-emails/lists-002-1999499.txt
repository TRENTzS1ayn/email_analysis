Hello,

If I have a <br> tag in my html text JTidy is making to br tags of it. I
guess JTidy think it is a need for an end <br> as well and therefore add
another one. 

How is it possible to stop this adding of an extra br tag?

Kind regards,
Pelle

   Almost certainly not quite what you're after, but for HTML validation 
in any recent vim you can:

vi my.html
:compiler tidy
:make

   Then jump/cycle through the errors/warnings as if they were compiler 
errors.  Really depends what you're trying to achieve through the GUI.
