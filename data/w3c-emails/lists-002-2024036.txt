Please publish this at some prominent place on our project homepage

How do I report bugs in HTML Tidy?

You are encouraged to report bugs you found to the Tidy devloper team.
Tidy's quality depends on your feedback. You can either file your bug
report in the [Sourceforge bug tracker for HTML Tidy] (this is the
recommended place for bug reports) or send a mail to the [publically
archived] mailing list [html-tidy@w3.org] (Note you don't have to have a
Sourceforge account in order to file bug reports or be subscribed to
html-tidy@w3.org in order to post messages to the list). Make sure to
*include at least the following information* in your report:

  * A desciption of what you think went wrong
  * The HTML Tidy version (find it out by running `tidy -v`) and
    operating system you are running
  * The input, that exposes the bug (e.g., the HTML document you tried
    to clean up)
  * The configuration options you've used (command line options like
    `-asxml`, configuration files, etc.), you may use `tidy
     -show-config` to get an overview of the active Tidy settings
  * Your e-mail address for further questions and comments

These information are necessary to reproduce whatever is failing,
without them we cannot help you. Additional information are very
welcome!

*Please report only one bug a time*. Messages with multiple bug reports
are less easy to handle and your report may get missed.

Maybe it would be a good idea to include a pointer to it in `tidy -h`.

Regards,
