Where is this error message from? It's certainly not HTML Tidy, it
doesn't have a "fatal error"...

By the way, ReportEncodingError uses the FatalError function, it
shouldn't do so, FatalError is only for fatal fatal fatal errors
like a failing malloc(). Who ever added this should please fix it,
thanks.
