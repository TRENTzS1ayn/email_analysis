Hi All, 
  There is a way around this problem(If you guys don't 
have it already).I don't think the Tidy.jar supplied by 
the Java port of Tidy is compiled with a Sun Compiler.What 
you can do is, take the Java Source Code of Tidy and 
compile it with a Sun Java Compiler.It should work - it 
worked for me.
Thanks
Aravind.
