Hi all,

I have been using Tidy for some time (the C version, 
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/) and I find it very useful. I have also 
tinkered with the JTidy Java version 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/jtidy) and I note that there is a Perl 
binding at the planning stage (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ptidy).

Is anyone working on a Python binding? This would I guess be quite an 
easy thing to include with the C version, given that Python as a 
language is a veneer on C APIs anyway. A Python binding would make 
scripting with Tidy very easy, e.g. to write bespoke website maintenance 
tools.

Thoughts?
Rick
