The source file below gives these warnings:

$ tidy -errors tryjunk.html

HTML Tidy for Windows (vers 1st April 2002 (no joke); built on Apr  6 2002, at 23:21:56)
Parsing "tryjunk.html"
line 22 column 72 - Warning: '<' + '/' + letter not allowed here
line 25 column 0 - Warning: '<' + '/' + letter not allowed here

tryjunk.html: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 transitional//EN"
tryjunk.html: Document content looks like HTML 3.2
2 warnings, 0 errors were found!

Neither of the warnings, nor the inference about HTML 3.2, look correct to me.

/* J. Greif, 2002/07/05
 This function writes an email address into the document as it 
 is rendered in the browser, without making that address visible
 to a web crawler which does not actually execute the javascript
 but only has access to the raw HTML source.
 This is a weak, but useful form of spam protection -- makes it harder
 for automated email address collecting programs to grab the address.
