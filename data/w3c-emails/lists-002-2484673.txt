I think he's saying "I specified in my DOCTYPE declaration that I wanted
HTML 4.0 Transitional, so why is it giving me that message about HTML
3.2?"   Once the "</" script problem is fixed, it *should* validate as
either 3.2 or 4.x Transitional, so that appears to be a rather spurious
comment on Tidy's part.  Make sure you're using the newest version of
Tidy...
