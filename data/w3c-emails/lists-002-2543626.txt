I guess you already know my opinion, but I wanted to state it anyway.  

In XML, since "<empty></empty>" and "<empty />" are semantically equal, I
would say convert them.  The only place I can see this being a problem for
someone running an XML document through tidy might not expect it to make
this kind of change.  I would be pleasantly surprised if it did this but
some might not.  I hate to say it, but maybe there should be an option that
would default to creating the "<empty />" elements.

I think I noticed this when I was trying to debug my original problem.  It
is good to know that it has already been reported.

PS: Thanks for looking into and fixing the problem I was having already.  I
may just have to try and compile the tidy code myself rather than wait for
the MinGW version to pick it up.
