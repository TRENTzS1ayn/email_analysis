I have also updated to the latest precompiled tidy (vers 1st May 2002,
MinGW) that I can find and it still exhibits the problem.

The current MinGW version online
< http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~renowden/tidy/ > is 1st June
2002; I have just checked (you had me worried for a bit).

I will be updating it to the July version tonight.
