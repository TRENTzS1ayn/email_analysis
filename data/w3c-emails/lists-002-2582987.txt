Good point.

Since there are already two options (output-xhtml and output-xml) for
defining the output, I would think that if you using  output-xhtml, you
should not convert empty elements, with both start and end tags (i.e.,
<empty></empty) to an empty element with a single tag (i.e., <element />).
If you are using output-xml, then doing the conversion makes sense, IMO.

I hope that made some sense.
