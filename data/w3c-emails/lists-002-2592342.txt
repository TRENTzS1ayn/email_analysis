What Howard said.  Yes, Rick is right about some HTML tags having required 
end tags (e.g. <SCRIPT></SCRIPT>).  But, as you suggest, I did the change 
only for generic XML output.

Also, there are really two changes: 1) eliminate extra vertical whitespace 
and 2) canonicalize empty tags.  I think 1) is a keeper (and would like to 
do the same for (X)HTML).  I'm not as confident about 2).  Still, because 
they are equivalent, I would still prefer to go with a consensus and/or 
conservative decision than to add an yet-another-option on a fairly minor 
point.

How about a compromise?:
<foo>
     <bar />
     <bar></bar>
</foo>

This way there is no tag elimination, but no gratuitous newline between the 
begin and end tags for empty elements.

take it easy,
Charlie
