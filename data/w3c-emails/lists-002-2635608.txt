Tidy must not insert white space to already empty elements, hence I am
fine with whatever prevents this. Since Tidy tries to normalize the
input document, it should have an option how to deal with empty elements
in general, i.e., either all are start-end-tags or all elements get an
end-tag. Tidy should not output both. This could be

  empty-elements: start-end-tag | end-tag

with start-end-tag beeing the default (docs should note this option is
ignored when in HTML/XHTML mode), but if people do not think this is
necessary, I can live without and always use start-end-tag notation.
