I don't think anyone is actively supporting a port of Tidy to Mandrake, at
least according to the following link for Linux distributions of Tidy :

<http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=tidy>

And since I am not a Mandrake user, I will have some difficulty helping you.

Specifically what version (date) of the source code did you download (from
where), and what sort of errors did you get? Chances are, the errors could
be fixed quite simply, since the code is quite portable (and appears to be
maintained for some Linux distributions).

And when you say binary, again what version, what platform was it compiled
for, and where did you download it from?

I'm sure if there are any Mandrake users out there, they will speak up.
