I'm not personally a Word-2000 user, but we do include various Word
documents in our regression tests for Tidy. The files probably range in
size from 20 K to 100 K. I couldn't tell you how complex the documents are,
but they are usually from real-world cases.

The Word-2000 support in Tidy is improving all the time.

Do you have a specific task in mind or concern? i.e. have you tried current
versions of Tidy, and if you are unhappy with the results, please report
any bugs and provide the Word-2000 files etc.

I'm sure users that Tidy Word-2000 documents regularly, will speak up.
