I downloaded the latest source code from the official tidy page (I believe it
was June 7 or 9).  When I get it, I just dont know what to do.  There is a
Makefile.  Can I use this somehow?  Can someone give me step-by step
instructions or tell me if they already exist? like:
    1. ./Makefile
    2. gcc tidy.c
    3. make install
    4. tidy
NOTE these are not even close to how to install.
I dont think that there's any problem with my configuration, just that I dont
know what I'm doing.  I've found that most source distros have an INSTALL file
with simple instructions to install the program, so I'm without a clue when
there's no step-by-step instructions.  I think practically everyone here has
more experience with *nix than me, so you'll probably (hopefully) be able to
figure this one out.
