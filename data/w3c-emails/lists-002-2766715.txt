Hi Jeff,

Actually, no, I don't believe Tidy will pass tabs to the output.  Your 
<pre> elements should still be OK, however.  By default, Tidy expands these 
to 8 spaces - which is what the browsers will use as well.  So, given that 
you are displaying with a fixed pitch font in a <PRE> element, all should 
be well.

Now, I presume there is something wrong with the statement above, otherwise 
you wouldn't have sent your note.  Can you send a sample that illustrates 
the problem?  Also, what browser?

take it easy,
Charlie
