Sorry to bother you, but do you know when you might have a new batch of
source code available on http://tidy.sourceforge.net/ that contains the
above patch?  I tried to access the CVS archives but my company does not
allow CVS access outside of our network so my only access would be the
source code link on the above page.  If you don't have time, I'll just wait
for the August 1st from Rick Parsons.  

PS: I tried to download the July 7th source code but for some reason winzip
has problems reading the file.  I get the following error:
Error reading header after processing 0 entries

PPS: I just wanted to thank Mr. Parsons for putting the MinGW binary release
together each month.

Thanks.
