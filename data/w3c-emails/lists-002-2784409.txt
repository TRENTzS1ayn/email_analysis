Hi Ellery,

"make install" should copy the binary file to /usr/local/bin.  You can 
change the location by updating INSTALLDIR in the Makefile.  It will also 
update the permissions to give group and world read/execute privs and 
change the group and owner to "bin".  Have a look at the "install" make 
target for details.

Have you got the build working yet?  Also, for x86, you may be able to use 
one of the other Linux binaries directly - or am I showing my Linux 
ignorance?

take it easy,
Charlie
