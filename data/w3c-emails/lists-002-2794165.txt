Hi Howard,

I checked in the change as last agreed.  It should appear in the next 
source snapshot.  We'll check all the changes on the mainline into the 
library branch before we finish.

If you need a Win32 binary, I can posted one on my home page at:
http://users.rcn.com/creitzel/tidy.exe.  It includes support for 
accessibility checks and asian and UTF16 encodings.

take it easy,
Charlie
