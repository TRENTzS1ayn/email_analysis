While it isn't explicitly stated on the web site, these beta releases are
primarily for people who know what they are doing <grin>. A real release in
the future will likely to have some kind of "INSTALL" file.

But Charlie basically has it correct. I don't use the Makefile much on my
platform, but when I do, I typically just do a build of Tidy, and don't
even bother installing it.

e.g.

make tidy

I don't expect there should be any issues on your platform, but if you need
to override settings in the Makefile, you can probably do so in the
standard way.

e.g.

make tidy CC=cc

And as Charlie says, a Linux_x86 pre-built binary may just work out of the box.
