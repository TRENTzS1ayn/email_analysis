Not more than 100 K?

I have a real task to convert .doc to .html.
I want to know something beforehand, because although I have one more way
to convert .doc to .html, but results till now are not as desired.

TT> I'm sure users that Tidy Word-2000 documents regularly, will speak up.
I hope so. And ask users who use Tidy for cleaning Word2000 documents to
answer.
