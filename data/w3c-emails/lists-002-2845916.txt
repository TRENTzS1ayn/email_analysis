I am converting Word to HTML through a few steps.
Save word as HTML
Make some manual changes to the document to support fields
Run Microsofts "filter.exe" on the document
Run Tidy on the document to output xhtml, but not using the option 
designed for word html.

Make some more manual changes
Do a transform using xslt 

I have some specific needs and thus found I had to use all these steps.
I am doing this on some "large" word docs  about 200Kb

Tidy is working very consistently so I am happy. 
The only weirdness I have found is that non-ascii text inside comments is 
getting mangled, I cut the comments out, run tidy, then paste the comments 
back in, no longer commented out.  My xslt transform handles them then.
