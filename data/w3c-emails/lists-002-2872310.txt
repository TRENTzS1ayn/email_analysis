Hi Nadezhda,

The original reason I started using Tidy was to do Word-To-HTML 
conversion.   MS has published an improved filter, which I believe Fred 
uses.  For information on how to get and use the MS filter, see:
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q291325

Maintaining files in Word is convenient if you need both PDF and HTML 
output.  We found a bit of prep work on the Word side helped a great 
deal.  In particular, getting folks to use Word styles like Heading 1, 2, 3 
and apply styles for bullet and numbered lists.  These come through to HTML 
as class attributes for applying fonts, colors, etc.  The only 
post-processing we needed to do was to insert a link to our real CSS 
stylesheet.  A very simple sed script did the trick.

About size, Tidy is an in-memory program.  But with most computers having 
tens of MB of RAM available, it would take a huge document to blow it 
out.  To guesstimate the RAM needed, take the HTML file size and double or 
triple it.

hope this helps,
Charlie
