There is, I think, currently only one glaring omission in Tidy.  Many
times, when we only want the *structural* markup, we need to get rid of
**ALL** presentational markup leftovers, including the embedded style
sheet.  Right now, the closest we can come to that is by applying
"clean" and "drop-font-tags", but that leaves droppings like this still
hanging around:

    <style type="text/css">
    /*<![CDATA[*/
 p.c1 {font-style: italic; text-align: justify}
    /*]]>*/
    </style>

...

    <p class="c1">...</p>

To get rid of this you have to manually delete the style section and
then do a regex search & replace to get rid of all the 'class=".*"'
attributes.  A 

strip-presentation: yes/[NO]

option (or similar idea) would be extremely useful.  And rather than
have to set *two* options -- like 'clean' and 'drop-font-tags', which
you currently have to set to get even part of the way there -- it should
be a "one size kills all":  get rid of all FONT & CENTER elements,
ALIGN, BGCOLOR, & BACKGROUND attributes etc., and *not* replacing them
with CLASS attributes and *not* creating an embedded style section.

Thanks,
