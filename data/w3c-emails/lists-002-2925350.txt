No, -bare turns it either into something like this

<p class="c3"> </p>

or this

<p> </p>

which means there are no &nbsp;'s, but it doesn't actually remove
content-void "paragraphs" that were only put there for visual effects in
various browsers.

I'm also looking at things like 

    <p class="c3"><br />
    </p>

(and other variations thereof).   IMO, a 'strip-presentation' option
should also remove all such content-void paragraphs, headings, and
list-items.
