(1) wants a single option to drop presentation stuff entirely,
(2) and for this to also strip class= attributes.

I agree with (1).
But when mapping from XML to HTML I like to use the class= attribute
to record the original XML element type.  If you have an information
retrieval system that tries to exploit element structure (and this is
one very good reason for wanting to have only structural elements
there) then you might want to use the *original* element types in your
indexing, if you know them.  I know someone who is building just such an
information retrieval system, so I wouldn't go along with (2).
What I want instead is a way for presentation stripping not to touch
class attributes at all.
