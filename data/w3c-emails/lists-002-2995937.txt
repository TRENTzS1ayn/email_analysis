Ah, I wasn't clear.  I didn't mean for Tidy to strip *all* class
attributes, just the ones *it* builds internally to replace <FONT> tags,
etc. when the "clean" option is specified (Tidy names these classes
"c1", "c2", ...).  

Class attributes in the original markup should of course be left intact.
