That's how I interpreted it.  I think author assigned class attributes are 
highly "structural" in the sense they are one of the few ways to add 
semantic meaning to presentation oriented markup.  Because of this, class 
attributes are prime candidates for XPath statements in XSLT 
transforms.  Which, I believe, is another way to say what Richard said.

As a practical matter, it will be difficult to distinguish author-supplied 
from Tidy-generated class attributes.  Better to simply not generate 
them.  But this is an implementation detail.

take it easy,
Charlie
