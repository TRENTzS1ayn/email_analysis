In the past, I have used Tidy with NotePad Pro, and found it extremely 
helpful in cleaning up html files generated by
MS Word 97. Recently, I upgraded to OFFICE XP and found that my tidy file 
had disappeared.

I still use NotePad Pro very heavily, and would like to re-install 
HTML-Tidy to work in conjunction with it. But - I don't know where to find 
the file and how to install it.

Can you help?
