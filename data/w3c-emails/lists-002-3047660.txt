* Download the tidy.exe executable from the tidy website, and put it in a 
separate directory or in the Notetab directory. Either use the old August 
4 2000 version: http://tidy.sourceforge.net/other/tidy04aug00.exe
 or the latest builds offered for the windows platform.

* The config file Notetab uses is "tidy.cfg" in the Notetab directory. 
Without a config file you get the default choices. I can send a sample config 
file if you like. See http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html for a 
long list of possible options for the current builds.

* Now, when you choose 'Tools > Tidy HTML code' (or Ctrl+F7), Notetab will 
ask where the tidy executable is located. Locate it, and you're finished.
