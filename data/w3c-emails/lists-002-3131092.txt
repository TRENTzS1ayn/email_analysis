Hello,

If I?m managing a large volume of HTML pages, is there any tools that I can
use to satisfy the table ?summary? attribute requirements without going to
each page and modify it manually?

PS.  Am I overlooking or I don?t see any options for me to add the
?summary? attribute under the configuration file setting(HTML tidy) ?

Thanks ahead.
