Just to add to Rijk's excellent post, the most recent Windows version of
Tidy is at

http://users.rcn.com/creitzel/tidy.exe

You can drop it in the Notetab Pro folder directly, or put it in some
other folder that's in your path.  If you do the latter, it makes it
easier to run Tidy standalone anywhere on your system.
