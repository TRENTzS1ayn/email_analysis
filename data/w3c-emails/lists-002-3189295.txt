Specifically :

I guess I differ in opinion that Tidy is wrong <grin>. But then again I
don't use this feature on my platform.

You didn't say exactly what your platform was (I assume it is some form of
UN*X), and whether you built Tidy yourself, or downloaded one of the
pre-built versions.

Is HOME set to "/root"? In which case is that the home directory for "root"
on your system, and are you logged in as "root"? If not logged in as
"root", and HOME is not set to your home directory, then maybe the open
failed due to a permissions problem. Or is environment variable HTML_TIDY
set? Perhaps you need to put a dummy ".tidyrc" in other places as well as
"/root".

Hope this helps.
