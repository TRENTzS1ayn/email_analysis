I might add that, if you are going to use sed, awk or some regex-type text 
replacement on HTML files, do it on Tidy output.  The pattern matching will 
work much more reliably on a consistent layout.  If you like, Tidy it again 
afterwards, but it shouldn't be necessary.

I have used sed in just this way to assign stylesheets.  Out of a few 
hundred files, I only had to fix two or three by hand.

And, yes, do all your sed mangling on a _copy_.

take it easy,
Charlie
