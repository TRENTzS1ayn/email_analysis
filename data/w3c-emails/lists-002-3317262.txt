I think the simple answer is that the parsed text is not null terminated 
and care must be taken when accessing these fields.  Further, Tidy (and 
JTidy) stores characters internally as UTF-8 characters (most of the time), 
so you'll probably need to unmangle the text before you can use 
it.  Probably easier to use Tidy to emit clean XHTML and then use SAX or 
DOM tools to manipate the tree.

take it easy,
Charlie
