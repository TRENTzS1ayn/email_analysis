Hello,

I am looking at using TidyCOM in an ASP application, to clean up HTML that 
users type into a textarea.

On the TidyCOM home page (http://perso.wanadoo.fr/ablavier/TidyCOM/ ), I find 
this warning:
"""
Warning: TidyCOM's code is not re-entrant--no more than 1 instance of 
TidyObject should be alive at the same time in the same process.
"""

Pardon my ignorance about ASP (I'm more of a Zope person), but does this mean 
only one TidyObject may exist in the entire ASP application? If that's the 
case, I guess I have to do a queue-and-mutex thing.

Any advice or recommendations of alternatives appreciated.
