I might be way off and have not used TidyCOM , but in ASP 
you could probably ensure creating a single object of 
TidyCom by declaring it as an application variable.
Thanks

Hello,

I am looking at using TidyCOM in an ASP application, to 
clean up HTML that 
users type into a textarea.

On the TidyCOM home page 
(http://perso.wanadoo.fr/ablavier/TidyCOM/ ), I find 
this warning:
"""
Warning: TidyCOM's code is not re-entrant--no more than 1 
instance of 
TidyObject should be alive at the same time in the same 
process.
"""

Pardon my ignorance about ASP (I'm more of a Zope person), 
but does this mean 
only one TidyObject may exist in the entire ASP 
application? If that's the 
case, I guess I have to do a queue-and-mutex thing.

Any advice or recommendations of alternatives appreciated.
