Hello html-tidy,

  I used to use Dave Raggett's html-tidy on my Win9x machines. Now I
  have WinXP and want to use a recent html-tidy version (especially to
  integrate with NoteTab Pro).

  Unfortunately, I can't make sense of the page at
  http://tidy.sourceforge.net/; I guess I don't understand the
  terminology. Will someone reply with the download link to the
  executable file I need?

  Thanks.

Best regards,
 Quin
