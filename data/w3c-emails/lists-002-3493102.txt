Hi,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but...

I am marking students' lab tutorials, the first thing I need to do is to
check if anyone whose HTML file (they submitted the HTML file
electronically) fails to pass the HTML Tidy.  By that I mean it generates
at least one "error".
 
Say I'd like to write a DOS batch file OR a UNIX script file, so that it
runs through all the html files in one directory.  Check out the validity,
then return any files (i.e. print out the file name) that has at least 1
errors.  In other words, any files that do NOT checked with:
   0 warning, 0 errors were found!
will have its file name printed on screen.  I am not worried about the "0
warning" section, only the "0 errors" (well, any files that do not produce
"0 errors").

I'm not sure how to write such a file, either is DOS or UNIX.  In fact I
would really appreciate it if one can quickly come up with a solution and
send it to me :-)


Cheers,

Kevin
