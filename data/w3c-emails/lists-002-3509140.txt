Dear all,
    I tried to use the web base HTML Validator (validator.w3.org) and compare the result with HTML tidy
    The result is not too good as the HTML validator is more strict in following the HTML 4.0 standard.
    i.e.  for HTML code "<body leftmargin="0" topmargin="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" b ..."

    HTML Validator will report error on leftmargin, topmargin, marginwidth,...  While HTML tidy don't have these error mention at all.

    Is there any option in HTML tidy that I could turn on and have it work the same as HTML Validator?
    Or is there any other software that could do the similar thing as HTML Validator?

Thanks.
