Using the online Tidy feature is challenging to say the least. Is one to
presume that this is an upload service that requires a fully delimited
computer address?  Or, does it require a URI address? That is the first
problem. The second, is that clicking on the "get tidy results" button loads
the cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/tidy file with a 403 "forbidden access" error
message. So, the question becomes: how can one CORRECTLY use this service?
