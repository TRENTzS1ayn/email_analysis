Don't, setXHTML(true);
This will return html namespace.

Subject: Java Tidy







I have been using TidyCOM for quite some 
time. Recently I started using Java version 
of Tidy --tidy.jar

After it parses a HTML file the output of the 
Java version of tidy has the default XHTML namespace
like this.

&lt;html
xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&#34;&gt;

This causes a problem with the programs that use
this output. Of course I could programatticaly remove
the namespace declaration. 

But  I wonder how to turn the xmlns generation off.
This does not happen with TidyCOM.

Thanks in advance.

Arun
