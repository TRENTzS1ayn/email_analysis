Octavian,

Regarding the first section of your note, I think that what you are saying
is largely a matter of opinion. In any case, it will need to be taken up
with the standards authorities, possibly via your national association. The
HTML Tidy volunteer team are only attempting to implement those standards
which are defined.

Regarding Unix, one has to remember that Linux is not the only fruit.

Regarding the second section, as I understand it, the accessibility checking
is an optional part of the Tidy build as is the Asian languages support so
it would be practical to compile a version without these features.
Certainly, for my own build (the one for Win32 MinGW available from the
project page), I have compiled it without them at the moment, although I am
considering generating alternate binary options in the future.
