Hi Octavian,

Sorry I missed your post earlier.  You can force Tidy to produce output, 
even if there are errors.  Use the option: --force-output yes.  See

http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#force-output

Thanks for the information about screen readers, btw.  Rick has a point, 
the existing accessibility checks are based on HTML specifications.  The 
intention of the HTML specs is to make it easier to write screen 
readers.  But very few web sites are written to HTML specs.  So real-world 
screen readers work with what they get.  I am glad to hear it.

It will be difficult for Tidy to adapt to several, different screen 
readers.  I believe the platform (Windows, Linux, etc.) is the least of the 
problem.  Rather, it is the variable capabilities of interpreting web pages.

take it easy,
Charlie
