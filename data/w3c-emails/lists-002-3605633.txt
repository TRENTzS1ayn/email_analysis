Hi Junnare,

I am not familiar with TidyDBG, where did you get it?

Anyway, for general use of Tidy, Dave Raggett maintains the best 
introduction document.  See his original Tidy page at:

http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/

There is also a half-decent quick reference at:

http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html

You can find easy links to both of these near the top of the Tidy project 
home page at http://tidy.sourceforge.net/.

For XHTML conversion, use -asxhtml (short for --output-xhtml yes).  Other 
useful options are "clean" (-c).  Some folks like numeric-entities for 
non-HTML-aware XML utiltities.

References:
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#output-xhtml
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#clean
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#doctype
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#drop-font-tags
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#numeric-entities

hope this helps,
Charlie
