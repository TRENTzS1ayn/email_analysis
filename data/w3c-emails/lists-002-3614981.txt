Hello,
I have been using Tidy to validate xml for a publishing model for
several months
The system is not completely automated and I use Tidy as much as a
checker with a custom interface as much as a tool to fix xml before it
is sent to the db
The editing interface can insert a table, but does not output the quotes
on the table attributes, which is causing a problem for the processing
of that type of content
As you can see below the OutputXml option is set to true, yet the
unquoted attributes are getting through Tidy without warning
I don't know if I am missing a config option or if this is something
already known about
Any input is appreciated, thanks!
