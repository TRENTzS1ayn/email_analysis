You have forced me to tell all.  Here's the deal, I cut slide making 
support out of TidyLib.   It simply broke the overall I/O model of the 
library.  That, and there are better tools for the job, namely XSLT.

I really have no idea how many people use the -slides option.  It has 
always looked excessively hard-coded to my eye.  You really want to use 
external template files: one for the TOC and another for the individual 
slides.  The templates would contain any needed scripts or stylesheets, 
etc.  In C in TidyLib is a tricky and inflexible place to maintain that stuff.

Any arguments in favor?  If there are folks who still want to use it, Tidy 
"Classic" will still be available.  In any case, it should be built as a 
utility based on the library.

Comments?

take it easy,
Charlie
