Thank you for your feedback. Mike Lam at the Adaptive Technology Resource
Centre at the University of Toronto, was mostly responsible for the
accessibility checking implementation, and he may be able to help answer
your questions. I only helped to integrate the accessibility checking into
Tidy.

What level of accessibility checking did you request of Tidy? 1, 2, or 3?

As Rick Parsons said :

I agree. Maybe we could provide more flexibility for accessibility
checking, to relax the rules a little.

You probably need to specify the configuration option that allows you to be
shown more of the errors :

--show-errors 1000

will show the first 1000 errors for example.

>Can you let the program to correct all the errors?

I believe you can use another configuration option to ignore the errors :

--force-output yes


Hope this helps.
