FYI, even if the accessibility checking code is compiled into the code,
(this extra) accessibility checking is OFF by default (and so the original
Tidy accessibility checking is done), and you have to request the checking
either on the command line or using the configuration option :

-access <n>
--accessibility-check <n>

 where <n> = 0 (OFF - default), 1, 2, 3
