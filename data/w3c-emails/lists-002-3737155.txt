Hi,

I can't make Jtidy print the correct symbol for &euro;, it always print 
?, either I write in my HTML file &euro; or the numeric entity value 
&#8364;.

I  looked in the source code, looked in the already posted messages in 
the mailing list, but I can't find a solution ....

Can anybody help me ?

Seb
