Thanks to Fernando, I dig a little bit deeper in the understanding of 
Tidy...
Though I did not find a solution to my problem : Any entity which code 
is upper than 255 is not kept "as is".

I use the last version of Jtidy from CVS.

Here is my configuration file :
output-xhtml:true
tidy-mark:false
quote-ampersand:false
doctype:omit
char-encoding:latin1
numeric-entities:true

Here is my test string, saved in a file :
<table><tr><td>Save : 120 &euro; or 100 &pound;</td></tr></table>

Here is the ouptut :
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Save : 120 ? or 100 ?</td></tr></table>

Even if I enter the numeric value of the entities (with the 
numeric-entities property set to true), it doesn't help.
Can anybody reproduce the problem, or did I forget something ?
