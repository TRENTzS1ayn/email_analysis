Much, much better!!!  Good work.

I would kill the "Other Builds" section on the main part of the page --
it doesn't provide any relevant info (*what* other builds?  the ones in
the "ports" box on the right?  Anyway, see below...).

Probably a good idea.  Especially after you bring out Tidylib.  In the
meantime, I would just reorganize that "Other Ports of Tidy" section.
It's currently too much of jumble with a bit of everything thrown in.
Separate them from one long "box" into several boxes, something like:

------------------<snip>---------------------
Tidylib
  Tidylib *sources*
  Charlie Reitzel's *page* with Win32 binary 
    C++, Perl and COM wrappers, and a GUI 
      // the first item can be deleted/moved to the
      // main section when Tidylib is released;
      // the last can then be moved to another
      // section[s], and this whole box deleted.
