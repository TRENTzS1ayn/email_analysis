Greetings,
I (think I) tried all possible configuration options in the latest tidy:
"HTML Tidy for Windows (release date: 1st August 2002; built on Aug  8
2002, at 15:41:13)"

But whenever I run it, it converts all the &copy; symbols in my HTML
code to &169;

How can I make it keep the original &copy; ?

Thanks in advance,
Daniel
