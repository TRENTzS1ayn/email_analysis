Dear all

I am currently using the jTidy version 04aug2000r7-dev... that was the
latest one I found.

There's a problem. I tried to tidy a site that was using duplicate
attributes in a tag. Because I want to process the XML-Output with a XSLT
step my problem is that the "clean" site is no valid XML..... because of
that duplicate usage of attributes.

Does anybody know how I can solve that problem? Do I have to switch to
HTML-Tidy?

In any case I need a valid XML.

Thanks for helping
-Marc
