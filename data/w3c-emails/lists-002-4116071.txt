Hello
Could you please advise. I have built a site with Frontpage98
I have been to validatorW3 and tried to get it checked
it will not validate the code. I have been to the Tidy section
and it said that I can get the html looked at with a free service.
Do I have to download a program or can you tell what I need to do
as I wish to correct my html code to conform with W3 guide lines
Many Thanks
W Perman
