Hi Will,

Visit the Tidy home page at http://tidy.sourceforge.net/.  From there you 
will find a link to Dave Raggett's documentation, which covers many aspects 
of using tidy and HTML cleanup in general.  If you are comfortable with 
command line tools, just download one of the binaries from the Tidy page.

There are also GUI wrappers for Tidy available for Windows, Mac and some 
other platforms as well.  These will make it easier to experiment with 
different Tidy options and look at the different results and diagnostic 
messages.  Again, there are links from the Tidy page.

All of the above are simple to install.  Usually, it is just a matter of 
extracting the files from the tar/zip file (depending on your platform, 
etc.) and running the program.

If you are new to W3C compliant HTML, I might just say one thing: don't 
worry too much about it.  The things is, there are several HTML and XHTML 
standards which occasionally even conflict with one another.

Instead, I would suggest starting out by checking that your pages work in 
at least two browsers.  Usually, these are IE and Netscape, but also Opera, 
Konqueror and others have significant user bases.  Pick two you think your 
readers may be using.

Finally, Front Page is known to add a bunch of stuff to HTML that you might 
want to clean up.  There are a few Tidy options that will assist with 
this.  See:

http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#word-2000
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#clean
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#bare
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html#drop-font-tags

Give it a try and post back to the list if you have more questions.

take it easy,
Charlie
