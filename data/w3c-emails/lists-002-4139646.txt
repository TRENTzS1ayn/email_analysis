Hmmm. I use the -z option in the command to tar the files (on a Linux 2.4
[Debian 2.2] x86 machine), and here is what "file" had to say on the
current "tidy_src.tgz", as seen on a different machine:

terry_teague@usw-pr-shell1:~$ file tidy_src.tgz
tidy_src.tgz: gzip compressed data, deflated, last modified: Sun Oct  6
23:50:03 2002, os: Unix

What platform are you running on? I know there are some problems with the
binary executable tar files on some platforms, but I believe is the first
problem I have heard of about the source archive.

Regards, Terry
