Re: .gz doesn't look compressed

I seem to recall that with some web browsers, files get downloaded, given
the original name, but the web browsers uncompresses the file - leaving
you with an uncompressed file with a .gz suffix.

I don't know whether this is relevant in the current problem, but it might
be considered.
