I am running with Mingw compiled tools on x86-win32 platform.  I built
the tools myself with gcc 2.95.2.

  >tar --version
   GNU tar version 1.11.2

  >gzip --version
  gzip 1.2.4 (18 Aug 93)
  Compilation options:
  NO_DIR SYS_UTIME STDC_HEADERS NO_CHOWN PROTO

However, they do work fine.  I use them with several emacs packages
and never had any problems with them before.

I did a wget from my linux machine and used curl on the same machine.
You are correct.  Netscape 6.2.3 surprised me.  Sorry to interrupt the
html-tidy mailing continuum with crude.  Recent trojans to OpenSSH,
etc have made me paranoid.

   Netscape 6.2.3 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; WinNT4.0; en-US;
   rv:0.9.4.1) Gecko/20020508 Netscape6/6.2.3

This is indeed my problem.  Any reason for "tgz" instead of ".tar.gz".
I guess that some poor deficient OS's cann't handle them.  Netscapes
behavior is surprising.  It would probably be good to decrypt before
viewing, but not really great while saving with the same extension.

Thanks,
Bill Pringlemeir
