That's a result of

  % http-head http://tidy.sourceforge.net/src/tidy_src.tgz

The resource is beeing delivered as tar document compressed using
"x-gzip" at the protocol level. Your user agent decompressed the
resource while leaving the .tgz extension untouched. I am not sure
why Apache responds like this and I certainly don't like it; I'll
look into how to fix it.
