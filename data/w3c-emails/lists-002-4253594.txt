Hello!

I hope I am sending this to the correct place.  I have a very old site that
needs lots of help.  We are planning on doing most fixes by hand, but I
would love to use Tidy to clean up some code on multiple files.  Is there a
way to do this?

(I am on MacOS 9, and our server is running off WebStar, so I am slightly
limited on the "command line" options.  I was hoping somehow I could do this
thru the config file?)

Please let me know!

Amy
