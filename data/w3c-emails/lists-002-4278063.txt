The ampersand character is allowed in URI References and often has a
special meaning, it's usually beeing used as separator between
parameters in the query part of a URI. If it's encoded using the %hh
encoding it loses this special meaning, i.e. your link is normally
interpreted as having three parameters

  onething     = 1
  anotherthing = 2
  everything   = 1+2

if you change it to

? http://www.something.org?onething=1%26anotherthing=2%26everything=1+2

it will be interpreted as having a single parameter

  onething     = 1&anotherthing=2&everything=1+2

If Tidy converted & to %26 most links will break, that's not the
intention of that option.
