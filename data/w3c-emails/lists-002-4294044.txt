Ah, but you missed something.

It is technically  correct to use
http://www.something.org?onething=1&amp;anotherthing=2&amp;everything=1+2.

And incorrect to use onething=1&anotherthing=2
While leaving the amp; off works. That is because the browsers realize 
that everyone leaves it off and make it work.

And when using xml you have to use &amp; to keep the parsers from 
complaining.
