But differently, IE 6.0 ignores sub-sequent <br>s while Opera 6.0 and
Mozilla 1.0 insert a newline wherever they find a <br>.

The http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/quickref.html is wrong, while
tab-size defaults to 8 (changed after the mentioned discussion) it is
documented as defaulting to 4. If you replace all <br> with \n Tidy
won't mess up anything hence that's where to look at.
