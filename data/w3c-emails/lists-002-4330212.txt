Sure it is but JTidy has for some reason omitted the document type
declaration and has not inserted a XML declaration. You can enforce
this using the appropriate configuration options. Does the document
you tried to tidy contain proprietary markup?

Let Tidy output either numeric character references or a document type
declaration pointing at a DTD that defines those entities.

Btw., there is a JTidy forum at

  http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=41436

where it is more likely to find people who can help you, this mailing
list is - strictly speaking - only for discussion of the C version
command line tool.
