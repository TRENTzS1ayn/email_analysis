The point is, surely, that there *is no* "right number of spaces". 
Tabs should not be used inside PRE, precisely because there is no way 
to tell the rendering system what the tab boundaries are.

If I code
<pre>
\t\tText
  \t    More text
</pre>
then I have no right to make assumptions about how the two pieces of 
text will line up: it depends on the tab stops, which are undefined 
(and not definable). If both IE and NS have the same defaults as my 
editor, that's luck.

"Usually", not "required to be".

Mapping <br> to \n is of course another can of worms altogether.
