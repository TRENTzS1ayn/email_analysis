Got ya. <br><br> == <br> in IE.  Good eye.

Yup.  Leaving the "<br>" might be messing up the left-right (column) 
alignment.  I tried a tweak to avoid putting out newlines right after <br> 
for pre-formatted mode.  It had no real effect.  I also tried adding a 
<b></b> here and there.  My current theory is that Tidy is including the 
element names in it's character count.  This makes sense for pretty 
printing, but not for pre-formatted elements.

take it easy,
