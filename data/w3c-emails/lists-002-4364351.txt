Hi Fred,

Good to see you there.  Well, "usually" is the bread and butter of Tidy.  I 
mean, you're right.  There are no guarantees (apparently).  But we do try 
to follow the principle of "interoperable compliance with the least 
surprise".  Also, there is an option for tab-size (in chars), so you can 
always tweak it to your liking.

Agree about the worms.  I am hesitant to map <br> to \n and not do anything 
about all the other markup allowed in <pre> that will still mess up the layout.

take it easy,
Charlie
