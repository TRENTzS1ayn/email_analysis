A popular OCR program is ABBYY FineReader, which can save its output as 
HTML.  Unfortunately, it has the bad habit of adding a <br /> tag to the 
end of every paragraph, e.g.:

<p>This is an OCR'd paragraph.<br /></p>

This additional <br /> tag doesn't seem to have any effect on the 
presentation in any of the User Agents I have tested it with.

May I modify the Tidy core code to drop the <br /> tag when it appears 
at the end of a paragraph?
