Most of the time it does not, yes.

We have a feature request by Claus F?rber for this and other <br>
related issues, see

? https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=611171&group_id=27659&atid=390966

I think to create just a special case for <p>...<br /></p> is not
enough, we can remove it at the end of all block level elements and
should, as Claus proposes, move them outside inline elements if they
occur just before the closing tag of the inline element.

So, in general I agree with removing <br />s at such places, but I'd
like to see a better thought out solution than just this <p><br> special
case.

Please follow up to tidy-develop@lists.sf.net only!

regards.
