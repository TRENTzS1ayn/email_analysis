  Hi all,

  I am tidying an HTML page with JTidy and converting it into XML.  However, when I open the page in MS IE I get the following error message:

  <<Reference to undefined entity 'nbsp'. Line 36, Position 6 

  I eventually need to extract data from the XML file.   

Any suggestion on how to go about with it?

Thank you all in advance.

Roberto
