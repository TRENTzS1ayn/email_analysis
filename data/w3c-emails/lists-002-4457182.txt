I doubt it, but it can take a while for people to come up with 
answers.

I'm no expert on XML, but as far as I can tell this would only be a 
change of content if you have elem1 defined with 
xml:space='preserve', and then only the blanks would be significant 
(and not the newline). The HTML4.1 spec says (appendix B.3.1):

and this should, AIUI, also be true in XML (though I can't find 
anything in the XML spec corresponding to what I've quoted from the 
HTML one).
