This raises the question whether Tidy should remove it at all, since an
associated style sheet may specify the 'clear' behaivour. What about
warning about occurences of <br> at such places in general and
automatically remove them if they don't have a class or id attribute or
the clear attriubte has a different value than "none"?

Agreed with the same reservation as above.
