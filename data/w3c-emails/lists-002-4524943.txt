No, Jany is right here, in XML by default all white space is significant
and as she points out, Tidy changes white space in the document. I
remember some feature requests regarding XML pretty printing and bug
reports on XML vs. Tidy's treatment of white space. I am not sure how
useful Tidy is for generic XML pretty printing...
