Agreed - if both input and output character sets are Windows-1252
then Tidy shouldn't mess with valid Windows-1252 characters.

That said, I think it is bad practice to use Windows-1252 and we
should set the default to a portable character set based on Unicode.

Linux and Mac user's aren't happy with folks delivering documents
using Windows-1252 special characters when these characters have
equivalent Unicode code points. It is also the case that 
Windows-1252 TrueType fonts include the Unicode glyph tables
so that using the Unicode code points works fine on Windows.
