Hex references have worked in IE since at least 5.0 and in current
Mozilla and Opera builds for as long as I can remember.  The only
browser still in use that does not support them is Netscape 4.x, and
that browser is slowly disappearing (thankfully!:).

The main reason, IMO, for allowing hex references is entering from and
checking against the Unicode tables.  I agree with Dan -- I think having
an option for expressing character references in hex is a good idea;
something like: 

hex-references: yes/NO
