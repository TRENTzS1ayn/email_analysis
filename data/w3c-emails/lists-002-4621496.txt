Hmm.

  % tidylib --word-2000 yes
  <o:p>...</o:p>
  line 1 column 1 - Warning: <o:p> is not approved by W3C
  line 1 column 1 - Warning: inserting missing 'title' element

  </html>

Is this really intended? Does it need a proper xmlns:o to work? Or am I
encountering a bug? Without --word-2000 I get

  line 1 column 1 - Error: <o:p> is not recognized!
  line 1 column 1 - Warning: discarding unexpected <o:p>
  line 1 column 1 - Warning: plain text isn't allowed in <head> elements
  line 1 column 1 - Warning: inserting missing 'title' element
  line 1 column 9 - Warning: discarding unexpected </o:p>

That's even worse. And another one, using --word-2000 I also get

  Info: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN"
  Info: Document content looks like HTML 3.2

Neither is true; the first reminds me to a bug I really thought I had
fixed and my May 2002 standalone build does not tell me about any given
document type declaration; Did you miss that bug fix when building the
library code?

regards.
