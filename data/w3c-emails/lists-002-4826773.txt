Every 25 minutes or so, some idiot system is returning another copy 
of a message originally posted by Lee Passey around three hours ago, 
with progressively more copies of a trailer advertising "Declude 
Virus". 

This is presumably automatic, and since there's nothing in the 
headers to identify the offending system apart from its IP address, 
it probably won't stop unless someone with admin rights configures 
W3C's mail server to reject mail from 61.11.21.23.

Please?
