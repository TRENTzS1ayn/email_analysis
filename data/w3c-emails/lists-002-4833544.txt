Well, I'm not sure if what you're seeing is a bug or not.  It _is_ 
working as implemented.

The problem is that M$Word used 4 new namespaces in its documents: v, o, 
  w, and dt.  Of these four, the only tag I have seen outside an HTML 
comment block is <o:p>.

When Tidy first encounters the word-2000 option during startup, it adds 
<o:p> to its list of acceptable tags so the parser won't puke (you'll 
now get the "not approved" warning).

But when you tell Tidy that the document is a Word document, it doesn't 
really believe you.  Instead, when it gets to the cleanup phase, it 
checks to make sure it really _is_ a word document before applying the 
drastic cleanup measures.  It does this by looking for the "xmlns:o" 
attribute on the <html> tag.  If it cannot find it, it checks for a 
<meta> tag where the name is "generator" and the value contains the 
string "Microsoft".  If at least one of these conditions is not met, the 
Word-2000 cleanup is not performed, and your <o:p> tags are not removed.

I'm not sure this checking within Tidy for a real M$ file is such a good 
idea.  Micro$oft has developed a pluging for Word that produces what 
they call "filtered" html.  It doesn't contain any of the proprietary 
tags that Word otherwise uses, but it is still pretty bloated, with font 
specifications for every paragraph.  It is also lacking the Word 2000 
signature so using the --word-2000 option doesn't provide the drastic 
kind of cleanup the file still needs.
