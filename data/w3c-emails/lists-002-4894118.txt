Thanks for the encouragement. It turns out that relatively few 
people have been using the slides feature, and as a result it has
recently been moved out of the core Tidy sources. Tidy has now been 
reformulated as a library, and it would be easy enough to integrate
that with the code for the slide generation, as a separate tool.

Going forward a few years, my ambition is to evolve CSS to the point
that it won't be necessary to split a presentation into separate
files for each slide. Instead, you will be able to define a
presentation style sheet that presents one slide at a time, along
with any build and page transition effects you indicate. The Opera
browser already supports the CSS @media presentation feature and we
expect others to follow. Further work is needed in the W3C to reach
a consensus on how to adapt CSS for build and page transition
effects, although we do have some initial proposals to start from.

That would be easy enough.

If you have developed some good script snippets for this, that would
be interesting, although, in the long term, I hope this would be
replaced by CSS as I mentioned above.

Yup!

That sounds good.

Would you be willing to help with the maintenance of the slide 
generation code?  Work on Tidy has now moved to SourceForge and
volunteers are very much welcomed, see:
