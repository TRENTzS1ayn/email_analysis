Tidy is fundamentally a tool that reads in HTML cleans it up and 
writes it out again. It was developed as a program you run from the
console prompt, but there are GUI encapsulations available, e.g. 
HTML-Kit, which you might prefer.

If you are using Windows, the first step is to unzip the zip file
and place the tidy.exe file in a folder somewhere on your 
executables path. You may also want to set up a config file to save 
having to type lots of options each time you run Tidy. From
the console prompt you can run Tidy like this:


   C> tidy -m mywebpage.html

In this case, the -m option requests Tidy to write the tidied file
back to the same filename as it read from (mywebpage.html). Tidy
will give you a breakdown of the problems it found and the version
of HTML the file appears to be using.
