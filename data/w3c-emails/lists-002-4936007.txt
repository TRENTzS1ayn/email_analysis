I have a popup screen that reads as follows:

Line one states  HTML Tidy for Windows <vers 1st August 2002; built on Aug 8 2002, at 15:41:13>

Line two states   Parsing Console input <stdin>

flashing cursor


Since this my first experience with Tidy, where do I go from here?

Thanks for your time,
