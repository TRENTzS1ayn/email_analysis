We are STILL getting virus attachments from dsr@w3.org. 

This is ridiculous.

Can someone PLEASE get this resolved? 

In the meantime, can Dave Raggett unsub from this list? I know he's the
creator of Tidy, but this failure to resolve this virus issue merits an
unsub until it's fixed.

By remaining subbed, he's performing a disservice to us all.
