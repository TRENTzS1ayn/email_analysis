The Apache lists do that, and the results are not always what you 
expect.  It seems you might as well just disallow all attachments and paste 
in the markup.  Most people do anyway and at least you know what you are 
sending before you send it.

Proper attachments are convenient because most mail readers have an easy 
way to save the file locally.  I just drop files into my Tidy test 
directory and open them with TidyUI to get a quick look at the problem.  It 
saves me several steps.  Call me lazy ...

Also, it strikes me that an attachment is _less_ likely than in-line text 
to be executed as a script by the mail reader.

Sorry so picky.  Btw, who can/will actually do anything about managing this 
list?

take it easy,
Charlie
