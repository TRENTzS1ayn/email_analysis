MS Outlook 2002 doesn't any attachment to those emails here, not even a
message that it has blocked access to one (which it shows when a .EXE,
etc. is attached).

With a View Source, I do see this:

<iframe src=cid:qhth height=0 width=0>
</iframe>

???  

What is 'qhth'?  And more to the point, how are others here "seeing" the
virus?
