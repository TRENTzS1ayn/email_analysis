I say ban all attachments. If you have a Web page you want someone to
look at, post it on your site, either as an actual .htm file or as a
zipped file. 

Dave Raggett is not at fault. He's using Linux (as I am) and is not the
source of the virus emails. 

But that means that SOMEONE on this list has the klez virus, and has
done nothing about it. So, could all the Windows users PLEASE update
your anti-virus software and scan your hard drives? That way your
viruses won't negatively affect the rest of us on this list who don't
use operating systems that are outrageously susceptible to viruses and
other dreck.

Thanks.

Scott
