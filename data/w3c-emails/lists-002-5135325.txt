Subject: HTML Tidy - notes on your "pending work"

1.  I'm doing the recursion through directories with a script wrapped 
    around 'tidy'.  Its Work In Progress for me too, deciding things
    like how I pick up on local and global and command line options.

2.  I love the "convert to CSS".  Now all you need to do is make it
    build a CSS for all the files and @include that ;-)

It is against the grain of modern education to teach children to
program.
What fun is there in making plans, acquiring discipline in organizing
thoughts, devoting attention to detail, and learning to be
self-critical?
