Hi,
I just downloaded the latest version of tidy and while trying to use it I
got:

"This document has errors that must be fixed before
using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version.

You may need to move one or both of the <form> and </form>
tags. HTML elements should be properly nested and form elements
are no exception. For instance you should not place the <form>
in one table cell and the </form> in another. If the <form> is
placed before a table, the </form> cannot be placed inside the
table! Note that one form can't be nested inside another"

First, I must point out that I used to use an older version (really old) of
tidy on that same page without any pbs. Second, I know it's broken and
that's exactly why I want to use tidy!! I'm not sure what led to changing
tidy to behave as it does now but this defeats the whole purpose...
