Using the latest version, you can use the '--force-output yes'
configuration option to get a pretty printed version of the document.
Tidy does not output anything in some cases because it is not sure how
to fix the errors it encountered. It would be helpful to have a sample
document to reproduce this behaivour and probably fix Tidy.
