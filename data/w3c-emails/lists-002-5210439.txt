If there isn't one already, there probably should be a plain generic
XMLTidy (separate program from HTMLTidy), that could assume all elements
to be inline then fed an exception list of block and empty elements.

But using HTMLTidy, in your config file you might try setting

input-xml: yes
new-blocklevel-tags: ...
new-empty-tags:      ...
new-inline-tags:     ...

Where '...' would represent the entire vocabulary of the document you're
using with each element in its respective place.

Has anybody tried this?  What is the max length of the "new-*" config
options?
