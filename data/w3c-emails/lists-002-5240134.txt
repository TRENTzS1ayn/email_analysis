I can think of some cases like

  * missing end-tags
  * un-quoted attribute values
  * un-escaped <, ]> and &
  * white-space in front of the XML declaration

but then I come to think who actually writes non-wellformed XML
documents and isn't writing a fault tolerant XML processor harmful?

White-space in XML documents is in general significant, so it is hard to
actually pretty print, unless you think a style like documented in
http://www.w3.org/2000/08/lb2/ is "pretty". If not, you'd still need a
definition of what elements in the to be tidied document are inline and
block-level and if users are willing to provide this information? Who at
all needs pretty XML?
