Dear all

I try to call htmltidy from a java program. JTidy is no option due to its
bugs.

My prog reads the html in a inputstream that I'd like to pass to htmltidy. I
do not want to create a file that htmltidy will read.

Is it possilbe to use another Input for htmltidy?

Thank you for your help
-Marc
