Hello,

I have a question:

Does TIDY support Chinese character set such as GB2312 and BIG5, which can
be two bytes, three bytes and four bytes?

I processed a web page contains Chinese character by TIDY. Then the
processed web page can't be displayed correctly, where the Chinese character
can't be showed correctly.

I don't know the reason. TIDY can't process with Chinese character or I
didn't use TIDY correctly?

Thanks and Best Regards,

Jifeng Yang
