Fred,

I use JEdit 4.1pre4, the default settings of JTidy with the required  plug-ins:

Version: 1.0.1 Requirements: ErrorList >= 1.2 ? JDK >= 1.3 ? jEdit >= 4.0pre1 ? XML >= 0.7

This is an extract of a webwork sample JSP:

1 <%@ taglib uri="webwork" prefix="webwork" %>
2 <%@ taglib uri="webwork" prefix="ui" %>
3
4 <html>
5 <head>
6   <title>
7      <webwork:text name="'main.title'"/>

JTidy reports:
shop.jsp:7:Error: webwork:text is not recognized!

Please let me know if I need to provide you with some more information.

Thanks for your help,

Frank
