I'm looking at integrating Tidy into my ASP/ASP.Net/HTML editor, ASP Express - I've created a temporary app to work with it, but I have a couple of hurdles and questions I can't seem to understand or get past.
1. I created a config file to add new tags, since I use asp.net, and custom tags (user controls) are able to be created ..... 
I've tried using all of the supplied types:
  new-inline-tags: 
  new-empty-tags: 
  new-blocklevel-tags: 
  new-pre-tags: 
And I've tried adding my tags in different ways:
aspnet101:side, <aspnet101:side, <aspnet101:side>, and the last real way the tag looks: <aspnet101:side runat="server"/>
I ALWAYS get an errror message - <aspnet101:side> is not recognized
What syntax do I use in the Config file?

Also - is there a way to set Tidy so that, it will just pass over these things and tidy-up the HTML that it can?

2. What do I need to do to get permission to use it within my applications?
3. What does "Warning: discarding unexpected <aspnet101:top>" really mean? Is it just going past it, or when I choose to save the file, will this actually be deleted from the text?
4. How can I set attributes for it to ignore? In my ASP.Net custom tags, I have things like : runat = "Server"
I then, get - Warning: unknown attribute "runat"

Thank you for your great effort in this application and any help you can give me.
