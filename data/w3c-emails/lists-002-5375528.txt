What version have you tried?

`new-blocklevel-tags: aspnet101:side` should work, e.g.

  C:\>tidylib --new-blocklevel-tags x:y
  <x:y>...</x:y>
  line 1 column 1 - Warning: <x:y> is not approved by W3C
  line 1 column 1 - Warning: inserting missing 'title' element

(`tidylib` is a TidyLib based recent build of HTML Tidy)

That's the intention of these config options.

Take a look at http://tinyurl.com/2ioo

Tidy excludes this element from the tree, the result tree will not
include it.

Tidy will keep unknown attributes and warns about them.
