Thanks, yet again, for boiling that down.  It's busted like that all the 
way back to 04Aug2000.  Never do see the declared tag in the 
output.  Doesn't work without the colon ":" in the element name.  Doesn't 
work w/out "strict" or XHTML, either.  It's done been broke good.

Can anyone locate or create an example of declared tag that does work (w/ 
any version of Tidy)?  I think there is one or two in the test bed.

Interestingly, even with the ":" in the tag name (thought this might hang 
up the option parser), tidy -config decltag.ini decltag.html -show-config 
accurately shows the declared tag.

Can someone besides me break out the debugger on this one?  I _was_ going 
to write some API docs for TidyLib. <g>  I was also going fix character set 
handling for TidyATL.

Have a good weekend all.

take it easy,
Charlie
