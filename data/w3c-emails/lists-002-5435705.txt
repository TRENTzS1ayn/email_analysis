B"H

Actualy I work with Meir Kogan, and I have the string as a BSTR Which as far
as I understand is just wchar_t * with a length.
The vbscript page that I am getting it from is set to use codepage 65001
i.e. utf8. So I am asuming its utf8 stored in an array of wchar_t however
that works. I was thinking of redfining the tidy string (whats it called
cbmtstr?) to use wchar_t and then rely on the config file to alter the
internal ... or to just cast the bstr to byte* and put it in the buffer. or
maybe I'm way off.

thanks for all the help.
