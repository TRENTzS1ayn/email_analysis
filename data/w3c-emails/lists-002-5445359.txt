Hi Moshe,

Just to get it straight, are you using TidyLib directly or via the ATL 
wrapper?   It will make a difference.

If using TidyLib and the BSTR directly, I'd just use UTF16LE character 
encoding.  If the BSTR is not NULL terminated (my memory escapes me), just 
attach a TidyBuffer to it and call tidyParseBuffer().


int tidyParseBSTR( TidyDoc tdoc, BSTR content )
{
     int rc = 0;
     TidyBuffer buf;
     tidyBufAttach( &buf, content, ::SysStringByteLen(content) );
     tidyOptSetCharEncoding( tdoc, _T("UTF16LE") );
     return tidyParseBuffer( tdoc, &buf );
}

hth,
Charlie
