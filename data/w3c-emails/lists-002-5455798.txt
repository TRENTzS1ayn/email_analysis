Hi Moshe,

I think I figured out the "right thing to do" with ParseString() and 
SaveString().  Anyway, I updated TidyATL and put it up on my Tidy 
page.  Works on my system, but it did before as well.   Can you give it a 
try on yours?

http://users.rcn.com/creitzel/tidy.html#comatl

For those just tuning in, Microsoft COM uses Unicode (UTF16LE) 
internally.  So, for the ParseString() and SaveString() methods, TidyATL 
now temporarily forces the encoding to UTF16LE.  It restores the original 
setting upon return for use w/ file operations.

This seems like a general issue when using memory-to-memory operations with 
the library.  One needs to be aware that the in-memory representation can 
be different than the on disk and set the Tidy encoding options appropriately.

Btw, the function is tidySetCharEncoding(), my mistake.  You can find most 
of the tidy functions in tidy.h.  The enum definitions are in tidyenum.h 
and there are a handful of methods in buffio.h and fileio.h relating to, 
buffer and file sources and sinks.

take it easy,
Charlie
