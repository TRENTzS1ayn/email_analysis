If some of us were forthcoming, we would have to put it on every page
we've on in the last 3 and a half years.  :)

I've seen such before, as in ...

http://www.iol.ie/~alank/xml/icons.htm

The "winning" graphic isn't listed any more (it wasn't my submission --

Not sure of the value of such -- it *might* promote Tidy more.  Or not.
But heh, if folks want a graphic, why not?  You could even have a
similar contest.
