Your opinion isn't what counts here :)
Validity is measured by the HTML specs and its formal definition as an SGML 
application. This issue is not a problem for browsers, which aren't real 
SGML parsers anyway. But the fix doesn't harm browsers either. See 
http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/problems.html#script for a good 
explanation.
