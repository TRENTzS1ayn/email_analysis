I have a CMS app that stores chunks of HTML into a database, however am 
noticing that the code provided by the editor isn't that clean and 
would like to use Tidy to clean it up.

The only problem is that we have added some of our own custom tags to 
the html.

Is there any way to provide Tidy with an exceptions list of tags to 
ignore?

Cheers,
