Why not add the custom tags in the internal subset (after DOCTYPE)
or build a custom DTD which includes the real one and your tags.
I use this to build my homepage. The custom tags are removed in the
process and Tidy cleans the result up.

This would let you parse and test your files using tools such as SP and
so on.
