Case 1:

As Christophe has pointed out, this is a valid warning and the escaped 
output is equivalent to your input.  I.e. Tidy successfully fixes the problem.

Case 2:

Got one.  See http://tidy.sf.net/bug/630990.  Bj?rn is currently working on 
that exact problem.  It was introduced by me <g> when I tweaked the parser 
to allow empty <SCRIPT> elements.  See http://tidy.sf.net/bug/443678.

In the meantime, the problem is easily worked around by adding a space 
after any plain "less than" operator (<) in your Javascript.

E.g.
Change:
for ( i=0; i<N; ++i )

To:
for ( i=0; i < N; ++i )

take it easy,
Charlie
