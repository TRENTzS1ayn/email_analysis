Hello All,

Some new on TidyLib:  Terry has moved the nightly build for a few Linux 
platforms (Alpha, Sparc and x86) over to TidyLib.  I have updated the 
project page to describe the lib based executables and to include my intro 
to TidyLib.  We are very close now to moving TidyLib into the mainline.

See the Tidy project page for details: http://tidy.sourceforge.net/.  All 
feedback and bug reports, as always, are appreciated.

take it easy,
Charlie
