Hi

I have searched the web page without success. My question is:

Is there a TidyToMem function (similar as the one in TidyCom.dll) planned in
the Tidy-project? The problem with the function available in the TidyCom.dll
component is that it is painfully slow and still uses TidyToFile at the end.

Grateful for all responses,
/Diana
