Hi Lucas,

Just get it straight, exactly which COM wrapper are you using?  I did a 
refresh of Andr?'s version last spring.  Since then, I did a brand new one 
based on TidyLib.
I call the new one TidyATL to distinguish it from Andr?'s original.

Anyway, I just looked at that page and I do not see what you see.  I see 
four (4) tables: 1 for the header, 1 for the body and two for the 
footer.  Each is closed perfectly well.  Tidy accurately parses and prints 
all four.

In fact, that page is fairly clean.  The only warnings are the usual 'table 
lacks "summary" attribute' and the odd empty paragraph used for vertical 
spacing.

Have another look and see if you still see the problem or perhaps you test 
on a copy of an older version of the page.  If the latter, can you send a 
small sample that reproduces the behavior?

take it easy,
Charlie
