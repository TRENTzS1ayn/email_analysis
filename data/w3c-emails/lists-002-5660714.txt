Hi Diana,

As I mentioned to Lucas, I have written a new COM wrapper based on 
TidyLib.  The COM wrapper doesn't expose all of the bells and whistles of 
the pure C library, but it uses no temp files for ParseString() and 
SaveString() methods.

You can pull it from my home page at http://users.rcn.com/creitzel/tidy.html

For the basics on the API, which have changed from Andr?'s version, check 
out the Intro to TidyLib at http://tidy.sf.net/libintro.html.  The API 
isn't exact, but the differences are only slight spelling changes.  Also, 
in VB (or what have you), code completion popups should help you find the 
right methods for setting the options you need.

enjoy,
Charlie
