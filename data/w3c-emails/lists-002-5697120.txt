True, but that problem was only with empty tags which, apparently, have 
never worked until now.

Actually, there were two problems.  One was a config file parsing problem, 
which caused problems whenever you declared more than one type of tag (on 
sequential lines).  The other was declared empty tags never getting added 
to parse tree.   I checked in fixes to both in the library branch last week.
