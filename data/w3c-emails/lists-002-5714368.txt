Are these fixes in the binaries on your page?  I just re-downloaded the
Win32 command line version and tested it on this:

    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Test</title>
    </head>
    <body>

    <aspx:header runat="server"/>

    <aspx:someblock foo="bar">block content</aspx:someblock>

    <p>A paragraph with <aspx:someinline foo="bar">inline 
    content</aspx:someinline>

    </body>
    </html>

with this config file:

    output-xhtml: yes
    doctype: strict
    wrap-asp: yes
    tidy-mark: no
    new-empty-tags: aspx:header
    new-blocklevel-tags: aspx:someblock
    new-inline-tags: aspx:someinline

And this is all I get as output:

    <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

    <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <head>
      <title>Test</title>
    </head>

    <body>
    </body>
    </html>


What happened to the aspx:* elements?
