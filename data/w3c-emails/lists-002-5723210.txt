Yes.  Terry has been busy lately getting the overnight builds to use 
TidyLib.  I just updated the command line executable on the Tidy homepage 
to the new, TidyLib-based executable.

We are in a period of transition.  You can tell the binaries that are based 
on TidyLib by the green background in the table.  Hope it is subtle enough 
:->  I just updated the homepage to indicate the most recent additional 
platforms (check the dates).

To get the latest TidyLib sources, you are encouraged to use CVS.  Just 
pull sources from the TIDYLIB_0_1 branch.

take it easy,
Charlie
