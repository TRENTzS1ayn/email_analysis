 There is one problem tho' If there is no config file, OR a  particular user control is NOT listed, it will list a warning AND delete the tag completely from the file....there are a couple of other  inconsistencies which also delete the controls, but I  haven't nailed down a repeatable scenario for -- I'll  continue down that trail tomorrow.
 
One question: 
Is there a particular way to list multiple user controls in  the new empty tags section? (I've been separating them by a comma, and then a space, just like in a sentence) - also, is there a limit to the number of new tags you can add here? I'm finding I wasn't too consistent in my naming conventions and have a lot of different prefixes defined for the same tags in different pages (one page might be xprs - then another page might be aspx - but they're all header, footer, or sidebar, for example). Therefore, I'm trying to put all  the possibilities into the config file, in the new empty tag section.

  Works for me.  I get the warnings, but the tags are not dropped anymore.

  tidy -config empty.tidy empty.html > empty.out.html

  take it easy,
