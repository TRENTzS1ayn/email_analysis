B"H

Or at least soon they will be.

I have just posted the necessary code change to the Dev list
for the project managers to add Unicode 16 encoding to tidy.

Now Smart Quotes are really just special characters. part of Unicode. and although tidy was supporting part of Unicode it was only able to handle characters that can be represented with one byte (8 bits).

Now that that will be fixed we will be able to have smart quotes, Russian/crylic, Greek, Hebrew, etc.
