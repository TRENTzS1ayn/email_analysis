I checked the FAQ's at http://www.boutell.com/faq/, as advised, but I found 
no mention of Tidy.

Can anyone tell me...

1) If Tidy can indeed clean up FrontPage documents, and

2) If it can, is their an online guide that shows you how to get started? 
The page at
http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/ says "Tidy is not yet a Windows 
program," yet the program I downloaded was advertised as Windows compatible.

Thanks.
