Hi all,

I just downloaded the 2-dec-2002 src for tidy, compiled it on an alpha
running OSF (`uname -a` => OSF1 is01 V4.0 1229 alpha alpha), but I'm
getting a segmentation fault.  I noticed you haven't provided a built
for OSF/alpha, but I thought someone on your team might know the fix
quicker than me.  I compiled with gcc 3.2, with -g, and got the
following:

libe1@is01 (~/software/tidy): gdb bin/tidy

Answer jump out at anyone?

(If it's relevant, this machine didn't have libtool installed, so I
built and installed GNU Libtool 1.4.3 for this install of tidy.)

Thanks for an (otherwise) great program!
