Entities are declared in the document type definition. If you do not
reference the DTD ("no doctype"), the entities are not declared and
thus SGML tools (and for XHTML, XML tools) will reject the document
due to references to undeclared entities. Tidy does not output named
character references (entity references) to avoid this situation, so,
yes, this is "normal".
