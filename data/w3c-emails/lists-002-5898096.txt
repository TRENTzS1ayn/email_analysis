I've a case where I'd like to use tidy to check files marked up with a
blend of ColdFusion and HTML.  ColdFusion is a preprocessor type application
server language (think PHP, ASP, etc.).

Right now, I have the following in a tidy config file:

new-inline-tags: CFABORT, CFAPPLET, CFAPPLICATION, CFASSOCIATE, CFAUTHENTICATE, CFBREAK, CFCACHE, CFCOL, CFCOLLECTION, CFCONTENT, CFCOOKIE, CFDIRECTORY, CFELSE, CFELSEIF, CFERROR, CFEXIT, CFFILE, CFFTP, CFGRIDCOLUMN, CFGRIDROW, CFGRIDUPDATE, CFHEADER, CFHTMLHEAD, CFHTTPPARAM, CFINCLUDE, CFINDEX, CFINPUT, CFINSERT, CFLDAP, CFLOCATION, CFMAIL, CFMODULE, CFOBJECT, CFPARAM, CFPOP, CFPROCPARAM, CFPROCRESULT, CFREGISTRY, CFSCHEDULE, CFSEARCH, CFSET, CFSETTING, CFSLIDER, CFSTOREDPROC, CFTEXTINPUT, CFTHROW, CFTREEITEM, CFUPDATE, CFWDDX
new-blocklevel-tags:  CFFORM, CFGRID, CFHTTP, CFIF, CFLOCK, CFLOOP, CFOUTPUT, CFQUERY, CFREPORT, CFSCRIPT, CFSELECT, CFSWITCH, CFCASE, CFDEFAULTCASE, CFTABLE, CFTRANSACTION, CFTREE, CFTRY, CFCATCH

However, 

HTML Tidy for Solaris (vers 1st June 2002; built on Jun 11 2002, at 06:28:18)


is generating this type of error:

line 1 column 1 - Warning: <cftry> is not approved by W3C

line 6 column 1 - Warning: <cfif> unexpected or duplicate quote mark

line 8 column 1 - Warning: missing </cfsetting> before </cfif>

etc.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to get tidy and ColdFusion pages to
work better together?
