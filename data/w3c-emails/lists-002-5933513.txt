I'm trying to use tidy, not as a beautifier, but as an error detector.
And as an error detector, the output generated still mixes info about
the CF tags with the real errors/warnings (and in fact, I have concerns
that real warnings are masked because of the CF warnings).

Tidy is the tool that CF developers on Linux/Solaris/HP-UX are often
told to use for doing syntax checking - I had assumed that I was just
missing some sort of options to actually be able to do this.
