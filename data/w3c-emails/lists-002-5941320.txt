Unfortunately, this is a case of "damned if you do, damned if you 
don't".  Escaping regular URLs is necessary to get them to work properly in 
Netscape browsers.  However, you break Javascript embedded in href 
attributes.

FWIW, I couldn't find Javascript links <a href="javascript: ...">foo</a> 
described anywhere in the HTML spec.  So we may be in a gray area of 
compliance with the _Recommendation_.  Certainly, the W3C has a track 
record of playing fast and loose with URI attributes (think of XML Namespaces).

take it easy,
Charlie
