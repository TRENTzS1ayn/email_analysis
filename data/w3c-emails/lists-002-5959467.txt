"Don't do that" is hardly consistent with Tidy's goal of fixing up markup, 
is it?  We usually only resort to that answer when faced with a 
functionality conflict or sheer difficulty.  We have neither in this case.

Well, Tidy supports a number of HTML features that are not defined by any 
W3C Recommendation.  So, fine, it isn't in the rec. However it is already 
in use by thousands, if not millions, of pages.  The typical use is for 
opening a link in a new window with a certain size and position.  It is a 
bit late to say, "no one should use it."

References to RFCs are only as normative as the Recommendation itself - 
which isn't.  It is a recommendation.  This fact is clearly demonstrated by 
the lack of compliance with all (X)HTML Recommendations by all known 
browsers and other clients.  In fact, Tidy exists entirely because of the 
gaps between the recs and working implementations.

Again, Javascript URLs are a de facto standard that works reasonably well 
on  all browsers and other markup processors.

That is your opinion.  I hope you agree that what Tidy does and what will 
or will not be changed is ultimately a consensus decision by the group.

take it easy,
