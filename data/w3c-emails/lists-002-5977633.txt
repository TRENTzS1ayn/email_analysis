Hello,

When using HTML Tidy on a file containing a link like this:

<a href="#A Stupid Link With Spaces">
.
.
.
.
<a name="A Stupid Link With Spaces">


it is transformed to this:

<a href="#A%20Stupid%20Link%20With%20Spaces">
.
.
.
.
<a name="A Stupid Link With Spaces">

The property "name" of a tag <a> should also be modified... Under IE5.5 the link doesn't work :(

Could it be corrected ?

Patrick
