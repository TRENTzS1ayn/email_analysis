You mean IE5.5?
Which DTD do you refer to?

name is defined as CDATA (thus spaces are allowed)
<!ATTLIST A
  ...
  name        CDATA          #IMPLIED  -- named link end --
  href        %URI;          #IMPLIED  -- URI for linked resource --
in html4 (loose DTD)

and as NMTOKEN (no spaces allowed)

<!ATTLIST a 
  ...
  name        NMTOKEN        #IMPLIED
  href        %URI;          #IMPLIED
in XHTML 1 (stricti DTD)

So the correct phrase should not be "it does not work with IE5.5" but
"IE5.5 is unable to process it".
I guess that other browsers could be as messy as IE in this matter.
Browsers do what they can in order to display any "tag soup", but they are no validators.
