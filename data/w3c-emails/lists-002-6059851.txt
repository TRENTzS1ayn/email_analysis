Attached is the source that creates the HTML Tidy problems.  These Javascript
routines are automatically created by the DreamWeaver product.

Below is my original problem text.
I just downloaded HTML-KIT build 292 and have some TIDY problems that did not
occur in build 290. I received error and warning messages in JavaScript code
that is being interpreted as HTML. Do you have any suggestions? Below is sample
code. 

Below are some of the errors and warnings: 
'<' + '/' + letter not allowed here 
unescaped & which should be written as &amp; 
unescaped & or unknown entity "&parent.frames.length" 
unescaped & or unknown entity "&i"
