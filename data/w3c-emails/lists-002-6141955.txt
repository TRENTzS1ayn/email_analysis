Likely the intended meaning in this case would be for the empty div to act 
as a separator, similar to <br>.  The couple browsers that I checked with 
rendered

  <div>foo<div></div>bar</div>

as

  foo
  bar

but the tidied version becomes

  foobar

without the separation that the author likely intended.

I suppose this case doesn't come up often in practice, but I thought it 
may be worth mentioning.
