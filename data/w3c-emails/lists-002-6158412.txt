Ok, I see what you mean.  Is this behavior specific to DIV or would it 
apply to other block level tags?  What about PRE, BLOCKQUOTE, CENTER?

Empty TD elements have meaning as placeholders.  However empty TDs should 
probably be handled the same way as empty Ps: insert a &nbsp;  This is my 
standard hand-coding practice to make tables w/ empty cells look OK.
