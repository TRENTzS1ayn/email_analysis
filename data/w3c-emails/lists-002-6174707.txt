Dear Readers,

I have had a quick look through the documentation of
HTML tidy.  However, I am not sure if HTML tidy can do
what I require.  I have an XML like document indented
according to node position.  There are nested groups
of nodes in the document.  However, there are no
closing tags in this document.  Can anyone tell me if
there is a way that HTML tidy can place correctly
positioned closing tags into this document. 

Also.  I tried to install HTML Tidy onto a Linux
platform but the unpacked package did not respond.  I
used the gunzip -zxvf command for unpacking the .tgz
file.  Maybe this is not correct.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Matt
