Ok, I modified CanPrune() in parser.c, adding the following before 'return
yes;'

    if (element->attributes != null)
        return no;

(sorry, I don't have cvs diff)
This seems to have done the job and it is not deleting my empty elements
with attributes. There doesn't seem to be any problems with this, but I
don't know the code well enough to know for sure.
