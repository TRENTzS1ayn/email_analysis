G'Day,

The Emacs support I developed for HTML tidy has matured a lot since I first
posted an advertisement to this list. It currently supports both GNU Emacs
and XEmacs, handles remote connections much better, has a nice interface to
almost all of tidy's options, can parse and write config files and can even
tell what each of the options mean.  Better still, I've fixed a number of
annoying bugs:-)

Unfortunately, the link at 

http://tidy.sourceforge.net

is no longer correct, and judging form some email I've been receiving,
desperately needs to be updated:-( Fresh copies of tidy.el can now be
downloaded from:

   http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/tidy.el.gz

Also, thanks to everyone who has submitted bug reports, feature request,
support and encouragement:-)

Merry Xmas,

Kal

All parts should go together without forcing.  You must remember that the parts
you are reassembling were disassembled by you.  Therefore, if you can't get
them together again, there must be a reason.  By all means, do not use a hammer.
