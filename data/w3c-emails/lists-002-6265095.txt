Interesting.  I have never heard this before.  Can you elaborate?  What are 
the side effects?

When generating HTML from web apps (Perl/JSP), I have always found it 
necessary to make sure all cells have something in them, either via rowspan 
or by adding &nbsp;.  If you leave them empty, you get visual "holes" 
through the table to the background.  If any styles are applied to the 
table, it looks weird.  To see an example, have a look at the table for 
binaries on the Tidy home page.  Admittedly, this is just a hack I have 
picked up and not based on any deeper theory.

curious,
Charlie
