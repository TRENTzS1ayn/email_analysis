I was thinking along similar lines.  Perhaps it would be good to fold in 
dropping/keeping of unknown tags.  Not sure.

I'll use your comments as a guide.  I want to experiment with the sample 
file that Charlie Cox sent us to see what the visual impact is on 
IE6/NS6.  His patch is simple enough, but I think getting a deeper 
understanding of how styles get applied will be worthwhile.  I don't see 
how an empty div can be used to apply any style, positional or 
otherwise.  Seems like useless text.  But Charlie claims his docs are 
broken.  So it immediately begs the question: what is the GCD cross-browser 
behavior that Tidy can expect?  I'd like to end up with a few sample files 
that maybe other folks can confirm/deny my findings on other browsers.  My 
selection is fairly limited these days.

take it easy,
Charlie

P.S. FYI, Lee put in that change wrt empty paragraphs.  If 
--drop-empty-paras no, then <p></p> => <p>&nbsp;</p>.
