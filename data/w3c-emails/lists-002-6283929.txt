The 'empty-elements' option would work for me as I could retain the <div>
tags with the styles defined for them without changing the default behavior
for anyone else.

would it be feasable to use <br><br> when no attributes are on the <div> and
leave as is(or use new option setting) if attributes are there(maybe just
style,class or id)?

btw, this is not my preference for drawing lines on a web page, but rather
the result of a third party utility to convert hundreds of PDFs to HTML
documents. 

one other note: my example is not nested <div> tags(as posted below), but
rather individual <div> tags. i.e.
<body>
<div style="..."></div>
<div style="..."></div>
</body>
