Hello,  There seems to be an issue with textarea tags.
 Given the example:
<textarea rows="3" cols="20">sdfsdf</textarea>

tidy would change it to:
<textarea rows="3" cols="20">
   sdfsdf
</textarea>

This causes the text to have a space at the begining
when the browser renders it.

Can you please advise how to get notified when a bug
is corrected?

Thank you!
Scott
