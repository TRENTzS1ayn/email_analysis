If you are logged into Source Forge when you log a bug, it will email you 
when a bug is updated.

But, what Fred said, what is your indent setting?  Also, what 
browsers?  Not that it wouldn't still be a bug.  Tidy is supposed to be 
aware of significant whitespace.   --indent yes is deprecated as it is 
known to cause rendering changes like this one.  Try --indent auto instead.

hth,
