I hope such an announcement isn't too out of place here: now available...

Balthisar Tidy for Mac OS X (10.2 and above). You can download it (HTTP)
from http://mywebpages.comcast.net/balthisar/files/tidy.dmg -- if you have
trouble with the disk image, the /files/ directory is open for
control-/right-clicking.

Balthisar Tidy is a beautiful Aqua implementation of HTML Tidy using
Charles Reitzel's TidyLib (wrapped in Objective-C), and it's completely
free (beer).

I've already starting REwriting the Cocoa TidyLib wrapper, and I'll
announce it to the developers' list when it's ready (too soon now, but
Balthisar Tidy works so there's no point in holding it back).

There's not much documentation for the application yet, but if you read
this list or otherwise use CLI Tidy, it'll be self-explanatory.
Additionally, there's no batch-support -- yet (the batch window comes up
for a sneak peek).

If you're looking for a GUI solution for Mac OS X, please consider trying
it out (and feedback is appreciated).

(It's my first effort at anything Cocoa -or- Mac -or- C related, having
come from a strong Delphi-on-Windows background.)
