Dear Folks,

Charlie recently reviewed a bunch of the outstanding Feature Requests for
Tidy, and set many of them to "Pending" meaning the request has either been
addressed, or rejected. Some were set to "Pending" without further comment.

So if you weren't already notified automatically of a change in status of
your favorite Tidy Feature Request, maybe because you entered the Feature
Request anonymously, it might behoove you to visit the Feature Requests
tracker, as "Pending" items get automatically closed after 15 days, and
they fall off the radar.

Visit <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=27659> for more information.

Regards, Terry
