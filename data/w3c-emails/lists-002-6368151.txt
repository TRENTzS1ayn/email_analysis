AFAIK, Tidy does not correct accessibility problems.  It only 
provides diagnostics.  However, to fill in table summary 
attributes with boiler plate would, imo, be counter-productive 
to actual usability by the blind.  Besides, that is only one 
of the many accessibility checks.  To read more about these,
thanks to the folks who contributed the WAI checking code, see 
their documentation here:

You can accomplish part of what you want with a simple script.

tidy --force-output yes foo.html | tidy -access 3 -o foo2.html

I.e. you run the accessibility checks on Tidy's output rather 
than the input.

Probably not feasible.  As many of the checks are content 
related.  I.e. is the content represented in a visual (or 
audio) only manner?  Is there an effective alternate 
representation.  Is there enough context for automated readers 
to work well?  These are the basic themes, as I read them, of 
the WAI guidelines.  In fact, there is a great deal of "noise" 
in Tidy's warnings as it cannot make determinations of 
semantic content.

Not sure what you mean here.  Can you send an example?

There are not current any methods in TidyLib for updating the 
document tree.  That said, it wouldn't be too difficult to add 
them.  In the short run, a decent alternative is to use Tidy 
to produce well formed XHTML and use any number of W3C DOM 
tools to manipulate the content.  Either way, you need to 
design and implement your own mappings and rulesets, etc.
