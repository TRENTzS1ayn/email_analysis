Not to beat a dead horse, but we should probably count ourselves as lucky.
Some public lists I have seen are 99% spam, and I would never post to those
lists. It is unfortunate that the html-tidy archives are publically
available for spam harvesters to troll - a technique that works for Apple
Computer's public list archives, is to simply password protect the archives
with a documented password that must be entered to continue; other mailing
list archives obscure the poster's EMail address.

I maintain the "tidy-develop" mailing list - this is a closed list, and the
users never get to see the spam that gets sent to the list administrator -
on a good day I receive 1 piece of spam, on a bad day, it is currently
running at about 3-4 pieces.

I see spam from the same senders occasionally, both to personal EMail
addresses, and to lists I am a member of - I recently rejoined the
"html-tidy", and I hope that didn't trigger this latest event.

Regards, Terry
