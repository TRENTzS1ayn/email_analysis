Hi Terry,

There are some XML variants:

.xsl            XSL Stylesheet
.xslt           XSL Transform
.xsd            XML Schema

I am sure there are others.  Although, I might avoid generic XML by 
default.  As you know, Tidy isn't 100% whitespace safe for those XML 
variants that demand it.

I handle this problem by keeping different types of files in separate 
directories.  E.g. I don't mix executables and markup files.  Also, I use 
consistent files extensions on markup files: either .xml/.xsl/.xsd or 
.html.  I bulk Tidy only .html files.  Sometimes I tidy XML files for 
readability, but I usually throw away the result for the reason above.

hth,
Charlie
