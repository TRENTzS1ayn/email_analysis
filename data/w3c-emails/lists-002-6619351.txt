 abuse@yahoo.com

I originally sent a covering note with one of the spams as an 
attachment. I got a reply saying the full headers were not there 
(they were, of course: I checked) and they cannot receive 
attachments.

I resent the complaint, with the entire message (including headers) 
cut-and-pasted in. They haven't bothered to reply.

[Apologies for slow response: Pipex mail servers had a problem]

I had another bunch just now and will be complaining about *all* of 
those.
