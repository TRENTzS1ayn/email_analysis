Hi Jason,

When did you update Tidy so that this broke?  Unless you update it, 
HomeSite uses 04Aug2000 version of Tidy.  There have been several bug fixes 
and enhancements to the word-2000 processing since that time.  You can 
update HomeSite by simple copying a newer version of tidy.exe for Windows 
into the HomeSite directory.  Be sure to back up the original file first.

If you didn't update Tidy, did the textism website change?

Take it easy,
Charlie
