Hey Charles...

When did you update Tidy so that this broke?  

--yeah I'm running:

<meta content="HTML Tidy for Windows (vers 1st February 2003), see
www.w3.org" name="generator" />

On that note, the new version of tidy also puts the name="generator" at
the end of the meta tag? Why not at the front?


If you didn't update Tidy, did the textism website change?

--that could very well be, I did send a note, we'll see what happens...
