FWIW, I've just sent 15 complaints off to abuse@yahoo.com - even 
though the latest batch came from "Click URL" at rock.com, they all 
advertise a bunch of pages at geocities (owned by yahoo) and it's 
against the geocities ToS to run multiple sites like that.

I'm about to complain to rock.com (info@rock.com) too.

I only did 11 yesterday (out of 40-odd incoming), but between us we 
seem to have shut down his yahoo ID. Let's see if we can kill his 
geocities accounts too.
