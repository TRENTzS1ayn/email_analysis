Hello folks,

I'd like to know is there a way to force JTidy to output XML or xHTML 
form HTML even when in the HTML there are some invalid tags (which are 
not in the specs). What I need is an option to tell tidy to erase those 
tags in the case of xHTML output or simply to leave them (with a 
warnning, and not to stop with error) in the case of XML ('cause the XML 
have no DTD so any tag is good by default, right?).

Help please! I?m using JTidy API. From 2001/8

Thank you in advance
Nikolay
