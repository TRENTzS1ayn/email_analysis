Hi Matt,

Can you send a sample file w/ config?  0x98 is either an illegal character 
or a Windows 1251 "small tilde" (should be translated to U+02DC).  Can you 
reproduce the problem with the command line tool?  If so, then we can treat 
it as a Tidy issue.  Otherwise, my bad.

There is still a spurious extra newline (0xD) problem with some 
encodings.  May be related.

take it easy,
Charlie
