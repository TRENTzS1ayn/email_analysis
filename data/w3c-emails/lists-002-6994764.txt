Hi,

When tidying html and outputting as xml, there is a symbol that is 
appearing at the start of my XML files, ascii value is 0x98. How do I stop 
it appearing?

I assume this is the 'unicode Byte Order Mark character' that is mentioned 
in the Tidy configuration options reference. However if I set 'output-bom' 
to false the symbol still appears. I've tried using various char encodings 
setting all these char-encoding, input-encoding, output-encoding to: ascii, 
latin1, raw, and utf16 --the character is always there regardless of what 
encoding I use.

The char is stopping tidy output as xml from being read correctly by .net's 
C# XPathDocument class. When I manually remove the char all works fine.

I am using Charles Reitzel's COM/ATL dll.

Many thanks and regards,

..matthew
