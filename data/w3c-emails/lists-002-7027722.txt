No, the byte order mark would be 00 00 FE FF, FF FE 00 00, 00 00 FF FE,
FE FF 00 00, FE FF, FF FE or EF BB BF depending on the encoding, 0x98
never indicates a byte order mark.

If you are unable to reproduce this using the command line tool or the
pure C interface, please ask Charles privately (or wherever he may
provide support to this) and please don't crosspost between
<html-tidy@w3.org> and <tidy-develop@lists.sourceforge.net>.
