I think show-body-only should do what you want. I use it for exactly
the same purpose. If you put the contents of the textarea inside
it should not add the header information (and not return
the actual tags either)

show-body-only
Type: Boolean
Default: no
Example: y/n, yes/no, t/f, true/false, 1/0 
This option specifies if Tidy should print only the contents of the body
tag as an HTML fragment. Useful for incorporating existing whole pages
as a portion of another page. 

Cheers

Hello.

I'm using tidy executable, version 1st March 2002 in Debian Woody. I'm
trying to parse some html text that inputs a user in a TEXTAREA (well,
I'm using a WYSIWYG editor, htmlarea). I want to filter out those Word
tags.

But the tidy command thinks it has a complete HTML page and adds the
header information.

Lets see an example:

Supose that the user writes this in the TEXTAREA: "Firs
cellSecond cell"

Then I call tidy from a script with this text (throught the standar
input). The output is something like this:




"HTML Tidy for Linux/x86 (vers 1st March 2002), see www.w3.org">
Firs cell
Second cell

And I want only this part:


Firs cell
Second cell




Is that posible?

Thanks in advance.
