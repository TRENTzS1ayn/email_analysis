Hello.

I'm using tidy executable, version 1st March 2002 in Debian Woody.
I'm trying to parse some html text that inputs a user in a TEXTAREA
(well, I'm using a WYSIWYG editor, htmlarea). I want to filter out
those Word tags.

But the tidy command thinks it has a complete HTML page and adds the
header information.

Lets see an example:

Supose that the user writes this in the TEXTAREA:
" Firs cellSecond cell"

Then I call tidy from a script with this text (throught the standar
input). The output is something like this:




"HTML Tidy for Linux/x86 (vers 1st March 2002), see www.w3.org">





Firs cell
Second cell





And I want only this part:


Firs cell
Second cell




Is that posible?

Thanks in advance.
