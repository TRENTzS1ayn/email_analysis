Actually, this list has long been used for support of JTidy and various 
Tidy Add-Ons.  E.g. the DocBook conversion tool, HTML-Kit, TidyCOM/TidyGUI 
and, of late, my stuff.  A great many Tidy bugs have been found and fixed 
through such reports.

Regardless of the interface used, it is a good idea to reproduce the 
problem, if possible, with the command line tool.  It also helps to isolate 
the specific configuration options and markup that reproduce the problem.

Agreed, better to pick one or the other.  But the orginal message is really 
a support issue and, therefore html-tidy@w3.org is preferred over the DEV 
list.  See http://tidy.sourceforge.net/docs/faq.html#support

take it easy,
Charlie
