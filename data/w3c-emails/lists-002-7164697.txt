I solved the problem last night with the help of a list member. I'm still
not 100% sure of what was causing triggering the message as it seemed to
only occur when two separate issues were present together in the code. These
were:

- Invalid attributes on the <body> tag
- <a> and <br> immediately within the <body>

If I removed either one of these the errors disappeared. I'm more concerned
about the invalid body tag attributes and have removed them.

But, yes you are right these messages are somewhat ambiguous, especially if
you have never seen them before. Is there a list of standard error messages
and probable causes somewhere?


Cheers

Mark
