Depending on the subset, it will either be ignored or the document
breaks, since Tidy's support for internal subset syntax is rather
limited, it tries to skip it and does not attempt to parse it.

By the proposed definiton for --drop-proprietary-attributes this is
still proprietary and Tidy would strip the bodyref attribute. This is
btw. no strictly conforming XHTML 1.0 document if the document uses the
bodyref attribute, declaring the attribute just tricks out the
validator.

And it will keep doing so.

I suggest you file a feature request on the project homepage, probably
on a config option to setup new attributes Tidy should keep untouched.
