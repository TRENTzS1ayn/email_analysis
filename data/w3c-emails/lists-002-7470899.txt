Hi
I have a problem when I use JTidy for parsing an HTML file : Tidy tries to
add a </INPUT> tag for each <INPUT> one, but unfortunately not at the good
place... Here's an example :
This :
<TD><INPUT name="login" type="text" size="20"></TD>
<TD>Coucou</TD>

Becomes this after having been parsed :
<TD>
<INPUT name="login" type="text" size="20">
<TD>Coucou</TD>
</INPUT>
</TD>
As you can see, Tidy does not put the INPUT closing tag immediately after
the opening tag and incorporates the next elements in the INPUT block, which
it shouldn't do.

Do you know how I can configure tidy for correcting this ? the simplest way
could be to close each <INPUT> tag with " />" instead of ">", but how can I
do this ?

Cedric
