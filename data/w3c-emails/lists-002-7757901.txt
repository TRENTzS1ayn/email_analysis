I am progressing : I've removed some configuration codelines which I had
added a long time ago (I don't remember why...) :
setClean(true);
setXmlTags(true);
And now Tidy generates this :
<input name="login" type="text" size="20"/>
This is precisely what I wanted it to do :)
Something is surprising : the result is the same if the XHTML property is
set to 'true' or 'false' ; do you think it may be because the input file
doctype (automatically inserted by my HTML editor ; I can change it if
necessary) is HTML 4.01 Transitional ?

But there's a new (little) problem (else it would be too easier...) :
    'Tidy (vers 4th August 2000) Parsing "InputStream"
line 9 column 1 - Warning: <table> lacks "summary" attribute

InputStream: Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0
Transitional//EN"
InputStream: Document content looks like HTML 4.01 Transitional
1 warnings/errors were found!'
I don't understant why Tidy displays this warning, because the 'summary'
attribute is optional in HTML 4.01... But the main thing is that I don't
have any problem with INPUT tags ; good news of the day :)

Yes I understand .. If you use the "output-xhtml: yes" option it should
(and does) produce compliant XHTML.

Your problem is how Tidy decides where to close the tag.  I agree it
should just add a trailing slash to an <input> tag resulting in <input
id="x"/> as I can't really see any valid reason to have any data within
<input></input> tags.  This is exactly what it does with <img> tags
quite successfully.

I have had similar (and harder to solve) problems with things like
unclose <marquee> tags (ugh!, not my content!)... Because a marquee tag
expects data between the <marquee> and </marquee> tags, sometimes tidy
decides to close it way down the page resulting in a whole page
scrolling marquee :)  Because IE arbitrarily ends the marquee when it
encounters another tag like a </td> the invalid document displays fine
before tidying, but looks terrible after.

The same problem can occur with many other unclosed tags in bad HTML
like <strong> etc.  There is no easy solutions for these ones, as who
can say what the author really intended, but tags like <input> should be
easily solved.

Cheers
Ben

The perfect solution would be that Tidy produces XHTML from my HTML
input file, because the org.w3c.dom.Document produced is manipulated
with DOM4J afterwards... That's why every tag has to be closed
correctly.

Sorry I had assumed you were tidying to XHTML as that is primarily what
I use tidy for!

I presume Cedric was also tidying to XHTML, so you would also have to do
that to reproduce his problem.

For HTML output, the <input> element must not have an end tag, for XHTML
output, Tidy will print <input ... />; choosing XHTML output does not
cause the behaivour you describe.
