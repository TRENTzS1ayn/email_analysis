Prior to any element in the body a valid HTML document requires a
document type declaration and a title element. Tidy never complained
about an absent document type declaration, leaving the title element.
In parser.c:ParseHead(...) Tidy will indeed not warn about the missing
title element if --show-body-only had been specified, but Tidy will warn
about all other errors in the header, e.g. <html foo=bar><p>... hence I
consider this a bug. It makes small sense to complain about all but this
error.

There were several feature requests on means for fragmentary parsing,
once someone implements such a feature... I've changed this in CVS, Tidy
will now warn about missing title elements even if --show-body-only is
specified.
