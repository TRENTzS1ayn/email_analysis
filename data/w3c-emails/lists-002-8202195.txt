HTML Tidy for Windows (vers 1st May 2002 (Terry's build); built on May 4
2002, at 16:52:44).

Doctype given is "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2"
Document content looks like HTML 3.2

I am getting the following message

<table> lacks "summary" attribute

The summary attribute is not a part of HTML 3.2, according to WDG's HTML 3.2
Reference (Wilbur).

Other than that, it is a fabulous piece of software.
