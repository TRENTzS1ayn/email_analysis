It seems that our friend is back.
I send a mail (with full header) to abuse@hotmail.com, but they don't
find anything in the header saying that the sender is one of their
members.

I guess they are kidding (MS Humour, probably).
Did someone else try to send a mail to hotmail (they are as stone dead
as a dead parrot).
