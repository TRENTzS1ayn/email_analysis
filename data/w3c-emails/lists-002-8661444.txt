I informed MSN's abuse line and they've been cooperative.  M le Spammeur
appears to be operating from MSN Malaysia through open relays at a
Malaysian university and in China (Guangdong Province, to be exact), but
the abuse addresses there don't respond.

The perp seems pretty clueless, but he's still a PIA.  Maybe if we informed
GWB that he's using a weapon of mass distraction....?
