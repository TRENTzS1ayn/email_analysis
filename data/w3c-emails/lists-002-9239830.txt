Hello List,
I just downloaded Tidy   and am trying to check  how it cleans up htm file saved from WORD 2000. I am using a simple text file with one ordered list and one data tablein it. But when I try (from DOS prompt):
 

tidy -m test1.htm,
it only displays a bunch of   warnings and errors and does not modify the file. The errors state that Tidy failed to recognize   many of the tags inserted by WORD. 
I tried a second  file created by WORD 2K that has a few hyperlinks and a couple of images. That too did not convert and I got a list of errors.

The documentation states that  in case Tidy encounters errors, the conversion is unpredictable. So does it mean it is not going to work? 

Is using the WORD 2.0 filter  a more reliable option?
Thanks,
Sailesh
