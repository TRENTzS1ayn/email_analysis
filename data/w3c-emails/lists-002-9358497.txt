Removal of new-xxx-tags is covered by <http://tidy.sf.net/bug/723772>
which is fixed in CVS; did you use latest sources? The omission of end
tags when you use new-empty-tags is intentional, in HTML empty elements
must not have end tags, hence Tidy does not output them. You could use
-asxml to get <todaydaystyle ... /> if that works for you.
