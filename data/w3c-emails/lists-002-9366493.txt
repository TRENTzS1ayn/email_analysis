Hi Bjoern,

<snip>

Thanks very much for your help.  Part of the problem was that I didn't
specify new-blocklevel-tags correctly and your help got me closer but Tidy
still isn't producing the kind of results I expect.

I'm using libtidy.dll with tidypas
(http://www.houston.quik.com/jkp/tidypas/) in Delphi 7.0 and I'm seeing two
problems although things are a bit better than was I was getting before.
The first problem is that while some of the tags inside of asp:calendar are
processed correctly tidy seems to be removing the closing on some of the
nested tags from my example.  Additionally, repeative executions of Tidy
eventually result in a blank file.  I've tried the same test using TidyGUI
with the same results.

With the setting you recommended (and testing using TidyGUI) the block tags
inside of the asp:calendar tag are never processed correctly.  Either the
tags are completely removed which I can resolve using new-empty-tags, or the
closing tag is removed (ex. </todaydaystyle>).
