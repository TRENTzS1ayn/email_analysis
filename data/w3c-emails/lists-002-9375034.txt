Hi Bjoern,

Thanks again for your reply.  Yes, I've downloaded the latest sources as of
this evening.  I'm working on an ASP.NET development tool and therefore it's
not acceptible that the end tags are removed.  Additionally, as you
mentioned HTML Tidy's formatting of the tags commonly found inside of an
ASP.NET tag is not very friendly.  Unfortunately, my current  timeframe is
such that I can't afford to take the time and correct HTML Tidy myself.  I
was hoping to be able to just "drop it in" and go but it's looking like that
may not happen.

I'll certainly watching to see if/when these issues are addressed.

Thanks again.
-Steve
