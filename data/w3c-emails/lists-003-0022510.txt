No, see <http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.10>, <img> elements may have
both a name and id attribute. XHTML 1.0 Strict and XHTML 1.1 disallow
the name attribute but as such documents are less compatible Tidy adds
the name attribute. It probably does not change the document type decl
which is a known problem and maybe it should not add it for these two
or with HTML 4.01 Strict three document types but doing so would require
to change parts of the doctype code and I did not get around to do that
yet. You can change the tidylib.c:FixAnchors(...) call to set wantName
to 'no' but we don't currently offer a configuration option for this.
