Note that GetToken(...) is an internal function and thus unsupported,
we might and likely will change it without much consideration of the
implications for other applications...

I've recently changed GetToken(...) for CDATA elements like <script>,
<style>, etc. so that you should be able to use the CdataContent mode
for these elements. This would require that you check for CDATA start
tags, assign the token to lexer->parent and call it with CdataContent
mode, have a look at parser.c:ParseScript(...) which does this.

What change to GetToken(...) did you have in mind to do this?
