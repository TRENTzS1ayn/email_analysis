I'm having trouble getting tidy to correct URL's with ampersand (&) 
character.

The page below contains one URL with part "...05B8&displaylang=en". For 
some reason tidy doesn't want to convert the & mark correctly. Could 
someone advice if the cause is my config below?

Here's a link to the sample page:
http://www.bloggidity.com/web/2004/05/25/web_services_enhancements_283.htm

Here's my tidy configuration:
char-encoding: latin1
doctype: strict
tidy-mark: no
clean: yes
drop-font-tags: yes
logical-emphasis: yes
output-xml: yes
output-xhtml: yes
numeric-entities: yes
show-warnings: no
show-body-only: yes
hide-comments: yes
drop-proprietary-attributes: yes
word-2000: yes
quote-marks: yes
quote-ampersand: yes
force-output: yes

Thanks, Tommi
