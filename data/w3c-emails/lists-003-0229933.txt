Solved it.. a bit silly :)

There was a wysiwyg editor that showed the content after it was 
processed by tidy. When the data was reloaded onto the page and 
displayed in the editor, the editor (HTMLArea 3) apparently translated 
the &amp; values back into &.

I changed the page so it performs tidy after data has been submitted 
from page and stores the pure tidy processed data into the database. 
This solved the problem.

Thanks for your help!

Ps. Here's a link to the editor http://dynarch.com/mishoo/htmlarea.epl
