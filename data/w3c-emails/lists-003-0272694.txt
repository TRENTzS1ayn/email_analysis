Are you using (SGML-syntax) HTML?

If you use `id` *instead* of `name`, you won't get the redundancy.  Note
that for XHTML 1.1 going forward, `name` is completely removed, since `id`
already does the job, plus `id` works with all other elements (i.e., you can
link to `<span id="foo">...</span>`, etc.).  Because of this, instead of the
old:

<h3><a name="foo"></a>Whatever</h3>

most people are now writing:

<h3 id="foo">Whatever</h3>

Which, BTW, is just as valid in HTML 4.01.

The above of course is just an FYI -- it doesn't address the issue of what
Tidy does -- or should do -- should you for whatever reason only want to use
`name`.
