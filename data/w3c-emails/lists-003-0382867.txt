I'm writing today to ask for your help because I'm very, very frightenedYou've no doubt heard how unsafe evoting is:

 

Software switched between testing and elections:

Multiple victories by EXACTLY 18,811 votes -- in the same election, in the same state, at the same time:

Felons secretly installing "updates" at the last minute before elections:

Microsoft Access (!) used as the database -- often with an ingenious password like (wait for it) "password"(!):

If you find these stories the least bit alarming, you can personally do something about it today. 

We are organizing a group of programmers to help provide an open-source system for e-voting machines; 

 

you are hereby invited to offer your skills and take part in changing history.

 

Stand up and fight for the vote.

 

Your country needs you.

 

sincerely,
