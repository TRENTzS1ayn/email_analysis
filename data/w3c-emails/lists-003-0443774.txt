Hi, 
 
I have previously tried running HTML Tidy from java on Windows 2000. However when i tried to my system to Linux(I have downloaded the Linux version, and tried running it, It works) I have problem executing HTML Tidy.
 
In Win 2000
Process p = rt.exec("cmd /c cd " +mainPath +" && " +cmd);
 
In Linux -- > Does Not work
Process p = rt.exec("sh -c "+mainPath +"/" +cmd);

cmd is the commad to call the tidy program with the necessary arguments.
 
Do you know how can i execute this?
 
Thanks!!
