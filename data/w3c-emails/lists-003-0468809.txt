Dear Sirs:
      I am not all that familiar with Gator but the screen box that usually
pops up when I go to a site that needs a log in the Gator pop up is not
showing. I may have done something to that particular site but I don't know
that. The site doesn't appear on the page that displays the sites that use
Gator. Others do show up as enabled.
      How can I get this particular site to show up when I enter it?

      Thank you,

      Bill DeFosses
