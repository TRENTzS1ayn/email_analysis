Any chance for an option to *not* wrap the <style> section in "commented"
CDATA sections?  There are no '<' or '&' characters needed in any version of
CSS.  It would be sooo much nicer to have just a plain 

  <style type="text/css">
    
  </style>

instead of the grotesque

  <style type="text/css">
  /*<![CDATA[*/
    
  /*]]>*/
  </style>

currently emitted with XHTML output.

Thanks,

PS.  I tried sending this to the 'tidy-develop' list, but I keep getting an

error in the returned mail.
