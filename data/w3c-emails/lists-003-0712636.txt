when I was validating a web page I received this message

Line 112, column 38: an attribute value literal can occur in an attribute
specification list only after a VI delimiter 

<param name="rotatoreffect" value="dissolve"> (this is the code)

what does it mean and how can I take care of it?  thanks so much for any
help you can give.
