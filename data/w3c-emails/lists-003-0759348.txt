Yes... Long standing issue, see http://tinyurl.com/2yham if you like. It
is however possible that style elements include <, & or ]]>, a reference
to a background image generated by a server side script, in generated
content or comments for example. The current escape code is in pprint.c,
it should be moved to clean.c and probably needs a rewrite to address
several bugs listed in the bug tracker. Patches most welcome! (as are
concrete proposals for configuration options).
