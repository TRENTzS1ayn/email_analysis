Dear Sirs,

To be short, let me be brief.

Where is my dashes?
Netscape Editor (from Netscape Navigator Version 3.0 Gold package)
converts my "&mdash;" into "&amp;mdash;". How can Tidy be programmed to
correct this substitution if any?

Where is my named entity references?
It seems that the same Netscape Editor translates a good deal of my
named entities into text. E. g. "&radic;" -> "&amp;radic;". How Tidy
could help me to fix this problem if any?

Where is my 'border="0"' attribute?!
So, could Tidy be programmed to insert 'border="0"' attribute into
"<table>" tag when or where this attribute is omitted. It is because of
the same Netscape Editor again. The Editor eats 'border="0"' attributes
(with value "0").

>From http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/ : "Tidy supports a small set
of character encoding options. The default is ASCII, which makes it easy
to edit markup in regular text editors." So, Tidy will not convert
Windows cp1251 and Windows cp1253 pages into UTF-8 pages in future?

============================================
Isn't it a bug below?

HTML sample:
                   <tr bgcolor="#6666cc">
                    <form method="post"
action="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary">
                    <td align="center">
                     <input type="hidden" name="book" value="Dictionary" />
                     <input type="text" name="va" size="15" /><br />
                     <input type="submit" value="Search" />
                     <input type="reset" value="Clear" />
                    </td>
                    </form>
                   </tr>

On the HTML from above, Tidy reports the following:
- - - - - - - - - -
...
line 2 column 21 - Warning: missing <td>
line 3 column 21 - Warning: discarding unexpected <td>
line 2 column 21 - Warning: missing </form> before </td>
line 9 column 21 - Error: discarding unexpected </form>

This document has errors that must be fixed before
using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version.
...
- - - - - - - - - -

Or another sample:
                   <tr bgcolor="#6666cc">
                    <form method="post"
action="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/thesaurus">
                    <td align="center">
                     <input type="hidden" name="book" value="Thesaurus" />
                     <input type="text" name="va" size="15" /><br />
                     <input type="submit" value="Search" />
                     <input type="reset" value="Clear" />
                    </td> 
                    </form>
                   </tr>

Tidy's report is following:
- - - - - - - - - -
...
line 2 column 21 - Warning: missing <td>
line 3 column 21 - Error: discarding unexpected <td>
line 2 column 21 - Warning: missing </form> before </td>
line 9 column 21 - Error: discarding unexpected </form>

You may ask me why I insert here <form> tag before <td> tag and don't do
that after <td> tag. Well, I explain it with pleasure :). I just have
downloaded this or similar code from the address
"http://www.merriam-webster.com/tools/search/srchbox5.zip" which was
linked from
"http://www.merriam-webster.com/tools/search/searchboxes2.htm". And, in
addition, a description could be found on
"http://www.merriam-webster.com/tools/search/searchboxes3.htm".
