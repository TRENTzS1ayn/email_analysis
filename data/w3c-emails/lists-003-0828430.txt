Tidy has no way of knowing if &amp;mdash; is an editor bug or what the user
actually wanted.
Also, stylesheets and other things could be effecting table borders, so
assuming border="0" when it's not specified could easily mess things up.

In short, I can't see any of that being put into tidy.

Luckily it sounds like those are bugs in Netscape 3.  If possible, try
upgrading to Mozilla - it's Netscape without the corporate crappyness.

Subject: Possible Tidy improvements

Dear Sirs,

To be short, let me be brief.

Where is my dashes?
Netscape Editor (from Netscape Navigator Version 3.0 Gold package)
converts my "&mdash;" into "&amp;mdash;". How can Tidy be programmed to
correct this substitution if any?

Where is my named entity references?
It seems that the same Netscape Editor translates a good deal of my
named entities into text. E. g. "&radic;" -> "&amp;radic;". How Tidy could
help me to fix this problem if any?

Where is my 'border="0"' attribute?!
So, could Tidy be programmed to insert 'border="0"' attribute into
"<table>" tag when or where this attribute is omitted. It is because of the
same Netscape Editor again. The Editor eats 'border="0"' attributes (with
value "0").

Best regards,
Cyril, Esq.
