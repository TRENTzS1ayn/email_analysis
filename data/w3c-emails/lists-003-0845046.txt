The fact that someone else also does it wrong, doesn't mean you have to.  
It is a gross violation of the HTML standard. If you either put the  
complete form inside one table cell, or wrap the <FORM> and </FORM> tags  
around a table and put the form controls in table cells, everything will  
be fine, and the search will work just as good (if not better) in all  
browsers.
