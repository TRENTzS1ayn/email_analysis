Hello all,

Just a note of thanks to Cory Nelson who has put my on the
straight-and-narrow (very narrow <g>) regarding structure of the DTD for
xhtml-1.1 and how that relates to Tidy Beta.

I haven't isolated that strangeness with the off-beat treatment of a
graphic, yet, but this has certainly gone a long way toward clearing the
waters elsewhere.

Cordially,

Harold Baughan
