Great question! I recieved an email from your address so I replied. I've
been trying to get out of the "Tidy" thing for over two weeks, now. They
(whoever ?they? is) have been sending me emails from everyone
involved with the tidy thread. I can't get away from it so I'm replying
to every email I recieve about it. "They" sent me your thread so I
replied. I'm not happy about it and will continue to reply to everyone
connected until it stops.



attached mail follows:
I haven't sent you any messages.  how did you get my address?
