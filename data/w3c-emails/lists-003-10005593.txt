You got comments... ;-)

Please change this to
1-byte:  {00-7F}Same as US-ASCII (ISO 646 IRV (1991))
                       ^                         ^^^               ^^^

The DEL control at 7F is included, and the reference to ASCII should be more specific.

The ISO standard defines not only the International Reference Version (IRV==US version) but also several national variants.

--> Registration Requirements (as defined in RFC 2978)

The RFC for IANA charset registration was updated from RFC 2278 to RFC 2978 (ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2978.txt).

This line needs some editing... ;-)

As far as I know, the requirement date is "on or after September 1, 2001" or "after August 31, 2001".

Your draft is missing one item for the registration: You need to state that this charset's "Intended Usage" is "COMMON", for example at the beginning of your section 9. See the "Intended Usage" in "5. Charset Registration Template" in RFC 2978.

(Thanks for mentioning material from Dirk and me :-)
You might also want to point to my less technical overview article at http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/docs/papers/gb18030.html
