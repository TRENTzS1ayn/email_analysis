Both are right, contemporary Georgian (and proposed charset) is "case
insensitive".
see http://www.gia.ge/georgia/language.htm#Writing about writing system &
alphabet(s)

in the chart http://www.gia.ge/g13n/geostd8.gif mentioned in the previous
message
only upper/lower half of single-byte table is shown,
not-shown corersponding lower/upper half - ASCII.
full description of charset is done in the attached document (in previous
letter).

did you meant any convenient/relevant/appropriate place for publishing it as
Info-RFC?

thanks,

  Just for my information, so that I am sure I understand it:

  - is it true that Georgian has no upper/lower case distinction?
  - the proposed charset can be used to write both Latin script and
    Georgian script. Right?

  It seems good to me - sending the draft to internet-drafts@ietf.org will
  make it public for 6 months; it may very well be a Good Thing to publish
  this as an info RFC so that it is permanently available.

  I-D submission is now closed before the IETF; you can send in the
  submission after December 15th.

  Good luck!

            Harald
