I propose to register ISO_8859-8:1999 as an alias to ISO_8859-8:1988. 

Reference:

252

Justification: ISO_8859-8:1999 is a superset of ISO_8859-8:1988. Valid
ISO_8859-8:1988 data will still be valid under ISO_8859-8:1999. The new
characters were reserved in ISO_8859-8:1988. Registering ISO_8859-8:1999
as a separate character set would cause too much unnecessary confusion.

Regards,

Jony Rosenne
