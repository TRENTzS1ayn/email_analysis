Did you originally subscribe to the list by sending a mail to
html-tidy-request@w3.org with a subject of "subscribe"?

Then to unsubscribe, send a mail to html-tidy-request@w3.org with a subject
of "unsubscribe"

Yes there has been some spam sent to this list lately .. But it's not the
fault of the legitimate list members ... And abusing us will not help.
