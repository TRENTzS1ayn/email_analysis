Hello Francois,

I'm not exactly sure your argument with UTF-8 works.

The problem becomes obvious if we assume that the UCS
is the reference. In this case, additions to the UCS
can always be made to work as good as the current
implementation (because we don't expect conversion
to legacy encodings to work, except for something
like NCRs in HTML/XML). However, additions to legacy
encodings will break interoperability if new data
is sent to old implementations with the old label,
in particular if the implementation converts to
UCS internally (which more and more implementations
do nowadays).

Regards,   Martin.
