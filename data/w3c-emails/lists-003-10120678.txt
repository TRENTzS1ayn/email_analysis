Hello Martin,

Questionning the applicability of something that was argued only for Unicode
certainly makes sense, but I'm afraid I don't quite follow your reasoning.

In my mind, the argument never hinged on conversion (or not) to Unicode, it
was simply a recognition that having a new label for compatible upgrades of
charsets actually hurt more that it helped, because a non-updated receiver
that gets the new label has to fail completely, whereas if the old label is
kept, the same non-updated receiver only has to fail if it actually gets
some of the new characters it doesn't know about.

This seems to apply whether the charset in question is UTF-8 of ISO-8859-8,
unless one assumes that in the case of UTF-8, an application can accept
characters that it doesn't know about.  Is that what you were implying?
