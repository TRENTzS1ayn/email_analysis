Dear Mr. Chen,

Thank you very much for your message.  I apologize for my
procrastination since making the first draft due to the tight schedule
here at work.

If you don't mind waiting a bit longer, I'll include the helpful
corrections and suggestions from Markus, Bruno, WU Jian and others, and
make up another draft for the GB18030 and GBK applications tonight or
tomorrow morning, and then you can make the further revisions.  :-)

You may wish to look at 

ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2978.txt
   or
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2978.html

for the procedures in registration.  Also, a listing of currently
registered charsets:

http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets

and  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-charsets/  for archives
of this mailing list (including previous discussions with GB18030
registrations.)

Best regards,

Anthony Fok (HUO Dongling)
