Dear Anthony,

Thank you very much for drafting application. Please note that the GBK was
released in 1995.

Mr. Xu Cheng told me that you would help us register GB18030 in IANA. If it
is, please give me some instructions on registration process. I work for the
Chinese IT Standardization Technical Committee.

Best regards,

CHEN Zhuang
Chinese Electronics Standardization Institute

>             Application of IANA Charset Registration for GB18030
>     ----------------------------------------------------
>
>     (First draft, November 9, 2001)
>
> Purpose
> =======
>
> 1. This is a proposal to register "GB18030" as a Charset name with
>    Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
>
>
> Background
> ==========
>
> 2. To facilitate electronic communication in People's Republic of China,
>    and to provide a smooth migration path from the older GB 2312-1980
>    standard and GBK (1993?) specification to Unicode / ISO 10646 /
>    GB 13000.1, the Chinese government published the GB 18030-2000 standard
>    on March 17, 2000:
>
>      Chinese National Standard GB 18030-2000: Information Technology --
>         Chinese Ideograms Coded Character Set for Information
Interchange --
>         Extension for the Basic Set
>
>      (Xinxi Jishu -- Xinxi Jiaohuan Yong Hanzi Bianma Zifuji -- Jibenji de
>       Kuochong)
>
>
> 3. A brief summary of the GB18030 codepoints is listed below:
>
> 1-byte:  {00-7E} Same as ASCII (ISO 646)
> 2-byte:  {81-FE}{40-7E,80-FE} Same as GBK
> 4-byte:  {81-FE}{30-39}{81-FE}{30-39} Maps linearly to ISO 10646
> starting from GB+81308130 = U+0080
> while skipping the mappings already defined
> in the 2-byte portions.
>
> 4. This registration request is specifically made since proper
>    registration will facilitate development of Operating Systems and
>    Internet-related software supporting GB18030.
>
>
> Registration Requirements (as defined in RFC 2278)
> ==================================================
>
> 5. Required characteristics
>
>   - The proposed charset conforms to the definition of a "charset"
>     as defined in 2.4 of RFC 2278.
>
>   - The proposed charset is suitable for use in MIME.
>
>   - The proposed charset is specified in a stable, openly available
>     specification.
>
>
> 6. New charsets
>
>    - The proposed charset is NOT a new charset.  It is a Chinese national
>      standard published on March 17, 2000 and further revised in
>      November 2000.
>
>
> 7. Naming requirements
>
>    - Proposed name for the charset is "GB18030".
>
>    - The name conforms to the ABNF definition in sect 3.3 of RFC 2278.
>
>
> 8. Functionality requirement
>
>    - The proposed charset functions as an actual charset.
>
>
> 9. Usage and implementation requirements
>
>    The GB 18030-2000 standard wasIt has been created by the Chinese
>    government with inputs from major vendors and institutions to
>    ensure full ISO 10646 / Unicode 3.x compatibility while
>    providing a smooth migration path from GB2312 and GBK encodings.
>
>    The proposed "GB18030" charset has been a mandatory standard in
>    Mainland China since August 31, 2001.  All operating systems
>    sold on or after that date must support GB18030.  Several major
>    operating systems already come with full GB18030 support, and
>    other vendors will finish the transition in coming months.
>    User-end applications will also fully support GB18030 in coming years.
>    Full GB18030 fonts have been available for some time now.
>
>    GB18030 is also China's solution to support minority ethnic languages
>    such as Mongolian, Tibetan and Uyghur, as well as all other languages
>    of the world.  It also fulfills the needs of ancient Chinese literature
>    research, libraries, geography, names, and more.
>
>
> 10. Publication requirements
>
>     The proposed charset has been published by the Chinese Government in
>     March 2000.  The standard was revised in November 2000.  Newer
revisions
>     will be published to follow updates in Unicode and ISO 10646
standards.
>
>     Dirk Meyer <dmeyer@adobe.com> has kindly translated and provided
>     comments of the GB 18030-2000 standard in English.  While unofficial,
>     it is indeed the authorative document on GB18030.  An on-line copy
>     is available at:

> 11. MIBenum requirements
>
> A MIBenum value for the proposed charset will be assigned by IANA
> at the time of registration.
