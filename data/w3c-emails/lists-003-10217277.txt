The IANA registration for the charset "macintosh", which represents the 
Mac OS Roman character set, currently refers to RFC 1345.

Since RFC 1345 was published, the definition of the MacRoman character 
set has changed. In particular, the code point 0xDB, which was formerly 
U+00A4 CURRENCY SIGN, was redefined to be U+20AC EURO SIGN.

What would be the appropriate course of action to deal with this 
discrepancy? Registering a new "macintosh-euro" character set seems like 
overkill. Apple would prefer to just redefine the IANA-registered 
character set "macintosh" to conform to the new definition of MacRoman. 
Is that allowed? If so, what procedure should be followed?

The definition of MacRoman can be found at:

http://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/ROMAN.TXT

Would it be appropriate to refer to that rather than to a (revised) RFC?
