Here is the list of the main things that I think should be done:

- Say something about the BOM (probably something along the lines:
   this exists, but is not recommended)

- Remove some historical stuff, move the rest of it to a separate
   section (in the back rather than in the front).

- Check/update terminology with respect to UCS-2/UTF-16,...

- Check/update references

Any comments? Any other main points?

If I have time (e.g. over the weekend), I will mark up the current
text in xml2rfc and start editing.

Regards,    Martin.
