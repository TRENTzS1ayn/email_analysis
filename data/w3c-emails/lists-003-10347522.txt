The most important change, IMO, is to explicitly forbid what
Unicode 3.2 calls irregular code unit sequences and to
explicitly draw attention to these in the section on Security
Considerations.  This section should clearly distinguish the
different avenues of attack:
-  irregular code unit sequences
-  over-long sequences
-  are there any others?

One important change which comes under Martin's heading of
"Check/update references" is a replacement of:

   A more detailed algorithm and formulae can be found in [FSS_UTF],
   [UNICODE] or Annex R to [ISO-10646].

with something more useful.

Thanks,
Misha
