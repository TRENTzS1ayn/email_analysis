That is a possibility.  It never was before, as prior to
Unicode 3.2, the Unicode definition of UTF-8 was seriously
flawed, allowing irregular code unit sequences.  On the
other hand, the definition of UTF-8 in Unicode 3.2 is made
up of amendments to existing text in Unicode 3.0, is it not?
That isn't a suitable format for a normative reference.
