OK, I got started on this.  I just submitted an I-D with a first load of
changes.  Attached is an HTML version.

New section added.  Mostly from RFC 2781.

I removed quite a bit.  There was only a single para leftover, so I left it
in the Intro.

Done.  Quite a bit of change in "Introduction" and "UTF-8 definition"

Done.

These are other changes I've done:

   o  Added a Changes section

   o  Note warning against decoding of invalid sequences turned into a
      normative MUST NOT.

   o  Added TOC.

   o  Removed suggested UNICODE-1-1-UTF-8 MIME charset registration.

   o  New "Notational conventions" section about RFC 2119 and U+HHHH
      notation.

   o  Pointer to Unicode Consortium Policies added in "Versions of the
      standards" section.

   o  Added a fourth example with a non-BMP character and a BOM.
