I agree, even though the Unicode Standard only describes UTF-8
out to U+10FFFF. 10646 still gives the full scheme to U-7FFFFFFF,
and it will be awhile (if ever) before we can change that to
deprecate all the 5- and 6-byte values. So I see no good reason
right now to put RFC 2279 out of synch with 10646, particularly
if it would slow down a revision of RFC 2279 now.
