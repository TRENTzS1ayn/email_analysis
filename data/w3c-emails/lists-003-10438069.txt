We could just point to Unicode 3.2, or to ISO. But we need
the RFC anyway. So I think it should be written so that
people don't have to go and read other documents to just
use UTF-8.

I think in terms of normative reference, you can point to
whatever text you like, assuming it's stable. That it is
in pieces isn't relative in terms of normativeness.

What I think is important is to point out that in 3.2, Unicode
has been updated to be as strict as the RFC always was (intended
to be).
