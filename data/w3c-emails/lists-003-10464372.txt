Dear IANA,

This mail is more than half a year old. Harald has approved
the registration of UTF-32, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE.
However, I have not found them in your list at
http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets.
Can you please update that list at your earliest
convenience? Many thanks in advance!

Regards,   Martin.
