I thought ISO had adopted a standing policy on not allocating
anything beyond U+10FFFF. Ken, do you know the exact status of
this? Can you tell us?

I think the new document should clearly state that codepoints above
U+10FFFF cannot be encoded in UTF-16, that the Unicode consortium
won't allocate any codepoints above that, that ISO has some relevant
policy (if they do),... Also, pointing to UTF-32 might be a good idea.
(I just found out that it has been approved for registration, but
is not yet listed in the relevant file.)
