One of the advantages about UTF8 that I've repeatedly heard touted was 
that it was NOT restricted to 10FFFF, and indeed could handle the entire 
32-bit codespace when such codes were eventually allocated. This was 
often used as an argument against other encodings, such as UTF16, that 
didn't have the same property.
