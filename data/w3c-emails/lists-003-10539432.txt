0. This is a great description of UTF-8!

1. Paragraph 34: "... to be discussed in section 5."
    must refer to section 7, not 5.
    (It is section 5 in RFC 2279.)

2. Section 5 (BOM)
    I suggest to add a paragraph about Unicode 3.2's addition of U+2060 Word Joiner.
    See chapter 3.9 in UAX 28, URL:
    http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr28/#3_9_special_character_properties

3. Bibliography
    I suggest to replace the [UNICODE] book/ISBN reference and the link to version 3.0
    with a reference to "Unicode 3.2"
    and a link to http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/versions/
    (Ken and others may have different ideas here).

    Note that the versions page itself refers to the book and its ISBN.

    For a more specific link to Unicode 3.2 one could use
    http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/versions/enumeratedversions.html#Unicode_3_2_0

    I think it is useful to refer to the version of the Unicode standard that has
    a matching definition of UTF-8
    (except for the 10ffff issue, which is covered in comments in the draft).

Best regards,
markus
