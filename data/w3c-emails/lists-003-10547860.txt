Good catch.  I had forgotten to update to an <xref> element.

What about this:

   In an attempt at diminishing the uncertainty, Unicode 3.2 adds a new
   character, U+2060 WORD JOINER, with exactly the same semantics and usage
   as U+FEFF except for the signature function, and strongly recommends its
   exclusive use for expressing word-joining semantics. Eventually,
following
   this recommendation will make it all but certain that any initial U+FEFF
   is a signature, not an intended "ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE".

Fine with me.  What do others think?

BTW, the I-D staff didn't like "draft-yergeau-utf8-rev2..." they suggested
"draft-yergeau-rfc2279bis..." instead, so this is it:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-yergeau-rfc2279bis-00.txt.
