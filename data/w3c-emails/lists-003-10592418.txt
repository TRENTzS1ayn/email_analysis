Well, it seems I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place :-)

What about this:

   [UNICODE]      The Unicode Consortium, "The Unicode Standard --
                  Version 3.2",  defined by The Unicode Standard,
                  Version 3.0 (Reading, MA, Addison-Wesley, 2000. ISBN
                  0-201-61633-5), as amended by the Unicode Standard
                  Annex #27: Unicode 3.1 (see http://www.unicode.org/
                  reports/tr27) and by the Unicode Standard Annex #28:
                  Unicode 3.2 (see http://www.unicode.org/reports/
                  tr28)., March 2002, <http://www.unicode.org/unicode/
                  standard/versions/
                  enumeratedversions.html#Unicode_3_2_0>.


I had to seriously cheat with the highly inflexible RFC2629 DTD to obtain
this, I hope it makes everyone happy.
