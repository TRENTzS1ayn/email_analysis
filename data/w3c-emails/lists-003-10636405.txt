Of course.  I have a printed copy of "Unicode Standard Annex #28: Unicode
3.2" too.  Anyone can print a copy of an online document or burn a CD.

The fact is that RFCs, like UAXs (but unlike major releases of Unicode) are
published primarily online and not given ISBNs or ISSNs.  They raise similar
questions of trust, permanence and findability.
