I've only got experience with Tidy, but I assume my answers will be valid  
for JTidy as well.

Yes, that is the purpose of the program.

Nope, that is not possible. Tidy will not create such invalid output. It  
can be teached to handle unknown elements as generic inline or block-level  
elements. But FORM is a known element, and even it that was not the case:  
Tidy knows that the TABLE element can only contain a few specific elements  
(CAPTION, COL, COLGROUP, THEAD, TFOOT, TBODY and TR).

Note that the illegal nesting of FORM directly in TABLE can cause problems  
for some browsers, and is never needed to achieve visual effects. For  
example, if you are worried about unwanted spacing before or after the  
form,

form {margin: 0;}

in your stylesheet will remove all of it.
