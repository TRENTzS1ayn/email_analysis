Correct. 10646-1:2000 (2nd edition) is on a separate numbering
of amendments now, and has already got a published Amendment 1.

The Korean amendment to 10646-1:1993 took a long time to process.
The DAM ballot closed 1996-12-15. That was effectively the point
of approval. The publication was supposed to take place in 1997,
but font problems delayed it, and the notice of publication
indicates 1998-05-15 as the date of official publication by ITTF.

The Unicode Standard Version 2.0, of course, was published much earlier,
based on the design that was effectively fixed by the FDAM back
in early 1996.
