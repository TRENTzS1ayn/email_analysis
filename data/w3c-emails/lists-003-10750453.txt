The point Martin may be making is that some tools insert a BOM
at the start of a resource they consider to be encoded using
UTF-8, but do not do so for a resource they consider to be
encoded using US-ASCII.

I have just carried out the following test.  I opened Notepad
under Win2K and typed the letter "a".  I then saved the file,
leaving the default encoding of "ANSI".  I then saved the file
again, under a different name, specifying "UTF-8" as the
encoding.  I then checked the file sizes using Properties.
The first file is 1 byte long; the second 4 bytes.
