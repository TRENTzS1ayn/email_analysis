If you give me a better suggestion for how to interpret
../character-set-info/windows-1251, I'll go with it.
And I wouldn't have to use URI rules, even on a single
machine, with several OSes, it would be pretty much the
same. And I actually got to the point I wanted after
going up and down in the hierarchy a bit more.

Let's please not use philosophical arguments to detract from
the straightforward job of cleaning up the redirects.
