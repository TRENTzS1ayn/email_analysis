Keith and Martin,

Just to add....

I'm in the process of moving all of the registrations
to WWW.IANA.ORG.

This is 1 of 3 areas that are the last to be moved
from isi.edu to iana.org.

For example:

http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-set-info/windows-1251

will be moved to something like this:

http://www.iana.org/character-set-info/windows-1251

As soon as I complete this I will send a note to the ietf-charsets list.

Let me know if you see anything else that needs to be changed.

Thanks,

Michelle
IANA

why do you assume that ../character-set-info/windows-1251 is a URI
or that the rules for relative URIs apply here?

the real lesson, I think, is to not embed filenames into documents.
