Martin and Harald,

I have made some changes to the Character Set information
that is linked from the IANA page at 
http://www.iana.org/numbers.htm.

These changes include the following:

I have added: <http://www.iana.org/assignments/charset-reg/index.htm>

This now replaces the isi.edu page.

At: <http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets>

I have updated the registrations that include pointers
to registration templates to now point to www.iana.org

Please let me know if you see anything that appears incorrect.

Michelle
IANA
