If I haven't done it before, I hereby approve this registration.

With regard to the non-ASCII characters in the registration, please delete 
them; I have no way of verifying if they are correct or not...

             Harald

Dear all,

Attached is the registration of the GBK charset for IANA.
Thanks to Bruno Haible for notifying me the subtle difference among
GBK implementations, and for his affirmation that we should treat
GBK == CP936.  :-)  All comments and suggestions are welcome.

Cheers,

Anthony
