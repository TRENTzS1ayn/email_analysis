is there a non-Web publication of this charset, or is it registered with 
some standardization agency?

web references have this nasty habit of disappearing after a few years....

my personal hope would be that it is "limited use" - I think the world is 
not served well by more widespread charsets. But your opinion may be 
different.

btw, for some reason it is common to have the "csNNN" name as an alias, and 
have the name not starting with "cs"......
