ISO 10646 equivalency table: See specification.

Additional information:
   CESU-8 is an 8-bit Compatibility Encoding Scheme for UTF-16 (CESU) that
   is intended for internal use within systems processing Unicode in order
to
   provide an ASCII-compatible 8-bit encoding that is similar to UTF-8 but
   preserves UTF-16 binary collation. Data encoded in CESU-8 should only be
   exchanged when it is labeled as such in a higher-level protocol or is
   agreed upon in an API definition.
