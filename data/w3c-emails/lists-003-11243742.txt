The proposal clearly states that CESU-8 is not for common use, both in the
description provided and in the Intended Usage block. It can however be
used between consenting and supporting systems when appropriately tagged as
CESU-8 in a higher-level protocol.  This also is stated in the DUTR.  MIME
types are just one of the higher level protocols for describing the
encodings, although in the case of CESU-8 the registration also states that
it is unsuitable for use as a MINE type.

IANA registration is important to CESU-8 as it will be (is) in systems from
several large software vendors, and IANA registered charsets are frequently
used within products to provide a canonical and vendor-neutral name for a
character set used within code, file descriptions etc.

Nothing in RFC 2278 requires that the character set registered is in common
use or suitable for open common interchange.

The statement "It is not intended nor recommended as an encoding used
for open information exchange." is underlined in the TR for emphasis.

Charset labels are used for exchanging information. Thus, CESU-8 is
*not* a candidate for having a charset label.
