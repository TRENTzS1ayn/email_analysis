hello,
my name is semir dzankovic and I am a student from Germany. I lam looking for detailed informations to function of html-tidy. uses tidy the dom-api or the sax-api for the generation of xhtml from html?  on the website (tidy.sourceforge.net) of tidy I did not find the concrete details, which can be the effect of my bad english.
perhaps you can give me some help.

thank you very much
                semir dzankovic
