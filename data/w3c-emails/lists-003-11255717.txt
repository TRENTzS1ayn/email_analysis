The more important problem, from the point of view of the Unicode
Consortium at this point, is that the "TR" is not yet an approved
TR. It is a Draft Unicode Technical Report, available for
public review, but not yet finally approved. I quote from the
status section:

"This is a draft document which may be updated, replaced, or
superseded by other documents at any time. This is not a stable
document; it is inappropriate to cite this document as other
than a work in progress."

So while it may be appropriate for Toby to start a registration
on the basis of the current definition, I don't think it would be
appropriate to actually approve and post a registration for "CESU-8"
until the DUTR #26 is actually approved by the UTC and posted as
a final UTR #26 -- at which point the document becomes stable
and referenceable.
