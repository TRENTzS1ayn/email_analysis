I think that Roozbeh had these ISO 8859-6 characters in mind:

0xEB    ARABIC FATHATAN
0xEC    ARABIC DAMMATAN
0xED    ARABIC KASRATAN
0xEE    ARABIC FATHA
0xEF    ARABIC DAMMA
0xF0    ARABIC KASRA
0xF1    ARABIC SHADDA
0xF2    ARABIC SUKUN

These *are* combining characters, or am I loosing something?
