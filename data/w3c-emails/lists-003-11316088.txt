Apologies for taking a VERY long time to respond to this batch of 
registrations.

Overarching question: Is it the intent of the Japanese-XML activity that 
one should register 13 new character sets for active use in data 
interchange?

This seems like a very strange way to promote interoperability.
But there may be something I do not understand here - I have not studied 
the matter.
