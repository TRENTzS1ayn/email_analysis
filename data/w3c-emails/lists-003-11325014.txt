nobody seems to have commented on this....

if "macintosh" is used in the industry to refer to a charset that has the 
euro sign in it, then I, personally, think that we should update the 
registration to point out that fact.

In a more rational world, a new "macintosh-euro" charset would be 
registered, but the currency symbol is the single most useless character I 
know about - redefining its codepoint does not cause a great deal of harm 
to the world.

What do others think?
