Hi Dolores:

>Can anyone tell me if there have been any updates to the following

>ISO8859-1
>ISO8859-2
>ISO8859-5
>ISO8859-9
>ISO8859-13
>ISO8859-15

The ISO catalogue lists publication dates as:

ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998
ISO/IEC 8859-2:1999
ISO/IEC 8859-5:1999
ISO/IEC 8859-9:1999
ISO/IEC 8859-13:1998
ISO/IEC 8859-15:1999

Please don't forget

ISO/IEC 8859-14:1998

which has some users in at least Ireland and Wales. Note also

ISO/IEC 8859-16:2001

which supports Romanian and was published last year.

One last thing,

ISO 8859-7:1987

which supports Greek is under revision and does have some additional 
characters in the code page, I believe.
