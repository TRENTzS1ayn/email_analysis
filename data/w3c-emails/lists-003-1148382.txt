Does your newsletter accept health article submissions? The 
article would be f^ree to use as long as my source box 
(with active link to my website) is included.

If you do accept article submissions, would you please tell 
me the correct email address where I should send my article 
and the name of the person to whom I should send it.

Thanks and have a great day!
