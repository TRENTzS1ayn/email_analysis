BTW, fortunately, they do allow legal IETF charset names too, and glibc etc.
follow IETF charset names quite closely.  What Li18nux requires is for
Li18nux-compliant systems to support Li18nux's own locale names in addition
to existing locale names.  Hmm...

I suppose they wanted to be consistent: GB-2312, GB-K and GB-18030.

But yes, point taken.  Thanks for your response!

Personally, I am not terribly fond of the Li18nux locale name guide either,
and I somewhat shudders at things like GB-K and HKSCS-BIG5 (well, at least
that is better than TCA-BIG5-HKSCS).  Nevertheless, I guess the Li18nux
committee have their reasons.

But yes, if you think there is no need to add these aliases to the IETF
Charset registry, that's perfectly fine with me too.  :-)

Thanks!

Anthony
