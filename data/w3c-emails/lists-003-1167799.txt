Hi All,

On Feb. 9 I asked several questions re: Tidy Beta version 15-Jan-2004, and
received some good help in operation.  However, one error keeps getting
introduced.  Note... the version in use is a plug-in to Chami's HTML-Kit
Version 1.0, Build 292, on Win-98.

After a beautify function, a non-visible, non-us-ascii character is being
added somewhere in several strings.  It seems to be happening on a line
which includes <br /> by itself, or a space after </a> at the end of a line,
or when there are two spaces between a period and the beginning of the next
sentence (such as in "...word.  Word...")

The xhtml 1.1 validator hiccoughs at such a time, can't say what the
character is, and won't proceed.

Does anyone know how to make whatever this character visible so that it can
be edited out?  And, of course, it should be looked into for the next build.

Thanks.

Harold Baughan
