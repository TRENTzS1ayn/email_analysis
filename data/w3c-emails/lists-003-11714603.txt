Uma,
the flipside of your comment is that if the guardianship is not done, the 
charset registry is at the mercy of whoever who wants to add inappropriate 
aliases to the registry :-)

if you want to change the procedures, you could try taking the existing 
procedures, reformulating or extending them the way you think they should 
be, and sending the result to this list, and eventually the IETF 
internet-drafts directory for discussion.

The IETF is a consensus process driven by those willing to do the work....
