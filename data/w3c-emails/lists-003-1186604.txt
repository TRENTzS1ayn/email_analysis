Thank you, Bjoern.

> reproduce the problem with an ideally simple test case.

There's the rub.  If I could figure out how to make the character *visible*
I could isolate it without tying up the W3C on-line validator.  I tried
"filtering" text through the plain-text Notepad program, but that didn't
clean anything.

I shall attempt this approach... The next time it pops up, I will save it as
a new document, and then delete everything around the problem area.  That'll
create a short file which may be emailed to anyone who cares to look -- or
post it to my site.

My own personal bet... it will now act like an upset stomach the instant you
walk into the doctor's office. ...And go away for a while.  :-)

I shall also look for that hex editor.  Hmmm.  Could the problem be
something else that I'm not seeing yet?  Such an editor might even prove
Tidy to be innocent of all charges!
