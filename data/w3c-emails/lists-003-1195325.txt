Give the man a cigar!

I have not been able to find a <nobr> element in the source text.  However,
I obtained a copy of the Frhed Hex editor and through it's eyes saw the evil
little creature in the final text.  An a0.  When I copy it in context from
the hex editor into this email, it comes out as follows --
"So, was it John Curtis?<bh:a0> Or perhaps the namesake of "

But now I've bounced around so much and tried so many things that I cannot
specifically remember/prove that the *only* source could have been Tidy.
(There were two spaces after the punctuation in the original text.)  So it's
time to backtrack and re-investigate. <sigh>
