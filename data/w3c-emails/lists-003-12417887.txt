I  am  Mr Ben Brown,  a farm  owner  in  Zimbabwe.   I 
have fifty farming  site  in  Zimbabwe, twenty 
tractors  with  one  hundred  and  twenty  workers.  
Then  the  Zimbabwe   ruling   government  of 
President Robert  Mugabe   ordered   for   the 
siezure  of  all  the  farming   lands  of  the  white 
own  farmers,  he  also  siezed  all  my  lands 
because  I  am  an  opposition  party  to  his 
government,  his  government  is  violating   the 
human  right  in  the  southern  region  of Africa. 
So  some  of  the  farm owners  where  killed  and 
their  properties  looted  by  the  war  veterans,  so 
I  being  a  black  Zimbabwean  I managed  to  move 
my  tractors  and  sold  them  to  the  south  African 
farmers.  I sold   all  my  properties  and  raised 
the  sum  of  US $22,300,000.00. 
                                                     
      Then  I  deposited  this   money  in  the 
Security  Company  at  Johannesburg  South  Africa  in 
the  safe  box.  I m  residing  temporary  now  in 
Johannesburg  as  a  political  assylum  seeker 
because  of  the  fear  of  Mugabe  who  are  seeking 
to  kill  me. 
Because  of  the  south  African  refugee  law, I 
cannot  deposit  this  money  in  the  bank  or 
invest  the  money  here  in  south  Africa,  that's 
why  I m  seeking  an  oversea   assistance  who  will 
help  me  transfer   this   money  to  his or  her 
account  to  his  country,  both  company  or 
individual.  I  get   your  address  through  a  
diplomatic  search  for  a  reliable  person.   I 
will  be  very  greatful  if  you  will  help  me  to 
transfer  this  money  on  your  account  or  find  a 
trust worthy  person  to   transfer  this  money.  I 
have  planned   a  smooth free  transaction  here  on 
my  side  because  I get  this  money   through  my  
effort  and  my  hard  work,  so  I have  noting   to 
fear.  The  break  down  of  this 
transaction  were  as  follows 
(1)  70% of  this  money  will  be for  me for  an 
investment  in  your  country. 
(2)  25% of  this  money  will  be  for  you  for 
your  assisting  me  to  transfer  it  on  your 
account  to  your   country. 
(3)  5%  of  this  money  will  be  for  any  expensis 
made  by  you  or  anyother  person  during  the 
transfering 
period. In  regard   of   this  request,  if  you  are 
willing   to  help  me,  Kindly  reply  me 
immediately and include your private tel/fax numbers. 
Thanks  and  God  bless 

Ben  Brown.
