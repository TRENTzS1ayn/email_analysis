I am Bariister Ekuma Nkama,the arthoney of the wife of late Nigerian 
Head of state,General Sani Abacha who died of heart attack on the 8th 
of june 1998 while still on active service for our country .
   I am contacting you with the hope that you will be of great 
assistance to her and the family.she currently have within her reach 
the sum of 
30 million u.s. dollars cash which she intend to use for investment 
purposes. This money came as a result of a payback contract deal 
between 
her husband and a Russian firm in our country's multi-billion dollar 
Ajaokuta Steel plant.
     The russian partners returned her husband's share being the above 
sum after his death. Presently new civilian gorvernment has intensified 
their probe into her husband financial resources which led to the 
freezing of all their accounts, local and foreign, the revoking
of all their business licenced and the arrest of her first son. In view
of this, she acted very fast to withdraw this money from one of their
finance house before it was closed down.
   she has deposited the money in a security company here in 
Nigeria(with a coded name)as family treasure in two trunks with the 
help of very 
legal officials of her late husband. No record is known about this fund 
by the government because there is no documentation showing that she 
receive such due to the current situation in the country and government 
attitude to her family, she closely monitored and cannot make use of 
this money hence she seek your assistance in receiving these funds and 
pay 
into your account for family safety.
    Bearing in mind that you may assist her, she had decided to part 
with you 20% of the total sum.
  I her personal lawyer -Barrister ekuma nkama has been mandated to 
handle this matter,therefore feel free to contact
me at e_nkama@excite.com for alarification and further  
discussion and Note that all correspondences should be directed to me.

 Barri.Ekuma Nkama
