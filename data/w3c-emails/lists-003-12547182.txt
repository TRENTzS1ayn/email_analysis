Hello Michael,

Some more comments below. The most important comment:

It would help everybody if you resent your mail with the proposals
at the beginning of the mail, and the justification afterwards
(i.e. US English order :-).

Please note that this clearly says "Right hand part of the Cyrillic
Alphabet". While this is really strange (the Cyrillic alphabet doesn't
have hands), it intends to say that it defines only the right part
(i.e. hex 0x80-0xFF) of some actual encoding.

RFC 1345 contains many other cases where only part of an actual encoding
is identified. It is unclear what these registrations (with labels mostly
of the form ISO-IR-foo) are actually standing for. There is a widespread
opinion that they as such should not be in the registry at all.

It is difficult to assert 'great quantity'. What would be helpful is to
have at least one example each of:
- Software implementing ISO-IR-111 according to the official document
- Software implementing ISO-IR-111 according to RFC 1345

Do you know such examples?

But just defining another alias doesn't solve the problem of differing
implementations. If we want to clear up things completely, a new registration
would be much better.
