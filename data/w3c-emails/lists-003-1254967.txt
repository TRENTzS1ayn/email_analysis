Did you try this: tidy -i -xml -asxml

This file:
<test><application>Creme</application> is not so much a single
    application, as an <emphasis>integration</emphasis> of a wide
    range of Open Source components.</test>

gives this:
<test>
<application>Creme</application>

is not so much a single application, as an 
<emphasis>integration</emphasis>

of a wide range of Open Source components.</test>
