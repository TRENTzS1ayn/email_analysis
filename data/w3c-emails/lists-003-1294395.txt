The problem here is that you use markup that is not allowed in any W3C
defined document type. For example the <marquee> element is not defined
by W3C, it is a proprietary extension, hence Tidy will report any
document containing the <marquee> element as HTML proprietary. Tidy
should also tell you what is wrong with your document, e.g.

  line 1 column 1 - Warning: <marquee> is not approved by W3C

or

  line 1 column 1 - Warning: <body> proprietary attribute "topmargin"

It would be helpful if you tell us what the Validator is complaining
about.
