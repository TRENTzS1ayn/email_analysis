We have a number of questions about the application of RFC 2978 that are
important for resolving which charsets IBM should register. Since this is
much easier with a formatted document instead of plaintext email, there is a
formatted document with the questions at the following address:

http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/icuhtml/design/charset_questi
ons.html

This document gives a number of named examples, and ask the following
questions:

Q1. If charset Base is already registered, which of the others is a possible
candidate for registration?

Q2. If charset Base_Roundtrip1 is registered, which of the others is a
candidate for registration?

Q3. How does the RFC handle such additions over time?

Q4. Does the RFC require any sort of stability?

Q5. Can mapping tables be added to older registrations?

Q6. It would appear to us that there are two possible bright-line rules.
Which is the closest to IANA policy?

We would appreciate getting any information on the policies that are being
followed, since the RFC is very unclear to us in a number of areas.
