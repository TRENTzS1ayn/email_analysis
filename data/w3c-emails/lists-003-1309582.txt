Hi great people!

Tidy keeps saying: Document content looks like HTML proprietary I looked for
days but can't find what DOCTYPE I should put in.

I tried the 4.01 transitional, loose but W3 keeps saying that is not
correct.
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

I didn't create the site, just optimizing it, and I don't know, the site has
some Java Script for drop down menus, otherwise nothing special. What do I
need to put in?

Thanks you,
