Can tidy be used to alter transitional XHTML into valid strict HTML? My
current focus is on the allowable child elements of the <body> tag. I have a
transitional input file with <a> and <br> tags as children of <body>. When I
run tidy with "output-xhtml: true" and "doctype: strict" in my config file,
it does indeed output a strict XHTML DOCTYPE declaration, but it still leaves
the <a> and <br> tags as direct children of the <body> tag.

 

Am I trying to use Tidy in a manner for which it is not intended?

 

Thanks,

Leonard
