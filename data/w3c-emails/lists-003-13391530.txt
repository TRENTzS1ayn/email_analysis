Dear Sir,

I am Emma Chuks, A senior accountant with the Union Bank of Nigeria ( Head Office). One of our clients,  Engineer Butch Miguel, who owned a fixed deposit account of $15m ran away from Nigeria as soon as he was discovered by government for been ivolved in illegal oil bunkering and  he is about forfitting this staggering amount to the bank as no next of kin follows up the fund for over 3 years now. In accordance with our bank's official ethics and or regulations, such account shall be forfitted entirely to the bank's treasury. This development is only known within the mein of the senior bank accountants who has resolved to look for a foreign partner who would stand as Next of Kin and claim the money on our behalf. Your entitlements shall be between 15-20% of this sum as the case may be if you will be able and honest to provide a serviceable foreign bank account that will accomodate this fund for our mutual benefit. 

I shall arrange a Notary Public/Attorney on your behalf who shall process some vital documents necessary to grant you a legal status of Next of Kin and beneficiary of the fund. I and the Notary Public shall guide you in the process and I will as well advise the Notary Public where necessary for a successful remittance of the fund. Necessary documents which shall be obtained and duly endorsed by the bank before forwarding to you to enable you prove absolute genuiness of the fund before your country's government and or bankers or as the case may be. 

To enable us commence the process, please send immediately to me the following: 
(i) Your full names/mailing adress. 
(ii) Phone/fax numbers.

NOTE: You are required to nominate a bank account (your bank account) where the fund shall be remitted upon acquiring all necessary approvals. In conclusion, this whole exercise is expected to take 7-10 working 
days if you strickly comply to my instructions and directives as an insider in the bank. Also confirm that you will NOT sit on my share of the money on successful completion. 

Waiting for your urgent response.
