I sent in a question on April 22 to the registrar, and as yet see no
answer.

IBM is in the position of needing to register perhaps hundreds of
charsets, and we need better information before we start; otherwise we
could end up with either redundant registrations or missing charsets.

BTW, the only mail archive I could find was on
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-charsets/2003AprJun/subject.html,
but that archive is full of spam. Is there a better source?

Subject: Charset Identity and Registration Questions

We have a number of questions about the application of RFC 2978 that
are
important for resolving which charsets IBM should register. Since this
is
much easier with a formatted document instead of plaintext email,
there is a
formatted document with the questions at the following address:
