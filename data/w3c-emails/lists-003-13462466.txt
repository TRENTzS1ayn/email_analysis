Hello Mark,

'a question' is a very big understatement. It was a long list of
questions, with additional material outside your mail.
Also, please be aware of the fact that 'the registrar' is
just a secretarial function, they don't have the necessary
technical knowledge to answer such questions.

I had a look at the questions, and the outside material, and
I think that all your questions make sense, and should be answered
by this list. But I was just overwhelmed by the number of questions,
and had no idea where to start. (also, I was on a trip) So I gave up.

While I think that most of the questions you ask make sense, I think
you should be aware that the answers may not be straightforward.
Many of these questions just haven't been considered up to now.

Also, you should be aware that, at least between updates to the
relevant registration documents (RFC), this list (and similar ones)
work in some sense similar to (UK or US) case law. I.e. if you want
an answer to a question, you have to bring a case that exhibits this
question (i.e. an actual registration). While this is not a hard-and-
fast condition for discussion on this list, it clearly makes
discussion easier.

Sorry about that. I thought this had been dealt with, apparently
it hasn't. I'll try to have it fixed.

Regards,    Martin.
