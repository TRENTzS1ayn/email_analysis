Standard Assurance Company Ltd.,
Plot 1 Eletu - Wase Street, 
Lagos Island, Lagos. 

Dear SIR, 

I am Dr,GODWIN AWELE. Executive Director in charge of claims and indemnity of Standard Assurance Company Ltd.I joined the services of the above firm in 1975. The company has a strong asset base of over Two Hundred Million United States Dollars and is a major force in Nigeria's Insurance Industry. General Insurance, Marine and Life Assurance are but some of the services rendered by my company. In my capacity over the years as head of Claims and Indemnity Department, I have been in most cases coming across several unclaimed life Assurance Benefits of both Foreigners and Nigerian. These claims amount to several millions in International Currency Denominations. 

The Nigeria Insurance Law on unclaimed benefits stipulates under seciton 7 subsection 10 cap 15 Laws of the Federation, that "once such unclaimed benefits have over stayed a maximum moratorium period of ten years, it should be returned and forfeited to the Government treasury. It is disheartening to learn that instead of such funds to be properly utilized by Government, some corrupt officials working in the ministry of social welfare often end up pocketing and enriching themselves with such unclaimed benefits as against humanritarian purposes they are supposed toserve. A pathetic case that prompted my deisre to contact you is that of MR.WILLIAMS RICHARD, a native of the now Breakup Republic of Yugoslavia. This man was our client and has a Life Assurance Policy worth Seventeen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars. 

MR. WILLIAMS RICHARD died about nine years ago in a Helicopter crash on an offshore crude oil exploration and has long been buried. The only known relation of his in our records died during the civil war in Yoguslavia and ever since, all eforts made by us to establish contacts with any other of his relation has proved unseccessful. His Assurance Policy will expire in the next few months from the date of this letter. Just last week we received an instruction from Ministry of Social Welfare to forward particulars of all unclaimed benefits that will expire in the next few months. It is not my intention to allow some corrupt government officials to line their pocket thistime around. In view of the above situation, coupled with my past experiences with government officials, I decided to contact you immediately for your assistance. The assistance I require from you is quite simple, to provide an account where these funds could be transferred to, and to forward claim to us as a distant cousin of Mr. Richard.Once yu do this, I would use my office to ensure a hitch-free success in tranferring the funds to your nominated overseas account, which will take about Twenty-one workingdays. Please note, that I am moved to do this because I am about to retire from a ctive service and this is the only opportunity to "make hay while sun shines". 

Time is of the essence in this matter and I do hope that you will appreciate these circumstances. As per the mode of sharing I and a colleague of mine have agreed to concede 30% of the total sum as above mentioned to you. 10% will be set aside for expenses generally, while the remaining 60% will be for all of us. For any additional information you may need, contact me on my personal  (alternative). Your early response and trust you will accord the information contained herein confidential. Thank you and God blessings. 

Kind Regards, 
Dr. GODWIN  AWELE
