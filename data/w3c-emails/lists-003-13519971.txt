You're right, I should have written "some questions".

The situation is that we have some 700ish mapping tables in ICU, and
many others in CDRA. While we do not need to register all of them,
there is a substantial number that we will need to register. The
problem is that many of them differ only to a small degree, in a
fashion that may or may not be permitted as a single registration
according to the RFC. So we need to get some clarity on what the RFC
requires before registering any of them.

A tight definition of a 'charset' would have *every* difference in
mappings count, including roundtrips, fallbacks, reverse fallbacks,
and extensions. A loose definition might only count roundtrip
mappings, and allow extensions (e.g. windows-1252 before and after the
Euro addition counting as the same registration, even though different
results are returned in mapping). There would be a very different set
of registrations resulting from which definition we should use (or
something inbetween).

Despite your recommendation, I am still rather reluctant to bombard
the list with all the different possible registrations. For everyone's
sake, it would really help to get some clarity first! That is why we
boiled down the questions to very simple examples. Each of those
examples actually illustrates a known problem, but is *much* easier to
comprehend than a multipage mapping table. If you think it would
facilitate matters, I could put out a separate email for each of the
questions.
