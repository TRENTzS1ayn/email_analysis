Subject: [other] Bug Report

 

To whom it may concern:
Using Windows 98 and running HTML Tidy from the command prompt using the
command line "tidy -m index.html" results in excellent performance until it
has finished finding the errors. Then, it crashes with the error message of
Error: Can't open "index.html"
The index.html file used is attached.
