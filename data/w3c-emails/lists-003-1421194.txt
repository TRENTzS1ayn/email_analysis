Ah, there's your problem: you're setting "bare" to "yes".  Change it to
"no", or just remove the option since "no" is the default.

I just remembered I got bitten by this a long time ago too.  The quickref
documentation should probably be updated to be more explicit.  This is what
it says now ...

This option specifies if Tidy should strip Microsoft 
specific HTML from Word 2000 documents, and output 
spaces rather than non-breaking spaces where they 
exist in the input.

... which hardly indicates the possible "side effects". :) 

Anyway, I kept your entire config file as is -- except for commenting out
the "bare: yes" -- and got the desired &mdash; when I re-ran Tidy on it.
