> Hi There,
> 
> My name is Kobi and I'm using the JTidy.
> 
> I am trying to parse piece of HTML content using the JTidy (for example HTML table), then I'm doing some manipulations on the loaded Dom.
> So far so good, but when I'm getting back the result the Jtidy returns the snippet HTML but with the <HTML>  <BODY> and <META> tags...
> 
> My question is how can I get only the snippet HTML without the added tags?

> Your quick answer will be very appreciate!!!
