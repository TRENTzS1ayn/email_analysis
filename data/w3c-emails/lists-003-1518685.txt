I have been using Tidy GUI with Word 2000 for a few years.  For SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HTML documents, you have to "Save it down" to HTML
3.2.  Tidy does a wonderful job with Word 2000.  There are minimal tags that
need to be changed.   Occationally, a few smart quotes or (&#146, &#147,
etc., slip though)


My newest delima is that I have a new laptop -- XP -- Word 2002 XP.   I have
tried saving the Word document as Web Page, Filtered, and then take through
Tidy GUI.  My problem is that codes such as o:p and <span>, <style> and
these tags are not allowed by the SEC.

ANY SUGGESTIONS.


MANY THANKS.
