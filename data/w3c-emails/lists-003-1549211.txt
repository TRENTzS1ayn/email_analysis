When Tidy fixes Word XML it is very agressive in removing markup that 
otherwise would be acceptable HTML. For this reason, when it is told to fix 
Word 2000 output it checks to be sure that the file it is fixing really was 
created by M$Word. If it doesn't find an M$Word signature at the beginning of 
the file it does not perform the Word cleanup.

When you use the HTML filter with Word 2002 it strips from the output the 
signatures that Tidy uses to detect Word XML, while leaving in much of the 
content that makes M$Word output so objectionable. As a result, Tidy doesn't 
perform the Word cleanup, even though you asked it to.

Try saving your output from Word "as Web Page", but not filtered. I think you 
may find that this will solve your problem.
