Hello every body,
I'd like to know if there is any way to parse just a part of a document 
and retrieve a Node which can be then attached to the DOM. My need is to 
add to the DOM created for the document, the HTML code generated by some 
javascripts available in the page also. The HTML generated from the 
javascript is just a part of the document.... I need to process it 
separately and then add it to the DOM where it belongs...
The problem is that JTidy crates Document for the piece of HTML and 
always add the <head> and <body> tags. Even worse... It put my piece of 
html in the head or in the body or in both depending on its contents, 
and I need to have it encapsulated as it is.....

Can you help ?
