21 Days to A Positive-Attitude Habit 
(c) Copyright 2004 by Patricia Wagner  

This may come as a surprise... but your attitude is more 
important than your aptitude in determining your success
in life!  

Just how critical is attitude to achievement? Well, take a 
look at one of the greatest inventors of the last two 
hundred years - Thomas Edison. Every time you turn on a 
light switch, you experience the result of his persistence 
in the face of continuous failure. 

Edison tried 10,000 times to get his light bulb invention to 
work, but failed each time. However, he had this to say 
about his lack of success. "I have not failed. I've just 
found 10,000 ways that won't work."  

You can learn to have this kind of outlook on life, but it 
needs to be purposefully installed into your daily living.  

You probably know it takes about 21 days to break a habit
by replacing it with a new one. If you are plagued with 
persistent negative thoughts toward life, you can replace 
this mindset with a new positive-attitude habit!  

Here is a 21-day five-step program to change a negative 
attitude to a positive one.  

1. Take charge of what you're thinking.

This is a moment-by-moment decision that doesn't happen 
overnight. It's a habit that will take some time to build. 
How can you do this? Choose to think uplifting thoughts 
instead of discouraging ones.  

You get to decide what you think, which in turn determines 
how you feel. Become aware of this and dwell on positive 
ideas throughout the day.  

At first you may have to force yourself to find something 
positive. Consider keeping a journal and write down at least 
one good thing in your life each day for three weeks. Then 
think about these blessings instead of discouraging 
thoughts.  

2. Read inspirational material.

During this 21-day training period, fill your mind with good 
thoughts. The best book of all to read is that priceless 
diamond of world literature - the Bible. You'll never know 
what wonderful results from reading it are around the corner 
until you open its covers!  

3. Focus on others.

For the next 21 days make an extra effort to help other 
people. Concentrating on assisting others will help you more 
than you realize. If you succeed in becoming wealthy 
but are poor in respect to your relationships, you will not 
be truly prosperous at all!  

So make a special effort of focusing on others during your 
21 days of building your new positive-attitude habit. This 
will free you up to allow the butterfly of happiness to land 
on your shoulder when you least expect it.  

4. Take care of your health needs. 

It's hard to maintain a positive mindset if you've neglected 
your physical needs. So during the 21 days of your attitude 
retraining make an extra effort to eat nutritious balanced 
meals. 

Not getting enough sleep will also be a tremendous 
hindrance, so make sure you're getting adequate rest. And 
don't forget to get enough exercise. When you feel down, try 
to take a brisk 30-minute walk. You'll feel revived!  

5. Learn contentment

For the next 21 days focus on what you have and not on what 
you don't have. Live in the present and enjoy your 
blessings.  

Try to forget acquiring stuff for the purpose of keeping up 
with others. That only leads to more anxiety. Be thankful 
for what you do have instead.  

When going through difficult experiences - remember that 
adversity can be a blessing in disguise. You might learn 
some important lessons during those tough times - like 
Thomas Edison did. (I know I have.) 

These lessons can turn into credentials that will enable you to help 
others when they're going through tough times.  

So don't let negativity ruin your present and future. 
Instead, build a new habit of having a positive attitude. It 
will take about 21 days to start seeing consistent changes 
in the way you think, but it will be worth it!  

Now choose the starting date for your attitude-renewal 
adventure and go for it!  

How about today?
