Hello...  I built my site's web page using Mozilla's page editor.  I 
didn't realize until recently what a mess it had made of the pages; 
nested styles all over the place...  I tried running html-tidy on it, 
with the option to join styles, but the result is still an awful mess.  
I'd appreciate if someone could take a look at the page, see why tidy is 
having problems with it, and maybe include that function in a future 
version so that I'll be able to clean things up better.  (You might also 
want to try and get Mozilla to include your parser in its page 
generation system.)

The page that's in the worst condition is at 
http://www.bittornado.com/download.html .
