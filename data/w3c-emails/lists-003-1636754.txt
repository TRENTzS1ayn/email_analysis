Hi,
We try to normalize types of styles and put them in an external style sheet. I can see that this is not happening at all on your site.

I found an excellent tidy implementation in html kit http://www.chami.com/html-kit/plugins/info/htmltidybeta/
but I still haven figured out how to run the php one standalone. 
thanks !
ct
