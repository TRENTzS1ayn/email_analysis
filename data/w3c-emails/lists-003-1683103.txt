Success Stories

      Dear Singles' Bar,

       I live in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada and had never heard of Singles-bar.com. While web surfing one day, I came across your banner ad on Mag4you.com and signed up more out of curiosity than anything else, but one ad really caught my eye. I sent a message right away and got a reply the very same night. Ryan and I sent messages for two days, talked on the phone for two more, then we met in person. As fate would have it, we lived in the same neighborhood. In fact, I drove by Ryan's apartment every day on my way to work. 
       
      After three months we moved in together and were married within 6 months of meeting. It has been the happiest moment of our lives. We just bought our first house and are starting a business together. I never would have dreamed I'd be where I am today. We love telling our story (it reminds us of a fairy tale) and recommend Singles-bar.com to all our friends.

      Michelle & Ryan
      Edmonton, Alberta, Canada
