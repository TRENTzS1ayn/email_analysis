The workshop is definitely on. We have about 25 people and seven talks 
scheduled. 

Jim Whitehead and I have prepared a detailed schedule, but for now, here's
an outline: (talks are generally 15 minutes each)

Opening Remarks - EJW
"We have met the enemy, and it is HTTP" - RK
"Goals for HTTP-NG" - Mike Spreitzer
break
"High performance HTTP" - Spencer Dawkins, Nortel
"Delta-encoding" - Fred Douglis
lunch
"Collaborative authoring support for the next generation" - EJW
"Rights Management" - Shane Owenby
break
"Open Hypermedia Protocol" - Hugh Davis
Closing Remarks - HFN

plus a few roundtable sections on other requirements.

I am confident this will be a productive day to think more widely about the
future of HTTP than just the -NG prototypes from W3C and Spero's proposal.
Discussion will center around Deployment, Programmability, Performance,
Collaborative services, and Hypermedia application requirements.
