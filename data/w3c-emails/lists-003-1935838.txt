I'll assume you meant "ten lbs. of _HTTP_ in a five lb. bag" :-)

The schedule I just sent out is provisional, and yes, we did pin a name on
your talk out of the blue. The intent is that during the day, each talk kicks
off themed discussion -- in the case of your statement, about network-layer 
performance and integration opportunities. 

Please feel free to retitle the talk -- nothing's binding -- but I just
wanted to illuminate where we were coming from.

Thanks,
Rohit Khare
