For those of you who were unable to attend the Thirteenth International 
Unicode Conference last month in San Jose, the proceedings are now available 
from the Unicode office.  For ordering instructions, please refer to:

   http://www.unicode.org/unicode/uni2book/u2ord.html

There were lots of great talks this time - on fonts, complex script 
rendering, the Unicode collation algorithm, many database talks, and more. 
Check it out.

Co-chair, IUC 13
