              Fourteenth International Unicode Conference

               Unicode and the Web: the Global Connection

                           March 22-25, 1999

                         Boston, Massachusetts

 The Internet and the World Wide Web continue to change the shape of
 computing. The goal of network computing and understandable text
 access across wide, diverse groups of people has brought great
 momentum to computing environments that build Unicode into their
 foundation. Whether it's new internet commerce, network access to
 data, or very portable applications, Unicode makes a solid foundation
 for the network, global enterprises, and software users everywhere.

 The Fourteenth International Unicode Conference will address topics
 ranging from Unicode use in the World Wide Web and in corporate
 and government intranets and databases, to the latest developments
 with Java, CSS, XML and XSL. Conference attendees will include
 managers, software engineers, systems analysts, and product
 marketing personnel responsible for the development of software
 supporting Unicode as well as those involved in all aspects of
 the globalization of software and the Internet.

 THE UNICODE STANDARD

 The Unicode Standard is a 16-bit character encoding encompassing the
 world's principal scripts which provides the foundation for the
 internationalization and localization of software.  With its simple
 and efficient approach to special and modified characters, the Unicode
 Standard defines a new degree of data portability between platforms
 and across borders.  Software (especially modern, distributed systems)
 can be adapted for particular countries far more easily than when
 existing character sets are used.  The Unicode Standard is code-for-
 code identical to the International Standard ISO/IEC 10646.

 For further information on the Unicode Standard, visit the Unicode Web
 site at <http://www.unicode.org> or e-mail <info@unicode.org>
