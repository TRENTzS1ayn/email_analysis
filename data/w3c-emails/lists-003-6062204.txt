Dear colleagues,

At the risk of being unpopular, I commend to you my review of the text of
draft-melikyan-armenian-charsets-00.txt, a draft RFC for Armenian. I do not
believe that this text is suitable to be an RFC, because it recommends the
character sets which do not follow the principles of character set coding
as practiced by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2.

You may find the text at
http://www.indigo.ie/egt/standards/hy/rfc-critique.html. I trust that the
criticisms will be taken in the spirit in which they are offered, namely,
to help improve the usability and interoperability of Armenian.
