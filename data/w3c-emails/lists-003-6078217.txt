Greetings, all. This draft hopefully covers the previous concerns that
people have had with the UTF-16 registrations. Of course, we are open to
comments and suggestions on how we can improve it.

Please note that I have submitted a related draft that is being discussed
on the ietf-types mailing list. It is for a new top-level MIME type that is
appropriate for UTF-16 text.
