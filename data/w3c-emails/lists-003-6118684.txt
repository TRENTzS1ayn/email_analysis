Based on my search of the RFC database, the following RFCs refer to
"unicode-1-1":

RFC 1945: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0

It's one of the listed character sets for HTTP headers.

RFC 2068: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1

Ditto.

RFC 1700: ASSIGNED NUMBERS

The charset database.

RFC 1641: Using Unicode with MIME

The original registration.

None of these seem like they would cause a problem by being obsoleted.
