Martin is completely correct on the first count: I sent the message to the 
wrong list. Here's the recent announcement for the new draft. We think this 
draft covers all the issues discussed here since the last draft. On first 
reading, I agree with some of Martin's nits, but need to look more 
carefully at the substantial stuff. However, please do read the draft and 
let us know if you think it is ready (or almost ready) to be sent off for 
RFChood.
