I think it is almost ready, but I have a nit.

I think that leading 0xFE 0xFF or 0xFF 0xFE in this case (charset = "utf-16") is 
always a byte order mark and is not a zero-width non-break space.  I would like 
to make this explicit, since "the character 0xFEFF in the first
position of a stream MAY be interpreted as a zero-width non-breaking
space, and is not always a byte-order mark." (in 3.2).
