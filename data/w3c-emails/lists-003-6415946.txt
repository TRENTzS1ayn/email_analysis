Are there many text editors that do not use the BOM for UTF-16?  I am 
just asking.

In this I-D, the BOM is a part of the text body rather than an artifact 
for encoding.  If this I-D becomes an RFC, XML is allowed to say that 
the BOM is mandatory, in my opinion.  In fact, the BOM is already mandatory 
in XML 1.0.  Since XML is pervasive, the BOM is likely to become almost 
compulsory.

Cheers,
