I see good reasons for having the BOM with charset="UTF-16".
I see no reason for having a BOM with charset="UTF-16BE" or
charset="UTF-16LE".

I think if we have all three labels and for each of them more
or less have "use a BOM or not as you like", we have the same
mess as before, just with more labels.

I think there are people who believe in the BOM, and others
that think it's a bad idea. My guess is that it's very difficult
to change that. But I think what we can do is to try and make
clear from the sender to the receiver what the position of the
sender was. Basically, then, BOM-lovers would use charset="UTF-16",
and BOM-haters would use charset="UTF-16BE" or charset="UTF-16LE".
We would have several different things, but we would know which is
which.

We wouldn't have to change XML, only to add a clarification to
say that "UTF-16" in the XML spec means only the case
charset="UTF-16", and not the others.

What do you think about it?   Regards,   Martin.
