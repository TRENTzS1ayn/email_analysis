It is not acceptable for protocols that frequently exchange little snippets
of data to always have to put in a BOM and check it at the receiving end.
Far more efficient to agree at the beginning on endianness and then
transmit only the significant characters. 

And later:

It is part of the MIME object (must be, for signature verification for
instance).  After MIME processing, the BOM may or may not be part of the
text.  In XML it is not, by virtue of the XML spec.

Yes, this must be preserved, IMHO.

For big document-like chunks, yes, but there are many other things under
the sun.
