Actually, the charset parameter of text/xml or appliation/xml, if exists, 
is authoritative.  In the case of text/xml, the default is US-ASCII (Jim and 
I were instructed to choose US-ASCII by the IESG, which is aware of the 
inconsistency with HTTP 1.1).  More about this, see RFC2376.

UTF-16 XML entities do *not* have to begin with '<?xml'.  Thus, if the BOM 
is made optional, we have a problem when the charset parameter is not 
available.
