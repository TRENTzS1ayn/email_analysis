I don't understand this. Either some processor is going to do something
with the entity for where it matters whether the entity is BE or LE.
If it's doing this, it has to work on the content anyway. Otherwise,
it's going to do something where endianness doesn't matter, and it
won't have to peek inside. Do I miss something?

I agree. But I think going the other way would be equally fatal:
Not defining things clear enough, and just do handwaving.

I agree. I think we have a compromize. The compromize is to agree that
there are two different ways of handling things, and that if they are
two different ways, they should be clearly separated, and not muddled.
