XML's requirement is based on the encoding, not the tag used to describe it.

Let's face it, forbidding BOMs with the BE/LE tags means that they can't be
used with XML, period.  That's part of the compromise.

They don't mean the same if some indicate byte order while another doesn't.
 That's the basic distinction and it makes sense even if they don't *also*
say something definite about BOMs.
