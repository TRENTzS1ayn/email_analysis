You're right, it's a minor problem.

It's not mere handwaving, the basic distinction between UTF-16 and
UTF-16BE/LE is that the former doesn't tell you byte order while the latter
does.  The BOM issue is secondary, is unclear and will probably remain
soemwhat unclear because of the fact that the BOM does double-duty with the
ZWNBSP.
