>If something is tagged "UTF-16BE" or "UTF-16LE", then it's not "UTF-16",

It certainly is *encoded* in UTF-16, even though it is not *tagged* with
the string "UTF-16".

>and the XML specification doesn't speak about that.

The XML spec says that entities *encoded* in UTF-16 must have a BOM.
However tagged internally or externally.  Putting a "UTF-16BE" tag on an
XML entity doesn't make the requirement go away.
