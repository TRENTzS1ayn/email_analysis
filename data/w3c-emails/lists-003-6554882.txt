Well, yes, in principle.  But the outlook for later versions does not look
promising to me.  The BOM is currently instrumental in ensuring the
self-describability of XML entities.  Requiring an encoding declaration for
UTF-16 entities would be an incompatible change, not acceptable.  Just
dropping the BOM requirement would mean losing the self-describability,
which I consider far less palatable than not being allowed to use the BE/LE
tags.  But perhaps someone will find some magic so that XML can have its
cake and eat it too.
