I disagree. Whether you tell the byte order or not is obviously
very related to whether you need the BOM or not.

If we start with the premise that the BOM is unclear and then
write the document, we will have a self-fulfilling promize.
We can have the same self-fulfilling promize if we separate
things clearly.

And exactly because of the double-duty of the BOM and the ZWNBSP,
it is very helpful to say exactly where we expect a BOM and where not.
