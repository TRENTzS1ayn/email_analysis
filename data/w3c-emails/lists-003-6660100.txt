I don't recall making such a statement, but it seems obvious that some sort of
label would be necessary if you expect other systems to understand and respect
such usage.

It seems to me it would depend on the rules such references follow. If such
references can be qualified with an appropriate charset then there's no
problem. But if not, then you have a potential interoperability problem,
especially given that one of the goals of XML-derived formats is to provide for
interoperability between applications.
