Dear sirs !

 I have thoroughtly studied the following documents :
- RFC-2130. "The Report of the IAB Character Set
   Workshop held 29 February - 1 March, 1996".
- RFC-2184
- RFC-2277 "IETF Policy on Character Sets and Languages"
- RFC-2278 "IANA Charset Registration Procedures"

 It become clean, that document :

http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets

is the MAIN. Many other specifications refer to it.

 However, to my mind, this document should be edited to
be a "full-featured" document. At least it should have
the authors name, the date of issue and the number
of version. It also could contain the link to "interface" :
: RFC-2278. It could be also in HTML or SGML format.

 I hope you will share my opinion and accept my
comments.

with best regards
