There are various aspects:

- Decompositions for existing characters are supposed not to change.
  TR 15 significantly increases the pressure to not change.

- Decompositions for newly defined precomposed characters are dealt with
  by keeping these characters decomposed in the normalized form. If
  charlint meets a character it doesn't know (an undefined codepoint),
  it can warn or abort.

- Support for 'compiling' is currently not part of charlint, but it
  is an idea for future work.

Regards,  Martin.
