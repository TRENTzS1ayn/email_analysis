I was thinking of the composition database; I thought they were different,
from the text in TR15.
There's been some pressure to add new precomposed characters (W with
circumflex? Did this get in already?) to Unicode; if these are added to the 
decomposition database, it does not hurt the correctness of normalization
of existing text that uses the decomposed forms.

If they are added to the composition database, existing normalized text
will turn "incorrect". This is bad.

(This is not really relevant to charlint, but to the underlying issues;
IETF may have to take a stand on normalization Real Soon Now....)

(Favourite decomposition: The Arabic "character" that decomposes into
"In the name of Allah, the compassionate and merciful" - 21
characters, including 3 spaces....)
