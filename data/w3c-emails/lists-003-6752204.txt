They will only be added to the 'decomposition database'. Note however
that the form of the data is not 'decomposition database' and 'composition
database', but it is 'database' and 'composition exclusions'. Your
'decomposition database' is obtained directly from the 'database',
the 'composition database' is the 'database' minus the 'exclusions'.
The decomposition for a newly defined precomposed character after
Unicode V 3.0 will be automatically put both into the 'database' and
into the 'exclusions'.

Exactly. I think the Unicode Consortium and the W3C have a solution
ready, and would be glad to help the IETF adopt it.
