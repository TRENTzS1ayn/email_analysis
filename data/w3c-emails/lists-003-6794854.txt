If we ever get to the point of putting XML-based protocols on standards 
track *and* we want to allow those protocols to use UTF-16/LE/BE (because 
this is allowed by the W3C's XML standard), then I think the UTF-16 
document should be on standards track. I could certainly see a world where 
we want XML-based protocols where UTF-16/BE/LE are prohibited; that would 
be a good world. But if we want to allow interoperable UTF-16 in standards 
track documents, I think this should be on standards track.
