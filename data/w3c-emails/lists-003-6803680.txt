Standards-track documents *can* refer to informational documents.
I can certainly see placing XML-based things on the standards track with 
language that says "MUST use either UTF-8 or UTF-16; SHOULD use UTF-8".
Weakened beyond that, I start feeling unhappy about the XML-based spec, not 
about the sanctity of the references.

There's a reason why we have humans to make these judgment calls.
