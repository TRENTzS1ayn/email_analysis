Hi folks,

I agree with Harald's judgment that Informational and *not*
Proposed Standard is appropriate.  The IETF has done a good
job of updating core IETF protocols to prefer or require
UTF-8.  Over the wire, UTF-16 has a long list of drawbacks
and no visible advantages.  It shouldn't be 'legitimized'
by IETF Proposed Standard designation.

My two cents,
