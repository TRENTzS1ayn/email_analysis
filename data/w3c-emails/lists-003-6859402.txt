My list of disadvantages:

- No compatibility with cstrings due to NULL
- Inability to represent characters outside Planes 0-16
- VERY bad expansion factor for characters outside Plane 0 (100% overhead)
- No ability to mix ASCII and UTF-16 elements in a simple viewer
- Two incompatible byte orders

My list of advantages:

- Does not require conversion between UCS-2 and UTF-16 when only Plane 0
   characters are used in the UTF-16

Note that the single advantage may be listed as a disadvantage if there 
turns out to be lots of applications that "support" UTF-16 the way they 
currently "support" Unicode - by throwing away the high-order bits....
