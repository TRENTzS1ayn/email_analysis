See http://www.unicode.org/pending/pending.html
It's entirely possible that all commonly used scripts will be encoded in 
Plane 0 (if those who fight for traditional Chinese and more precomposed 
characters give up), but I don't think it's likely that ISO will abandon 
Plane 1.

Yes. My mistake; I didn't count properly.
