Oops....apologies; I managed to read your 0..16 as "0".
That's my second stupid error this debate.....my brain must be rotting....

[haring off on an unrelated topic]
one thing I'm not connected enough to have found out:
Is this large set *new* characters, or are parts of the set used for 
rolling back the unifications that created so much tension in and around 
the IRG, for people who want that?

I read you. And see no reason to disagree.
A pity that 21 is not a power of 2.....but that's well beyond the ability 
of standards comittees to accomplish.
