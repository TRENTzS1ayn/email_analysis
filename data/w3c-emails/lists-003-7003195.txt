It's good to see that this has found it's way to this list.

Some comments:

- There is some confusion about MIME. All six proposed encodings
  are listed as 'MIME charsets', but it says that only two of them
  are suitable for use in MIME. Also, while I don't know all the details
  of the proposed encodings, the base encodings EUC-JP and Shift_JIS
  are definitely suitable for use with MIME, and it would surprise
  me if the new, related encodings were not.

- I agree with MURATA Makoto that some comment on how/when the
  encodings should be used (or not) are appropriate. However, simply
  labeling them as legacy encodings may be highly confusing. On the
  other hand, saying something like 'ISO-2022-JP-3 is the encoding
  for Japanese text' is definitely also confusing.

- The draft does not give very many details about the actual encodings.
  The draft should be expanded to contain enough details so that
  implementers not able to understand Japanese can implement the
  encodings.

- It may be very helpful for a wide audience to include some other
  details about JIS X 0213 in the draft. As I haven't see the final
  version of JIS X 0213, I cannot give further details at the moment.

- As JIS X 0213 is not yet published, I think the registration should
  wait until that has happened, and people have had a chance to have
  a look at it. Of course, that doesn't preclude to continue to prepare
  the registration as much as possible.


Regards,   Martin.
