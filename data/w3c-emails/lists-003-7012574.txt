Well, I already sent them to you. I have included the two
other authors of the internet-draft. I hope this helps.

I am copying the ietf-charsets list according to Section 4.1
of rfc2278.html.

I apreciate your kindness. There is indeed no requirement, not
even for an informational RFC. However, as you are planning
to publish an informational RFC, I thought it would be a good
idea to give some more details. I personally don't care, because
I can read Japanese, but I think a lot of people would apreciate
it, and it would greatly help the adoption and uniform implementation
of the new standard and the new 'charset's.

This would be in the tradition of RFC 1468 and RFC 1554 and
others.

While the first public review page at
http://jcs.aa.tufs.ac.jp/jcs/pubrev/index.html contains a lot
of pointers, on the final public review page
http://jcs.aa.tufs.ac.jp/fdis-an.htm I can only find pointers
to submissions to the ISO registry and to ISO/Unicode.
Can you give me a pointer to the actual draft? And can
you update the pointer in the internet-draft to make
things easier to find?

I wouldn't dream to do so. W3C only publishes via the WWW,
so I have no problem with a publication on the WWW, as far
as I can find it.
