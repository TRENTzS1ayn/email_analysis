Hi folks,

I agree.  Let's get this registration and RFC out the door

Ship it!

Cheers,
- Ira McDonald

PS - I've just unsubscribed from my old (soon to die)
Xerox email address and resubscribed from my new 
email address at Sharp Labs America.  Please send
me notes in the future at: imcdonald@sharplabs.com.
