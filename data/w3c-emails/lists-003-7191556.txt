I agree. Just because we made the mistake of registering such things in the
past doesn't mean we should continue to do so.

I think this goes way too far. We have no way of knowing which of the aliases
are in use now. Attempts to scan some tiny subset of transactions in a
particular protocol are entirely futile, as usage of odd things often tends to
be concentrated in small groups of systems. We can deprecate the use of some
names, but like the <font> tag, the existance of these names needs to be
documented, not deleted. (I note in passing that any browser that doesn't
support <font> isn't terribly useful in practice.)

This has already been done. Expect to see the revision available in the very
near future.
