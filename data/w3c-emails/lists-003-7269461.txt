Hi Keld,

Agreed.  Also, the ITU-T T.series and IETF Internet Fax WG
protocols have normative references to each other.  And several
W3C specs have normative references to the IANA Charset Registry.
Planned incoherence is short-sighted.

Comments showing the usual domain of usage of an alias would
be a good improvement.

Cheers,

Some ISO protocols are also internet protocols.
You may in IETF diverge from the charset names used in ISO for
the same concepts and entities, but by doing that you really
miss alignment with ISO naming of charsets.
