I agree that there is no strict requirement; still it would be
a very good thing given the potential importance of these
registrations and their implementations. The RFC on iso-2022-jp
has helped implementation of Japanese mail,... a lot. If the
new RFC could contain the same descriptions, I'm sure it would
help the acceptance of the new standard a lot.

This is a completely confused comment. All of the registrations
are suitable for use with MIME, because all of them allow to
respect the CR/LF conventions of MIME. So this has to be changed
in the internet-draft/RFC.

JIS X 0213, for each of it's characters, lists the ISO 10646
equivalent. That's very nice for the characters that have equivalents
in ISO 10646.

However, JIS X 0213, for those characters that at present do not
have an ISO 10646 equivalent, also lists a value. These values
are given in parentheses. Some text in JIS X 0213 says that these
are not normative, but that's difficult to find for a Japanese
reader, and impossible for somebody not speaking Japanese.

Some of the values in parentheses may turn out to coincide
with the  values that will eventually (hopefully rather soon)
be assigned to these characters by the relevant groups, but some
of them definitely won't coincide.

Those values in parentheses are therefore a serious potential threat
to interoperability, and I consider it absolutely necessary that
both the RFC-to-be and the registrations themselves contain a very
clear warning on this issue.

There is no doubt at all that a lot of work went into this standard,
and in terms of character selection, and in particular in terms of
Kanji selection, the result is excellent and very well based.

And there is now doubt that the things should be registered,
with the necessary precautions.

Some more comments on the Internet Draft itself below.

The words 'the encoding for Japanese text' should be qualified.
It's not clear why it's 'the' and not 'a'.

As I have said before, this is wrong. 8-bit MIME has no problems
with them.
