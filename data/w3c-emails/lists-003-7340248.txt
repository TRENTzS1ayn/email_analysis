No, I would prefer it if IANA took an even stronger stance than that.
These new charsets should be rejected on the grounds that JIS X 0213
itself seriously breaks the rules. People ought to have learned by now,
and it is simply unacceptable for a national standards body to make such
an egregious mistake at this point.

My suggestion is to ask the Japanese standards body to republish (if it
has already been published) JIS X 0213 with those parenthesized code
points either removed or at the very least changed to PUA (Private Use
Area) codes, similar to the MathML spec's use of PUA in MathML 1.0:

Would that be "now doubt" or "no doubt"?

Instead of using the technical "suitable for use in MIME" requirement,
it might be better for the spec to simply say that the iso-2022-jp-3
variants are recommended since almost all messages over TCP/IP in Japan
use iso-2022-jp, with which it is intended to be compatible (I assume).
