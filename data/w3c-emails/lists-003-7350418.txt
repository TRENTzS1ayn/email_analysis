This is incorrect. All charset names MUST be usable as a MIME
charset parameter value. The process forbids registration of anything
else. See RFC 2278, section 3.3.

Martin is completely correct here. See RFC 2278 section 3.1. It says that all
charset registrations must note whether or not they are suitable for use in
MIME text, based on what the MIME specification (RFC 2045) says about text. The
two restrictions RFC 2045 imposes are that line terminators must be represented
as CRLF and that nulls may not be used. As far as I can tell these charsets
meet these restrictions, so they are suitable for MIME use, and if that's the
case that's what the registration has to say. (As it happens I wrote this
and I can assure you that this is what's intended.)

This is an entirely mechanical assessment based on the technical properties of
the charset. You appear to be confusing it with whether or not you feel these
charsets _should_ be used in MIME. That's a separate concern, and not one
that the registration process addresses.
