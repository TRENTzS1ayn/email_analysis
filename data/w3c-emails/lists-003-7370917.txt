What you call some random charset outside of a protocol has nothing to do 
with the registration process.

My dear sir, I wrote this part of the specification, so I think I know what it
means. You can argue that the words aren't clear if you like (although many
people have read this specification and you are the only one that has arrived
at this bizzarre interpretation) but you cannot argue what the intent was.

>    All registered

You are quoting out of context. The full paragraph reads:

   Registered charsets MUST conform to the definition of a "charset"
   given above.  In addition, charsets intended for use in MIME content
   types under the "text" top-level type must conform to the
   restrictions on that type described in RFC 2045. All registered
   charsets MUST note whether or not they are suitable for use in MIME.

In context it is quite clear that this is talking specifically about MIME text,
not MIME in general. The suitability requirement is with MIME text. indeed,
arguing that the suitability require applies to MIME in general makes
no sense at all, since there are in general no suitability requirements
that cover all of MIME.

I'll take this as a sign that the text in this paragraph need to clarified in
the next version. But you should take it as a sign that your reading of the
specification is wrong and needs to be corrected.

Nobody else has indicated that they believe the written text says what you
think it says. In fact everyone else I've communicated with has indicated
that they don't agree with you at all.

And I'm not the editor, I'm the author. And this was discussed at great length
and in enormous detail, so the meaning others attached to it is equally clear.
