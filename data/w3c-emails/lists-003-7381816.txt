Agreed completely.

So?

If you are just stating your opinion, it's fine.

But, if you are trying to argue against me, please make my point
you are arguing against clear.

There can be a charset not suitable for MIME use, even though the
content of the charset follows the rules required for MIME text.

It is of course that editors think they know what their work means.

But, it does not mean editors define what their work means.

A sad reality is that, once editors make a mistake, they are the last
people to recognize the mistake.

The words including context are chrystal clear.

It seems to me that you are claiming that you, as an author,
communicated with others less often than editors are expected
to do.

However, as is described in section 5.2 of RFC 1603 and section 2.3 of
RFC 2028, WG documents are maintained by WG editors that you should
have acted as an editor. WG editors on a document can be replaced.

Or, are you saying that your personal ID has passed IESG review as is
without WG review? Then, you are the author. But I have never noticed
that it occurred.

Anyway, please read the rules carefully and never try to create your own.

If you think you need further clarifications on IETF standardization
process, please mail me privately or make it in generic ietf mailing
list.
