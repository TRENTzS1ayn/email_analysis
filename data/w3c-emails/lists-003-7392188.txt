I'm not convinced, but even if it were true, it isn't part of the registration
information at present. You can of course ask for it to be made part of the
information in the future, but that would take a general consensus that this is
valuable information to add to move forward. Everyone else that has spoken
about this thus far (both publicly and privately) doesn't agree with you, so my
assessment is that such a consensus isn't there.

No, Ohta, I've communicated with dozens of people about this stuff -- more than
enough to be sure that there's a broad understanding of the intent. And not one
of them read this the way you do.

I fail to see why this is even remotely relevant. But regardless, this isn't a
WG document, so the section you cite doesn't apply.

The charset registration procedure was a personal submission by John Klensin,
Jon Postel, and myself, based on an earlier document Jon Postel wrote by
himself. It was last called in the IETF and approved by the IESG, and
is currently a BCP.

I'm quite familiar with the rules, thank you.

Oh please. This is simply insulting. Suck it up and move on, Ohta. Bottom
line, you need to change your registration to conform with the actual
rules the registration process imposes, not this fantasy of your own
invention.
