Oops! I misstated the authorship here -- sorry about that. This one was done by
myself and Jon Postel. John Klensin wasn't an author, and deserves none of the
blame ;-) I was confusing this with the media types registration document,
which John, Jon, and myself did write.

And to answer a question several have asked privately, when this specification
is revised I plan to leave Jon as co-author. I see this as entirely
appropriate, as he did write a bunch of the original text, and that won't
change in the new revision.

This also will be my final posting on this matter.
