People indeed should have learned, I fully agree with you.
And I'm glad to see such a clear position, which I hope will
make sure that this problem is addressed very seriously by
the charset reviewer and IANA.

However, I have to disagree with you that the this should hold
up the registrations. What is being asked for registration are
legacy charsets, and there is no requirement that they be
fully mappable to Unicode/ISO 10646. Where mappings are available,
they should be given, but where they are not available, they
should not hold up a registration. In the present case, the main
problem is that some entries in the printing look as if they
are mappings to Unicode/ISO 10646, but they are not. This should
clearly be documented as part of the registration.

But the codes in parentheses are officially not part of the
standard, and the standard (in the rare case that somebody indeed
reads, or can read, the relevant part) indeed says that.

This is a very good idea independent of the IANA registration.

Yes, no doubt.
