I do not think it should be a requirement that new IANA registrations 
be mappable to 10646/Unicode. That would leave the whole of
the internet in the hands of the Unicode consortium with respect to
charsets, and that is too much power to give a closed consortium
over an open network. I hope this is not what is meant.
