The consortium is open to any organization to join, has liaisons with many standards organizations, and has many contributions from individual experts. It is as open as the W3C and many other consortia, and more open than ISO itself since members do not need to be national bodies. Moreover, we work very closely with ISO in determining character allocation, with a relationship that has been uniquely successful.

I regard Unicode as quite closed, as it costs about USD 12.000 a year to have a say (voting
rights) in the Consortium. Only big companies can do this. It also shows that only
about 20 very big US companies have a voting rights in Unicode inc.
