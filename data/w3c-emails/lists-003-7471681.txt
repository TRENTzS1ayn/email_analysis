You are correct, it is not closed.

However, it is the closest to what I see as a lobby group.
BTW, national bodies are another example.

... and about EUR 600 for an individual to join (as a "specialist";
I disregard "individual" membership, as I do not see the benefit:
the free copy of the Unicode standard sells for less, as far as
I can say).
I do not know if restrictions apply to "specialist" membership, as
the list is quite short.

Too much of my surprise, figures are in fact lower: 1 UK company (Reuters),
1 German one (SAP), 1 Japanese one (JustSystem), 1 not-for-profit
US organisation and 15 US companies (assuming I did not guess wrong on the
few ones I do not know about): looks like a very low number to me...
While I was figuring that ISO was a very closed world indeed, it looks like
this is not an isolate case... Also, English-speaking companies seems to
have a heavy weight (no, I do not want to be the editor of an hypothetic
Catalan or French version, thanks! ;-))
