I never said that they should be fully mappable to Unicode/10646.

As far as I know, there are no IANA rules that require a charset
registration to be accompanied by Unicode/10646 mappings.

If the Japanese standards body approves of the way JIS X 0213 is
written, and publishes it, that is its own business. However, if they
were to submit their document to the Unicode Technical Committee or
ISO/IEC JTC1 SC2/WG2, it would undoubtedly be voted down because of the
appearance of unassigned, non-PUA codes in that document, whether
normative or not.

IANA is also an international organization, with a world-wide scope
similar to UTC and WG2. So I think it would be quite appropriate for
IANA to look carefully at the incoming charset registrations. If there
is anything at all about the registration that looks like it might cause
interoperability problems, it is the duty of the readers of this mailing
list to point that out, and I thank you for reminding me of that
particular problem in JIS X 0213.

As a member of this mailing list, I now raise this objection, and I can
only hope that the charset reviewer takes it seriously. We shouldn't let
the Japanese standards body get away with such behavior.

No, my suggestion is that we reject the charset registrations until we
see some proof that JIS X 0213 has been corrected.

Also, I'd like to know which escape sequences have been assigned to JIS
X 0213. I had a look in the ISO registry, but I couldn't find it:

  http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/ISO-IR/

If JIS X 0213's escape sequence(s) haven't been registered by ISO yet, I
think IANA should wait until that has happened. ISO-2022-JP-3 is not
usable until we know what the escape sequences are, and that they are
legitimate.
