I take that there are international firms that are full members of Unicode.
Have Unicode ever had a meeting outside the US, though? (I am not talking about
conferences, obviously).

The fees, compared to other consortia, are quite reasonable, and used to finance the development of the standard.

Nothing to stop them except a yearly fee of USD 12.000.

Yes, but they have no voting rights.

Yes, I see Unicode, W3C and IMC as all in the same league.
I do not see ISO as being closed, you can participate thru your national organization.
And there is one in virtually every country.

I am saying that IETF should be careful, and avoid it if possible. IETF should
preferably build on open standards, developed in open standards organizations,
like itself.
