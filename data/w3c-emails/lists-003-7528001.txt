Um, could we drop the "my organization is more open than yours" garbage? 
This is a close analog of the juvenile "my operating system is better than 
yours" trash that plagues many mailing lists.

Re-reading the messages on this list, I see none that say that *any* group, 
close or open, should control whether a charset gets registered. Keld made 
a mistake in his interpretation of a message, and the argument went 
downhill from there. Please note that the charset reviewer has already 
rejected the application on other grounds, so this discussion is both a 
waste of time and insulting.
