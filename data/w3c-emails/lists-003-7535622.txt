I see.

Why are you then calling these membership classes for "membership"
if they are not members? That is misleading and confusing.

I have seen the membership list of the UTC, it is not very different
in nature from the UI membership. So what is the difference?

I have never doubted that Unicode Inc. is a proper organization.
So is Microsoft, Sun, W3C and others trying to set their standards thru.
And Unicode Inc. is in practice not an open standardization organization
due to the high membership fees there are to get voting rights
in the organization. It is an organization of a number of big firms
trying to advance their "standard" worldwide.
