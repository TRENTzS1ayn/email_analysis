As a charset reviewer make it clear that, for charset registration,
written text, including that in BCPs, can be interpreted anyhow,
don't bother to discuss about rules on charset registration.

With similar interpretation of current or future BCPs, we can just
use any charset with authorized IANA registeration (whatever IANA
registration means) without being bothered by Ned.
