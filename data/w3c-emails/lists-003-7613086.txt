I would like to know what you mean by "we".   The JSC committee 
which developed JIS X 0213?  You, Yasuoka-san, and Shibano-san?
Apparently, "we" cannot mean all Japanese, because I do not 
agree.  I know that many Japanese experts do not agree either.

If you would like to make an exhibition of yourself, that is 
fine.  But please clearly say that you are talking for yourself 
only.
