I'm sorry, but I completely disagree. Jon wrote a significant percentage of the
current draft. That hasn't changed. Not crediting him as a coauthor would be,
in effect, plagarism.

Consider the analogous case of publication of, say, The Moonstone, by Wilke
Collins. (The first mystery novel ever published according to some.) The text
of this book is old enough that there's no copyright issue. But how would
you feel if I were to take that book, change a couple of words here and
there, and republish it listing me as the author?

And if you don't think the literary world is a valid comparison, how about,
say, Ordinary Differential Equations by Boyce and DePrima. Boyce has, I
believe, long since passed on, but the book continues to be updated and
republished with him as the primary author.

See the second example above -- it seems directly on point. As long as the
document makes it clear that one of the authors is no longer around I don't see
a problem.

The author section contains a pointer to the "I Remember IANA" RFC. That,
it seems to me, establishes that Jon is no longer responsible for changes
I make.
