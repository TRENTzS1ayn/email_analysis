Dan, just to make things extremely clear. In this case, as Ned is 
co-author, I am the AD in charge for this document. Your question has 
been asked before, and the conclusion was that Jon should stay as 
co-author. I did not find any new arguments from you that (so far) 
would make me change my mind.

At the same time, I thank you for coming with comments. That is 
exactly the way the IETF works, and I am happy to read any response 
you send to the email of Ned (and of course comments from you on 
other papers).
