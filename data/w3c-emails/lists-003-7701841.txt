Thank you for your prompt reply. I'm glad these char sets will finally be
registered.
The IBM code pages below are created to add the euro symbol to existing IBM
code pages that are published in "IBM NLDG Volume 2 (SE09-8002-03) August
1994", and are already on the IANA registry. The referenced URL is just to
indicate the code position the euro symbol has been added at for each code
page.
However, there are two exceptions:

   IBM00923 is the IBM code page corresponding to ISO 8859-15, and
   therefore I'm withdrawing the registration for this char set, and
   instead asking for an alias to be added to the ISO 8859-15 entry in your
   registry, the alias name should be: IBM00923
   IBM00924 has the same character repertoire as ISO 8859-15 but in an
   EBCDIC encoding. We are in the process of making the IBM code pages
   available on the web, until that time IBM00924 can be obtained by
   sending an e-mail to "nltc@ca.ibm.com" attention "Code Page and
   Character Set Registrar".

The URL previously provided has been corrected below to be
"www.as400.ibm.com/euro/Roadmap.htm" (changing the extension from html to
htm)
The code pages below (except IBM00858) are EBCDIC code pages , EBCDIC code
pages are NOT suitable for use in MIME Text.

The URL for conversion tables to ISO 10646 has been added for each entry
below (http://www.developer.ibm.com/devcon/titlepg.htm). Users must
register as a guest to gain access to the catalog. From the catalog select
Sample Code , then scroll down to NLS to find the conversion tables.

If any further information is required to register those char sets, please
let me know. Also please update the char set registration mailing list to
include my e-mail address (tamer@ca.ibm.com) instead of Rick Pond's
(pond@ca.ibm.com).


This is to register the IBM Coded Character Set ID's (CCSID's) and their
corresponding code pages created to add the euro symbol to existing IBM
Code Pages.
