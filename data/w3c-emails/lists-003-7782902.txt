No show-stoppers for me either.

I think the stable reference should explain how to deal with
extensions, just like the UTF-8 registration in 2279 explains how to
deal with extensions of 10646.
If it doesn't, we'll just assume that it's frozen forever.....?

A "for example" reference could be useful.

the intent is within 14 days of the submission of the charset to the list,
I think.
Human nature being what it is, the charset reviewer feels like making this 
a SHOULD......

I've got one more nit, which is new text since 2278:

I tried to find the requirement for the cs prefix in 1759 and failed.
Since this flies directly into the face of the idea that we want fewer 
names, not more, would it be possible to remove this requirement?
