Dear Sir/Madam,

     To facilitate electronic communication using Chinese within Hong Kong, a
set of Chinese characters was developed by the Government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region in 1999. The details of the character set can be
found in "http://www.digital21.gov.hk/eng/hkscs/introduction.html". In order to
have better communication using this character set in Internet community, we
would like to register this character set in IANA registration.

     It is highly appreciated if you can provide information about the following
questions relating to IANA charset registration procedures.

Q1.  Is there requirements of the proposer submitting charset registration? If
yes, what is the requirements? Should the charset registration proposer be an
individual, a company, an organization, the one define the standard, etc ?


Q2.  As stated in RFC 2278, the registration procedure is started by sending the
proposed charset registration to "ietf-charset@iana.org". Should this charset
registration procedure be done periodically or on request ? How long will it
take ?

Q3.  After submitting the charset registration application by the proposer, when
will the charset be officially announced and published ?

Q4.  Will the proposer be acknowledged before the official
announcement/publication of the charset?


Thank you for your attention.

Regards,
Nicky Yick
Acting System Manager

Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
