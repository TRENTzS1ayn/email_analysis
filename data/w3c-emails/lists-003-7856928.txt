hmmm....this may not be what you want. More later.

The requirement is that the proposer be nameable, and that we can contact him.
Usually this means that a human is the preferred submitter.
What he represents, the IETF does not want to care about.

the length of the procedure depends on the amount of discussion, and the 
response of the submitter.
The minimum length of the procedure is 14 days.

There is currently some problem at IANA which prevents the publication of 
approved character sets, so I must admit that I do not know this.

No such procedure has been put in place. I, as charset reviewer, usually CC 
the ietf-charsets list when I make a recommendation to IANA; you are 
encouraged to become a member.

Back to the proposed registration:
from the webpage you quoted, I quote:

"The HKSCS, as a supplementary character set of the Big-5 and ISO 10646 
coding schemes, contains Chinese characters needed in Chinese computing in 
Hong Kong but are not contained in either the Big-5 or ISO 10646 standard 
character set"

This fits with the definition of "character set" that is the basis for 
"coded character set" in RFC 2278 paragraph 2.4, but NOT with the 
definition of "charset" given in paragraph 2.3.
What I think you are looking to register is a scheme documenting the 
encoding of documents containing characters from Big-5 + HKSCS, or ISO 
10646(current) + HKSCS; this would involve 3 parts:

   - A reference to the variant of Big-5 or ISO 10646 you want to base
     yourself on
   - A definition of the switching, subsetting or private-use-space usage
   - A definition of the set of characters you want to use.

HKSCS is the third of these, as far as I can see; the "charset" you should 
register is the combination of all 3 of the above.

Hope this helped!
