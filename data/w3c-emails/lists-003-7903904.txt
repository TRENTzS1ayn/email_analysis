This is a good way to put it. I will update my proposal.

Well, I will try to find a somewhat nicer way to say this... :-)

You are right. The intention behind SCSU is not to have an encoding that is good for internal processing; the intention is to have an encoding of Unicode that is more compact than UTF-8 or UTF-16 and that is useful in files (beware of searching though) and especially in protocols.

For example, the XML parser that I know always converts everything from the document charset into UTF-16 before it does anything else. It does not care about such issues.

That's fair.

What is the next step? Do I need to update and resend the proposal? Should I wait for a few days to give more people time to respond?
