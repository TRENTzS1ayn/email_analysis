>1. Please add the following IANA consideration section:

>IANA Considerations

>IANA is to register the character sets found in Appendixes A.1, A.2,
>and A.3 according to RFC 2278, using registration templates found in
>those appendixes.

>
>2. Please change last paragraph of section 1.1 according to the following:
>--- OLD TEXT
>
>The IETF policy on character sets and languages [CHARPOLICY] says that
>IETF protocols MUST be able to use the UTF-8 character encoding scheme
>[UTF-8]. Although UTF-8 has many beneficial properties, such as the
>direct encoding of US-ASCII characters, re-synchronization after loss
>of octets and immunity to the byte-order issue (see 3.1 below), it is
>less dense than UTF-16 for characters whose values are between 0x0800
>and 0xFFFF. Some products and network standards already specify UTF-16,
>making it an important encoding for the Internet.
