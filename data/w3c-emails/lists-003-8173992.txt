Again, the list has always been ietf-charsets@innosoft.com. IANA has
in the past maintained a forwarding address that redirects mail to the
real list. AFAIK IANA has never maintained a charsets list.

The former should be taken up with IANA; the latter is expected since the
list is not and never has been a Majordomo list run by IANA.
