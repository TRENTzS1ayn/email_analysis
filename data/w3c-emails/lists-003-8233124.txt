Hi Markus and Martin,

I just visited the Unicode Consortium home page and verified
my memory - UTF#6 (SCSU) has the status 'Approved' (by
Unicode Consortium) but is NOT incorporated into the
brand new Unicode v3.0 specification.  I *think* that
weakens the case for IANA registration, but I could easily
be wrong.

Harald or Ned - what do you guys think?

Cheers,

This is probably a difficult one.

- We don't really want it to be used too much, but the IANA
   policy for registrations (as far as I have heard from people
   I consider relevant in this respect) currently tends towards
   'register if somebody uses it, even if we think it shouldn't
   be used'.

- Strictly formally speaking, the thing fits the definition for
   'charset', but it's really rather far away from the average
   case.

So I would say: Register, but with as big a warning as possible.


Regards,   Martin.
