I'm basically in agreement with Martin. I like having names for things
so we have something we can use if the need arises. On the other hand, I
don't see much utility in actually using SCSU. (I note in passing that
the registration needs to say it cannot be used in MIME text.) So I'd
say register, but recommend it not be used.
