Makes sense. But I don't agree on all points with your classification.

It seems to be the case that:
- There is consensus (in the IETF sense) on the meaning of the
   above sentences.
- It was shown that the interpretation of the above sentences
   may pose some problems.

This seems to be a typical case for a last call correction.

Thanks for giving the interpretation of 'stable'. This is a reasonable
interpretation, but there are others, and the doc should make clear
what interpretation is intended.

Well, if it cannot be unified, it would at least be helpful
to point out that there are differences, and which terms
correspond to which.
