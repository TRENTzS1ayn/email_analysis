That may well be, but without substantive support from other quarters --
support I've seen no signs of -- I'm not going to accomodate your
positions on these points.

I don't agree. This is a much bigger problem and the registry needs to be
cleaned up before it gets addressed. (Work to clean up the registry is already
underway, but I don't want to wait for it to finish before getting this update
out.)

I'll see what I can do as a RFC editor note, but I note in passing
that you seem to be the only one who was confused by this.

I'd much rather correct the problem than try to work around it.

I'll make the change as an RFC Editor note.
