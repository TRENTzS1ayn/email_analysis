It's in IANA's queue.

IANA, at publication.

IANA, at the in-notes address you quoted.

At the same time.

No, it's not. IANA has been working with some people (Chris Newman in 
particular) to modify the way they list charsets on the site, and the 
progress of new ones has been a bit stalled.

The fact that IANA has replaced the personnel responsible hasn't helped either.
On my TODO list is to make a personal webpage (as charset registrar) of 
suggested charsets and their status. Unfortunately that TODO list is nearly 
as long as IANA's....

I'm sorry, I don't have one. Want to publish one in the meantime?

sorry not to be able to do better!
