1) Could you please resubmit your application in ASCII?
    The IANA does not operate on .doc files, and it is less error prone if you
    perform the conversion yourself.

2) The Big5 registration as it exists now is as follows:

Name: Big5  (preferred MIME name)
MIBenum: 2026
Source: Chinese for Taiwan Multi-byte set.
         PCL Symbol Set Id: 18T
Alias: csBig5

    This is a bit less information than I feel comfortable with.
    Especially, it is not enough to evaluate whether or not your proposal is
    suitable for use with MIME text/* body parts.
    Perhaps you could help us by updating this registration with the
    proper details?

Thanks!
