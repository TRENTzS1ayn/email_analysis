Dear Harald,

1.   Attached please find the application in ASCII format.

2.   Big5 is a Chinese coding scheme which is based on the traditional Chinese
character set and commonly used in Taiwan and Hong Kong.  Originally, Big5
coding scheme is developed in Taiwan and contains 13,053 characters.  A common
shortcoming of Big5 is that it does not cover a fair number of characters
commonly used in Hong Kong.  In order to cater the need of information exchange
in Chinese among Hong Kong communities, Government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region have built up a set of Chinese characters, i.e. the Hong
Kong Supplementary Character Set (HKSCS) to encompass common characters which
have not been included in the Big5 coding scheme.  4702 HKSCS characters have
been added in the User-defined Area of the Big5 coding scheme.  After the
release of HKSCS, it has been widely adopted by the market, the public and the
Government.


3.   If you have any queries, please feel free to contact me.


Thanks.

1) Could you please resubmit your application in ASCII?
    The IANA does not operate on .doc files, and it is less error prone if you
    perform the conversion yourself.

2) The Big5 registration as it exists now is as follows:

Name: Big5  (preferred MIME name)
MIBenum: 2026
Source: Chinese for Taiwan Multi-byte set.
         PCL Symbol Set Id: 18T
Alias: csBig5

    This is a bit less information than I feel comfortable with.
    Especially, it is not enough to evaluate whether or not your proposal is
    suitable for use with MIME text/* body parts.
    Perhaps you could help us by updating this registration with the
    proper details?

Thanks!
