MIBenum: 2252   

Name: iso-8859-14
MIBenum: 110   

UTF-16, UTF-16LE, and UTF-16BE have been registered.  

UTF-7 has been changed to MIBenum: 1012
ISO-2022-CN still has MIBenum: 104

MIBEnum  1004, named ISO-8859-1, has been removed, since the name was a 
duplicate for MIBEnum 4, and the entry did not designate a coded charset.

The complete registrations can be found at the following:

<http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets>

and

<http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-set-info/>

We plan to make some further changes to the file (organizationally).
Thank you for your patience, and Harald for your help.
