Sorry, I missed that. Do you want me to resubmit, or could you just make
that change?

Sorry. UTF-32, like UTF-16 is NOT suitable for use in MIME text. In
particular,
it uses octets with a value of 0. Additionally, CR and LF aren't
represented in
the same way as in ASCII.

The answer to this question is therefore NO, not YES.
