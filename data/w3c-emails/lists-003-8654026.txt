Resubmit.

note: each charset should have its own registration form.

BTW, TR19 is technically broken in its definition of UTF-32: it specifies 
that an UTF-8 character stream MAY OR MAY NOT begin with a Byte Order Mark, 
and that octets can be in any order.

This allows (when taking exquisite care - you only have 4.1 bits that are 
valid in both upper and lower halves of the 32-bit word) the construction 
of octet sequences that are ambiguous.

If either the specification or the registration had said "A serialization 
of Unicode code points into UTF-32 that does not begin with a byte order 
mark MUST be in Big Endian", I would not have protested. But this is, IMHO, 
just too broken to be registered as a charset.

As written, I OPPOSE the registration of UTF-32.
(Apologies for having missed it at Unicode standardization time - we saw it 
coming, and did not catch it in time)
