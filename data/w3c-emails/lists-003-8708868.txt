The UTC does not consider it a botch. It is permissible for UTF-16 to be
either BE or LE if it does not have a BOM. For example, on Windows a
database field might contain BOM-less LE text. In such a case, a
higher-level protocol is establishing the byte orientation.

I personally agree that it would be far better to use the unambiguous term
UTF-16LE for BOM-less UTF-16 text for such serializations. I think the
problem is that the term "UTF-16" can also refer to the in-memory use of
UTF-16 as a sequence of 16-bit chunks, where byte-orientation is not an
issue (unless you are skanky and use unions to look at the bytes). So people
like to simply refer to it as UTF-16 whether in memory or serialized,
instead of the more appropriate term UTF-16LE.

However, if the IETF liaison wants to present a proposal to restrict UTF-16
and UTF-32 -- when used as a serialization into bytes, to being only BE if
there is no BOM, I believe that the UTC would certainly take that into
consideration. The next meeting is happening very soon...
