We have had such discussions, or rather, asked what IETF can/should do to
make sure that we don't get different byte orders inside protocols and at
the same time not override what UTC does.

As you say, UTC definitions are not only used in protocols but also stored
data on disk, and that is for historical reasons in different byte orders.
Going away from that fact is difficult -- even though it would be nice.

Can IETF do something which might help you think?
