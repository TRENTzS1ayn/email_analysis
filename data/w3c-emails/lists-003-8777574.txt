We deliberately introduced the term UTF-32 since this regularizes
the notation for everyone. Little is to be gained by using a mixed
notation in that section using UTF-8, UTF-16 and UCS-4 together.

If you would like to fix the 10646 spec, you could propose that the
term UTF-32 is formally added there as well. As it stands, 10646
has an unfortunate asymmetry in notation that is cumbersome to use
for the non-specialist.
