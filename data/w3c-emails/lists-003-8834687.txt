I just found a typo in the IANA charset file at
http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets


Instead of
     Alais: csEBCDICPT
it should read
     Alias: csEBCDICPT

Can this please be corrected?

The file also contained some spurious spaces,
and used sometimes "Alias: None" and sometimes
just "Alias:" to indicate the absence of aliases.
Maybe that can be corrected, too. I'm willing to help.

Many thanks and kind regards,    Martin.

P.S.: Did I send this to (all) the right list(s)?
       Is there any review necessary, or can this be done asap?
