     Charset name: KS_C_5601-1987

     Charset aliases:ISO-IR-149
KS_C_5601-1989
KSC_5601
KS_C_5601

     Suitability for use in MIME text: yes

     Published specification(s): KS_C_5601-1987

     Additional information:

The existing registration for KS_C_5601-1987 does not
include an alias for KS_C_5601. However, that alias
name is widely used by implementations. Conversely,
the existing shorthand alias KSC_5601 is not widely
used by implementations. Furthermore, given the
placement of underscores in the canonical name versus
the existing alias, it is highly probable that future
implementations will default to "KS_C_5601" instead
of the alias in the charset registery.

This registration is intended to be a modification to
the existing registration, adding KS_C_5601, while
keeping KSC_5601 for backwards compatibility.
