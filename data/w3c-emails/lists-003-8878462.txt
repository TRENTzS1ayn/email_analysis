I have a copy of that standard at work, but in Korean (which I can
read about as well as the average scientist can read Greek :-(.
But I think the problem isn't the standard itself, because the
standard (or the way people use it) both includes the simple
14-bit table as well as the combination with ASCII (or it's
Korean equivalent). If you can point us to a few files with
actual data, this may help.
