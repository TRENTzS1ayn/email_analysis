Microsoft treats KS_C_5601-1987 the same as Windows CP-949
whose Unicode mapping table is available at:

ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/MICSFT/WINDOWS/CP949.TXT

It does include 7-bit ASCII characters. And we have a problem
if a chraset definition of any of these new alias disagrees
with Windows 949. Microsoft Outlook Express, which I used to
work on, and Microsoft Outlook send Korean Messages including 
US ASCII characters using "KS_C_5601-1987", and Korean web 
pages including US ASCII characters also use KS_C_5601-1987 
everywhere.
