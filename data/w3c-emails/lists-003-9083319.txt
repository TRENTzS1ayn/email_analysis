Sounds good to me. It is actually mailbox names, not the mailboxes
themselves that are encoded in this encoding, but I thought that
mailboxname would be a bit too verbose.

My main interest is to have an unambiguous official name for the
encoding; what name exactly that is is of less importance to me.

Thanks for you comments,

Martin
