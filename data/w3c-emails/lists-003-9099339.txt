More accurately, it is used in IMAP mailbox names. It doesn't appear in email
headers.

Yes, but its use in IMAP mailbox names means it does inevitably appear in
various other contexts. Filenames associated with mailboxes are one example;
there are others.

Speaking from personal experience, having a name to refer to this charset would
be quite useful. I needed a name in code I've written and I would prefer to
use a standard one rather than making one up that's bound to be different
than what other people come up with.

If this were true, perhaps, but the world isn't this neat in practice.

Actually, the final ACE that is chosen for use probably does need to be
registered as a charset, for the same reasons. And I have no problem with
registering other protocol-specific encodings as charset names.

Remember, registration is simply a means of identification, it doesn't imply
endorsement for general use. We really need to get past the notion that
we condone something by registering it.

> If it _is_ registered, I would go for "IMAP-mailbox-name".

Personally I could not care less what the name is. This is as good as any
other.

Of course.
