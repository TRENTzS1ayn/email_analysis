Hello,

I just joined this mailing list and I have a question which I hope
someone here can answer. On my web site, I feature links to news articles
in various countries in various languages and character sets. I am
having trouble representing some languages on the same page due to
the encoding.  If I use iso-8859-1 encoding, the English, French,
Spanish, and Portuguese, Italian, German, and Hungarian characters
display correctly, but the Slovak and Polish characters do not. If I
set the encoding to iso-8859-2, the the Slovak and Polish look right
but the accented characters in the other languages look wrong.

The site in question is:

                http://www.unification.net/news/

The page is a little big and I need to break it down, so I apologize if
it takes a little while to load.

Thank you,

Damian Anderson
