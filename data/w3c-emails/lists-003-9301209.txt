Markus,

I believe you are not missing GBK -- IANA is. In the work I did to enable
the Oracle XML Parser for a large list of charsets, I have also found the
following charsets are missing from IANA. A brief check today indicates that
these are still missing, but I could have missed something.

   EUC-TW
   ISO2022CN-CNS
   ISO2022CN-GB
   MS874
   MS932
   MS936
   MS949
   MS950
   ISCII
   GB18030

Additionally, missing from IANA registry were a large number of IBM code
pages (CPXXX, CPXXXX, CPXXXXX). I can send these to you or the IETF list
upon request, but I'm hesitant to litter just yet.

I apologize that I have not yet had time to file RFCs for the addition of
all of these charsets. Just the same, should someone else like to file these
as RFCs, please don't wait for me.

Thanks,
