query:
are all these charset names you have seen used "in the wild" where MIME 
charset names should be used, or are they charsets that you know about 
which are used in some context, and you think there should be registered 
names for them?

this will have most influence on the "intended usage" section....

no RFC required, just a charset registration procedure :-)
