The first was very clearly intended as the DBCS-only part.
I'm not sure it's used at all, but then transmitting DBCS-
only data is rather rare anyway.

Most registrations that have iso-ir-xxx as alias are in
a very similar situation (of course some of them are single-
byte, but still only half of an actual 8-bit 'charset').

In the case of Korean, the situation is unfortunately a bit
more complicated in practice; please see the thread starting at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-charsets/2001AprJun/0025.html
for details.

If you think something is missing that you need, please submit
a registration.
