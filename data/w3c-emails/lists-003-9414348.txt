Since the "character-sets" document is likely to be rerolled again,
may I request that a spelling error be corrected:

< (set of) sub-repetoires that may occur.  The third region (>1999) is
> (set of) sub-repertoires that may occur.  The third region (>1999) is

The word "repertoire" really does have three r's in it, as may be
confirmed at http://www.m-w.com/ .

This fix will make it much easier to locate
  http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets
via web searches.

Thanks,
