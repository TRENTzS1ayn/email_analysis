Character set reviewer decision:
Don't register any aliases.

They were not in the form-as-submitted, can be added later using the update 
procedure, and we cannot get rid of aliases we have once entered.

If a need for a specific alias is identified, that is the time to do it.

(yes, Keld, I think it would have been better to have FAR fewer aliases in 
RFC 1345. But we are where we are now.)
