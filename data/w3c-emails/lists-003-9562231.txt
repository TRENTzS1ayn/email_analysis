The DTD was changed in the last version (December last year). The changes
are listed in http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr22/#Modifications

The major change was the removal of <import>, which the UTC felt made the
validity checking too cumbersome. In the previous version, you could use
imports to override mappings in another version.

Unfortunately, I see that you use <import> extensively, so that you would
have to regenerate the files in their complete form.

[There are three more changes that were approved this year for 2022 and some
other minor cases, but they are backwards compatible.]
