I was delighted to read in

  ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2/WG 3/N 441
  http://wwwold.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC2/WG3/docs/n441.pdf

how ISO 8859-16 is officially considered by the Kingdom of the
Netherlands a threat to their national security. (Though it makes we
worry whether the Dutch secret police is now after me, having made
available tools for generating X11 fonts for that encoding with the
subversive COMMA BELOW characters. Implementors beware.)
