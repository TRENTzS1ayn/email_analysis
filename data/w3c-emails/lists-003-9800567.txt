The uri above may have some problems because it doesn't exist
at the moment, you don't have a guarantee that w3c will create
it for you, and w3c would not guarantee that it's content doesn't
change.

I suggest that you proceed as follows:

1) you resubmit the Japanese XML profile to w3c and wait until
    it is published

2) you use the dated version corresponding to the above uri
    in your registration


Regards,   Martin.
