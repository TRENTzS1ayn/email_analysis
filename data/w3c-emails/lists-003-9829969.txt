Yes it does have these in the right place, but that's not sufficient for MIME.
The other requirement is that NULL not be used. Unfortunately, in GSM NULL is
where the at-sign character lives.

Another question with this particular character is whether it is an upper or
lower case C. It looks like an upper case C to me in the chart, but I question
the wisdom of having an upper case C-cedilla but no lower case C-cedilla.

Agreed, although there is apparently similar 7bit squeezing going on in
other contexts. Go figure.
