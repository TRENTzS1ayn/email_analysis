See:

ftp://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/ETSI/GSM0338.TXT

for the best sense that we (myself, Kent Karlsson, and
Markus Kuhn) were able to make of trying to map this
to Unicode.

GSM 0338 is a very funny animal that departs significantly
from the way JTC1/SC2 builds character sets. It overloads 
characters by glyph shape, uses NULL, and has an escape
mechanism, using ESCAPE in a way noncompatible with ISO 2022,
to create a double-byte escape encoding for extra characters.

It doesn't seem advisable to me to suggest that it would
be appropriate for MIME text encoding.
