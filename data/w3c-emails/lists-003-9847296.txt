I would prefer to see this (or a similar, public document) as the reference cited by the registration and the charsets list.

My main reason is that I looked at etsi.org and tried to download the specification. It forced me to register as a user, and the registration form forced me to agree to receive advertising spam. I find this unacceptable for a public standard document (and did not register).

From all I hear and read, I wholeheartedly agree. Registration yes, MIME no, and probably limited use.
