| Charset name:
| 
|   SAMI-WS2
| 
|   This is the name character set is know as in GNU libc.

I strongly support this registration. The Sami community in Norway
(and probably also elsewhere in Scandinavia) is using this charset in
web pages, and there is a real need for a recognized identifier for
it. 

Currently, people generally use "windows-1252" as the encoding
identifier, but if an identifier is adopted there is a real chance
that this may change.

Opera 5.5 will ship with support for this charset, and it would be
very good if it could support a commonly agreed identifier right from
the start.
