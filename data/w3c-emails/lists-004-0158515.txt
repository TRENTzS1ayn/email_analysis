I would characterize that as FUD. You can join the national bodies,
and that is feasible even for one-person firms. That they are national
means that you can influence the specifications without having big
travel expenses. Yes, most ISO standards cost money, but if ypu want the
information, the standards are available to you in most countries via
the public library systems, for free.

It is becacuse UTF-8 in the ISO 10646 definition only encodes characters
defined in 10646. And "surrogates" are not characters. So they "do not
occur" in UTF-8.
