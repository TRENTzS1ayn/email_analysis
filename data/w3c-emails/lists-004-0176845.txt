FUD or not, to about the same degree as your comments
about Unicode.

I have certainly influenced the Unicode standard without travel
expenses, and I know of people who have had much more influence
than me, without travel expenses. Attending ISO meetings isn't
without travel expenses, or is it?
Another relevant point is that participation in ISO member
organizations may be very different depending on country.
It's definitely not in all cases free of fees and travel
expenses.

Ok. Most public libraries these days have some kind of Internet
access, and I guess most would order the Unicode Standard
(or make it accessible through interlibrary loan), too.

Ok. So formally speaking, this might be okay. But what's important
here is not that somebody can figure things out after some detailed
research, but that people get the message up front.
