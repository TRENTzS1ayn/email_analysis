Yes, you're just repeating what the Note in Annex D says.  It's not wrong.
It's just insufficient: it's a Note (non-normative) and it does not forbid
(or even warn against) interpreting encoded surrogates.  Or overlong
sequences.  There is a section that describes certain error cases, but it
misses those two, thereby implying that they might not be errors.  The
Unicode 3.2 text is just much tighter (at long last!) and therefore should
be chosen.
