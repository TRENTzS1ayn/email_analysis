Makoto and others: Are you working on a Microsoft Windows system?
I think that in particular for the BOM issue, it would be good
to make sure that we get interoperability reports also from
Unix/Linux based systems or Macs, but I haven't seen any such
yet (I know Francois works on Win, and me too).

Regards,    Martin.
