Good idea.  I accessed the list archive at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-charsets/2003JanMar/0039.html using
Netscape 6.2.3 running on Solaris 8.  The message and attachments displayed
correctly except for the last 2 lines (Arabic and Gothic).  Saving to a
local and examining with 'od -x' showed that the problem was purely
rendering, as the UTF-8 data was as expected.
