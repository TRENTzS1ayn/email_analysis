Dear Sir:

I am in receipt of a lotto claims award for $500,000 from Michael Page at
Millenium Security Trust & Finance of the Netherlands.  I found a notice and
your email on a website after doing a search.  Do you have any information
on such claim or if it is the typical scam going around?  Any information
will be appreciated.  Thank you.

Reggie Oglesby
