My name is SENATOR DAVID MARK the executive 
Chairman Pension funds committee in the senate of the 
federal Republic Of Nigeria. 

I am writing you to earnestly Solicit for your assistance 
in helping to receive some sum of money. I got your e-mail 
address on the Internet while searching for a reliable and 
reputable person to handle this transaction. 

THE PREPOSITION: 

We have the sum of US$9,000,000.00 (Nine Million Dollars) 
that we intend to transfer overseas through the assistance 
of a foreign partner. This money came as a result of the 
unclaimed pension funds over the years due to the over-
invoiced claims put forward by my committee but the 
pensioners have already been paid their claims. What is 
left is the over-invoiced amount of US$9,000,000.00 which 
has been deposited in a bank. 

I have agreed to transfer the funds overseas for my 
campaign funding, private use and for investment purposes 
with your help. I am contacting you therefore, to stand in 
as the beneficiary to process this fund into your custody. 

You will be entitled to 25% for assisting us and 5% will be 
set aside to cover all expenseswe may incur in the course 
if this transaction.While 70% is fo me and my partners. 

The fund shall be transferred to you legally in accordance 
to all laid down procedures governing transfer of funds. I 
have perfected all modalities for the successful transfer 
of this money to you as the beneficiary.

Finally, I have to reassure you that this transaction is 
risk free and should be kept absolutely confidential. 

Presently, you can reach me by e-mail and 
you should also include your telephone, fax and or cell 
phone numbers if any, for secured communication between us. 

Thank you for your anticipated cooperation. 
I await your response.
