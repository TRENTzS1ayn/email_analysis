PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
  
My name is Mrs. Yugo.o.Heinz from Germany. I am
married To Mr. Robert Heinz 
who worked with the German embassy in Saudi Arabi
for nine years before he 
died in the year 2001. We were married for eleven
years without a child. He 
died after a brief illness that lasted for only four
Days. Before his death 
we were both born again Christians. When my late
 husband was alive he 
deposited the sum of US$20.Million (twenty Million U.S.
 Dollars) with a 
Security Company In europe. Presently, this Money is
 still With the Security 
Company.
  
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last
 for the next three months 
due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most
 is my stroke. Having 
known my Condition I decided to donate this fund to
 church or Better still a 
Christian individual that will utilize this money
 the way I am going to 
instruct here in. I want a church that will use
 these fund-to-fund churches, 
Orphanages, Research centers and widows propagating
 the Word of God and to 
ensure that the house of God is Maintained. The
 Bible made us to understand 
that blessed is the hand that giveth.
  
I took this decision because I don't have any child
 that Will inherit this 
Money and my husband relatives are not Christians
 and I Don't want my 
Husbands hard earned money to be misused by
 Unbelievers. I don't want a 
Situation where this money will be used in an
 ungodly Manner.

 Hence the Reason for taking this bold decision. I am
 not afraid of death 
hence I know where I am going. I know that I am
 going to be in the Bosom of 
the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will
 fight my case and I shall 
hold my please.
  
I Don't need any telephone Communication in this
 regard because of my
 health Because of the presence of my husbands
relatives around
  Me always. I don't want them to know about this
 Development. With God all 
things are possible. As soon As I receive your reply
 I shall give you the 
contact of The Finance/Security Company in Spain.
 
I will also issue you a letter of authority that
 will empower You as the new 
beneficiary of this fund.
  
I want you and the church to always pray for me
 because The lord is my
  Shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a
 Worthy Christian.
  Whoever that wants to serve the Lord Must serve him
 in spirit and truth. 
Please always be Prayerful all through you life. Any
 delay in your Reply 
will give me room in sourcing for a church or
 Christian individual for this 
same purpose. Please Assure me that you will act
 accordingly as I stated 
Herein. Hoping to hearing from you.
 
Remain blessed in the name of the Lord. Contact me through this fax number +1-360-935-5817 or +1-775-307-9119.

Yours in Christ,
 MRS. YUGO.O.HEINZ.
