  Beloved in Christ,
It is a priviledge to hear from God and it gives me
joy to relate my testimony to you haven recieved
instruction from God through divine revelation.
I was a Moslem and a retired military top officer in
Nigerian Army that served under the past military
regime. I was the financial secretary
to the Armed Force Ruling Council (AFRC). With my
position as a financial secretary, I was able to
divert up to $45,000,000.00 (Forty Five million
U.S Dollars, into my personal Bank  Account, hoping to
invest the money when I?m retired.
Immediately I got retired, I was converted from Moslem
to Christian when I was preached the words of God
through my cousin Pastor Paul Osakwe.
I then gave my life to Christ and became a born again
Christain.
Since I gave my life to Christ, I had no rest of mind.
Some times I think of the souls I killed when I was a
soldier and the dubious ways I diverted
my country?s money into my Personal Bank Account. I
then decided to seek the face of God for forgiveness
and after fasting and prayer through
Divine Revelation, the Almighty God revealed to me
that the only way I could have rest of mind is when I
used all my money to do the work
of God. I immediately disclosed my revelation to my
Pastor and he was happy with me.
I have been thinking of the particular thing to do for
my God before this present civilian president of my
country set up a panel (Honourable
Oputa Panel) to probe the Bank Account of the past
Military officers like me. Instead of loosing this
money to my government, I quickly withdrew
my money out of my Account and deposited the money in
a finance and security company for safety.
My Pastor has adviced me to sneak out of the country
with the money to sow it into a ministries abroad. I
have decided to sow this money into
your ministry. I am making arrangement to come over to
your country but you need to receive this money from
the finance and security company in cash before I come
over.
The cash has been packaged by the security company in
consignments and ready for shipment but the security
company requires the address of the
receiver. Please send to me your names, address and
your telefax number where I can fax the Airway Bill to
you to claim the consignment over
there.
I will be coming over to your ministry with my family
for thanksgiving as soon as I sent out this money to
you. Please act fast because I dont
want the panel to know that I want to leave the
country, they might suspect my intention to leave now
that the probe is going on.I look forward to your response
