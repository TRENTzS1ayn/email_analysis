A Framework implementation with GB18030 support. The
Encoding.GetEncoding() documentation reads

[...]
  The GetEncoding method relies on the underlying platform to support
  most code pages. However, system support is supplied for the following
  cases: Specify code page 0 for the default encoding, that is, the
  encoding specified in the regional settings for the computer executing
  this method; 1200 for little-endian Unicode (UTF-16LE); 1201 for
  big-endian Unicode (UTF-16BE); 1252 for Windows operating system
  (windows-1252); 65000 for UTF-7; 65001 for UTF-8; 20127 for ASCII, and
  54936 for GB18030 (Chinese Simplified).
