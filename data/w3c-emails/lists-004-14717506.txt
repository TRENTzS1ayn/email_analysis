RELOCATION AND PARTNERSHIP
Dear Sir  
  
I am disable from motor accident and cannot travel abroad without 
Doctor?s orders. I was an oil consultan t based in the United kingdom, and because I helped a lot of 
foreign crude Oil companies to get crude oil lifting rights and lucrative Oil contracts 
from Angola. I was able to amass fortune worth about USD$148,000,000.00. (One hundred and fourty 
eight million United States dollar) On 21st December 2002, I left the U.K. finally with my 
family, and came back to Angola. But because of the unfavorable political and economic climate in 
Angola, and for security reasons, I left my money total USD$148,000,000.00 in a security 
safe Deposit vault in London. On 22nd December 2002, my whole family and I were involved in a 
very bad accident on our way home to our village at Luanda, Angola. I lost my entire family 
in the accident, and I myself fell into coma since then.
  
  
I eventually recovered from coma, and was discharged from the hospital 
two weeks ago. I have no money with which to sponsor anyone in Angola to undertake the trip for 
me. In any case, my extended family here abandoned me in hospital when they realized that 
the money, which I came back with, had been spent on hospital bills; I am currently living on 
the charity of the church. And now, I need your help to collect this money in London and 
invest it in a profitable venture abroad; I cannot bring in this money into Angola for fear of 
seizure by the Government. If the money is properly and profitably invested abroad, I intended to 
leave Angola permanently.
  
  
Can I count on your help? If you agree to help me, I will send you by 
courier the ELECTRONIC CARD KEY of my vault so that you can travel to London and open the 
vault; you will then remove the money total USD$148,000,000.00 and transfer it to your Bank Account. 
For your help and assistance, you will keep 25% of the total money for yourself and keep 
75% for me in safe custody until I travel to meet you and invest my shares. If you agree to 
help me, please reply me with the following information.
  
  
Your complete name and Street (postal) address.
Your phone and fax number, including mobile if any
Your confidential email address.
Once I receive your reply stating your street postal address as above, I 
will send to you the Safe Deposit Vault key be EXPRESS MAIL, and I will also forward to you 
more details of this transaction by email.
  
  
Regards,
  
MR.richard
