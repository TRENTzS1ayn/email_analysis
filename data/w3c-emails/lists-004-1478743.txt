Hi,
Do you still have your vehicle listed for sale?
(sorry if iv'e reached the wrong person)
I just wanted some details, (miles, history etc). My wife
and I are starting to get serious about a purchase.

If it's still available, please DON'T reply to this email 
because it's my father's account. Just email me at mine:
justmefred_36@hotmail.com  

If I don't hear from you, I'll assume I've got the wrong
person and I wont contact you anymore.

Thanks,

Fred
