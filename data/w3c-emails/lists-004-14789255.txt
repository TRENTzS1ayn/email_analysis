Dear Friend,

My Name is Sylvester Bannaya, (Manager) BANQUE ATLANTIQUE Abidjan-Cote D'Ivoire
I am writting in respect of a foreign Customer of my Bank(Mr Fredrick M Wong) from California USA.Who perished in a Plane Crash with his wife in October 1999(with Egyptian Airline 990)with other passengers on board.

Since the demise of Mr.Fredrick M. Wong and wife, Mrs.Lilla C. Wong, I personally have enquired from all avaliable information from his account file with my bank,and still cannot find a next of kin to his money with my bank,as all effort has proved abortive. since their demise 4 years ago, no one has actualy come forward to his money, futher investigation to the united states internal affers,shows that the couples have no kids of there own untill there death.

He made a one year fix deposit of $3.5 million USD in preparation to be used in building a recycling plant in Abidjan, this money has been with our bank since there demise for long time now, On this note, i have decided to seek the attention of whom i shall use as a next of kin, as to claim this money,as My Bank ethics dose not allow such money to remain more than 5 years, otherwise if noticed by the Finance Ministry Bank Auditors,it will be re-called back to the fedral bank treasury as unclaimed money.

i would want you to act as the next of kin to this money, i will provide a back up document for this arrangement,and as the manager of this bank,i will guranttee that no one finds out this arrangement,this should be between You, Myself and my Bank Chief Accountant. you will be well compancated with 30% of the entire money, while 70% will be for myself and my bank accountant.

Do respond to this effect if this issue interest you, as this matter needs Urgent Attention. 
All correspondence should be through slybannaya@netscape.net

Awaiting you quick response,

Sincerely
Sylvester Bannaya
