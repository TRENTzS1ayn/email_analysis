PLEASE  REPLY ME WITH MY ALTERNATIVE EMAIL ADDRESS efedave@netscape.net

I would like to begin by way of introduction; My name is efe david,
a native of nigeria. I am a senior employee of nigeria Department of
Energy and Mineral Resources. I got your contact through
my personal research and out of desperation decided to reach you
through this medium.


I am writing this letter to solicit your co-operation in order to
redeem an investment currently held under trust with the Department
of Energy and Mineral Resources of nigeria. The said investment now
valued at USD$26.426M (Twenty six million, four hundred and twenty
six thousand American dollars), was originally purchased by one Mr.
wayne michael and leased to the  Orange Mining Corporation in
1977.

Since the maturity of this contract in September 1997, several
attempts have been made without success to contact Mr. wayne
michael or any of his close relatives, in whose favuor the
investment cash value can be paid.

My partner, who is the Account Director in the same Ministry and I,
have initiated the process of filing a claim for this money with the
hope of having the funds transferred to you. In order to do this, we
will swear an affidavit in the High Court of my country stating that
you are a distant cousin and next of kin to Mr.wayne the
owner of the money. After which, we will file a claim for this money
from the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources, indicating
thatyou were appointed by Mr.wayne to be the beneficiary of these
funds. When the claim is approved you as the beneficiary will be paid
the sum of USD$26.426M.

The money will be paid directly to any bank of your choice; you will
have the responsibility to ensure that my partner and I receive 70%
of the money while you keep the remaining 25% for your assistance.The
remaining 5% will be for incidental expenses.

I want to assure you that my partner and I are in a position to make
the payment of this claim possible provided that you can give us very
strong guarantee that our share will be secured,
and that you will not take advantage of our position.

Be assured that there is absolutely nothing to worry about in the
view of this claim. It is perfectly safe with no risks involved, and
it is not subject to any inquiry, since my partner and I will be
handling the claim directly nigeria  on your behalf.

I do hope my proposal is acceptable to you. Please acknowledge the
receipt of this letter, so that I can provide you with more
clarification about the claim and how we intend to make this deal
beneficial to everyone involved.please rememeber to give me your name
and your phone numbers for easy
communication.
ours Sincerely.

efe david.
