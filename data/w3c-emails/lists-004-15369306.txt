Sir,

PRIVATE AND URGENT PROPOSAL 

It is my hope that this mail will reach you in the best of health and business conditions.

My name is Anthony David a United Kingdom national living and working here in Spain, at the foreign exchange control desk of one of the private international banks here in Spain. 

 

I am contacting you towards realization of a business engagement that we think will be of mutual benefit to both you and I. Suffice to say this proposal requires most urgent attention to enable its accomplishment in a very good time. Though I know that a contact of this nature without prior relationship will make anyone apprehensive, but I am assuring you that you will not be amenable to any form of loss or degradation at the end of the transaction. 

 

PROPOSITION; 

We discovered an abandoned sum of US$15,500,000.00 (Fifteen million five hundred thousand united states dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers by name SALAH ADAM 32, who died along with his entire family in the plane crash of 31st October 1999 on board the Egyptian Airline 990 alongside other passengers. Please consult the Cable News Network (CNN) website below for verification. http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html  http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html 

 

Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay claims to this money as the heir. We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin or an Investor to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Pursuance to securing this money for further use rather than forfeiting it to the ministerio de economia y hacienda (Ministry of Economic Affairs) here in Espana, we have secured from the probate an order of mandamus to locate any of deceased beneficiaries who could take ownership of the fund left behind.

It is based on this probate order that my colleague and I now seek your permission to have you stand as next of kin or investor to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by us for the funds (US$15,500,000.00) to be released in your favor as the beneficiary's Investor or next of kin. 

 

It is expedient to make known to you that our main aim is to use you to invest this fund for a certain period of time and then take the interest that will accrue at least for a period of 3 years before returning the money to the same account.  In effect, we are aiming at investing the fund to make some profit. Investment could be 3 years and above.

 

Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business proposal by furnishing me with the following; 

 

1. Your Name, Direct Telephone and fax numbers and if possible your profile (Brief biography).

These requirements will enable us open up discussions with you before we can file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favor before the transfer could be made to you as an investor for the deceased.

You would be entitled to forty percent (40%) of the total interest that will accrue for the period of 3 years that the money shall be invested under your auspices, while sixty percent shall be for us the initiators working at the bank (2 of us). 

If this proposal is acceptable by you, do contact me at the earliest time possible. We pray that you do not take undue advantage of the trust we shall repose in you to expose the transaction even if you are not interested.

Please send your response to my private e-mail address as stated above.

Warmest Regards, 

 

Anthony David.
