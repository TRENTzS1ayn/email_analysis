RE: UNPAID CONTRACT SUM After waiting to hear from you or your Nigeria
partners for a long time now, I decided to make this
direct approach to you in other not to let it be as if
I have anything in mind against you. I do not know if
you have asked yourself why each time the release of
these fund is approved, all of a sudden, the payment
will be stopped or one problem or the other will come
up. If you have not asked this question or you do not
know, this is an opportunity for me to tell you. Some time ago, your Nigerian 
friend I mean the people
that introduced you to the project approached me
through my dear Wife who works with the federal
Ministry of Finance and requested me to assist
them conclude a money transfer deal they had with you,
they requested me to assist them by removing the
original contractors name, companys name and bank
particulars from Central bank of Nigeria (CBN) vetting
computer and replacing them with your name and your
bank details in order to make you appear as the
rightful beneficiary of this funds. I agreed on
condition that they will pay me $100,000 as soon as
your name appears as the beneficiary.I did as agreed
and demanded to be paid but your friends started
telling me stories. They even told me that you promise
to send money to me. Do you know that up till now, I
have not received a single cent from them and have not
set my eyes on any of them. Based on their attitude, I decided to stop the 
funds
release movement because I cannot be denied of my
right in my own office considering the risk as it
might affect my job. Secondly, I know the source of
the funds and you did not execute any contract in
Nigeria, although I am the only person privileged to
know this information and it is a fact. Why I am
making this clear to you is that I can see that you
are still making efforts spending money in order to
conclude this project. Now I am ready to forget the
past, I do not need the $100,000 any longer from you
but a share of 25% of the total sum. I need your
assurance that those your colleagues will be totally
keep out of this transaction, I know that none of them
is aware of this transaction after trying their best
to conclude it without my consent. Finally, I need your promise that no 
official of the
Central bank of Nigeria will be aware of my
involvement in this regard. Now re-assure me that you
will be willing to offer me the 25% of the fund, that
you will assist my wife and personal assistant to
establish a foreign account in your country where my
share will be lodged. If you are ready to conclude this business with
me,you
can contact me immediately on (EMAIL:
