Hi There,

My name is Jenny Lazarte
I am sorry for the unusual approach but I have acquired your email address 
as a person who is actively involved or is looking for an online Business  Opportunity. 

If this is the case I would be grateful if you would allow me to send you details of an 
opportunity that I am currently involved in at the moment. I did not want to send you any 
details until I had mailed you to seek your permission first, as experience has taught me 
that not all leads that we acquire are genuine Business Opportunity Seekers, 
If this is the case for you then please ignore this email as you have already been 
excluded from future mailing from me. 

If however It would be ok to send you details of my Opportunity then 
please reply to this email with MORE INFO in the subject line and your 
Name in the text body,  without this I cannot send you any further 
information I am afraid.

Thank you very much for your time and your cooperation thus far.

God Bless You and your Family

Yours sincerely,
Jenny Lazarte
