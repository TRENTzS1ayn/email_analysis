The main report is at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-charsets/2003JanMar/0040.html.
This is part of this list's archives, considerably more stable and reliable
than any web page I could put on any old server, since W3C has a commitment
to provide "persistently accessible repositories" of the mailing lists it
hosts.

Another web page of interest is
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-charsets/2003JanMar/0039.html,
which is the test message that the report reports on.

Additional snippets of reporting on the test message are at
