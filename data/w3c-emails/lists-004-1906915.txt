My email client (Mulberry) does not support UTF-8.

I was able to view both the converted message in the web archive and the 
UTF-8 attachment file in the following environments:
        MacOS X 10.2.4 Camino web browser (based on Mozilla)
        MacOS X 10.2.4 Safari web browser

All but the last line were correct.  Camino displayed the last line as a 
series of double-question-mark characters, a reasonable interpretation on a 
system which is presumably lacking the appropriate font.  Safari displayed 
the last line as what may be a series of unknown character glyphs.  Given 
the number of "unknown" glyphs I would presume both Safari and Camino 
correctly parsed the UTF-8.
