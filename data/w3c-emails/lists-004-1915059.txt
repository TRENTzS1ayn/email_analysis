Dear Sir,

My name is Alhaji Abdulahi Mohammed. I am the head of credit and accounts department of InterGlobe  Bank Plc., Western District, Nigeria.

I write you in respect of a foreign customer who has a Domicilliary accuont in my bank. His name is EngineerJoseph Schultzman. He was among those who died in aplane crash here in Nigeria during the reign of lateGeneral Sani Abacha.

Since the demise of this our customer, Engineer Joseph Schultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor, I have kept a close watch of the deposit records andaccounts and since then nobody has come to claim themoney in this a/c as next of kin to the late engineer.He had only Six million united states dollars(USD6,000,000.00) in his a/c and the a/c iscoded. It is only an insider that could produce thecode or password of the deposit particulars. 

As it stands now, there is nobody in that position toproduce the needed information other than my very selfconsidering my position in the bank.Based on the reason that nobody has come forward toclaim the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask foryour co operation in using your name as the next ofkin to the deceased to send these funds out to aforeign 
offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself and you. 

At this point I am the only one withthe information because I have removed the depositfile from the safe .By this doing, what is required of  you is to send anapplication laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to the late Engineer. I will need your full nameand address, company orresidential, so that i cancomputerize them to tally with next of kin column inthe certificate of deposit.

Finally i want you to understand that the request fora foreigner as the next of kin is occassioned by thefact that the customer was a foreigner and for thatreason alone a local cannot represent as next of kin.When you contact me, then we shall discuss on how themoney will be split between us.

Trusting to hear from you, 

I remain Respectfully yours,

Abdulahi Mohammed
