UNION TRUST INTL. BANK OF NIGERIA 
45 BANK ANTHONY WAY IKOYI LAGOS BRANCH ,TEL:234-80234-68432
ATTN:

I am MR.ADAMU CIROMA, Bank Manager of Union Trust Intl. Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 

On June 6, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Paul Nick Myers made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$7,000,000.00 (seven Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to him forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Paul Nick Myers died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. 

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Paul Nick Myers did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$7,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it and according to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Paul Nick Myers so that the fruits of this man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorneys will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys to process and notarization all the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor in order for the transfer to take place. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. 

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorneys and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. 

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. 

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email or ulternative mail {adamu_02@go.com}

Thanks and regards 
MR.ADAMU CIROMA.
Bank Manager of Union Trust Intl. Bank of Nigeria, 
Lagos Branch
