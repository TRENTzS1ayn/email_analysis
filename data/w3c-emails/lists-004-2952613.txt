Hi,

This note came from Free Software Group's Linux/I18N list.

It describes work on complete coverage of Unicode 1.0 CJK in
a _single_ language-independent IME (Input Method Editor) for
Linux.  And future consideration of the A and B extensions
(in more recent Unicode versions).

Recent Charset discussions about UTF-8 [RFC 2279bis] have shown
concern about complete support of the Unicode CJK assignments.
This is hopeful news.

Cheers,

Korean in both South Korea and North Korea is mostly written in 
straight Hangul, without hanja or Latin alphabet. There is a 
occasional need for Hangul-hanja conversion and other IMEs, but 
switching is far less frequent than in Japanese.

North Korea did not allow the use of hanja for a long time, but 
has relaxed the prohibition. When I was in South Korea in the 
1960s, hanja were used in most publications, but they have 
fallen out of everyday use.

There has been some work toward a language-independent IME. Zhu 
Bongfu, inventor of the shape-based Cangjie IME for Chinese 
started out with only Big5/Traditional Chinese, but his most 
recent version has extensions for Simplified Chinese. He has 
someone working on a version to cover the Unicode 1.0 Han 
repertoire (basically Unified CJK Ideographs). After that, he is 
considering what to do about the A and B extensions, and 
proposals to add at least 50,000 more historical CJK characters.

Somebody else did a Cangjie IME for Japanese, but I don't know 
anybody who uses it.
