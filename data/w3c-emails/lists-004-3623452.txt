Mobutu Sese Seko, ( now The Republic of Congo, under the leadership of the
son of Mr. Laurent Kabila). I presume you are aware there is a financial
dispute between my family ( THE MOBUTUS ) and the present civilian Government.
This is based on what they believe as bad and corrupt governance on my late
father's part. May his  soul rest in perfect peace. As you might have heard
how a lot of my father's bank account in Switzerland and North America have
been  frozen. Following the above named reasons, I am soliciting for your
humble and confidential assistance to take custody of THIRTY Million United
States Dollars ( US$30,000,000.00 ), also to front for me in the areas of
business you desire profitable. These funds have secretly been deposited
into a
confidential Security Company, where it can easily be withdrawn or paid
to a
recommended beneficiary. The funds will be released to you by the Security
Company,based on my recommendations, on that note, you will be presented
as my partner who will be fronting for me and my family in any subsequent
ventures. Myself and my mother have decided to give 20% to you if you are
able to help us claim this consignment.

expenses in the course of this transaction at the end of the transaction.
