  Lani Wride


 Mobile Notary Public

 Signing Agent













Dear Agent and Escrow Officer:

I am a mobile notary and have been in the mortgage business for 6.5 years
and have been doing loan signings for 3 years.  I started loan signings with
Brian McMahon of Lamorinda Funding Group and work at the new Pleasanton
office of Diablo Funding Group. This is what his assistant had to say about
my service:

?We have worked with Lani Wride for a long time, calling upon her to do
signings at our borrower's homes.  She is terrific with the customer and
very organized up front so all goes smoothly.  I highly recommend her.  If
you are in a position to send business her way I know you'll be happy with
the service.?
