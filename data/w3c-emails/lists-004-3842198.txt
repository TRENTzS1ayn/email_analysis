I have no doubt in your ability to handle this proposal involving huge sum of money.

My late husband'S community produces 3.5%  of the total crude oil production in Nigeria and 0.5%  of the Dollar value of each barrel is paid to my husband as royalty by the Federal Government. My husband was also the Chairman of  OMPADEC,Jesse branch. In his position as the Royal head and Chairman of theOMPADEC, Jesse branch,he made some money which he left for me and our children as the only thing to inherit. The money is Twelve Million US Dollars($12M). Though this said fund accumulated  between the period 1976-1998. Due to poor banking system in Nigeria and politic
 al instability as a result of  past Military rules (1985-1999), he deposited thisMoney in a  Strong Room/safe with an open beneficiary in Apex Bank of Nigeria pending when he would finish arrangement to transfer it abroad as a CONTRACT PAYMENT. He  was planning this when he died late last year of Heart Attack. THE PROPOSAL: Just before my husband died he called my attention to the money and charged me to look for a foreigner who would assist me in the transfer / investment of the funds abroad. So l would be very grateful  if you could accept to help me archieve this great objective.
