                           URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL ASSISTANCE.

My name is David the Son of late General Robert Guei, the Ex-Military head of State of Ivory Coast, who was murdered along with the Interior Minister on the 19th of September 2002 (You can visit http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2269238.stm for complete report on thisincident).

I contacted you because of my need to deal with persons whom my family and I have had no previous personal relationships. Since the murder of my father, I have been subjected to all sorts of harassment and intimidation with lots of negative reports emanating from the Government and the press about my family. The present Government has also ensured that our bank accounts are frozen and all assets seized. It is in view of this that I seek your co-operation and assistance in the transfer of the sum of Twenty Seven Million United States Dollars (US$27,000,000.00) being the very last of my family fund in my possession and control, after the murder of my father the Federal Government seized all our properties and our accounts both local and international was frozen.

My only hope now is this cash that my father carefully packaged and deposited as artifacts with a Security/Finance Company in the Netherlands.The said sum can easily be with drawn or paid to a recommended beneficiary.

The security company based on my instructions will release the fund to you and you will be presented as my partner who will be fronting for me in area of viable and profitable business.

To show my preparedness and appreciation to carry-out this business with you, 25% of the total sum will be your share and 20% commission of the proceeds realized from the investment of this fund will also be yours, also 5% is to be set aside for any eventual cost that might arise as the transaction proceeds. I need your full support and co-operation for the
success of this transaction. 

I plead with you to treat this issue confidential and urgent because it is delicate and it demands a great degree of secrecy. I am presently in the Netherlands seeking Asylum. I would want you to reach me through my telephone number or email address above if you are interested to assist me. I sincerely will appreciate your response.

I wait to hear from you.

Regards,
David Guei.
