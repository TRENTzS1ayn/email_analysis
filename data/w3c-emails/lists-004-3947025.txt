Dear Sir 

First, l must solicit your confidence in thistransaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. Though l know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but l am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. We have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been reliably informed of your discreteness and ability in transactions of this nature. Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am MR. OBOH THOMPSON, a director with the Union Bank Plc, Lagos. I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence.

Valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank Plc to get in touch with any of the Baker's family or relatives but there has been no success till date. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of late Engr. Theophilus Baker's next-of-kin (he had no wife nor children that is known to us). The management under the influence of our Chairman and member of the board of directors, retired Chie
 f Kalu Uke. Kalu, that an arrangement has been made for the funds to be declared "UNCLAIMABLE"

Thoephilus Baker so that the fund USD$31.5Million would be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next-of-kin. All documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully worked out. We have secured from the probate an order of madamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries, and more so we are assuring you of a 100% risk free involvement.

We have agreed that, the funds will be shared thus, after it has been transferred into your account.
