RE: URGENT & CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL 

Although this proposal might come to you as a 
surprise, since it is from someone you do not know or 
have seen before, but based on recommendations, I 
gathered from a very reliable source here in Nigeria. 

I am the director, fund coordinator of the Finance 
Contract Department of Nigeria Ports Authority. The 
crux of this letter is that the finance / contract 
department of the NPA deliberatly over-inflated the 
contract values of various contract awarded. 

In the course of disbursement, my office was able to 
track down the sum of US$23.5M as the over invoiced 
sum. This money is now floating in the NPA 
domicilliary account with the Central Bank of Nigeria 
(CBN). I and my colleagues now want to quickly 
tranfer this fund to a safe nominated foreign account 
for possible investment abroad. 

We are not allowed as a matter of government policy to
operate any foreign account because of our status as 
civil / public servants. Hence the need to solicit 
for your full banking details, to enable us transfer 
this money into your account. 

Upon your acceptance of this proposal, we have also 
agreed on a sharing ration: 
1. 25% for you as the account owner 
2. 65% for I and my colleagues 
3. 10% will be set aside to defray all incidental 
expenses both locally and internationally during 
the course of this transaction. 

Furthermore, we shall be coming over to your country 
when the money is finally in your account and we 
shall be relying on your advise as regards to 
investment of our share. be informed that this 
business is genuine and 100% safe considering the high
powered government officials involved. 

Send by email the following information: 
1. Your company name and address, bank name, address 
and account number 
2. Your telephone and fax number for effective 
communication 

This is to effect the swift transfer of this fund into
your account in less than seven (7) working days. 
Contact me strictly on my email address while looking 
forward to a healthy business relationship with you. 

Yours faithfully, 

MR.DANJUMA AHMED.
