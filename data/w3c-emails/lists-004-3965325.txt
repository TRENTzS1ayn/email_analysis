You have won it in a lottery? Simply I want to learn(find out), I too have won in this lottery, and from me after a prize demand, that I all over again would transfer(translate) them 2.000 EURO, and then only they will transfer(translate) me my prize. Also I want to ask, from you after the notice on a prize and all filled forms demanded 2.000 EURO?
