SIR 

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE: STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 

I AM  MR. EZUKS CHUKWUDI, AN ACCOUNTANT WITH THE NIGERIAN 
NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (N.N.P.C.). I HEADED A 
SEVEN-MAN TENDERS BOARD IN CHARGE OF CONTRACT AWARDS 
AND PAYMENT APPROVALS. I CAME TO KNOW OF YOU IN MY 
SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE AND REPUTABLE PERSON TO HANDLE A 
VERY CONFIDENTIAL TRANSACTION WHICH INVOLVES THE 
TRANSFER OF A HUGE SUM OF MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT. 

THERE WERE SERIES OF CONTRACTS EXECUTED BY A 
CONSORTIUM OF MULTI-NATIONALS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY IN 
FAVOUR OF N.N.P.C. THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF THIS 
CONTRACTS WERE DELIBERATELY OVER- INVOICED TO THE SUM 
OF USD$30,000,000.00 (THIRTY MILLION UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS). 

THIS AMOUNT HAS  BEEN APPROVED AND IS NOW READY TO 
BE TRANSFERRED, BEING THAT THE COMPANIES THAT ACTUALLY 
EXECUTED THESE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN FULLY PAID AND THE 
PROJECTS OFFICIALLY COMMISSIONED. 

CONSEQUENTLY, MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE WILLING TO 
TRANSFER THE TOTAL AMOUNT TO YOUR ACCOUNT FOR 
SUBSEQUENT DISBURSEMENT, SINCE WE, CIVIL SERVANTS 
ARE PROHIBITED BY THE CODE OF CONDUCT BUREAU (CIVIL 
SERVICE LAW) FROM OPERATING AND/OR OPENING FOREIGN 
ACCOUNTS IN OUR NAMES. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE TRUST 
REPOSED ON YOU AT THIS JUNCTURE IS ENORMOUS. IN 
RETURN, WE HAVE AGREED TO OFFER YOU 25% OF THE 
TRANSFERRED SUM, WHILE 10% SHALL BE SET ASIDE FOR 
INCIDENTAL EXPENSES (INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL) BETWEEN 
PARTIES IN THE COURSE OF THE TRANSACTION. YOU WILL BE 
MANDATED TO REMIT THE BALANCE TO OTHER ACCOUNTS IN DUE COURSE. 

MODALITIES HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL 
OF THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND THE CENTRAL BANK OF 
NIGERIA (C.B.N.) FOR THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THE 
FUNDS WITHIN 14 WORKING DAYS SUBJECT TO YOUR 
SATISFACTION OF THE ABOVE STATED TERMS. OUR ASSURANCE 
IS THAT YOUR ROLE IS RISK FREE. 

TO ACCORD THIS TRANSACTION THE LEGALITY IT DESERVES 
AND FOR MUTUAL SECURITY OF THE FUNDS THE WHOLE 
APPROVAL PROCEDURES WILL BE OFFICIALLY AND LEGALLY 
PROCESSED WITH YOUR NAME OR THE NAME OF ANY COMPANY 
YOU MAY NOMINATE AS THE BONAFIDE BENEFICIARY. 

ONCE MORE, I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT HAVING PUT IN 
OVER TEN YEARS IN THE CIVIL SERVICE OF MY COUNTRY, I 
AM AVERSE TO HAVING MY IMAGE AND CAREER DENTED. THIS 
MATTER SHOULD THEREFORE BE TREATED WITH THE UTMOST 
SECRECY AND URGENCY IT DESERVES. 

KINDLY EXPEDITE ACTION AS WE ARE BEHIND SCHEDULE TO 
ENABLE US INCLUDE THIS TRANSFER IN THIS BATCH 
WHICH WOULD CONSTITUTE THE LAST QUARTER PAYMENTS FOR 
THE 2003 FINANCIAL YEAR. 

CONTACT ME THROUGH MY TELE  NUMBER IS 234-80-34036425
POSSIBLE FOR MORE DETAILS. 

YOURS SINCERELY, 
MR. EZUKS CHUKWUDI
