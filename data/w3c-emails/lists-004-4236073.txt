MY DEAR

I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha, the widow of the late Gen. Sanni Abacha former Nigeria 
Military Head of State who died mysteriously as a result of Cardiac Arrest 
Since after my husband's death my family is under restriction of movement and 
that not withstanding, we are being molested by police and our Bank Account 
both here and abroad are being frozen by the Nigerian Democratic Government, 
Furthermore, my elder son was in detention by the Nigeria Government for more 
interrogation about my husband's assets and some vital documents, Following the 
recent discovery of my husband's Bank Account
by the Nigeria Government with Swiss Bank in which the huge sum of US$700 
Million and DM450 Million was logged.

I therefore decided to contact you in confidence that I was able to move out 
the sum of US$25.5 Million Dollars, which was secretly defaced and is sealed in 
two Metal boxes for security reasons, I therefore personally, appeal to you 
Seriously and religiously for your urgent assistance to move this money into 
your country where I believe it will be safe since I cannot leave the country 
now due to the restriction of movement imposed on the members of my family by 
the Nigeria Government.

Please kindly send me your telephone, fax number and also your full names, 
address which I will hand over to my family lawyer to prepare you on how to 
claim the funds from the security company, However, arrangements have been put 
in place to move this money out of the country in a secret vault through a 
security company, and as soon as you indicate your interest my Lawyer shall 
send you the Air-Way Bill of the Luggage and other related documents so that 
you can proceed to claim the Luggage from the security company Conclusively, we 
have agreed to offer you 20% of the total sum while 75% is to before me and my 
family for profitable business investment which you will
advice me on.

Preferable properties in your country subsequent to my free movement by the 
Nigeria Government. While 5% is mapped out for expenses as your government may 
demand for tax and it also covers your telephone bills. Please reply urgently 
and treat with absolute confidentiality and sincerity.

NB: PLEASE BEFORE YOU REPLY ME THIS MAIL, KINDLY GO THROUGH WEBSITE FIRST.
Switzerland Bank has also agreed to give back my family some of the money.
