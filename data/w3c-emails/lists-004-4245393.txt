  you as we have not correspond before. I approach you
  most honourably and sincerely to propose to you a
  business partnership of mutual benefit and interest.

  who was the leader of the Revolutionary United Front
  of Sierra-Leone (RUF) and formerly the Director of
  GOLD/DIAMOND CORPORATION of Sierra-Leone.

  My father was arrested  by the civilian government of President
  Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, for the role he played during
  the regime of major Paul Koromah, which resulted to
 war.before his death On the night of my father?s arrest, he
  instructed me to move out of the country without
  delay, with the sum of US$ 15M (15 Million
  US Dollars) contained in a sealed trunk box.

  I fled out of our country in the company of my mother
  through the coastal river and arrived in
  Abidjan-IvoryCoast, where I deposited the box in a
  Security Company as containing family treasure forsafe
  keeping.

  into partnership venture with you. I am
  asking for your assitance to help us claim the
  money and secure it for onward investment and to
  make residence arrangement for us, this money is rigth now
  in Madrid SPAIN.

  I have the consent of my family and we have agreed
  to give you 15% of the total amount, including 15%
  share from the profits which the money will generate
 from any future investment. The existence of this
  fortune which I have revealed to you is authentic
  and confidential and there is no risk involved in
  the cause of retreiving it back from the Security
  Company.

  It has been transfered and it is currently in the
  custody of a security company in Spain.
