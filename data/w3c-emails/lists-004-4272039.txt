Good   Day,
 
 You may be suprise to receive this email since you do not know me.
 I am the son of the late president of Democratic Republic Of
 Zaire,President Mobutu Sese Seko, ( now The Republic Of Congo, under
 the leadership of the son of Mr. Laurent Kabila ). I presume you are
 aware there is a financial dispute between my family ( THE MOBUTUS ) and the
 present civilian Government. This is based on what they believe as bad
 and corrupt governance on my late father's part. May his soul rest in
 perfect peace.As you might have heard how a lot of my father's bank account in
 Switzerland and North America have been frozen.
 Following the above named reasons, I am soliciting for your humble and
 confidential assistance to take custody of THIRTY Million United States
 Dollars ( US$30,000,000.00 ), also to front for me in the areas of
 business you desire profitable.
 These funds have secretly been deposited into a confidential Security
 Company, where it can easily be withdrawn or paid to a recommended
 beneficiary. The funds will be released to you by the Security Company,
 based on my recommendations, on that note, you will be presented as my
 partner who will be fronting for me  and my family in any subsequent
 ventures. Myself and my mother have decided to give 20% to you if you
 are able to help us claim this consignment.We have also decided to give you
 any money spent on phone calls or travelling expenses in the course of this
 transaction.
 
 Please, I need your entire support and co-operation for the success of
 this transaction, your utmost confidentiality and secrecy is highly
 required, due to my family's present predicament. I sincerely will appreciate
 your willingness to assist us as soon as possible.
 
 I am presently in the refugee camp here in the Netherlands under the
 united nations refugee camp in Netherlands and I can be reached on
 phone number +31-627-282-395 or via email mmobutu@hknetmail.com for 
 more information on how we can proceed in this transaction.
