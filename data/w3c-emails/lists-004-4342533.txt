LITTLE BRAINS ORPHANGE HOME.


Ours is an orphange home basically meant to cater for kids without
parents. This Home was founded in the year 1995 by Late Mrs Ngozi
Asika a devoted Christain mother.


At inception, it has 5 kids and has since grown in numbers. Today, we
have 300 kids in the  orphange, while 120 kids has successfully been
taken out for adoption by interested people.


Our source of income has been voluntary donations from public
spirited individuals, churches, mosques and corporate organisations. 


The growing number of kids in the orphange requires adequate funding
which hardly comes in nowadays due to economic downturn in our
country. Consequently, we are finding it difficult to take good care
of these children. Available resources are been over-stretched.
Facilities are in total dilapidation requiring urgent attention.
Feeding has become irregular. Medicare is an uphill task. 


In this situation, we are faced with two options. To close down the 
Home or continue to operate it. The management of the home decided to
continue its operation out of our love for children who are leaders
of tomorrow.


It is in furtherance of our decision that we sincerely appeal for
your help. Donation in any form will be welcomed: baby food, baby
clothes, drugs, cash, toys etc.


Please help us to bring smiles to these Ophans.  Thanks in
anticipation of your positive response.
