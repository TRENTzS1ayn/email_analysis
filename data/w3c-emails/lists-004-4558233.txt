  FROM EDITH FONA
ABIDJAN COTE'D IVOIRE
WEST AFRICA


Dear sir/madam,

I am EDITH FONA , a Sierra-Leoneian and the Duther of late Major
General BENAYAH FONA of Blessed Memory.

My Father  was among the people who died in detention as aresult of his


involvement in the government of MAJOR JOHNNY PAUL KOROMAH who was the
rebel leader in Sierra-Leone but now in exile following the fall of his
government.

Before my Father's  sudden death, he made me to understand that he has
the sum of
US$10 Million (Ten Million American Dollars) he deposited in a


Bank in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.He also gave me the deposit slip and the

deposition agreement with which the deposit was made. I have since
contacted the Bank as regards the deposit and my intending plan to transfer it.

I therefore seek your assistance to provide me with an account where
the money
will be transferred and probably help me ininvesting the money for the
future of me and my Bother  since my Father is no more. I EDITH FONA and my Brother will
be willing to offer you 20% of this money as commission hoping that you are a
sincere and God fearing person.

Please, do reach me on this above email address for confidenlity of
this transaction. 

Thanks and God bless.

Yours faithfully

EDITH FONA and Brother Godwill.
