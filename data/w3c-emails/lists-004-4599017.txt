Dear friend,
 
 
I am HAJIYA MARYAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigeria
Head of State,General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th
of June, 1998 while still on active duty.

l am contacting you in view of the fact that we will
be of
great assistance to each other likeness developing a
cordial
relationship.

I currently have within my reach the sum of ELEVEN
MILLION US Dollars
(US$11,000,000.00) cash which l intend to use for
investment, like Real
EstateDevelopment or import/export business
specifically in your
country.
This money came as a payback contract deal between my
late husband and a
Russian Firm on our countries multi-billion dollars
Ajaokuta Steel Plant Project.

The Russian Partners returned my husband's share of
USD$11,000,000.00
after the death of my husband and lodged in my
husband's security
company
of which l am director right now, the new Civilian
Government have
intensified their probe on my husband's financial and
oil company.
In view of these, l acted fast to withdraw the
US$11,000,000.00 from the
company's vault and deposited in another private
security company vault
within the country.

I have since declared the Security Company bankrupt.
No record ever
existed concerning the money traceable by the
government because there
is
no documentation
showing that we received the money from the Russian.

Due to the current situation in the country concerning
government
attitude
towards my family, it has become quite impossible for
me to make use of this money within. 

Let me refer you to the front page of This Day
Newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it
through their website :www.thisdayonline.com , click
on
archives,8th.june,2001) The present government in
Nigeria had frozen and seized all my bank accounts
both here in Nigeria and abroad. 

Thus lshall expect you to contact me urgently to
enable us discuss in detail about this transaction.

Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to
transfer this fund, l proposed a percentage of 17% of
total sum to you for the expected service and
assistance, 10% for offsetting minor expenses incurred
in the course of this transaction. 

Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop
further contacts. All correspondence must be by the
email address above.

l must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise
the utmost
indulgence to keepthis matter extraordinarily
confidential whatever your decision while await your
prompt response.

NB: Because of the security being mounted on the
members of my family, l have decided that this
transaction be kept in utmost secrecy, remember to
include your private Telephone or fax number for easy
communication.

Best Regards.

DR. (HAJIYA) MARYAM ABACHA.
