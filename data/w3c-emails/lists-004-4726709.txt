Good day, 
 
It is an opportunity for me to know you and your honourable self and the
position you now occupy. 

I am Donaldson Taylor the son of President Charles Taylor of Liberia.
And presently I am in The Netherlands where I have been residing for the past ten years. 
 
I was home few days ago because of the death of my Grand mother whom my
father had to bury before he leaves office on the 11th of this month august and move to Nigeria for refugee status. 

However, because of the accusation of the various groups and the lessons my
father learnt during the days of Late President Samuel Doe, he has made all
arrangement for we his children to be relocated in various countries of the
world where there is lasting peace and investment opportunities. 

Presently, with his connections through Sierra Leone where he has
 been accused of supporting the uprising there and which later led to the present
problem we are now having in our country, he made arrangement with a Security firm with the assistance of our personal aid Capt. Gerard Domion to move to Amsterdam The Netherlands some funds for safe keeping. The fund is now in the possession of the security firm in The Netherlands. 

This fund which is U.S$16,400,000:00 (Sixteen million, four hundred thousand United States dollars) needs to be claimed and transferred to an account that you will have to provide as a TRUSTWORTHY partner. 
 
My father has advised that this money be kept very confidential and injected into a very viable INVESTMENT that I will be able to find, with the assistance of a trustworthy partner. 
The reason for the funds to be kept very confidential is because of the war crime charges the United Nation is planning to take legal action against him. And you know that once that is done, he can be jailed and all known asset and funds of his, will be sieze. 
This is the motivating basic factor that he has asked me to seek for a trustworthy partner in whose named account this funds will be transferred into to avoid trace in the future.
I do not want to contact just any body regarding this funds and safe
 keeping of this funds but someone of great trust and integrity, who can give his words and his words are always his BOND.
 
If you are interested in assisting me get this funds from the security firm and investing it, please indicate so in your response to this e-mail by a return mail.
 
Thanks for your anticipated cooperation.
 
Faithfully yours,
Donaldson Taylor.
