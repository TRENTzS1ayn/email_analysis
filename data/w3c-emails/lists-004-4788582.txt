Dear Sir,

Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad
necessitate this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing the sum of
USD7,500,000.000 (seven million five hundred thousand united states dollars)inherited from
my father's business reserve.

I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family; my father was an agriculturist. He
became rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was victimized by
President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was assassinated by unknown
gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding the minority white
farmers.

Before his death, my father foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and
property then decided to deposit the above sum with a private finance and
security firm in Europe. This money has become the only inherited property
of our family since our home was burnt,and the farmlands and machines seized;
yet the government and it's loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us.

To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 15%
of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or 25%
share for possible help on investing in any reliable venture.

There are however some minimal cost involved in securing the release of this
deposit from the present holding company.

My family and I are presently in the Netherlands, 
we seeking political assylum We chose The Netherlands 
because we wnated to be close to our money as 
Zimbabwe is no longer safe for us to live in.


please in good fate treat with utmost confidentiality . 
A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers 
for more confidential communication will be highly appreciated.

Sincerely yours

Thomas Goma
