FROM:BARRISTER CHURCHILL OKOCHA ESQ. 
     OKOCHA & CO 
     ATTORNEYS/LEGAL PRACTITIONER 
     NIGERIA 


WE NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE. 


DEAR FRIEND, 

COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON. GRACE AND PEACE AND LOVE 
FROM THIS PART OF THE ATLANTIC TO YOU. I HOPE MY 
LETTER DOES NOT CAUSE YOU TOO MUCH EMBARRASSMENT AS I 
WRITE TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON THE CONTACT 
ADDRESS GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND WHO WORKS AT THE 
NIGERIAN EMBASSY IN YOUR COUNTRY. PLEASE EXCUSE MY 
INTRUSION INTO YOUR PRIVATE LIFE. 

I AM BARRISTER CHURCHILL OKOCHA ESQ. I REPRESENT MOHAMMED 
ABACHA, SON OF THE LATE GEN.SANI ABACHA, WHO WAS THE 
FORMER MILITARY HEAD OF STATE IN NIGERIA. HE DIED IN 
1998. SINCE HIS DEATH, THE FAMILY HAS BEEN LOSING A 
LOT OF MONEY DUE TO VINDICTIVE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
WHO ARE BENT ON DEALING WITH THE FAMILY. BASED ON THIS 
THEREFORE, THE FAMILY HAS ASKED ME TO SEEK FOR A 
FOREIGN PARTNER WHO CAN WORK WITH US AS TO MOVE OUT 
THE TOTAL SUM OF US$75,000,000.00 ( SEVENTY FIVE 
MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ), PRESENTLY IN THEIR 
POSSESSION. THIS MONEY WAS OF COURSE, ACQUIRED BY THE 
LATE PRESIDENT AND IS NOW KEPT SECRETLY BY THE FAMILY. 
THE SWISS GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY FROZEN ALL THE 
ACCOUNTS OF THE FAMILY IN SWITZERLAND, AND SOME OTHER 
COUNTRIES WOULD SOON FOLLOW TO DO THE SAME. THIS BID 
BY SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO DEAL WITH THIS FAMILY 
HAS MADE IT NECESSARY THAT WE SEEK YOUR ASSISITANCE IN 
RECEIVING THIS MONEY AND IN INVESTING IT ON BEHALF 
OFTHE FAMILY. 

THIS MUST BE A JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTION AND WE MUST 
ALL WORK TOGETHER. SINCE THIS MONEY IS STILL CASH, 
EXTRA SECURITY MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO PROTECT IT 
FROM THEFT OR SEIZURE, PENDING WHEN AGREEMENT IS 
REACHED ON WHEN AND HOW TO MOVE IT INTO ANY OF YOUR 
NOMINATED BANK ACCOUNTS. I HAVE PERSONALLY WORKED OUT 
ALL MODALITIES FOR THE PEACEFUL CONCLUSION OF THIS 
TRANSACTION. THE TRANSACTION DEFINITELY WOULD BE 
HANDLED IN PHASES AND THE FIRST PHASE WILL INVOLVE THE 
MOVING OF US$25,000,000.00( TWENTY FIVE MILLION 
UNITEDSTATES DOLLARS ). 

MY CLIENTS ARE WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE 
PERCENTAGE OF THIS MONEY AS SOON AS THE TRANSACTIONIS 
CONCLUDED. I WILL, HOWEVER, BASED ON THE GROUNDS THAT 
YOU ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH US AND ALSO ALL 
CONTENTIOUS ISSUES DISCUSSED BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT 
OF THIS TRANSACTION. YOU MAY ALSO DISCUSS YOUR 
PERCENTAGE BEFORE WE START TO WORK. AS SOON AS I HEAR 
FROM YOU, I WILL GIVE YOU ALL NECESSARY DETAILS AS TO 
HOW WE INTEND TO CARRY OUT THE WHOLE TRANSACTION. 
PLEASE, DO NOT ENTERTAIN ANY FEARS,AS ALL NECESSARY 
MODALITIES ARE IN PLACE, AND I ASSURE YOU OF ALL 
SUCCESS AND SAFETY IN THIS TRANSACTION. 

PLEASE, THIS TRANSACTION REQUIRES ABSOLUTE 
CONFIDENTIALITY AND YOU WOULD BE EXPECTED TO TREAT IT 
AS SUCH UNTIL THE FUNDS ARE MOVED OUT OF THIS COUNTRY. 

PLEASE, YOU WILL ALSO IGNORE THIS LETTER AND RESPECT 
OUR TRUST IN YOU BY NOT EXPOSING THIS TRANSACTION, 
EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED.LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING 
WITH YOU. THANK YOU. 

TRULY YOURS, 

BARRISTER CHURCHILL OKOCHA ESQ.
