UNION BANK NIGERIA PLC
36 MARINA STREET LAGOS,NIGERIA

FROM THE DESK OF FRANK UBABIA
MANAGER,BILLS AND EXCHANGE.
TEL:234-80-33299850

DEAR GOOD FRIEND, 

                          

I AM THE MANAGER OF BILLS AND EXCHANGE AT THE FOREIGN
REMITTANCE DEPARTMENT OF THIS BANK. IAM WRITING YOU
FOLLOWING THE IMPRESSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU THROUGH
ONE OF MY FRIENDS WHO WORKED WITH THE NIGERIAN CHAMBER OF COMERCE BEFORE HIS TRANSFER TO THE NIGERIAN TRADE MISSION IN HONG KONG. HE ASSURED ME OF YOUR CAPABILITY AND RELIABILITY TO CHAMPION A BUSINESS OF GREAT MAGNITUDE LIKE THIS ONE,ALTHOUGH I DID NOT TELL HIM THE NATURE OF THIS BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY IT REQUIRES.

IN MY DEPARTMENT, WE DISCOVERED AN ABANDONED SUM OF
USD25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS
ONLY) IN A DOMICILIARY ACCOUNT THAT BELONGS TO ONE OF
OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WHO DIED IN A GHASTLY PLANE
CRASH IN JANUARY, 2000 ABOARD KENYA AIRWAYS ALONG WITH
HIS ENTIRE FAMILY.

SINCE WE GOT THE INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE
EXPECTED HIS NEXT- OF- KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM THE
MONEY BECAUSE WE CANNOT RELEASE IT UNLESS SOMEBODY
APPLIES FOR IT AS THE NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION TO THE
DECEASED AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINES.
UNFORTUNATELY WE LEARNT THAT ALL HIS SUPPOSED NEXT OF
KIN OR RELATIONS DIED ALONG WITH HIM AT THE PLANE
CRASH LEAVING NOBODY BEHIND FOR THE CLAIM. IT IS UPON
THIS DISCOVERY THEREFORE, THAT I NOW DECIDED TO MAKE
BUSINESS WITH YOU AND RELEASE THE MONEY TO YOU AS THE
NEXT OF KIN  OR RELATION OF THE DECEASED FOR 
SAFE-KEEPING AND SUBSEQUENT DISBURSEMENT WITH YOU
SINCE NOBODY IS COMING FOR IT AND I DO NOT WANT THIS
MONEY TO BE RECYCLED INTO THE BANK'S BOUNDED ACCOUNT
AS AN UNCLAIMED FUND.

THE REQUEST FOR A FOREIGNER AS  NEXT OF KIN IN THIS
BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER
WAS A FOREIGNER AND A NIGERIA CANNOT STAND AS NEXT
OF KIN TO A FOREIGNER. I HAVE AGREED THAT 25% OF THIS
MONEY WILL BE FOR YOU AS FOREIGN PARTNER, THEREAFTER  I WILL VISIT YOUR COUNTRY FOR THE
DISBURSEMENT ACCORDING TO THE AGREED PERCENTAGES.
PERSONALLY, I WOULD WANT YOU TO ADVISE ME ON THE BEST
AREA OF INVESTMENT BECAUSE I AM CONSIDERING TO INVEST
THE GREATER PROPORTION OF MY SHARE IN YOUR COUNTRY.

THEREFORE TO ENABLE THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THE FUNDS VIA OUR CORRESPONDENT FINANCE HOUSE IN OVERSEAS TO YOU AS ARRANGED, YOU SHOULD FIRST APPLY TO THE BANK
AS THE NEXT OF KIN OR BUSINESS PARTNER OF THE
DECEASED INDICATING YOUR ACCOUNT DETAILS WHEREIN THE
MONEY WILL BE  REMITTED. UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR REPLY
MAIL, I SHALL SEND TO YOU THE TEXT OF THE APPLICATION
WHICH YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO THE BANK FOR
THE BANK'S PROCEDURAL AUTHENTICATION AND IMMEDIATE
REMITTANCE OF THE FUND TO THE ACCOUNT YOU ARE GOING
TO NOMINATE.

AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE THIS MAIL, DO CONTACT ME AT
ONCE THROUGH MY  ABOVE INDICATED E-MAIL,OR BETTER STILL YOU CALL ME ON MY ABOVE TELEPHONE NUMBER FOR MORE CLARIFICATION. 

AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE YOU TO INDICATE YOUR PRIVATE AND
CONFIDENTIAL TELEPHONE, FAX,CELLULAR AND E-MAIL FOR THE
EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION REQUIRED.

*BE INFORMED THAT ALL NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS TOWARDS THE SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF THE FUND VIA OUR CORRESPONDENT FINANCE HOUSE IN OVERSEAS HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED AND IT IS 100% RISK FREE. 


TRUSTING TO HEAR FROM YOU IMMEDIATELY.

YOURS FAITHFULLY,

MR.  FRANK UBABIA
