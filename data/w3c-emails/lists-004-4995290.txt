Dear Friend,
                                    
I am marriam Abacha,wife to the late Nigerian Head of State,Gen.Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June
1998 while still on duty.  I am contacting you with the hope that you will be of great assistance to me.I currently have within my reach the sum of US$35.86M cash which I intend to utilise for investment purposes in your country.The
money is part of a  payback from a contract deal between my husband and a Chinese Firm on our country's multi-billion Dollars Railway Line Project.  The Chinese partners returned my husband;s share, US$35.86Million,after his death.  
Now the civilian Government in Nigeria has intensified
their probe on myhusband;s financial resources which has led to the closure of all our accounts both locally and internationally, revoking of all our business licences. In view of this, I acted very fast to withdraw US$35.86M which was in cash from our Bureau De Change, Foreign Exchange out fit before it was closed down.  I have deposited this money,concealed in eight  trunk boxes as family treasures, in a private security company in Europe with the help of a diplomat who conveyed the trunk boxes containing the funds as a diplomatic luggage to beat security.Five out of the eight trunk boxes contain the money while three boxes contain important documents and other materials.  The security
company does not know the actual content of the five boxes, the three boxes were used to cover up for the rest.Due to the current situation in my country and the Government;s attitude to my family, I cannot make use of this money within
Africa here, hence, I seek your help in clearing the five boxes so that we can use the money for investment there in your country.  This will also be under your supervision.On your consent please indicate your interest to my
attorney immediately for further talks.  Your terms of assistance will also be negotiated when he calls you.  Therefore include your phone numbers.Your urgent 
response is needed. And I must re mind you of the confidentiality of this matter whatever your decision, while I await your response.

Regards
Mrs Marriam Abacha
