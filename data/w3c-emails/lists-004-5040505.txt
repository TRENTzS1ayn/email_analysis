Dear Sir,
My names are  Mac  Johnson  Bonida, I am the inmediate
young brother to Mrs Jewel Charlas Taylor of  war
tored country of Liberia-westAfrica, the wife of (Mr
Charlas Taylor) president of Liberia.
After a peace deal in Ghana few weeks ago, my sister
called me for introduction of what need to be done
inmediately that her properties are no longer safe. He
asked me to meet her contact in Ivory Coast to arrange
my journey to Eruope. She said  that she had made
contact with a  Security company to move a truck box
containing $30.000000:00 US Dollars,  Thirty  Million
United State Dollars Only, and
that the security company label it as Africa rtifacts.
The Company has confirmed the arrival of  this
consignment in their  office in Spain.
I left for Ivory-Coast  for my journey to Europe and
at this moment I am in Spain but owing to what is
happening in my country this time, my sister can not
do nothing as to Claim the Consignment and she want
this deal to be a confidential transaction, so she
asked me to contact any partner  who could stand as a
beneficiary of this truck box.
She has agreed to give10% of the total fund to you for
assistance and moving the fund to your private account
in your country for purpose of investment. While 5% of
the total fund will cover your expense during this
transaction.
You can contact me if you are interested by my e-mail jonsonbonida_mac@latinmail.com
address or kindly call me on this Spainish  telephone
number, 0034649171338.
I would be glad if you can help me out to complete
this transcation and transfer this fund into your
private account. Please endevour to keep this
transaction as confidentail as possible because my
Sister and her husband is in trouble over the
war in my country-Liberia.
Your Sincerelly
Mac Jonson Bonida
