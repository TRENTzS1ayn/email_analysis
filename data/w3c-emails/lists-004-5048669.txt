fatal aircrash on 30 JAN 2000 Since then I have made
several inquiries to your embassy to locate any of my

any member of his family hence I contacted you. I have
contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and
property left behind by my client before they get
confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank

the CITIZEN INTERNTIONAL BANK. Where the deceased had
an account Valued at about ($35 million u s dollars)

have the account confiscated within the next ten
official working days.

relatives for over 2 years now, I seek your consent to
present you as the next of kin of the deceased since

this account valued at ($35 million US Dollars)can be
paid to you and then you and me Can share the
money.50% to me and 40% to you. While 10% for
unforeseen bottle necks we might incur in this
transaction an attorney will be contracted to helpus
