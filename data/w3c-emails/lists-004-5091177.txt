 Dear Charsets,
I am Olim Amirov. On the 1-st of September I have received the winning notification from Maria Jose Sanches. There she asked me to contact with Barry Hanson in order to claim my prize fund. I reached him and met all his requirements, but he disappeared. Now I found the same massage, which has been sent to me in the Internet and your e-mail address near by it. So wouldn?t you so kind to inform me if this was true about the winning or it was just a joke.

Looking forward to hear from you soon.

Best regards,

Olim Amirov.
