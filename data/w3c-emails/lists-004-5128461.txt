FROM: LUISA PIMENTEL ESTRADA. 
E-MAIL: HEREXCELLENCY1@PHANTOMEMAIL.COM

IT IS WITH HEARTFELT HOPE THAT I WRITE TO SEEK YOUR CO-OPERATION AND
ASSISTANCE IN THE CONTEXT STATED BELOW:

MAY I FIRST INTRODUCE MYSELF: I AM SENATOR LUISA PIMENTEL ESTRADA, THE
FIRST WIFE OF JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA (FORMER HEAD OF STATE AND
PRESIDENT OF PHILIPPINES) WHO IS PRESENTLY HELD IN DETENTION IN A
HOSPITAL OUTSIDE MANILLA, PHILIPPINES. I GOT YOUR CONTACT FROM THE
INTERNET DURING THE COURSE OF MY SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE FOREIGNER WHO
WILL ASSIST ME IN RECEIVING THE SUM OF US$57MILLION SECRETLY DEPOSITED
IN MY FAVOUR BY MY HUSBAND. THIS MONEY WAS KEPT WITH A SECURITY COMPANY
IN LUXEMBOURG AND I HAVE ALL DOCUMENTS WITH ME AS OF WHEN IT WAS
DEPOSITED IN A SECURITY VAULT FOR SAFE KEEPING. WE HAVE BEEN
DELIBERATING ON HOW TO INVEST THIS FUND ABROAD IN A CONFIDENTIAL MANNER
UNTIL WE CAME TO A CONCLUSION TO USE IT TO BUY ESTATES AND PART OF IT
WILL BE USED FOR NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS IN YOUR COUNTRY.

HOWEVER, THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION OF GLORIA ARROYO (THE PRESIDENT OF
PHILIPPINES) IS SEEKING THE DEATH OF MY HUSBAND.IN PURSUIT OF THIS
VENDETTA, THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT HAVE RESOLVED TO FREEZE ALL KNOWN
ASSETS OF JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA INCLUDING PROPERTIES AT HOME AND
ABROAD AND ARE PRESENTLY EMBARKING ON TO SEIZE THE VARIOUS BANK ACCOUNTS
OF MY HUSBAND IN SWITZERLAND, UK AND AUSTRALIA. IN FACT, THE ATTACK ON
OUR FAMILY (THE ESTRADA'S) IS SO DEVASTATED TO AN EXTENT OF SEIZING OUR
TRAVELLING PASSPORT, FAMILY ACCOUNTS, TRYING SOME MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY
IN COURT FOR OFFENCES ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED BY MY HUSBAND AND EVEN
RESTRICT US FROM SEEING MY HUSBAND. MY SON WAS RELEASED FROM DETENTION
ON THE AGREEMENT TO REFUND $1.5 MILLION TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PHILIPPINES
ALLEGEDLY STOLEN BY MY HUSBAND. 

YOU CAN FIND THIS ON;http://LATELINENEWS.COM/PS/ENGLISH/29432.SHTML
http://WWW.TIME.COM/TIME/ASIA/MAGAZINE/2001/0129/COVER1.HTML

WE ARE NOT READY TO COMPLY WITH THIS AS MOST OF THE FAMILY ASSETS AND
BANK ACCOUNTS ABROAD HAVE BEEN FROZEN BY THE ARROYO REGIME. IN VIEW OF
THIS GREVIOUS THREAT TO OUR ECONOMIC AND PERSONAL SURVIVAL, OUR FAMILY
TRUSTEE HAVE SECRETLY PROTECTED THE DEPOSIT, YOU ARE TO ASSIST US
TRAVELLING TO LUXEMBOURG TO LAY CLAIMS OF THE CONSIGNMENT WITH THE AID
OF ALL LEGAL DOCUMENTS THAT WILL BE FORWARDED TO YOU AS TIME GOES ON. 

IN THE MEANTIME, THERE IS A TRAVELLING EMBARGO ON THE FAMILY MEMBERS AND
OUR LOCAL ACCOUNTS ARE SEIZED AS WELL AS OUR TELEPHONE LINES HAVE BEEN
BUGGED.FOR THIS REASON, TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WILL NOT BE AN IDEAL
MEANS OF COMMUNICATION BECAUSE OUR CALLS WILL BE RECORDED.WE ARE
CURRENTLY BEING CATERED FOR BY THE GOVERNMENT OF PHILIPPINES IN OTHER TO
MONITOR AND CONTROL OUR FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES.WE CANNOT BE HELD
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SINS OF MY HUSBAND. IN VIEW OF THIS PLIGHT, I EXPECT
YOU TO BE TRUSTWORTHY AND KIND ENOUGH TO
RESPOND TO THIS DISTRESSED CALL TO SAVE OUR FAMILY FROM A HOPELESS
FUTURE.AND IF YOU AGREE TO HELP, WE SHALL DISCUSS THE DISBURSEMENT RATIO
IN OUR NEXT CORRESPONDENCE AFTER WE HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED. 

I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUICK RESPONSE WHILE THANKING YOU FOR YOUR
CO-OPERATION. IN VIEW OF ALL ABOVE DETAILS, I REQUEST YOU TO KEEP THIS
LETTER AND CO-OPERATION HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT
INTERESTED. BEST WISHES, 



LUISA PIMENTEL ESTRADA.
