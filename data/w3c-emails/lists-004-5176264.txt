REQUEST FOR URGENT

ASSISTANCE/INVESTMENT.

Dear Sir/Madam ,

My names is MR. NICKY WILLIAMS, the

elder son of Mr. ANTHONY WILLIAMS,of Zimbabwe. It might be a surprise to

you where I got your contact address, I got it from network on line, South 
African. During the current crises against the farmers of Zimbabwe by the 
supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms 
in our country, he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to 
his party members and their followers.

My father was one of the best farmers in the country and knowing that he did 
not support the president?s political ideology, the president?s supporters 
invaded

my father?s farm burnt down everything, shot him and as a result of the 
wounds

sustained, he became sick and died a! fter two days. And after his death, I 
with

my younger Brother decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our

lives to South-Africa.

BUT, before he died HE WROTE HIS WILL, which reads

"(MY BELOVEED SON ,I WISH TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO

THE SUM OF ($9,000,000=00). MILLION U.S DOLLARS WHICH

I DEPOSITED IN A BOX WITH A SECURITY COMPANY IN

JOHANNESBURG (SOUTH-AFRICA). IN CASE OF MY ABSENCE

ON EARTH CAUSED BY DEATH ONLY". You should solicit for

reliable foreign partner to assist you to transfer this money out of South 
Africa for

investment purpose. I deposited the money in your name and it can be

claimed by you alone with the deposit code. your mother has all the 
documents. Take

good care of your mother and brother." From the above, you will understand

that the lives and future of my family depends on this money as much, I

will be very grateful if you can assist us. I with my younger bro! ther are 
now

living in South-Africa as POLITICAL ASYLUM SEEKERS and the financial law of

SOUTH-AFRICA does not allow ASYLUM SEEKERS certain Financial rights to

such huge amount of money .In view of this, I cannot invest this money in

South-Africa, hence I am asking you to assist me transfer this money

out of South-Africa for investment purposes. For your efforts, I am prepared 
to offer you 20% of the total

fund, while 5% will be set aside for local and international expenses and 
75% will be kept for me and my family

...

Finally modalities on how the transfer will be done will be conveyed to you

once we establish trust and confidence between ourselves. Looking forward to

your urgent reply .For detailed information.

NOTE: THE KEY WORD TO THIS TRANSACTION IS ABSOLUTE CONFIDENTIALITY AND 
SECRECY. THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE. YOUR URGENT RESPONSE WILL BE 
HIGHLY

APPRECIATED.
