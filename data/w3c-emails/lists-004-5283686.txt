REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP- TRANSFER OF US$25,500,000.00

I am ENGR Ade Innocent a director in the project and planning 
department of the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA), I 
head a seven man Tenders Board Committee in charge of contract award 
and Payment approvals. I came to know of you in my 
search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very 
confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum 
of money to a foreign account.

There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of 
Multinationals in the power industry in favour of the (NEPA) among 
which were;

1) The expansion of Power line network within Nigeria for power 
distribution.
2) Contract for Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of various Gas Turbines 
in the country.

The original value of of these contracts were deliberately over 
invoiced in the sum of Twenty Five million, Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars (US$25,500,000.00) which has recently 
been approved and now ready to be transferred. 
However the companies that actually executed the aforementioned 
contract have been fully paid and the projects officially 
commissioned.

Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total 
amount into your account for subsequent disbursement, 
since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau 
(Civil Service Laws) from opening and/or operating 
foreign accounts in our names.

Needless to say, the trust reposed in you at this juncture is enormous. 
In return, we have agreed amongst ourselves to offer 
you 30% of the transferred sum, 5% shall be set aside for any 
incidental expenses during the course of this transaction, you 
will then be mandated to revert the balance to us in due course.

You must however NOTE that this transaction is subject to the follwing 
terms and conditions; our conviction of your transparent 
honesty and dilligence, that you must accord this transaction with 
utmost confidentiality and secrecy.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the Ministry 
of Finance, Central Bank of Nigeria and the Presidential 
Task Force on Contract Payment for the immediate remittance of the 
funds within 10 -14 working days subject to your 
satisfaction of the above terms. Our assurance is that your role shall 
be totally risk free . To accord this transaction the legality it 
deserves, and for mutual security of funds, the whole procedures shall 
be legally processed with your name or any company 
you may nominate as the bona fide final beneficiary.

Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 20years in 
the Civil Service of my country, I am very much averse to 
having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be 
treated with utmost secrecy and urgency. Kindly expedite 
immediate action as we are well behind schedule to enable us include 
this transfer in the Third batch of the 2003 fiscal year 
contract payments.

BEST REGARDS.

ENGR Ade Innocent.
