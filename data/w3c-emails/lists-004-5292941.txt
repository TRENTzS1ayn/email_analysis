Dear,

ATTENTION:

I am Barrister Jide Tiawo a Solicitor, I know it will come to you as a
surprise because we have not met either physically or through correspondence.
I am the Personal Attorney to Mr. Adams Victor a national of your country,
and a contractor here in Nigeria. On the 21st of April 2000, my client,
were involved in a car accident along Ibadan / Lagos Express Road.
Unfortunately they All lost their lives in the event of the accident, after
the several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over
the Internet to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence I
contacted you.

I plead for your assist in repatriating the money and property left behind
by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the
Apex Bank where these huge deposits were lodged. Particularly, the APEX
BANK where the deceased had an account valued at about US$8M (Eight Million
United Stated Dollars). Consequently, APEX BANK as issued me a notice to provide the next of kin
or have the account confiscated. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating
the relatives for over 2 years now. I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased, so
that the proceeds of this account valued at US$8MD can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10%
should be for expenses or tax as your government may require.

If you are interested to kindly forward immediately the following:
1. YOUR FULL NAME
2. CONTACT ADDRESS
3. PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER.
I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim
we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this
deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.
Please direct your reply through this Email Box immediately you receive
this proposal for more explanation on the inheritance.

Yours Faithfully,

Barrister Jide Tiawo (Esq.).
