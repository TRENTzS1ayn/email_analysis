provide the next of kin or have the account
confiscated. Since I have been unsuccesfull in
locating the the relatives for over 2 years now.

I seek your consent to present you as the next
 of kin
of the deceased since you are from the same country so
that the proceeds of this account valued at US$10.5MD
can be paid to you and then you and me can share the
money. 50% to me and 40% to you,while 10% should be
for expenses or tax as your government may require.

I have all necessary legal documents that can be used
to back up any claim we may make. All I require is
your honest cooperation to enable ussee this deal
through. I guarantee that this will be executed under
