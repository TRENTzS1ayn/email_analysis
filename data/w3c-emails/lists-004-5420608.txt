Dear 
  This mail may come to you as a surprise because we have not met but was born out of my sincere desire for assistance and to establish a business relationship with you.
 
    My name is Robins Jonathan ,the son of Chief Williams T.Jonathan (the former financial director of Sierra Leone national minning corporation)who was killed and mutilated by the military Junta led by major Foday Sankoh after overthrowing the elected government of president Tejan Kabar,though I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and disturbances in Sierra Leone but it has a consistent features in news bulletins.The pressure of war drove the rest of our family out of Sierra Leone into exile in Spain (Madrid) where we have been living under political asylum for one year now.
 
  Sadly,my mother died of cancer three months after our arrival but before her death,she handed over to me a certificate meant for a secret deposited trunk box which my father made in a Security Company in Madrid-Spain and she disclosed to me that the trunk box contains US10.600.000.00(ten million six hundred thousand United State DollarS).
 
   The money was paid to the minning corporation under him by its overseas customers in the heat of the war but he made the deposit in his name with the hope of converting it to his personal use at the end of the war but was killed when the conflict intensified as a result of his opposition to the rebel forces.I have contacted the security company to confirm the deposit and established ownership.
   Due to the death of my mother and the continued hostility in Sierra Leone I have decided to solicit for the assistance of an honest and trustworthy person that will assist me in the withdrawal of the trunk box for investment purposes.I cannot do it alone due to my present status and total ignorance in business and investment as I was in school before the outbreak of the war.
 
   You will be given a negotiable percentage of the money at the end of the transaction.If you are trustworthy and interested in the proposal,contact me immediatly for more details.You must maintain absolute confidentiality to ensure success also include your personal telephone number when replying.It is very important to note that during my fact finding mission to establish ownership of the subject matter,I decided here and now to write you this mail.I await your quick response.
 
Best Regards,
   Robins.
