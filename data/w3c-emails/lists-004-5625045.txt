Hello,
I am Hajia Mariam Abacha, the wife of Late General Sani Abacha,former
head of state of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Following the death
of my husband Gen.sani Abacha in 1998,I have been thrown into a state of
utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian
administration. I have been subjected to physical and psychological
torture by the security agents in this country.
I have lost confidence with anybody and everybody in this country.
You must have heard over the media and on the internet of the recovery
of various huge amount of money being deposited by my late husband in
different security firms abroad, some companies willing to give up the
secrets and disclose our money confidently lodged with them and many out
for blackmail.Infact, the total sum discovered by the government so far
is to the tune of $700 million US dollars and they are not relenting in
their effort to make me poor for life. I got your contact through my
personal research, and out of desperation decided to reach you. I will
give you more information regarding this issue as soon as you show some
response. I repose great confidence in you, hence my approaching you
through this means and due to the security network placed on my daily
affairs I cannot visit the embassy. I therefore decided to contact you
hoping you will not betray my confidence in you.
I have deposited the sum of 28.3 million dollars with a security firm
in abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I
shall be grateful if this fund could be transferred into your account
for safe keeping and later for investments. This arrangement is known to
you and my son Mustapha alone who has just been released by the
federal government. So my son will deal directly with you as security is
up my whole being.
I am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a friendly
atmosphere like yours as soon as this fund gets into your account so
that I can start all over again if only you would like the idea, but you
don't like the idea then please help me in diverting this fund into your
bank account which will accrue you 30% of this fund. Please, honesty is
the watch word in this transaction. I shall give you a more detailed
picture of the situation. Incase you don't accept this transaction
please do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this
information in total trust and confidence. I shall be grateful if you
accept my proposal in good faith. Please expedite action. Sincerely
yours,
Hajia Mariam Abacha.
