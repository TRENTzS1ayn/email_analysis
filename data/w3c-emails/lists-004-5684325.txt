>DEAREST FRIEND,
>
>Greetings to you and your family. I want you to read
>this mail with a compassionate heart and understanding
>that any action you take is geared towards rendering
>humanitarian assistance to a woman who is in distress with his family.
>My name is MRS JACKON ALLEN, a Liberian and former
>Deputy Minister of Information under former President
>Charles Taylor. I was his right hand assistant until a
>couple of weeks ago when I realised
>that my entire life was in utmost danger after the
>assassination of the Sports Minister
>in a helicopter crash. I was responsible for the
>diamond deals with the RUF rebel
>group of Sierra Leone. I was handling the diamond
>sales on behalf of President Taylor
>who in turn supplies ammunition to the rebels. This is
>what the international community
>and United Nations code-named: Conflict Diamond.
>It was while I was discharging this duty that I
>diverted the sum of US$ 30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million United States
>Dollars) for
>myself. I deposited the money contained in 2 trunk boxes in a
>Security Company as artifacts to avoid prying eyes and travelled back to
>my country where I continued with my duties. I informed
>President Taylor that the United Nations Mission in
>Sierra Leone (UNAMSL) seized the
>diamond consignment and made report to the United
>Nations. It was based on this diamond
>dealings involving President Taylor that the United
>Nations imposed sanctions on Liberia recently.
>My aim is to look for a trusted foreign partner outside to help me move
>the
>fund out for investment. It is based on my decision to
>move the fund out for investment
>that I am contacting you to assist me in taking the
>funds to your country .All you need do is to claim the 2 Boxes from the
>
>security company's headquarters in Europe and open a
>bank account through which the money will be lodged
>before transfer into your nominated Bank account.
>I am willing to compensate you with 20% of the total
>sum for your assistance and
>want to let you understand that the future of myself
>and family depends solely on this money .In this transaction
>confidentiality is
>very essential for us to achieve
>our goal. It is important that you maintain utmost
>good faith and trust .You must also not circumvent
>the transaction in any way.
>In conclusion I will like you to understand that you
>shall bear no risk whatsoeverin this business and as
>such there is nothing for you to be afraid of.I want you to
>provide your telephone , fax number and your residential or business address
>for direct communication and for the commencement of the procedures.

>Regards,
>Jackon Allen.
