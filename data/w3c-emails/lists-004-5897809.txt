have gone through all legal and lawful verifications and

should be used through an Excutor,for the benefit of less priviledge
children,support of war refugees all over the world and outreach

We are seeking your consent to present you as the next of kin of the
deceased, so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$15 can be
paid to you  as the next of kin to Mr lim and to invest it for the
purpose of helping the less priviledged in the society and evangelism
works.
