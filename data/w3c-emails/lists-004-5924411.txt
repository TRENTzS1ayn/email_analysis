Dear Friend/Partner,
Compliments of the day to you. Let me start by first introducing myself to you. I am Mallam Ibrahim Saleh, a native of Sokoto  in sokoto state of Nigeria, a Muslim, 39years old and married with 7 children.I am an accounts clerk in the accounts department of the habib  Bank of Nigeria Plc.I was recently transferred to our head office here in Lagos and after a month of carrying out my duties I discovered an abnormalcy in some foreign exchange transaction carried out by the former head of this department. It seem that the bank had some foreign exchange dealings on behalf of a company based in India for some texile machines purchased for an seismic firm carrying out operations in Portharcourt. The transaction was done and all parties satisfied, but after going through the papers I discovered an outstanding credit of nine million,seven hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars 
(US$9.750.000.00) left floating after it had originally supposed to be cleared with the total amount of Thirty Eight Million United States Dollars approved.
After I made this discovery, I quickly and discretely made some papers to cover up this deficit and put in papers to have it cleared out immediately to any account oversea. All that remains is particulars of either a firm or a reliable person to finalize the clearance of these funds. This where I need your immediate assistance, I am just an accounts 
clerk with a monthly salary of Forty Thousand Naira which is the equivalent  of Six hundred Dollars where in the world will I have this kind of  opportunity again. Let me assure you that this transaction will not  take
more than a week to finalize and since I and you are aware of it the are little of any likelihood of any mishap or exposure and as soon as it is done I will resign and start a any business of my choice. I am prepared to take suggestions and advice from you on how best this deal can be handled to ensure that we are all happy.i am proposing 20% as share to you once  we have successfuly  paid it into your account . Thus; 20% for you as partner 
and facilitator in getting the funds out, 80% for myself.
 Please reply back immediately on your preparedness to assist and be rest assured 
that as soon as the funds are safely in your account all documentation would be destroyed eradicating any trace whatsoever to your involvement. As I told you earlier all that I need is a name of a firm or your full  names, your contact address and your phone number so as to prepare the filling process.
Thanks in antiscipated co-operations.I look forward to receiving your prompt and favorably response, may the almighty Allah bless you and your family.
Regards,
Mallam Irahim Saleh.
