Dear Sir/Madam,

I am pleased to introduced myself humble self to you as Rtd General Salami Abubakar, I served under the regime of the late former head of state General Sani Abacha, as the chairman petroleum task force, as a close friend to the General, am giving freedom of anything in the country. So it was this time that I sold some seized crude oil to a Swiss oil merchant at the rate of eighty five million U.S Dollars ($85 million), Immediately after the transaction I lodged the fund into a diplomatic courier company.

Due to the problem some of the service cheifs and Rtd Generals that serves under the late general Sani Abacha are facing from the present democratic government under president Obasanjo ,we are placed under security surveillance and our local and international account were frozen, our property were being confiscated to the government property, as at now I can't travel out of the country because my international documents are seized by the state security.

Now my only hope of survival is the fund in Spain, which I need someone to entrust the fund with, who will utilize the fund in investment and banking, the fund should be invest into a well profitable investment, whoever is willing to assist will be given 10% of the fund, the person will presides and oversee the investment and the sources of the fund should be kept secret, my name must not in any way appear in anything concerning the fund for security reason. you can reach me through my email salamiabubakar@fsmail.net 

I urgently awaits your response.

Thanks.

Rtd General Salami Abubakar
