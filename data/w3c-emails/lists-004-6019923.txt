Did you respond to the e-mail from Johnson Ndiovu??  I got the same e-mail and did some investigating.  Here is what I uncovered:

A man claiming to be Johnston Ndiovu, the son of a murdered Zimbabwean
farmer, sent a telephone number in Holland, where he said he was living as
an asylum seeker. He maintained that Dutch laws on asylum prevented him
gaining access to the $12.5m he said his father had left at a security
company. 

"What I really need you to do is to send me your full name and details and
as soon as I have that we can change the ownership of the consignment to
your name," said 'Ndiovu'. "We can do this within seven days. All you have
to do is to make this confidential between you and I." 

'Ndiovu' became agitated when his proposed victim said he wanted to seek
his wife's advice. "I just want you alone to know. You know women,
sometimes they don't keep things secret," he said. 

The following day, 'Ndiovu' sent an official-looking form authorising the
change of ownership from his name. 

Just doing some investigating, and your e-mail came up under a search in Yahoo, for Johnson Ndiovu.
E-mail back if you want, just thought you should know.  CD
