FROM MRS AMINA MOHAMMED 
Attn:my beloved.
Greetings!!
I come to you with a sincere heart believing in
Almighty Allah that you will consider my plight and
come to help and also benefit from me. 
I am Mrs. Amina Mohammed, cousin and Personal
Assistant to former Nigeria Head of State, Late
General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th July 1998
while in power. 
Before I proceed please. accept my apology for the
embarrassment this mail might cause you for coming
from a total stranger who you do not know. Actually I
got your contact from the Internet; please do not feel
bad about it because I am compelled to reach you due
to urgentneed to safeguard the money in question. Once
again, forgive me and cometo my aid. 
Please read the following carefully. 
Sometime in early 1997, my boss late Gen. Sanni Abacha
entrusted to me the sum of US$20.5M in cash (Twenty
million, five hundred thousand USdollars) due to the
trust and confidence he had in me. This money was
meantfor campaign in his self-succession bid but
unfortunately he suddenlydied befor actualization of
his aspiration. This amount of $20.5M in CASH was
deposited with a security company which I will
disclose in subsequent mail in a giant trunk box as
diplomatic consignments In agreement with Mr.Mohammed
Abacha who is the son of late General Abacha and the
heir to themoney. 
I write to solicit your assistance for the money to be
transferred to your custody. Note that Mr.Mohammed
Abacha is currently in detention by the present
Nigeria Government for reasons linked to activities of
his father when he was in power. Now based on the
business trust I have on you, I would want you to come
forward and receive this consignment containing the
money in cash on our behalf from the security company
for subsequent disbursement between you and us.
Understand that we are soliciting your assistance
because the present Nigerian Government is
seizing/freezing any Bank Account or valuables
belonging to the late Head of state'sfamily and
relatives. In fact we do not have enough money now to
sustain ourfamily so, I will appreciate if you can
consider our plight and assist us. For your
assistance, we have agreed to compensate you with 20%
of thetotal amount ($20.5) while the remaining 80% is
for us. We hope to investpart of our sharein your
country on viable area of investment as you may advise
us. 
If you are interested you will need to visit the
security Company for clearance of the consignment. I
assure you that the transaction is 100%risk free. 
Please I implore you to keep this transaction
absolutely secret against negative exposure. I would
want you to contact me mmediately  so that we can
proceed with the business. You should please on reply
enclose your private telephone, fax number so that we
can have more confidential correspondence. 
Best regards, 
MRS.AMINA MOHAMMED
PLEASE TREAT WITH DISPATCH
