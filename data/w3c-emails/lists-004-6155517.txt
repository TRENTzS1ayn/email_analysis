On the 21st April 2002. My client, his wife and their three children were involved In a ghastly motor accident along Badagry Express Road. Unfortunately, All the occupants in the vehicle lost their lives. my client was a successful and an accomplished family man, who made enough fortune before his untimely death. 
Since then I had made several inquiries through your Embassy to locate any of my clients extended relative but this exercise has proved unsuccessful. After several unsuccessful attempts. I decided to trace his relatives through the Internet, to locate any member of his family not much progress was recorded. Coincidentally,I came across your name and to my surprise, you bear a similar surname with my client. By virtue of my closeness to the deceased and his immediate family, I am very much aware of my client financial standing and the bank account he operates. I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client, so that you can be paid the funds left in his bank account, hence I contacted you. I am offering you this opportunity by contacting you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the
  Bank where this huge Deposits were lodged. This Investment Banking corp where the Deceased had an Account is valued at about Ten Million,Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars as at last month assessment. 
The Bank has issued me a notice as the Attorney to the Deceased to provide the Next of Kin or have the Account confiscated within the Next Ten official working days since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 years that I have been searching, I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin or family member to the Deceased since you are at an advantage, bearing the same surname and equally from the same country, so that the proceeds of this Bank Account valued at $10.5 Million Dollars can be paid to you. we shall both share the funds,35% to you and 60% to me, while 2% should be for Expenses and 3% to charitable organizations.I have all the necessary Legal Documents that will be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law.
