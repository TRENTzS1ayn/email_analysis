FROM. IDRIS AHMED.
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.
FOREIGN OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT.
BANQUE TOGOLAISE POUR LE COMMERCE ET L'INDUSTRIE,
LOME- TOGO.
I am IDRIS AHMED, a worker in charge of auditing and accounting section 
of 
Banque Togolaise Pour Le Commerce Et L'Industrie Lome-Togo in West 
Africa 
with due respect and regard. After viewing your impressive profile 
couple 
with your age I have decided to contact you  on a business transaction 
that 
will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.We 
had a 
foreign client Mr John Schelpert who deposited a huge sum of money 
(US$27.5million) with our bank.Eventually, this client was among the 
victims 
of EGYPT AIR BOEING 767 FLIGHT NO.990 that crashed on the 31-10-1999 in 
U.S.A but, since then we have not had any body coming for the claims as 
the 
next of kin. A sitaution I have monitored closely with my position in 
the 
bank.
Now, having monitored this deposit and managed it over the years before 
his 
death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past 
three 
years plus, I have removed the file to my private volt. I now solicit 
for 
your assistance to present you as the next of kin as every other 
arrangement 
has being concluded by me and I am only waiting for a foreigner to 
enable me 
move the fund to his account. This does not have any risk attached to it
 as 
all the internal documentations will be handled by me. I therefore 
request 
you to confirm your interest by a return message and I will furnish you 
with 
details.
Your interest will be negotiable before we commence the operation.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Regards
Yours partner to be
IDRIS AHMED.
