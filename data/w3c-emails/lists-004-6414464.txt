NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM COOPERATION
(NNPC) COMPLEX FALOMO-IKOYI
LAGOS
Attn:CEO,
I take liberty anchored on a strong desire to establish a bussiness relationship. Greeting to you. I am a top goverment official in my country,
and a decision taking member of our Contract Review Committee. By virtue of this Position and present opportunity, I require your assistance if you will
consent, to assist me in transfering a sizeable amount of money into a foreign account. I have cleverly mapped out a foolproof plan to enable us transfer about $32,500,000 (Thirty two Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars)into a foreign account and same can not be traced to you by our goverment should they decide to probe. Your share for assisting me will be 30%, and please be assured that you do not face any risks at all, as all Ministries and Parastatals
here,have tremendous respect for foreign Contractors and Investors, besides I shall legitimately register you here as a Contractor and afterwards arrange to withdraw your file as soon as the funds have been deposited in your account.
I intend to travel down to meet with you ahead of the Funds to discuss investment plans and other viable businesses that you may suggest.I am believing I can trust you. You can send me an e-mailfor further information. You should also
let me know your current telephone and fax numbers in your response so that I can give you more verbal details.
My Sincere Regards,
sanusi.
