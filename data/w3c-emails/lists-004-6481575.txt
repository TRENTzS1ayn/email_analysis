Dear Sir, 
 
I am George Nwanze, Personal Assistant to President Charles Taylor, the former President of Liberia. As you may know he has recently stepped down from power and is presently in assylum in Nigeria. The purpose of my letter is to ask if you can render the assistance requested and to bring to bear my present position and the very need for true and solicited help with respect to Ex President Taylor. 
 
View these websites carefully:
http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/08/11/taylor.warcrimes/index.html http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/08/11/liberia.1300/index.html 
 
Your assistance is needed in the sense that some funds derived from Diamond sales during his tenure needs to be transferred/moved from its present location to a place or an account that you may hopefully provide or arrange. The reason for this is that plans are underway to confiscate not only his known fixed assets but also liquid assets. 
 
I have been mandated to seek and find a reliable person, based overseas, that is disposed in helping to secure some or all of the funds in question. 
 
If you are that person, do respond to this letter. Otherwise no offence meant. 
This is my Private e-mail:georgenwanze@katamail.com

Sincerely yours, 
 
George Nwanze
P.A. President Taylor
