DEAR SIR,

I am Dr. Mrs. Mariam Abacha, wife of the Late Nigerian Head of
State,Gereral Sani Abacha who died on 8th of June 1998 while still on
duty.I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great
assistance to each other like wise developing acordial business
relationship.

I currently have the sum of thirty Million United States Dollars
(US$30,000,000) cash, which I intend to use for investment purposes
specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal
between my late husband and Russian firm on our countrys Multi-Billion
Dollar Ajaokuta Steel Plant.

The Russian partner returned my husbands share of US$30,000,000.00 USD
after the death of my husband and lodged it with a finance company in
Europe of which I am the Beneficiary. Right now the new civilian
government have intensified their probe on my husbands financial
resources and they revoked our licenses that allows us to own a financial
and Oil Company. I have since declared myself and my family Bankruptcy.
No record ever existed concerning the money neither the money tranceable
by the  Government because there is no documentation showing that we
received the money from the Russians. Due to the current situation in
the  country and government attitude towards my family, it has become
quite impossible for me to make use of this money within, and outside
especially in Europe as the European government has been assisting our
government in the tracing of any of our bank accounts oversea, hence my
movement is restricted by the government now.

Thus I seek assistance to transfer this money out of this account to a non
traceable and safe account designation through our family representative
BARRISTER ALI KALOMA, (SAN) To enable us discuss in details about
this transaction please contact him on e-mail as indicated above.

WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO

I will transfer the ownership of the money and issue you a power of attorney
through my Lawyer. With these document you will present to the bank for
claiming the money as my proxy from the finance company in Europe.
The entire operation is risk free since it is only you and me and my Lawyer
that knows the details of the money.

After you must have transfer the money to your country where it is save my
Lawyer will then meet you in your country to use my share of the money
for investment. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to
transfer this fund, I propose a commission of 30% (Thirty Persent) of the
total sum to you for the expected services and assistance.Your urgent
response is highly needed so as to stop futher contact. All
correspondence must be by e-mail I must use this opportunity to implore
you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily
confidential whatever your decision while I await your prompt
response.

Regards,
DR. (MRS.) MARIAM ABACHA
