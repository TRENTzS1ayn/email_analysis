RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.


I am DR.AHMED MANSUR., Chairman to the Contract Review Panel that was recently inaugurated by the President of the Federal Republic of 
Nigeria to review the activities of past military government with 
particular reference to contracts awarded by all ministries between 
1990 to 1999. In the course of carrying out our assigned duties, we 
discovered the sum of USD40.5M (forty million, five hundred thousand 
dollars) only lying idle in a suspense account with our apex bank. This funds emanated from grossly over-invoiced contracts awarded to  conglomerate of foreign firms by the Petroleum Ministry on behalf of  the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. On completion of our 
assignment, this amount was deliberately not included in our report 
because we want to capitalize on this once in a lifetime opportunity to benefit and make a fortune out of it. The only option we have to  achieve our aims and objective is to have this fund transferred to a country of our choice where it can be kept in trust and safe custody 
for us. We are however handicapped at the moment by our status as civil servants, which barred us from operating foreign accounts while still in government service.

Thus, through some discreet inquiries from our Chambers of Commerce, 
you and your organization were revealed as being quite astute in 
private entrepreneurship. On this premise, we have no doubt in your 
ability to handle a business of this nature, which informed our desire 
and wish to enter into a partnership with you. This business involves 
the remittance of this amount into your bank account with the hope of 
travelling down to meet you physically in order to receive our share. 
We hope to invest some in profitable ventures in your country based on 
your advise while the balance will be repatriated home as foreign 
earnings. 

We have mapped out strategies and all paperwork is in place 
to ensure a 100% success.The nature of your business at present does not really matter because in the world over, bigger firms do bid for big contracts especially in third world countries like ours and can subcontract part of it to other firms for execution. That is you or your firm will be regarded as one of those that executed one of such projects and therefore entitled to receive the over-invoiced amount of the contract value since the original contractor has been paid. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free as there is actually no risk is involved either now or in the future for we are well connected in official circle. Given our level of commitment at the moment, we want to assure you that with full dedication on your part, the objective of having this fund remitted would have been realized within a period of two weeks. 

It is hereby expressly agreed in principle that at the end of the transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire sum, 75% will be for my colleagues and I.If you are interested in this proposal, please for confidential reasons respond to my private email address:ahmansur@tiscali.co.uk or to my tel/fax number as specified above for more clarifications. If however you are not interested, still let me know to enable me search for someone else to carry out this business with.

I anticipate a timely response from you.

Thanks.

Yours Sincerely,


DR.AHMED MANSUR.
