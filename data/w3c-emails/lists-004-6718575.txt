Have you heard of the man called JESUS,he is the way the truth and the light,why don't you try Him.He has the answer to your problems.We invite you to to make JESUS CHRIST THE LORD of your life by praying this prayer thus:

"O LORD GOD,I come to you in the name of Jesus Christ.Your Word says ,"whoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved"(Acts 2:21)I ask that you forgive me all my sins and I promise to walk according to your ways.
I ask Jesus to come into my heart to be the Lord of my life.I receive eternal life into my spirit and according to Romans 10:9,"That if you shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus Christ, and shall believe with thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shall be saved,"I declare that I am saved;I am born-again;I am a child of God! I now walk in the consciousness of my new life in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah!"
