                                                       Urgent Business Proposal 


Dear Sir 

I am writing to you representing the king from the kingdom of Swaziland. My  Name is Ms Diane Sibusiso Dlamini, Sister of King Mswati and daughter of the  late King Sibiza. Last year my brother, the king chose an eigth wife the  age of 17 but due to pressure from our citizens and government the wedding  did not take place and instead my brother had to pay a fine of a cow to appease his people. This was very humiliaiting to our family as the Royal Family still rules in our country. 

This situation represents the threat that has come to the exsistence of the Royal Family of Swaziland. Due to this problem we came to the realisation  that our family heritage has to remain in the hands of its rightful owners. My brother has now given me the sum of USD $15,500,000 MILLION to invest abroad in the intrest of him. 

I am currently residing in Madrid,Spain and I on behalf of my brother am looking for a reliable person to help me invest this fortune. Unfortunatly I do not have any friends and it is the first time I have travelled outside my country I would be grateful for your assistence, if you decide to assiste me in this matter I will give 15% of the total amount mentioned above. 

If you are intrested in this issue please notify me on the following e-mail: dianedlamini@netscape.net with your contact telephone number so that I can explain better. 

Yours Sincerely 

H.R.H.

Diane Sibusiso Dlamini
