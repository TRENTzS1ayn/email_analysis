RC.27199


Dear Sir,

STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL

I am DR.SANNI YAKUKBU, The manager, Bills and Exchange at the Foreign
Remittance Department of the A.D.B Bank of Nigeria Plc. I am writing this
letter to ask for your support and cooperation to carry out this business
opportunity in my department. We discovered an abandoned sum of $15,000,000M
USDOLLARS (15 million United States Dollars only) in an account that belongs
to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family of a
wife and two children in November 1999 in a Plane crash.

Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come
over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot release the
fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to
the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately, neither
their family member nor distant relative has everappeared to claim the said
fund. Upon this discovery, I and other officials in my department have
agreed to make business with you and release the total amount into your
account as the heir of the fund since no one came for it or discovered he
maintained account with our bank, otherwise the fund will be returned to the
banks treasury as unclaimed fund.

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus;

20 % for you as foreign partner,
75 % for us the officials in my department and
5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign
expences incurred by us and you during the course of
this business.

Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one of my colleagues
will come to your country and mind our share. It is from our 75 % we intend
to
import Agricultural Machineries into my country as a way of recycling the
fund. To commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate
your interest by a return e-mail and enclose your private contact telephone
number, fax number full name and address and your designated bank
coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments
for necessary approvals before the transfer can be made.

Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of
its nature.

I look forward to receiving your prompt response.

DR.SANNI YAKUBU.
