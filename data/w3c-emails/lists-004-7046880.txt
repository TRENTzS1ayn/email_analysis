DR. MUSA   ADAMU 
ORIENT BANK (NIG) LTD. IDUMOTA
234_8033571070
LAGOS-NIGERIA.

DEAR SIR,
I AM DR. MUSA  ADAMU  BANK MANAGER OF ORIENT BANK OF
NIGERIA LAGOS BRANCH. I HAVE URGENT AND VERY
CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PPROPOSITION FOR YOU.
ON JUNE 6TH, 1997, A CANADIAN OIL CONSULTANT /
CONTRACTOR WITH THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM
COPORATION, MR, BARRY KELLY MADE A NUMBERED TIME (FIX)
DEPOSIT FOR TWELVE CALENDAR MONTHS VALUED AT US$25,
000, 000.00. (TWENTY ? FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES
DOLLARS) IN MY BRANCH. UPON MATURITY I SENT A ROUTINE
NOTIFICATION TO HIS FORWARDING ADDRESS BUT GOT NO
REPLY. AFTER A MONTH, WE SENT A REMINDER AND FINALY WE
DISCOVERED FROM HIS CONTRACT EMPLOYERS, THE NIGERIAN
NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION THAT MR, BARRY KELLY
DIED FROM AN AUTO MOBILE ACCEDENT. ON FURTHER
INVESTIGATION, I FIND OUT THAT HE DIED WITHOUT MAKING A
WILL, AND ALL ATTEMPTS TO TRACE HIS NEXT OF KIN WAS
FRUITLESS.
I THEREFORE MADE FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND DISCOVERED
THAT MR, BARRY KELLY DID NOT DECLARE ANY KIN OR
RELATIONS IN ALL HIS OFFICAIL DOCUMENTS INCLUDING HIS
BANK DEPOSIT PAPER WORK IN MY BANK. THIS SUM OF
US$25,000,000.00. IS STILL SITTING IN MY BANK AND THE
INTEREST IS BEING ROLED OVER WITH THE PRINCIPAL SUM AT
THE END OF EACH YEAR. NO ONE WILL EVER COME FORWARD TO
CLAIM IT. ACCORDING TO NIGERIAN LAW, AT THE EXPIRATION
OF 5(FIVE) YEARS, THE MONEY WILL REVERT TO THE
OWNERSHIP OF THE NIGERIAN GORVERNMENT IF NOBODY APPLIES
TO CLAIM THE FUND.
CONSEQUENTLY, MY PROPOSAL IS THAT I WILL LIKE YOU AS A
FOREIGNER TO STAND IN AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO MR, BARRY
KELLY SO THAT THE FRUITS OF THIS OLD MAN?S LABOUR WILL
NOT GET INTO THE HANDS OF SOME CORRUPT GORVERNMENT
OFFICALS. THIS IS SIMPLE, I WILL LIKE YOU TO PROVIDE
IMMEDIATELY YOUR FULL NAMES AND ADDRESS SO THAT THE
ATTORNEY WILL PREPARE THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS AND
AFFIDAVITS WHICH WILL PUT YOU IN PLACE AS THE NEXT OF
KIN. WE SHALL EMPLOY THE SERVICE OF TWO ATTORNEY FOR
DRAFTING AND NOTARIZATION OF THE WILL AND TO OBTAIN THE
NECESSARY DOCUMENTS AND LETER OF PROBATE/
ADMINISTRATION IN YOUR FAVOUR FOR THE TRANSFER. A BANK
ACCOUNT IN ANY PART OF THE WORLD WHICH YOU WILL PROVIDE
WILL THEN FACILITATE THE TRANSFER OF THIS MONEY TO YOU
AS THE BENEFICAIRY/ NEXT OF KIN. THE MONEY WILL BE PAID
INTO YOUR ACCOUNT FOR US TO SHARE IN THE RATIO OF 60%
FOR ME AND 40% FOR YOU.
THERE IS NO RISK ATALL AS ALL THE PAPER WORK FOR THIS
TRANSACTION WILL BE DONE BY THE ATTORNEY AND MY
POSITION AS THE BRANCH MANAGER GUARANTEES THE
SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF THIS TRANSACTION. IF YOU ARE
INTERESTED, PLEASE REPLY IMMEDIATELY VIA THE PRIVATE
EMAIL ADDRESS BELLOW. YOU CAN ALSO REPLY VIA MY PRIVATE
FAX NUMBER OR YOU CALL ME ON MY PRIVATE TELEPHONE
NUMBER : 234-8033571070 UPON YOUR RESPONSE, I SHALL
THEN PROVIDE YOU WITH MORE DETAILS AND RELEVANT
DOCUMENTS THAT WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THE TRANSACTION.
PLEASE OBSERVE UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY, AND REST ASSURED
THAT THIS TRANSACTION WILL BE MOST PROFITABLE FOR BOTH
OF US BECAUSE I SHALL REQUIRE YOUR ASSISTANCE TO INVEST
MY SHARE IN YOUR COUNTRY.
AWAITING YOUR URGENT REPLY VIA EMAIL OR THROUGH MY
PRIVATE PHONE NUMBER.
THANKS AND REGARDS.
DR. MUSA  ADAMU
