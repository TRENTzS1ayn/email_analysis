Dear Sir,

I am Jean Wayne,  from Liberia, I am a cousin and defence adviser to former Liberian President Mr. Charles Taylor. During the hit of the war in Liberia, President Charles Taylor gave me a box containing cash of US$12,8M ( Twelve Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only) to buy arms and ammunitions for his soldiers. 
I could not buy the ammunitions because I wanted no more wars in Liberia, I therefore  moved the box containing the money out of Liberia through diplomatic immunity to a Security company in Spain, where I deposited the box as family treasure, just for security reasons. 

Now that everything is over, Taylor has finally settled in Nigeria, I have decided to move this money to your country for safety reasons and investments with your assistance. Be rest assured that this transaction is risk free as no person is aware of the money. 

You will be compensated with 25% of the total sum, if you agree to assist me receive this money in your country. 

I am expecting your urgent reply via jean_2003@zwallet.com or better you can contact the Manager  of the security company in Spain where the Consignment is deposited, He is Mr. Bob Harry, Tel number + 34 690 078 641 for more details. 

To confirm this, kindly visit this report; http://allafrica.com/stories/200309190413.html  

Thanks,

Jean Wayne
