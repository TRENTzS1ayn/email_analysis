Dear Sir/Madam, 

I wish to introduce our company PETER IGHO & CO. a 
consultant firm . 
I am writing you in respect of our client that was 
brought to my firm for professional advice and 
directives. 
Our client Mrs. MATILDA HUBERT a widow to one late 
COL. RODRIGUE HUBERT former Paymaster General of 
Ecomog ( A PEACEKEEPING MILITARY ORGANISATION WITHIN 
THE WEST-AFRICA SUBREGION) came to my office 
in-respect of her late husband?s money which is under 
deposit with a security. 
To the knitty-gritty of the matter, the woman (Mrs. 
MALTIDA HUBERT) got to know about the deposit with the 
Security Company when the family lawyer read her late 
husband?s will. The total amount involved happens to 
be USD18.5 million. 
The problem is that in her late husband?s will, an 
instruction was given that before she can lay hand on 
a cent from the money deposited with the security 
company, she must personally present a competent and 
reliable foreign Manager/Investor to whom the USD18.5 
million should be released to for onward investment 
purposes because she had been a full time housewife 
all through her married life and as such has no 
experience in financial management matters. 
From the discussions I held with her, I discovered she 
is interested in buying a good house to live with her 
three children . Under this circumstances I deem it 
fit that you can be of assistance to her, because I 
have the believe you can capably handle this 
transaction without any mistake as this is the only 
hope the woman has left in this world. 
Looking forward to your prompt reply. 
Yours faithfully, 
PETER IGHO
Principal Partner
