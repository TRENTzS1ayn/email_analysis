From: Mrs. Mariam Abacha

Dear Sir,

STRICTLY URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL

I am MRS. MARIAM ABACHA. Widow to the Former Military Head of State 
Late General Sani Abacha, who died suddenly as a result of Cardiac Arrest on 8th of June, 1998.One early morning, I was called by my Late Husband General Sani Abacha, who at that time was the Chief
in commander of the Army and the president of Nigeria. He conducted me round the apartment and showed me three metals boxes of money all in Foreign Exchange, my husband told me he was
to use the money for the settlement of his personal Royal Guards on his self succession Bidand campaigns.
Upon his tragic and unexpected death, the new civilian Government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, has insisted on probing my family's financial resources and has gazette all our
properties, also they recently seized all the known family's fund abroad with the assistance of the British Government. It is only this money S$80,000,000.00 
(Eighty Million US Dollars only) that he deposited
with a security company vault in Holland, that they can not trace because the fund was deposited as ANTIQUITY African Art Work from the National Commission for Museum and Monuments
(N. C. M. M.) Nigeria,the family intends to use this money for investment purpose to enable the family start life all over again. Therefore, the family urgently in need of a "very competent and investor participant" that we could entrust with the Certificate of Deposit and(PIN) PersonalIdentification Number Code to help us remove the funds from the security company " Since no names were used in securing the vault.
I got your contact address and name from our Chamber of Commerce, in Lagos - Nigeria, if the proposal is acceptable to you, after getting
the money out from the security company vault to your country, my family have agreed to offer to you 30% of the total sum for the kind assistance you rendered to us. And in addition bank
the family's own part of the funds and assist us in investing (with my approval on project)as a front for us until the situation becomes more
favourable for us to now meet and discuss the way forward, most especially now that my elder son, Mohammed Abacha and I are under pressure from the Government, despite the fact that my family had
already returned the sum of US$3 Billion from my Late husband's Account in the U.S.A. Europe and other countries.
Please kindly state your early response immediately so that you will be given more details on the logistics and modalities by my agent Mr.lawal Alli ,if you are interested in a "Working partnership we can arrange a meeting in Holland at the Security Company. I have to use this man as my agent because the Government of Nigeria is still monitoring my communication and movement.

NOTE: I do not need to remind you of the absolute secrecy and confidentiality that this transaction demands. You are free to speak directly with my agent on Phone as his number will be given to you as soon as you show your interest,and you will have to
