Dear Friend,
Before I start,I must first Apologies for this unsolicited mail to you.Iam
aware that this is certainly an unconventional approach to starting a relationship
but as time goes on you will realize the need for my action.

My name is Barrister Buba Moha a Solicitor and the personal Attorney to
Mr John Steiner,an American who worked with an Oil company in Nigeria.Here
in after referred to as my Client.On the 21st of April 1999,my client,his
wife and their three children were involved in a Ghastly motor accident
along Sagamu Express road.My Client and his entire family unfortunately
lost their lives in the accident.Since then I have made several enquiries
to your Embassy to locate any of my Client's extended relatives which has
proved abortive.

My main reason for contacting you is to assist me in repatriating the money
and properties left behind by my Client before they are confiscated or declared
unservicable by the bank where they are deposited and lodged.Particularly
the Union Bank PLC where the deceased has a fixed sum of Four Million United
States Dollars.The said bank has issued me a final notice to provide the
next of kin of my Client or they will be left with no other choice than
to confiscate his funds.Since I have been unsuccessful in locating my clients
relatives for the past two years I seek your consent to present you as the
next of kin of my client, so that the said fund as stated above i.e the
sum of Four million United States Dollars can be paid to you instead of
leaving for it for Union Bank Plc,we can take part of it and leave the rest
for Charity.I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back
up any claim we may make.All I require is your honest co-operation to enable
us see this arrangement through.I guarantee that this will be executed under
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law
and l will give you 20% of the total fund for your assistance then 5% for
the charity also 5% for reimbursment of expenses incurred during the transaction
while l used 70% for investment in your country.Please reply by this email
address above.

Finally kindly give me your confidential Phone and fax numbers so that I
can communicate with you easily.

Best regards,

Barrister Buba Moha
