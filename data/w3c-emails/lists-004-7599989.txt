Dear Sir/Madam, 

It is indeed my pleasure to write to you this letter, which I believe 
will be 
a suprise, as we are both complete strangers. My name is Mr Segun 
Agbaje, the 
Deputy Managing Director of COMMERICAL BANK OF AFRICA. I am writing in 
respect 
of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t 
who 
perished in a plane crash Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole 
passengers 
aboard on August 6, 1997. Since the demise of this 
our customer,I personally has watched with keen interest to see the 
next of 
kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds 
of 
USD.28.5m,[twenty eight million five hundred thousand united states 
dollars] 
which has been with my branch for a very long time. 

On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the 
next of 
kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics 
here 
does not allow such money to stay more than Six years, because money 
will be 
recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view 
of this 
I got your contact through a trade journal after realizing that your 
country 
is similar to the deceased. I will give you 15% of the total. 

Upon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the 
application, bank's fax number and the next step to take. I will not 
fail to 
bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you 
should not 
entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized 
within 
five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a
relation to the deceased. 

When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail to my private 
mail box, 
signifying your decision.Including your private Tel/Fax numbers for 
quick 
communication. 

Respectfully submitted, 

Mr Segun Agbaje
