URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL: 


DEAR SIR, 

Re:Transfer of $22,000.000.00 USD(TWENTY TWO MILLION UNITED 
STATES DOLLARS). 

WE WANT TO TRANSFER TO OVERSEAS($22,000.000.00TWENTY TWO MILLION UNITED 
STATES DOLLARS)FROM A SECURITY COMPANY IN SPAIN,I WANT TO ASK YOU TO 
QUIETLY LOOK FOR A RELIABLE AND HONEST PERSON WHO WILL BE CAPABLE AND FIT 
TO PROVIDE EITHER AN EXISTING BANK ACCOUNT OR TO SET UP A NEW BANK 
ACCOUNT IMMEDIATELY TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY,EVEN AN EMPTY ACCOUNT CAN SERVE 
TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY,AS LONG AS YOU WILL REMAIN HONEST TO ME TILL THE 
END OF THIS IMPORTANT BUSINESS TRANSACTION.I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT YOU 
WILL NEVER LET ME DOWN EITHER NOW OR IN FUTURE. 

I AM DR.USMAN MUHAMMED,THE AUDITOR GENERAL OF ONE OF THE SECURITY COMPANY. 
IN MADRID SPAIN DURING THE COURSE OF OUR AUDITING,I DISCOVERED 

FLOATING FUND IN AN ACCOUNT OPENED IN THE SECURITY COMPANY IN 1994 AND 
SINCE 1999 NOBODY HAS OPERATED ON THIS ACCOUNT AGAIN, AFTER GOING 
THROUGH SOME OLD FILES IN THE RECORDS I DISCOVERED THAT THE OWNER OF THE 
ACCOUNT DIED WITHOUT A HEIR HENCE THE MONEY IS FLOATING AND IF I DO NOT 
REMIT THIS MONEY OUT URGENTLY,IT WILL BE FORFEITED FOR NOTHING. 

THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT WAS "MR.ALLAN P. SEAMAN",A FOREIGNER AND AN 
INDUSTRIALIST,AND HE DIED SINCE 1999 AND NO OTHER PERSON KNOWS ABOUT 
THIS ACCOUNT OR ANYTHING CONCERNING IT,THE ACCOUNT HAS NO BENEFICIARY AND 
MY INVESTIGATION PROVED TO ME AS WELL THAT ALLAN.P SEAMAN UNTILL HIS 
DEATH WAS THE MANAGER DIAMOND SAFARI(PTY). 

WE WILL START THE FIRST TRANSFER WITH $10 MILLION DOLLARS[TEN MILLION 
DOLLARS]UPON SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER WITHOUT ANY DISAPPOINTMENT FROM YOUR 
SIDE,WE SHALL RE-APPLY FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE REMAINING $12 MILLION USA 
DOLLARS[TWELVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS]INTO YOUR ACCOUNT BRINGING 
THE SUM TOTAL TO $22,000.000.00(TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS). 

I AM CONTACTING YOU AS A FOREIGNER BECAUSE THIS MONEY CAN ONLY BE 
APPROVED TO A FOREIGNER WITH VALID INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT,DRIVERS LICENCE 
AND FOREIGN ACCOUNT BECAUSE THE MONEY IS IN USA DOLLARS AND THE FORMER 
OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT"MR.ALLAN P.SEAMAN IS A FOREIGNER.I WILL LIKE US TO 
MEET FACE TO FACE TO SIGN A BINDING AGREEMENT THAT WILL BIND US TOGETHER 
IN THE BUSINESS,I AM REVEALING ALL THESE TO YOU WITH THE BELIEF THAT 
YOU WILL NEVER LET ME DOWN IN THIS 
BUSINESS,YOU ARE THE FIRST AND ONLY PERSON I AM CONTACTING FOR THE 
BUSINESS,SO PLEASE REPLYURGENTLY FOR ME TO TELL YOU THE NEXT STEP TO 
TAKE.YOU SHOULD FORWARD YOUR TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS AND YOUR BANK ACCOUNT 
DETAILS THAT WILL BE USED IN TRANSFERING THE MONEY. 

YOU WILL HAVE TO GIVE ME THE ASSURANCE WHEN WE MEET THAT THIS MONEY 
WILL BE INTACT PENDING OUR PHYSICAL ARRIVAL IN YOUR COUNTRY FOR SHARING 
AND DISBURSEMENT OF THE FUND WHICH WILL BE 30% FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE,65% 
WILL BE FOR US WHILE 5% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THE 
EXPENSES THAT WILL BE INCURRED BY BOTH PARTIES DURING THE COURSE OF THE 
TRANSFER. 

I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR EARLIEST RESPONSE,ALL CORRESPONDENCE FOR NOW 
SHOULD BE EMAIL FOR SECURITY REASONS.AND MAY ALLA BLESS YOU. 



SINCERELY,

DR.USMAN MUHAMMED
