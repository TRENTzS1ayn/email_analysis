Airline plane crash.Ever since we got information
about his death,we have been expecting his next of kin
to come over and claim his money because we cannot
release it unless somebody applied for it in the
person of next of kin or relation to the deceased as
stipulated in our banking rules and
regulations,but,unfortunately till date of writting
this mail to you,nobody has come forward to claim the
