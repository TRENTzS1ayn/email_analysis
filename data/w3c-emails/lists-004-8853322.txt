Greetings to you my dear friend,
I am Dr. (Mrs.)Doyin Abiola married to late [Chief M.K.O.Abiola] of Nigeria.
I wish to propose a business involving huge sums of money, which hopefully will be of mutual benefit to both parties on successful completion.
In retrospect, my late husband was Nigeria's foremost politician,businessman and 
philantropist.I sincerely need your assistance to take custodian of huge sum of money,but I want you to bear in mind this has to be strictly confidential. After the Presidential Election campaign, my late husband [Chief M.K.O.Abiola] withdrew some of his from Nigeria banks and changed them to America dollars which he deposited as consignment with a private security company in oversease for safe keeping with an opened beneficiary stating that the consignment money belongs to the family. 
After his death in the year 1998, there was confusion in the entire Abiola's family as regards sharing of the family assets and moreso, there is envy and jealousy as it was obvious that I was my husband's favourite wife,while he was alive. As soon as he passed away, coupled with the fact that, what I have and what is due to me might be taking away from me by greedy family relations whose reasons would be bothering on family tradition and ethics. Now I am therefore asking you to come to my aid in getting this money from  the security company and for a possible onward investment. I should have contaced other members of the family but I'm afraid of doing so because of the way widows are being treated in some African countries. they are often dispossed of their husband's properties without a recourse to   the right of the woman and the children left behind by the deceased. 
My son, Jimola Abiola is my only son and we share secrets, he stays far away from the family Villa who is just 15 years old. He is a manior and therefore not complete to enter any lagal contract with the security company. 
I will appreciate if you will kindly assist me and my immediate family on this matter,if I may say I'm interested to invest in any good investment that would yied quick turn over but I wish to do a joint partnership with you since I have no any experience on such of if possible, just kindly help me to accomodate this money in  your account while I give you a handsome persentage( say 20% ) of the total sumat the successful completion of the transaction.I would advise that this matter be treated in capsule.
You will be adequately compensated for this. Please do get in touch with me urgently on receipt of this mail through my Email address below doyin_abiola@tiscali.co.uk

Thanks and remain bleesed,
Sister Doyin Abiola
