Hi,

How are you sir or madam. I found your email while searching the internet
for Grand Canyon Lottery. I think that you know this name as it seems that
they sent you the same email they sent to me saying that you won 5 million
dollars, could we cooperate in that to know if these people are true or
liars, could you tell me what happened with you, what did they ask from you
or whether you took the money or not.

looking forward to hear from you soon.

thanks and best regards.
