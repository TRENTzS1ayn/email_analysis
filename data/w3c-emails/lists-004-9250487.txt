Dear Sir, 
   Although we have not met, but was borne out of my sincere desire for assistance and to establish a business relationship with you. 
 
 My name is Joyce.T. Lamar,the wife of Chief Williams .T. Lamar(the former financial Director of Sierra Leone national minning corporation) who was killed and mutilated by the military junta led by Major Foday Sankoh after overthrowing the elected government of President Tejan Kabah, though I do not know to what extent you are familiar with this events and disturbances in Sierra Leone but it has consistent features in news and bulletins.The pressure of war drove the rest of our family out of Sierra Leone into exile in Spain(Madrid) where we have been living under political asylum for 4 months now. 
 
Sadly,my mother died of cancer 2 months after our arrival into spain, i am now here with my 2 children and myself,But before the death of my husband he has handed over to me a certificate meant for a secret deposited trunk box which my father made in a security company in Madrid Spain, and he disclosed to me that the trunk box contains US$25,000.000.00 Million Dollars. 
 
The money was paid to the minning corporation under him by it's overseas customers in the heat of the war but he made the deposit in his name with the hope of converting it to his personal use at the end of the war but was killed when the conflict intensified as a result of his opposition to the rebel forces.I have contacted the security company to confirm the deposit and established ownership. 
 
Due to the death of my mother and the continued hostility in Sierra Leone,I have decided to solicit for the assistance of an honest and trustworthy person that will assist me in the withdrawal of the trunk box for investment purposes.I cannot do it alone due to my present status and total ignorance in business and investment as I was in school before the outbreak of the war. 
 
You will be given a nogotiable percentage of the money at the end of the transaction.If you are trustworthy and interested in the proposal, contact me immediately for more details.You must maintain absolute confidentiality to ensure success also include your personal telephone number when replying.It is very important to note that during my fact finding mission to establish ownership of the subject matter, I decided here and now to write you this mail. I await your quick response. 
 
 
Best regards, 
 
 Mrs Joyce.T. Lamar.
