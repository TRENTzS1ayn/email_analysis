Sorry for the delay in response, practical realities can take precedence.

Most of these issues were dealt with in the early nineties by widespread
industry groups such as the Unicode Consortium (www.unicode.org) or
XOpen standards such as XPG4 in 1992 (www.opengroup.org).

I find it difficult to believe the rules for case-insensitive comparison
are that difficult to grasp, though I admit the implementations for the
old 8-bit character representations had to deal with the fundamental
ambiguities of context dependent mappings and can be pretty hairy
reading. The solution for such implementation problems of course is to
agree on the context or to remove the ambiguities in the character set
representations. The latter means either restricting use to the POSIX
subset of all locales, or using one of the "universal" sets like Unicode.

Instead of 8-bit string functions such as strcoll, you might want to look 
at the WCS equivalents in most standard libraries. Issues such as no upper
or lower case form are smoothly handled by towupper(), towlower(). If
you are concerned about equivalent forms (which is stretching things for
case insensitivity), try wcscoll(). Most of the major programming 
environments, Java, Windows, and commercial Unix variants should have all 
the implementation tools needed. Many have a function such as wcsicmp(), 
or String.equalsIgnoreCase().

I believe the current draft mandates UTF8-Unicode as the format for
exchanging character data. Further specification of the implementation
details in the standard is probably not in keeping with the tradition of
such things and should be left to the implementors, right?

Cheers,
RossW
