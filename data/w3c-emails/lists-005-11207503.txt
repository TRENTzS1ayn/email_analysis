OK, here's everyone's last chance to object, or else the change
will appear in 09.2

Cheers,
Geoff

Did anybody object to this? (I expected to see the change in 09.1)

That's fine with me.  If nobody objects, I'll make that change.

Cheers,

The DAV:predecessor-set on checked out version selectors and working 
resources shows up in advanced versioning, but has nothing to do with 
anything else in advanced. Couldn't it be moved to core-versioning, saying 

that "core versioning servers MAY restrict the DAV:predecessor-set 
property to contain only the version listed in the DAV:checked-out 
property"?
