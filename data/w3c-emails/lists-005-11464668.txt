I agree with Jim - but I would also add that labels provide more than just 
a human readable name, they provide the ability to define a unique 
configuration of the resources in the repository.  One often does not want 
to get everything from the repository, just the subset of resources in the 
configuration identified by a unique label.  Baselines provide this type of 
functionality in advanced versioning and labels provide it in core.  If 
labels are removed from core, how is this accomplished?
