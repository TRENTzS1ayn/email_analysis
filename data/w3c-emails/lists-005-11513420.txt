Since many document management clients don't want or need baselining
or configuration functionality, the document management versioning
servers do not want to have to provide the infrastructure
(i.e. labels) for it.

   I agree with Jim - but I would also add that labels provide more than just 
   a human readable name, they provide the ability to define a unique 
   configuration of the resources in the repository.  One often does not want 
   to get everything from the repository, just the subset of resources in the 
   configuration identified by a unique label.  Baselines provide this type of 
   functionality in advanced versioning and labels provide it in core.  If 
   labels are removed from core, how is this accomplished?
