Okay. Quick question:

  If I CHECKOUT a version resource (directly or via DAV:target in the
  CHECKOUT method), does the DAV:target disappear from any Version Selectors
  that point at correspond to that version?


In other words, does the monkeying around with DAV:target and
DAV:checked-out *only* occur for in-place checked-out version selectors?

[ which in turn means it won't happen to me since I don't use in-place ]

With that tidbit, then I'll reread your email to see if problems still
exist.

Thx!

Cheers,
