Labels have a role separate from support from baselining. They're just a 
mechanism for distinguishing revisions that is controled by the client. 
Without labels, clients that want to get a consistent set of revisions 
will have to remember all the server-generated URLs and/or version names. 
Although possible, this is state that the server should generally be 
providing for clients so they don't have to persist this kind of 
information.




Since many document management clients don't want or need baselining
or configuration functionality, the document management versioning
servers do not want to have to provide the infrastructure
(i.e. labels) for it.

Cheers,
Geoff

   I agree with Jim - but I would also add that labels provide more than 
just
   a human readable name, they provide the ability to define a unique
   configuration of the resources in the repository.  One often does not 
want
   to get everything from the repository, just the subset of resources in 
the
   configuration identified by a unique label.  Baselines provide this 
type of
   functionality in advanced versioning and labels provide it in core.  If
   labels are removed from core, how is this accomplished?
