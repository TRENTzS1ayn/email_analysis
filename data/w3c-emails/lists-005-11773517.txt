   Perhaps it is more useful to come at it like this: - Is it legitimate for
   someone to use whatever property is identified for label as a property on a
   core-only system, so that if the system were upgraded or the data was
   transported to a system with advanced versioning support, everything would
   work consistently?

The protocol says that any server that supports versioning MUST reject
an attempt to PROPPATCH any property (core or advanced) that is defined
as "protected" by the protocol.  This provides an error check to make
sure a naive client doesn't create a property that a versioning aware
client could misinterpret as having the protocol defined live behavior.

Cheers,
Geoff
