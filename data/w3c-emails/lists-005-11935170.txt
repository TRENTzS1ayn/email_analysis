   From: "Lisa Dusseault" <lisa@xythos.com>

   I initially assumed -- since I work on document repositories rather than
   source repositories -- that core would be suitable for document
   repositories' simpler versioning needs.  That assumption was probably
   unwarranted.

In earlier drafts of the protocol, the core level was called
"document management" (and advanced was called "configuration management"),
so historically, Lisa's assumption is very warranted.

   Nevertheless, I think it would be a Good Thing if we did explicitly or at
   least consciously target "core versioning" to simple document repository
   scenarios.  Source repositories can then implement on top of core versioning
   any additional features like baselining, forking, etc. that aren't required
   of document repositories.

As is probably clear from my postings, I wholeheartedly (and even
vehemently :-) agree with the preceding paragraph.

Cheers,
Geoff
