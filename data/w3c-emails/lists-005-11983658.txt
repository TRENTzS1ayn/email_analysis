section 16.4 BASELINE-CONTROL p.52

The BASELINE-CONTROL method allows a *baseline history* to be specified in
the body; *the initial version* in this baseline history is used as the
target of the newly-created baseline selector.

In contrast, the VERSION-CONTROL method allows a *version* to be specified
in the body; *this version* is used as the target of the newly-created
version selector.

Besides being inconsistent, the behavior of BASELINE-CONTROL is not
particularly convenient for a client trying to create a workspace and
populate it from a pre-existing baseline version (that is, without appeal
to an existing baseline version selector). The steps are:

1. MKWORKSPACE to create a new workspace
2. VERSION-CONTROL the workspace root collection specifying the baseline's
root collection version (assume this is known to client)
3. BASELINE-CONTROL the workspace root collection specifying the baseline
history
4. SET-TARGET on the baseline selector to the baseline version

If BASELINE-CONTROL allowed a baseline version to be specified in the body
and that version were to be used as the target of the newly-created
baseline selector, then steps 3 and 4 could be reduced to just one:

3'. BASELINE-CONTROL the workspace root collection specifying the baseline
version
