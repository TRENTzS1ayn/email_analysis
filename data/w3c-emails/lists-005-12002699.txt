   section 16.4 BASELINE-CONTROL p.52

   The BASELINE-CONTROL method allows a *baseline history* to be specified in
   the body; *the initial version* in this baseline history is used as the
   target of the newly-created baseline selector.

That is a typo ... you'll notice from the DTD that a baseline, not a
baseline history, is required.  Thanks for catching this!

   In contrast, the VERSION-CONTROL method allows a *version* to be specified
   in the body; *this version* is used as the target of the newly-created
   version selector.

Yes, that's the way BASELINE-CONTROL should be as well.

   Besides being inconsistent, the behavior of BASELINE-CONTROL is not
   particularly convenient for a client trying to create a workspace and
   populate it from a pre-existing baseline version (that is, without appeal
   to an existing baseline version selector). The steps are:

   1. MKWORKSPACE to create a new workspace
   2. VERSION-CONTROL the workspace root collection specifying the baseline's
   root collection version (assume this is known to client)

Actually, you can baselining a collection is independent of whether
or not you are versioning it, so the VERSION-CONTROL step is not
requird.

   3. BASELINE-CONTROL the workspace root collection specifying the baseline
   history
   4. SET-TARGET on the baseline selector to the baseline version

   If BASELINE-CONTROL allowed a baseline version to be specified in the body
   and that version were to be used as the target of the newly-created
   baseline selector, then steps 3 and 4 could be reduced to just one:

   3'. BASELINE-CONTROL the workspace root collection specifying the baseline
   version

Yes, that's what it should have said.  I'll fix this.
Since there is no need to VERSION-CONTROL the workspace, you
can create a new workspace based on an existing baseline in two steps:

   1. MKWORKSPACE to create a new workspace
   2. BASELINE-CONTROL the workspace root collection specifying the baseline

I'll post a 10.2 draft with this fix.

Cheers,
Geoff
