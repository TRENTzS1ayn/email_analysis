I would say that, so long as label support is optional, and they don't
depend on any non-core mechanism, that the core is a good place to put them.

Mostly I see it encouraging developers to notice them and consider their
support rather than come up with substitutes at the core level that don't
scale into advanced.

It may be a small thing, and I recommend it anyhow.

Changes since deltav-10:

- Moved version selector DAV:predecessor-set property to core. (Boris)
- Made label support optional. (Lisa)
- Removed Workspace header (Geoff)
- Added DAV:must-not-be-checked-out precondition for LABEL (John)
- Only require Multi-Status if there was an error in a Depth operation
  (e.g. LABEL and SET-TARGET). (John)
- Got rid of "parent workspace" for MKWORKSPACE (Tim/Geoff)
- Added DAV:no-checkout argument to MERGE (Tim)
- Fixed BASELINE-CONTROL so that baseline (not baseline history)
  is the argument (Tim).

Outstanding Issues:

- Should labels be moved back to core?

Cheers,
Geoff
