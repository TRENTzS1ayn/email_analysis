   From: Chris Kaler <ckaler@microsoft.com>

   [CK] I assume we still keep baseline and workspaces separate in terms
of OPTIONS discoverability, yes?

Definitely yes.  In addition to fine-grained discovery via
DAV:supported-methods, DAV:supported-live-properties, and
DAV:supported-reports, we have the following "feature-sets" defined
for the DAV header: workspace, baseline, activity, merging, and
versioned-collection.


Cheers,
Geoff
