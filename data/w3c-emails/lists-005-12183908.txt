I have posted a 10.4 version with this fixed on the web site, but for some
reason,
I can't get in to update the index.html page.  But you can find 10.4 in
the usual place by specifying the URL by hand.

Cheers,
Geoff

Geoff,

There are references to the old repository report in 16.2 and 16.3 of
versioning-10.3;  these should be changes to refer to
DAV:workspace-collection-set and DAV:activity-collection-set respectively.

Tim
