OK, seems reasonable.

I like must-support.

Hypothetically, it might make sense to include this in a property value, so
the client knows its should not believe it understands the value of the
property unless it also understands the element.

More than anything though, the lack of symmetry is what bothers me.  If it's
a general XML feature, why limit it to a single direction of message flow?
