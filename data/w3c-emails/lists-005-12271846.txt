Just a reminder that the next DeltaV working group
meeting will be held at the 49th IETF meeting on
December 14th from 1:00PM to 3:00PM. I hope to see
many of you there. This is an important meeting as
we want to take the versioning specification to
IETF last call sometime in January. So bring your
issues and lets get this done!

Although all official work happens in the mailing
list and at the Delta-V working group meetings, it is
often beneficial to have additional "high bandwidth"
discussions to facilitate design discussions between
working group meetings.  We try to have these design
team meetings between and during the regularly scheduled
IETF meetings to help make progress on our specification.
The next of these design team meetings will be held at
during IETF 49 on Wedensday. Dec 13 and Thursday, 
Dec 14. I don't have a meeting location at this time. 
Worst case, I'll post a location on the message board.

Please note that meeting minutes will be issued to the
mailing list and all decisions made at the meeting are
tentative until reviewed on mailing list. Any member of
the DeltaV working group is welcome to attend, but be
prepared to get into the details!
