The spec should say that workspaces cannot 'overlap', i.e., a workspace
cannot be a member of another workspace, and bindings cannot be made
outside the workspace.  Having multiple workpace 'parents' would confuse
many things, including current activity, and make workspace semantics for
single history selectors very time consuming to enforce.
