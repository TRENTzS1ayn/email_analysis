Simply that you shouldn't be allowed to create an overlap by binding a
member of one workspace to a member of another workspace, or create a
binding from a member of a workspace to, say, a parent of the workspace
since the workspace would become a member of itself.

However, since the delta-v spec cannot refer to the binding spec ("other
than as work in progress") it should be sufficient to say that workspaces
cannot be nested, and leave other binding issues for that work group<g>

  ... bindings cannot be made outside the workspace.

  Can you clarify what is meant by the above? Bindings to/from what for
instance?
