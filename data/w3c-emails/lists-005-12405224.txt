Section 9.1.1 shows the use of a VERSION-CONTROL on an existing resource.
However, it responds with a 201 (Created). I'm thinking that it should be a
200 (OK) or a 204 (No Content) since it is not creating the Request-URI.

RFC 2616, 10.2.2 states that the created resource should be returned in a
Location: header (presuming it is different from the Request-URI). As I read
it, it may even mandate a Location: header for the 201 (Created) response.

I think it might be a bit whacky for VERSION-CONTROL to return the location
of the version history, so I'd recommend changing the response (for an
existing, versionable) resource to one of:

1) 200 (OK) with a body that specifies the URIs of the initial version and
   the version history.

2) 204 (No Content)


The first is certainly more informative for smart clients.
