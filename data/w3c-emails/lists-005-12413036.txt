We need to be able to do a CHECKOUT on a collection version so that we can
perform operations within the collection and on the collection itself.

In Subversion, I've been planning to do a CHECKOUT on a parent collection
version resource, which will return a location such as:

    http://host.name/repo/$svn/wrk/100.3

I can then do the following:

    PUT http://host.name/repo/$svn/wrk/100.3/newfile.html

or even:
    COPY http://host.name/repo/somedir/foo.c
    Destination: http://host.name/repo/$svn/wrk/100.3/foo.c
    
    (or a MOVE if the source's parent is checked out)

The working resource for the collection is also handy for deleting or for
replacing the collection:

    DELETE http://host.name/repo/$svn/wrk/100.3
    (note that this request also requires a checked-out parent)

    COPY http://host.name/repo/somedir/
    Destination: http://host.name/repo/$svn/wrk/100.3
    Overwrite: T

DELETE of a member is a CHECKOUT of two items: the thing to DELETE and the
parent collection.


Without being able to do a CHECKOUT on a collection, there wouldn't be a way
to do any of the above.

Cheers,
