   Are you interested in formalizing the response at all, to provide the
   relevant URIs?
   (I'm just so-so on it, but others might want the extra feature)

I'm medium to strongly against adding info like the version history
or initial version URL to the VERSION-CONTROL response.  Many clients
won't need this information, and clients that do need it will often
need more than that, so they'll have to issue a PROPFIND or property
report request anyway.

Cheers,
Geoff
