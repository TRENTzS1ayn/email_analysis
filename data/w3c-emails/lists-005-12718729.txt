    - "In order to ensure unambiguous merging and baselining
    semantics, a workspace may contain at most one version
    selector for a given version history."  A bind to an
    existing resource in another workspace would require the
    server to determine if there are any version selectors
    in each workspace that fail this precondition.
    </tim>

  <Geoff>
  This last complication is one a server already must
  deal with, since the VERSION-CONTROL request can be
  used to create a version selector whose DAV:target
  refers to a version in an existing version history.
  </Geoff>

The difference being that the search space for a VERSION_CONTROL request is
the history of an existing versioned resource, whereas the seach space for
a bind to a workspace is the entire workspace.
