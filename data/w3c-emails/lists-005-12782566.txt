I believe it should be a SHOULD.  There are a variety of versioning
repositories that do not provide atomic group checkin behavior, and
it is a reasonable server value-add to guarantee atomic behavior.
A client can simply report the error, so it doesn't significantly
complicate client implementations.

Cheers,
Geoff

   Is that 'should' a SHOULD or a MUST?

   There are likely servers that cannot achieve an 'atomic delete with
   multiple resource property updates'.

   Subject:  Deletion semantics for versioning metadata





   Greg has asked that we clarify the results of deleting things
   like working resources, versions, version histories, etc.

   I believe it is sufficient for us to say that if a server allows you
   to delete such a resource, that all the versioning properties of other
   resources that refer to that resource should be updated to no longer
   refer to the deleted resource (I'd probably enumerate those properties
   to make sure there is no misunderstanding).

   Any objections?

   Cheers,
   Geoff
