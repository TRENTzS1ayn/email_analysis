       <tim> "In order to ensure unambiguous merging and baselining
       semantics, a workspace may contain at most one version selector
       for a given version history."  A bind to an existing resource
       in another workspace would require the server to determine if
       there are any version selectors in each workspace that fail
       this precondition.  </tim>

     <Geoff> This last complication is one a server already must deal
     with, since the VERSION-CONTROL request can be used to create a
     version selector whose DAV:target refers to a version in an
     existing version history.  </Geoff>

   The difference being that the search space for a VERSION_CONTROL
   request is the history of an existing versioned resource, whereas
   the seach space for a bind to a workspace is the entire workspace.

Ah yes, of course, if you were to bind to a collection in another
workspace.  Good point.

Cheers,
Geoff
