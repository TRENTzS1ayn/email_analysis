I'd suggest that an implementation "MUST NOT return invalid pointers to
deleted working resources or other dangling pointers".

This leaves the implementation free to clean up on delete, or to clean up on
request, or in a background process, whatever the implementors prefer.  This
isn't quite "atomic", but it gets the desired behaviour.
