   From: Tim_Ellison@uk.ibm.com

   So when I have two workspaces A and B both with bindings to a resource C,
   in which workspace is C?

I'd just leave that up to the server.  I'd suggest the following
constraint: "the DAV:workspace of a resource MUST be the same as the
DAV:workspace of one of its parents, unless the resource itself is a
workspace, in which case the DAV:workspace MUST identify the resource
itself."

Cheers,
Geoff
