Hrm. The DAV:workspace property is *only* needed for things that occur
underneath a workspace, right? In other words, this isn't trying to imply
that any DAV resource must define this property? Or further: if the
workspace feature does not exist, thus workspace members do not exist, then
I won't have to worry about this property?
