It seems a bit more complicated than that. If you delete a version history,
then I'd expect the corresponding selectors and versions to become
non-controlled resources.

But even then, it seems that you could lose all the information on how to
track down the available versions for a given resource.

(of course, I'd expect most servers to just refuse deletion of versions and
 version histories, but the spec may not be able to make that assumption;
 hmm. I guess it could say "server defined")

Mostly, I'm concerned with what deletion of a working resource and an
activity means. For the former, I'd expect something like an UNCHECKOUT. For
an activity, I'd expect a full rollback of all associated checked-out
resources. Specifically, let's say that I have an activity with 10 working
resources associated with it; I'd like to do one of two things to that
activity: CHECKIN or DELETE, corresponding to "commit" or "rollback". After
either of those operations, the activity and all working resources are gone.
