   Hrm. The DAV:workspace property is *only* needed for things that
   occur underneath a workspace, right?  In other words, this isn't
   trying to imply that any DAV resource must define this property? Or
   further: if the workspace feature does not exist, thus workspace
   members do not exist, then I won't have to worry about this
   property?

Correct.  Of course, if we end up deciding that checking out a
collection version creates a workspace, then you would have to worry
about it (:-).

Cheers,
Geoff
