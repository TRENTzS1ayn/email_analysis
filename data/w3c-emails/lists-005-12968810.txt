I agree that this is a viable implementation trick, and the client would
thereby never see 'invalid pointers' so it would satisfy the MUST protocol.
(I equate it to the protocol saying a resource MUST have a property, and
the server choosing to calculate it on the fly when requested.)
If it looks like a duck, ...

I'd suggest that an implementation "MUST NOT return invalid pointers to
deleted working resources or other dangling pointers".

This leaves the implementation free to clean up on delete, or to clean up
on
request, or in a background process, whatever the implementors prefer.
This
isn't quite "atomic", but it gets the desired behaviour.
