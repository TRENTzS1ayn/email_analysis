Separating the workspace 'ownership' from the workspace 'membership' would
resolve this issue.  It certainly has the potential to mess up some
workspace optimizations.  Would you allow version selectors to change
workspace ownership?

Conceptually, why would you add this constraint if ownership and membership
are orthogonal concepts?

So a reserved 'yes', provided the constraint was made (for efficient
implementation reasons), and clients cannot change a resource's workspace
ownership.
