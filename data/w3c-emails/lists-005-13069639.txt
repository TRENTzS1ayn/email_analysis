Subject:  DeltaV BOFs in San Diego




In addition to the official DeltaV meeting slot on Thursday, at 3:30PM, are
there any DeltaV BOF meetings being planned?  While I won't be in San
Diego,
I think there will be a lot of WebDAV people there, and they might be
interested in attending a DeltaV BOF.  I'll announce it on the WebDAV WG
list if there is one.

- Jim
