There seems to be a typo in the PROPPATCH section in core versioning
(section 8.6 in the 10 draft, 7.4 in the 10.5 draft).  Shouldn't it be
"checked-in version selector", not "checked-out version selector"?  The
corrected sentence would read:

"If the request-URL identifies a checked-in version selector, an attempt to
modify a dead property MUST fail unless DAV:auto-version is set for that
version selector."
