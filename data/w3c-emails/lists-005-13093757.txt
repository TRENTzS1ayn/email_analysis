To: Mailing list DELTAV<ietf-dav-versioning@w3.org>, Mailing list WEBDAV<w3c-dist-auth@w3.org>

I'm just reading the documnentation of both groups ...

I didn't understand what is the difference of the two working groups.
Someone could tell me something ... 

Can I consider deltav as the continuation of webdav ?
If so, why webdav is still working ?

Thanks

Simone Pensa
