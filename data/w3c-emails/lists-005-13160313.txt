Ooops.  Correction to the last sentence :

   From: "Geoffrey M. Clemm" <geoffrey.clemm@rational.com>

   We would then define two alternative forms of optional parallel
   development, "client side workspaces" (with working resources) and
   "server side workspaces" (with working resources).

That should have been:

   We would then define two alternative forms of optional parallel
   development, "client side workspaces" (with working resources) and
   "server side workspaces" (with workspaces).

This proposal effectively says that the current server choice
(client side workspaces vs. server side workspaces) should be
reflected in the optional category, so that all of "core" is
required.  Leaving it the way it is now is misleading, since
the form of checkout is a server option but we have that functionality
defined in the "required" section of the protocol.

Cheers,
Geoff
