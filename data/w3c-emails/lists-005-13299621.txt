It is not about decreasing round trips... not a bit. It is about
establishing a change set. All of the changes get checked in as a single
unit and assigned a version number.

I see no way to do a change set if the resources must be checked in
individually. Not to mention the transactional problems with that. For
example, if checkout-fork is true ("allow multiple checkouts"), but
checkin-fork is false ("can't check in if the checked out version is not the
latest"), then I need to cancel the *entire* checkin if *any* of the
checkins would create a fork.
