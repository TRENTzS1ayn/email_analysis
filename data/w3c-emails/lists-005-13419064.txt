Actually, my point was to introduce just a new level or layer within the
protocol rather than splitting it into separate RFCs.  But, of course, I
have no objections against it, if splitting the document helps improving
the structure of the protocol.

However, if you want to split the document, I would suggest splitting it
in a slightly different way:

* Versioning protocol:

  everything that deals with versioning of individual (unrelated) files

  Level 1: mandatory features (what is currently called core versioning)
  Level 2: optional features (optional versioning reports, mutable
           versions, labels, MERGE for individual files and collections)

* Configuration management protocol:

  everything that deals with versioning of sets of associated (related)
  files

  Basically, everything that is left should go here (including baselines,
  activities, working spaces, MERGE for baselines and activities, etc.).

And those features that have nothing at all to do with versioning (e.g.
new WebDAV properties, REPORT method framework, property report) should
be moved to (a revised edition of) WebDAV.

Bye,
     Juergen
