At a recent deltav presentation I was giving, someone suggested
that "version selector" was not a very good term, since a checked
out version selector doesn't really select a version.  I believe
this is a very good point, and would like to consider selecting
a less misleading term.

My favorite would be "version controlled resource", which we
could shorten to just "controlled resource" in contexts where
it is unambiguous.

We can then say that the VERSION-CONTROL request creates a
version controlled resource at the request URL.  It also then
is very natural to refer to a checked-in version controlled
resource and a checked-out version controlled resource.

I'm going to make a pass through the document to see how
this works out in practice, and then if this goes smoothly,
I'd like to post it for general comment.  Any objections?

Cheers,
Geoff
