I just finished an editing pass over the protocol, and the only time
we used the term "version-controlled" was in reference to resources
that had already had the VERSION-CONTROL operation applied to them, so
current usage in the protocol is consistent with replacing the term
"version selector" with "version-controlled resource".

I've never encountered the need to have a term for "any kind of
resource managed by DeltaV", so I don't think we need one (and even
if we did, I don't think we'd want to use "version-controlled for
that concept).

I'll post the results of this editing pass as a 10.7 working draft,
so folks can see what this really would look like.

Cheers,
Geoff

   Seems fine... but don't we already use "version controlled resource" to
   refer to any of the resources managed by DeltaV? (hrm; maybe not ; do we
   need/want one?)
