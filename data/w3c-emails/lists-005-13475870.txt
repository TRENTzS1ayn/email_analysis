The term was taken from RFC2616 regarding the requirements for an HTTP/1.1
server to provide a Date: header if the server can provide a "resonale
approximation of the current time"
(http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2616.html#sec-14.18).

It seemed reasonable to only require the same level of time keeping
accuracy for the checkin date property.
