I have just started to get envolved with WebDAV and I would really
appreciate it if someone could point to me some useful (and easy to
understand) links or information for versioning(What can be versioned how 
e.t.c)

Thanx
Stamaths

PS:Sorry if the mail seems kind of stupid but I have never before 
worked neither with http nor with any kind of versioning(CVS).
