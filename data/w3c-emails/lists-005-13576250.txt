Sure by this definition rather than Versioning Handle, why not Version URL.

From the call a spade a spade school of thought.

Subject:  RE: version-selector => version-controlled-resource




Here's another cut at a definition of version-controlled resource, taking
into account Geoff's comments, and trying to pare it down to the essential
elements:

"Version-controlled resource:  The concept of the version-controlled
resource is to allow a single URL to track a resource through the
checkout-modify-checkin cycle from one version to the next.  It is a
resource with a unique URL distinct from the URLs of both its associated
version history and any of the versions in that version history.  At any
given instant when it is in a checked-in state, it has a copy of the
content
and dead properties of one version from its associated version history.
Immediately after it is checked out, it has a writable working copy of the
content and dead properties of the version targeted when it was checked
out.
This working copy can be modified 'in-place' with methods like PUT and
PROPPATCH, without affecting the selected version that was checked out.  A
checkin changes the state of the version-controlled resource back to
'checked-in', and creates a new version in its associated version history
whose content and dead properties are a copy of that of the
version-controlled resource at the time of checkin."

Incidentally, I find "version-controlled resource" to be a bit of a
mouthful
also (:-).  I think something like "version handle" would be better, since
it's designed to be the handle by which a version is taken through the
checkout-modify-checkin cycle.  It shifts from object to object in the
process, just as a handle might in a program.  For your consideration,
here's the same definition with "version handle" instead of VCR:

"Version handle:  The concept of the version handle is to allow a single
URL
to track a resource through the checkout-modify-checkin cycle from one
version to the next.  It is a resource with a unique URL distinct from the
URLs of both its associated version history and any of the versions in that
version history.  At any given instant when it is in a checked-in state, it
has a copy of the content and dead properties of one version from its
associated version history.  Immediately after it is checked out, it has a
writable working copy of the content and dead properties of the version
targeted when it was checked out.  This working copy can be modified
'in-place' with methods like PUT and PROPPATCH, without affecting the
selected version that was checked out.  A checkin changes the state of the
version handle back to 'checked-in', and creates a new version in its
associated version history whose content and dead properties are a copy of
that of the version handle at the time of checkin."
