My concern is that this might lead to the document not being useful as a
reference.  For example, if all of the header definitions are spread
throughout the document, it is hard to find the one place where all the
header definitions are located. But, I can see the attraction to having
functional groupings by option package. Perhaps some hybrid would work.
Alternatively, a good index (or appendix listing all of the headers, and the
section that defines them) might fix the reference problem.
