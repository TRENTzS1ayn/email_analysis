OK, that makes it 3 votes in favor of partitioning the doc into
discrete packages, and none against.  If I have a chance, I'll give it
a try and see how it looks.  Not sure if I'll be able to get to this
before I leave for San Diego though.

Cheers,

   Agree with these statements, and particularly that indexing/appendixing is
   the way to deal with the problem.  The nice thing about separating the doc
   into discrete "packages" is that it's easier to make sure each package is a
   consistent set of features by itself, or to know what other package is
   relied upon.
