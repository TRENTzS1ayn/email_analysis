Just to make sure there is no confusion, I would not be removing anything
from the current document, but rather creating a new document (called
deltav-versioning-core) that had the subset of the versioning protocol
that was mandantory.  The main impact this would have on the current
document is that it would allow us to unify the terminology section
(since there would be a separate document for folks only interested
in "core").

I won't have time to create this subset document before the meeting,
so I'll create it only if we decide at the working group meeting that
this is the right thing to do.

Cheers,
Geoff

Since we're trying to take the DeltaV spec to last call shortly after the
Dec IETF working group meeting, it may be too late to split it up now. I
suggest we leave it alone for the working group meeting and see what the
group wants to do and what effect it might have on our ability to go last
call.
