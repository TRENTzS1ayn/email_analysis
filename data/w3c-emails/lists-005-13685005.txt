Yes, the DeltaV meeting will definitely not overlap the WebDAV WG,
so the Wed DeltaV meeting will be 9-3:15 rather than 9-5:00.
BTW, I definitely will be at the 3:30-5pm DeltaV design meeting
on Thursday, so there will be at least one person there (:-).

I agree with Eric that since there are no open issues with the ACL
draft, that a ACL BOF is not needed (we can walk through the ACL
protocol in the WebDAV WG time slot ... it's a very short protocol).
Especially with DeltaV going to last call, I personally would
rather put that time into DeltaV.

So I propose we not have an ACL BOF on Wed.

Cheers,
Geoff

Actually, I suspect the DeltaV meeting probably won't overlap the WebDAV WG
meeting. Upon a closer look, there were actually no times specified in Jim
Amsden's message announcing the DeltaV design team meetings.  I just assumed
they were from 9 to 5.  In the past the DeltaV design team hasn't met during
the WebDAV WG meeting.

As for the ACL BOF, I think a useful meeting would be to have a design
walkthrough of the current specification.  I'm not convinced that everyone
has given the latest draft a thorough examination.
