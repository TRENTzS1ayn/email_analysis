We can recess the design team meeting for all working group meetings and 
the ACL BOF. B.T.W., ACLs had a BOF a couple of years ago. Shouldn't this 
work be done in a working group by now?




Why is the DeltaV design meeting overlapping the Access Control and
WebDAV meetings?  There are a lot of people (like Geoff and me) interested
in both.

Also, I'm not sure that an access control BOF before the WebDAV meeting
makes sense, as I don't know of a lot of open issues at this point.
