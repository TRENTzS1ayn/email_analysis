The ACL work is being done in a working group meeting ...
the WebDAV working group meeting (:-). (The ACL spec is a WebDAV
working group document).

JimW's use of the word "BOF" was misleading here.  The Wed 1-3
meeting would be better described as a "WebDAV working group
ACL design meeting". 

Cheers,
Geoff

We can recess the design team meeting for all working group meetings and
the ACL BOF. B.T.W., ACLs had a BOF a couple of years ago. Shouldn't this
work be done in a working group by now?




Why is the DeltaV design meeting overlapping the Access Control and
WebDAV meetings?  There are a lot of people (like Geoff and me) interested
in both.

Also, I'm not sure that an access control BOF before the WebDAV meeting
makes sense, as I don't know of a lot of open issues at this point.
