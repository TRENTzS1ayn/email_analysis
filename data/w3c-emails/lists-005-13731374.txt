These are the comments that I think may be more controversial.


(II.1) F and T should be false and true to allign the direction of the
       XML Schema look of allignment with XML schema wherever we can
       (at least by value).

(II.2) Require the value of DAV:comment to be XML, for internationalization.

(II.3) Don't constrain the value of DAV:creator-displayname to be a string.

(II.4) Require version-name to be XML, for internationalization.

(II.5) Move all DAV:supported-xxx properties to the OPTIONS response.
       Move all DAV:xxx-collection-set properties to the OPTIONS
       response.

(II.6) Require that a version URL never be re-used after a version is
       deleted.

(II.7) Add tokens for If header that check whether specific
       checkout/checkin forking behavior is supported by the server.

(II.8) Allow "ancestor", "descendant", (or both), and "all" as options
       to the DAV:version-tree report.

(II.9) Require that a PUT to a locked auto-versioned resource be just
       CHECKOUT/update (i.e. omit the CHECKIN).  Then have an UNLOCK
       of an auto-checked-out versioned resource be a CHECKIN.
