ah... important clarification. Now I understand where you are going with
this stuff.

Okay... I hereby retract most of my objections in this topic area :-)

But: I still would like to have a way to somehow tell a client "I don't
support public checkouts." In other words, the only model supported is the
"client workspace" -- I need the client to remember the Location returned
from a CHECKOUT.

[ concretely: I'd support working resources, but not checked-out version
  selectors ]

Cheers,
