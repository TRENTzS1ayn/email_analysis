It would be easy code-wise to use GUIDs in creating version URLs.  However
that's not the issue.  I'm not arguing whether this can be implemented
easily; it certainly can be.  I'm arguing whether it needs to be part of the
protocol specification.  Does it have any bearing on the protocol standard
whether or not a server reuses version URLs?  I think not.  Leave decisions
up to the implementors when they do not affect interoperability.  Or, give
me an argument why interoperability _suffers_ if the server reuses version
URLs.
