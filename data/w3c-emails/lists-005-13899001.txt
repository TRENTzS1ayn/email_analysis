<greg>You've got all kinds of race conditions and stuff going in there to
try and
deal with the problem. Sure, the server knows all of the files that Joe is
going to checkin (through examination of the activity), but it can't do
anything about it until all the files are checked in. Does it say "well,
there is a v7 for this file, but I can't give it to you right now." What if
Joe never comes back? Nancy should have got v7 in that case. Oh, and what
happens with rollback for Joe's failed checkin? Or is that first resource
supposed to fail on checkin because some *other* resource in the activity
is
going to fail in the future.</greg>

I don't think we ever considered DAV:version-names to play this role. We
considered them a way to distinguish revisions that is set by the server
for display purposes, they can't be used to access the version. WebDAV
defines the change set to be the latest versions in an activity. It doesn't
say that all the changes were created at the same time. This moves the
validation of the change set to after checkin, not before. I understand
this might not be ideal.
