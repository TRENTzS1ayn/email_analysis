To me, this looks like a good example where in practice, a URL is all you 
can send to me. It's just not practical to send me the ETag as well, 
because there is no easy way for me to check it. I think I would prefer 
clicking on a URL such as
http://www.sharemation.com/~milele/public/advanced-status-reporting.htm/00741ab6a2c400141e860000c0a80cc2
or
http://www.sharemation.com/~milele/public/advanced-status-reporting.htm?version=1&etag=1fe4-69-39e7056c
over checking the ETag myself.

With reusable version URLs, users would need to know about ETags. Example: 
If you accidentally deleted advanced-status-reporting.htm and then re-created it, a URL which just 
says ?version=1 would link to the latest version of that document instead 
of the first version.
