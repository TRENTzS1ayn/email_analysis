I agree with Boris that it is infeasible to expect clients to remember ETags
to differentiate between recycled version URLs.  Without encoding the ETag
in a URL there is no way to create a safe href to a particular version.

I have no problem with putting GUIDs into the URL, which need not be
particularly short or meaningful.
