IETFers,

I'm stuck at the Sheraton, and don't have my own transportation to the
Marriott, where the deltaV design team is meeting.  Is anybody going over
there??  unfortunately I have to be back here for 11:30.

Wasn't there any way to find a niche or hotel room or bar corner here at the
conference hotel?

Lisa
