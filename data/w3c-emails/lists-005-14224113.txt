I agree that its a strech to think of these things as properties, but one 
could consider Greg's example below to be the "synchronization properties" 
of some root directory. 

My issue is that we already have a number of ways produce reports: using 
servlets (or any other standard way of extending servers with custom 
reports), POST, PROPFIND, and now REPORT. My first suggestion was to use 
POST and just define the entity request body formats for interoperability. 
This didn't seem appealing. Next came PROPFIND. I think POST and PROPFIND 
are already existing, generic, extensible mechanisms while REPORT seems to 
be sort of a special case method. There's no difference in the semantics, 
just the marshalling, and POST and/or PROPFIND already provide sufficient 
semantics.

Greg, your example below could be done without any extension to WebDAV as 
your client can ask for the information it needs by doing PROPFINDs with 
depth on a collection.




I find that using PROPFIND rather than REPORT is a big bogus. I'm not
necessarily asking for properties. I'm asking for information from the
server. Is a compare-report a set of *properties* ?? Not in my mind.

For Subversion, I'm also going to be using a custom report. The client 
will
send to the server a representation of the client state. The server will
return a report saying something to the effect of, "that tree is out of
date; that file is an older version, but is equivalent to the latest; 
those
files are fine; etc"

That isn't a PROPFIND :-)

Cheers,
