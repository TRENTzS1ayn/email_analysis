I think "SHOULD be the same" would be misleading, for example the last
modified time of the VCR should not be the same as its target.

Let the spec. be quiet since the property report can be used to trivially
retrieve properties from the target resource.  Given that the VCR and the
version are separate resources there is no precedence for having their
properties synchronized (beyond the initial VERSION-CONTROL or SET-TARGET).

That's completely fine... no big deal if some must differ. However, we
could
probably insert a "SHOULD be the same" phrase. That at least lets people
know that the live props will be the same unless something really prevents
it.
