<greg>PROPFIND is for fetching properties. REPORT is for fetching information
about the server, its layout/organization, for multiple disparate 
resources
and data, etc.</greg>

The spec currently says REPORT is for fetching properties of a resource 
that require additional parameters, PROPFIND for properties that don't 
require parameters. So why not just add the parameters to PROPFIND?

We're getting many requests to reduce the number of methods. While I'm not 
always sympathetic to this, REPORT looks like a good candidate. The WebDAV 
working group seemed to prefer this approach. What do others think?
