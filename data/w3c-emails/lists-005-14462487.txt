Then what about putting version history resources into core versioning? In 
document management systems, the history resource for a version like:
http://dav.example.org/foo/document.htm?version=7
could be just:
http://dav.example.org/foo/document.htm
The DAV:version-set property would then play the role of the history 
report. Except that there would be no predecessor/successor information, 
but if everything is linear anyway, who cares...

BTW, for core versioning server implementors, it might be interesting to implement GET applied to a version history 
resource (the result of which is not spec'd).

Note that since last Saturday, even Greg wants to implement version 
history resources :-)
(Sorry, couldn't resist.)

Boris.

P.S. Just for the record: I'm in the REPORT camp, but REPORT doesn't have 
to be in core.
