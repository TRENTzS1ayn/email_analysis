   P.S. Just for the record: I'm in the REPORT camp, but REPORT
   doesn't have to be in core.

OK, with Lisa clarifying that she is for REPORT in some circumstances,
and with Boris weighing in for REPORT, that leaves JimA as the only
advocate for replacing REPORT with PROPFIND.  So the consensus appears
to be that we should keep REPORT.

Cheers,
Geoff
