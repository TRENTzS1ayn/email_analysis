Currently, I still have some stuff to write up for the revised
protocol, but the only thing left on my "unresolved issue" list is:

(1) Should version history URL's be in core (i.e. be required)?

(2) Should version URL's be stable (i.e. cannot later refer to something else)?

Any other unresolved issues that I've missed?

Just to get a sense of where the group is on these questions, please
everyone mail post one of the following 5 choices on these two issues:

Yes.
Prefer yes (but can live with no).
Don't care.
Prefer no (but can live with yes).
No.

Personally, I "prefer yes" to both issues.

Cheers,
Geoff
