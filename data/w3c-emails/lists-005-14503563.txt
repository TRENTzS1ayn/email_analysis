I propose that we add the following appendix to the protocol.
I believe this should help address the concern that there are
too many combinations of options.  In fact, if we get enough
entries in this section, we might be able to trim down or combine
some of the existing options.

Any objections, or suggestions for improving the wording?

Cheers,
Geoff

APPENDIX B: PROPOSED VERSIONING CLIENT AND SERVER OPTIONS

Although a server can implement any combination of versioning options,
it is expected that certain options will commonly be implemented
together.  In order to provide guidance to both client and server
implementers, this appendix enumerates the option combinations
currently being planned for client and server versioning
implementations.

A client will have certain options that it requires and others that it
supports.  The difference is that a client will simply give up on a
server that does not provide options that it requires, while it will
just not use options that it supports but which the server does not.

Note that this is just a statement of intent, and does NOT represent a
commitment by any individual or organization to provide the specified
versioning implementation.  An up-to-date version of this appendix can
be found at <http://www.webdav.org/deltav/implementations.html>.
