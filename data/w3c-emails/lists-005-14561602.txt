Only if you allow "slashing-through" a collection version resource. :-)

This does imply that a core server would not implement collection versions.

That's the theory :-). Honestly, I probably won't be allowing that in the
first revision. I've got enough to do as it is...

We're talking about putting them into core, not whether I'll be implementing
them. :-)

Version history seems a relatively complicated beast, so making it core
seems like it would need a justification. Therefore, my "prefer no" and a
request for why a core server would *need* them.

Sure, but that isn't the question at hand, now is it :-)
