I kind of agree with Greg that this belongs on the website rather
than in the RFC.

> 
> Although a server can implement any combination of versioning options,
> it is expected that certain options will commonly be implemented
> together.  In order to provide guidance to both client and server
> implementers, this appendix enumerates the option combinations
> currently being planned for client and server versioning

> A client will have certain options that it requires and others that it
> supports.  The difference is that a client will simply give up on a
> server that does not provide options that it requires, while it will
> just not use options that it supports but which the server does not.
> 
> Note that this is just a statement of intent, and does NOT represent a
> commitment by any individual or organization to provide the specified
> versioning implementation.  An up-to-date version of this appendix can
> be found at <http://www.webdav.org/deltav/implementations.html>.
