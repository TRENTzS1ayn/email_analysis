I'll add one more vote for keeping REPORT around, Geoff, even without
Greg's argument around allprop (which I automatically discount).  Basically,
the question is whether or not PROPFIND should be a general RPC mechanism
for stuff not affecting server state (the non-destructive version of POST),
and I think that handling all the potential cases of missing arguments will
make PROPFIND reports very cumbersome and buggy where servers crash or fail
because the check for all the combinations of missing arguments missed
something.
