I agree that the defn. for REPORT is fine.

I also agree with not restricting the definition of property more.  Server
implementors don't get the choice to add methods (vs properties) like we
do, we would need an alternative way for server implementors to marshal
"extra" live property information to the client, and I don't think that
additional implementation-specific reports are likely to work as well with
software that doesn't know about them in advance.
