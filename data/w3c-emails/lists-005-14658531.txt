   I'd expect the second URL to refer to the "latest" version rather than the
   version history.

I'm sure Boris meant something like:

http://dav.example.org/foo/document.htm?version-history

as the URL for the version history resource, since

/http://dav.example.org/foo/document.htm

is the URL for the version-controlled resource.

Note that we need to be a bit careful with the terms "refer" and
"latest" in this context.  When a version-controlled resource is
checked-in, its content and dead properties are the same as those of
the version resource identified by the DAV:target of the
version-controlled resource, but the URL refers to the
version-controlled resource, not to that version resource, and the
DAV:target is not necessarily the "latest" version (new versions can
be created in the version history without changing the DAV:target of
the versin controlled resource).

Cheers,
Geoff
