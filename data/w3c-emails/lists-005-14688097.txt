Note the bit in there about DAV:prop in the CHECKIN of an activity. It would
be great if that could be formalized, along with a response body for the
CHECKIN.

The motivation is pretty simple: the CHECKIN can construct a *bunch* of new
version resources. It would be nice to have the CHECKIN return that
information to you (since it already has it), then for the client to go
crawling back over the server fetching all that data.

The interesting question, of course, is what resource the DAV:prop applies
to. Is it the version selector? No, because those aren't involved in the
checkout or checkin (we originally checked out version resources). So it is
most likely going to refer to the new version resource. I'm fine with that,
as I can get the DAV:version, DAV:getetag, and DAV:version-name properties
from that and be okay.

But depending on what you CHECKIN, I could see the DAV:prop potentially
applying to different items. IMO, it would always apply to the newly-created
version resource(s).

Cheers,
