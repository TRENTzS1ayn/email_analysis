Geoff's comments are worth re-posting just to hammer the point home.

A version-controlled resource (VCR) is NOT a reference/pointer/redirector
to a version -- it is a resource with the same content and dead properties
as a version (a 'copy' if you will).  Operations on the VCR do not affect
the version from which it was created.

I'm struggling to determine the cause of the continued confusion.  Maybe it
is the historical name (version selector), or the fact that it has a
DAV:target property, or the fact that the protocol has an easy way to step
over the VCR to the vesion, or are people thinking of implementations?

Would renaming 'DAV:target' to 'DAV:based-on' or such like help?
