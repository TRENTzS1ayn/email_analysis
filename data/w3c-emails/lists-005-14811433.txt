Grr. This seems a bit bizarre. Of the version control systems that I've used
(RCS, CVS, SourceSafe), they've all had floating VCRs (effectively). That
DeltaV lacks the same concept is quite astonishing...

That simply blows.

People can't lock stuff on my server :-), so I'm not worred about this.


Hmm. I just thought of something. Assume you have two people: Joe checks in
a bunch of stuff, creating new version resources. He then follows with a
bunch of SET-TARGET methods, so the VCRs get update. Jane fetches the VCRs
and sees his changes.

Now... what if Joe was replaced by an automatic process? From Jane's
standpoint, she doesn't care *how* the VCRs are updated, just that they are.

In other words, I might argue that the server can pretend there is somebody
out there updating all the VCRs in the repository to point to the "latest"
revision. The logs don't show it :-), but it is happening.

Does the spec forbid this? :-)
