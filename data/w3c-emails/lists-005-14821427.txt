I believe this draft reflects the current consensus on how to 
resolve the issues raised during the last call period.  In particular,
wrt the outstanding issues, my reading of the consensus is:
- keep REPORT (i.e. do not replace with PROPFIND)
- require version-URL's not to be re-used (I believe only Lisa is
  against this, and not for difficulty of implementation reasons)
- keep version history resources optional.

The changes were primarily in the layout of the document, but the
design team feels that there were enough changes to merit a second
last-call on the modified draft.  In particular, I will post
draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-11 on 1/1/01.  There will then
a 2 week working group last call on this document.  If there are
no substantive changes from this last call, we will submit the -11
draft to the IESG.

I'll be monitoring the mailing list closely between now and 1/1/01,
and would appreciate any reviews of the 10.11 working draft.

Cheers,
Geoff
