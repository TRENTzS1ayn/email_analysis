   From: Juergen Reuter <reuterj@ira.uka.de>

   Is there any way to determine the set of activities for a working
   resource as was specified in a preceding CHECKOUT?  Probably, somewhere
   in section 13, there should be a DAV:activity-set defined for working
   resources.

A working resource is defined as having all the properties of a checked
out version-controlled resource.  Since a checked out version-controlled
resource has a DAV:activity-set, so does a working resource.

   And in section 13.9, there should be a DAV:checkout-set
   property (as in section 5.1.4) defined on activity resources, right?

That seems reasonable.  I've added this in the 10.11 draft.  If anyone
objects, please let me know.

Cheers,
Geoff
