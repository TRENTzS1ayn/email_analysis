Here is the response from the working group to Yaron's comments.
These changes appear in the current (10-11) working draft.

   ------- Act I --------------

   (I.1) Get rid of DAV:must-support attribute, and instead define tokens
 for use in an If header.

Done.

   (I.2) Add an intermediate node above any list of property names in a
 report request or response, so that the report can be extended
 with additional XML markup.

Done.  (I think I caught them all).

   (I.3) Add an "unknown" value for checkin-date.

The working group felt a "null" value was appropriate for this,
rather than defining an "unknown" value.

   (I.4) Require that the 403/409 response body token appear as the top
 level element "unless explicitly negotiated otherwise", so that
 clients get predictable behavior, but later specs can allow
 clients to request other behavior.

Done.

   (I.5) Need to define the precondition for when cannot place a resource
 at this place. (one per resource type).

Done.

   (I.6) Have an example show additional elements in request body being
 ignored by the request.

This will be reflected in the "scenarios" document, since this is just
one of many interesting examples that are worth describing.

   (I.7) Add a response body to VERSION-CONTROL, so that can indicate
   whether
 it is a no-op or not.  <DAV:already-under-control/>

Done.

   (I.8) Whenever a statement of the form "the xxx specified in the yyy
 element" refers to an element in the request body, it should
 explicitly say "the xxx specified in the yyy element in the
 request body".

Done wherever there was a chance of ambiguity.

   (I.9) Indicate which live properties are controlled by a lock.

Done (in particular, every versioning live property is controlled by
a write lock).

Cheers,
Geoff
