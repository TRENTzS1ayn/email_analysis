   From: "Geoffrey M. Clemm" <geoffrey.clemm@rational.com>

   (II.1) F and T should be false and true to allign the direction of the
  XML Schema look of allignment with XML schema wherever we can
  (at least by value).

Done.

   (II.2) Require the value of DAV:comment to be XML, for internationalization.

Removed the restriction that it be a string, but did not require it to be XML.

   (II.3) Don't constrain the value of DAV:creator-displayname to be a string.

Done.

   (II.4) Require version-name to be XML, for internationalization.

Removed the restrictin that it be a string, but did not require it to be XML.

   (II.5) Move all DAV:supported-xxx properties to the OPTIONS response.
  Move all DAV:xxx-collection-set properties to the OPTIONS
  response.

Done.

   (II.6) Require that a version URL never be re-used after a version is
  deleted.

Done.

   (II.7) Add tokens for If header that check whether specific
  checkout/checkin forking behavior is supported by the server.

Deferred.  This can be added later if there is sufficient interest.

   (II.8) Allow "ancestor", "descendant", (or both), and "all" as options
  to the DAV:version-tree report.

Deferred.  This can be added later if there is sufficient interest.

   (II.9) Require that a PUT to a locked auto-versioned resource be just
  CHECKOUT/update (i.e. omit the CHECKIN).  Then have an UNLOCK
  of an auto-checked-out versioned resource be a CHECKIN.

Done.

Cheers,
Geoff
