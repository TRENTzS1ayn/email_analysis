   From: "Geoffrey M. Clemm" <geoffrey.clemm@rational.com>

   (II.1) F and T should be false and true to allign the direction of the
       XML Schema look of allignment with XML schema wherever we can
       (at least by value).

Done.

   (II.2) Require the value of DAV:comment to be XML, for
internationalization.

Removed the restriction that it be a string, but did not require it to be
XML.

   (II.3) Don't constrain the value of DAV:creator-displayname to be a
string.

Done.

   (II.4) Require version-name to be XML, for internationalization.

Removed the restrictin that it be a string, but did not require it to be
XML.

<tim>
    So what's a guy to do?  If it is not necessarily XML it must be
    handled as a String -- which means all of those <'s and &'s must
    be escaped.  Of course if a different client retrieves the comment
    and the XML is un-escaped on the way out, it won't be internationalized
    to the client's taste.
    I guess that the objection to it's being XML is that the comment
    is typically accessible by other (non-NLS'd) tools that would only
    expect a String.
</tim>

   (II.5) Move all DAV:supported-xxx properties to the OPTIONS response.
       Move all DAV:xxx-collection-set properties to the OPTIONS
       response.

Done.

<tim>
    Do we need DAV:supported-live-properties?
    Servers are required to protect the names of all live properties
    (whether they support them or not), so PROPPATCH will fail if the
    property is unsupported.
    Servers should not define a live property that it does not support,
    and PROPFIND would return 404 Not Found.
</tim>


   (II.6) Require that a version URL never be re-used after a version is
       deleted.

Done.

   (II.7) Add tokens for If header that check whether specific
       checkout/checkin forking behavior is supported by the server.

Deferred.  This can be added later if there is sufficient interest.

   (II.8) Allow "ancestor", "descendant", (or both), and "all" as options
       to the DAV:version-tree report.

Deferred.  This can be added later if there is sufficient interest.

   (II.9) Require that a PUT to a locked auto-versioned resource be just
       CHECKOUT/update (i.e. omit the CHECKIN).  Then have an UNLOCK
       of an auto-checked-out versioned resource be a CHECKIN.

Done.

Cheers,
Geoff
