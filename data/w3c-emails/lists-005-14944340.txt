   Should this be in the versioning protocol, or in an update to 2518? (Or
   is it intended that the versioning RFC update 2518?)

This is something that is needed by the versioning protocol, but which
is of sufficient generality as to be a reasonable candidate for
inclusion in an update to 2518.  So it MUST appear in the versioning
protocol (since we don't want to delay the versioning protocol until
an update to 2518 is completed), and they SHOULD appear in the update
to 2518.

Cheers,
Geoff
