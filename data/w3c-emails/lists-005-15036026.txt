True. But I can also get it from the activity-MERGE you just defined. And
that is much better.

(the version-set on an activity could be a little troublesome for me; not

Well, going against the DAV:version-set, it identifies the version
resources, so I'm already there. Not a problem. But the question is probably
moot for my case.
