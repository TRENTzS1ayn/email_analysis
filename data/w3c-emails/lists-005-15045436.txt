FWIW:

If the VCR is already checked out, I chose to return 409 Conflict
<DAV:must-not-be-checked-out/>.  If a client sends CHECKOUT to a resource
that is not under version control I return 403 Forbidden
<DAV:must-be-version-or-version-controlled-resource/>.

For a complete list of the 403/409 split (which was derived somewhat
arbitrarily) see
