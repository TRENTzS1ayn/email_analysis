   (II.4) Require version-name to be XML, for internationalization.

Removed the restrictin that it be a string, but did not require it to be
XML.

<tim>
    So what's a guy to do?  If it is not necessarily XML it must be
    handled as a String -- which means all of those <'s and &'s must
    be escaped.  Of course if a different client retrieves the comment
    and the XML is un-escaped on the way out, it won't be internationalized
    to the client's taste.
    I guess that the objection to it's being XML is that the comment
    is typically accessible by other (non-NLS'd) tools that would only
    expect a String.

<jra>
I think it should be XML too. Remember PCDATA is acceptable XML, and its
just a string. This should follow the same convention as DAV:owner for lock
owners for example.
