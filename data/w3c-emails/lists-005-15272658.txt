Hi Mark!

I was aware you were planning on sending in a review by the
first week of January, so I made sure that the last call
period (from 1/1/01 to 1/15/01) did not interfere with that,
but I'm also happy to delay posting the draft until 1/5/01,
so that we can get anything you find fixed up before sending
it out for last call (such as those section 0 references,
thanks to Word's idea of how to silently update cross
references!).

So the two week last call period will now begin on 1/5/01.

Cheers,
Geoff

I request that the the draft be submitted on 1/5/01 for last call at the
earliest.

I am working with our team to prepare some comments to 10.12.
Realistically, a number of people are out for the holidays and will not
return until 1/2 for final input.

I am also trying to correct section references like the following in Section
5:

"In order to ensure unambiguous merging (see section 6.2) and baselining
(see section 0) ..."

Happy New Year as well,

Mark
