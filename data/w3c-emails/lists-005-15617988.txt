Not sure what happened there.  I'll just restore that section
from version 13 unless I can figure out what that was all about.
Thanks for noticing!

Cheers,
Geoff

What happened to the DAV:prop stuff in the MERGE request? I'm not seeing it
anywhere in the -14 draft. I don't recall any conversation about removing
that.
