I'm glad to see from the meeting notes that I wasn't the only one who
wondered about Core versus Basic (Core + checkout + fork control).  I agree
with Mark and Larry that Core is sufficient to implement versioning, and
with Eric that some clients will be perfectly happy to deal with Core-level
servers.  So I believe DeltaV should have a package which is just Core.  I
would not replace Core with Basic.  Given that decision, I would rename
Basic to avoid the implication that it's the minimum package, or otherwise
make it clear that Core is the minimum.

I disagree with Geoff and JimW that adding checkout and fork control is low
cost for any server wishing to be DeltaV-compliant.  Recall that checkout
requires mutable VCRs on the server which hold intermediate state between
checkout and checkin, whereas Core has no such requirement.  Core allows all
server-resident resources to be immutable, which is arguably a more
consistent model than the mixed model with checkout (mutable checked-out
VCRs, everything else immutable).  For existing versioning servers that
disallow mutable objects, the cost of supporting checkout is non-trivial,
because code would have to be written to subvert the fundamental design of
the server.
