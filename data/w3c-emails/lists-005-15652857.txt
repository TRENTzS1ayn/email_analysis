Thanks for taking and posting the notes, John!

Just one minor correction to the minutes:

   Have talked it over with ADs to see what kind of standard they need to
   meet before submitting draft to AD; Patrik said it's really down to
   whether the chair thinks there's consensus. If the AD doesn't find any
   omissions/flaws, then they'll issue the IESG Last Call.

Yes, this was Patrik.

   Patrik has already given one approving comment on the doc (he likes
   server-side workspaces), suggesting that he's been keeping track of
   deltav well enough that he's probably already spotted major gotchas
   that might hold it up.

It actually was Ned who made this comment (Ned is the
AD responsible for the DeltaV protocol).
I'm not sure that it would be appropriate
to infer that he's already spotted major gotchas that might hold
it up (Ned made no such claim), but I felt it was a
good indication of his knowledge and interest in the area.

Cheers,
Geoff
