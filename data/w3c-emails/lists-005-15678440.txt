Agenda:

Discuss the changes proposed at the Minneapolis IETF

- split Variant into separate spec (no objections so far)

- merge Fork-Control into Checkout (no objections so far)

- define four "feature-sets" or "option-sets" (defined in earlier message)

- defer label header, but keep LABEL method

- defer UPDATE method

I'll try to get a 14.1 draft posted to the deltav web site before
Friday.

Cheers,
Geoff
