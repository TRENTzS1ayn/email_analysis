A version-controlled configuration is always associated with a
baseline-controlled collection (and is used to capture the state
of the configuration rooted at that baseline-controlled collection).
Since you can always check-out/modify/check-in the members of the
baseline-controlled collection, this effectively lets you modify
that membership of that baseline-controlled collection, unconstrained
by the current state of the associated version-controlled configuration.

In contrast a "baseline", like any other version, is always immutable.

Cheers,
Geoff

"always possible" ?? How is that? This proposal seems predicated on a VCC
being mutable, but I don't understand why that would be so. I seem them as
quite immutable.
