Take the word 'schon' in German, which can also be spelled
'schoen'.  There is a convention that specifies that umlauts can
be replaced by a following "e" and still be the same word.  It is
not the case that binary comparisons can be done even for equality
for natural language strings.

However, your point is still valid--I thought the reasons to get
rid of the Label header were:

* make label just a property and remove an option, simplifying
  the client testing problem
* shorten the spec
* nobody at the working group cared that much about the header
* avoid the language pain in the a** with respect to internationalizing
the header

The language issue isn't sufficient by itself.
