IF you do comparisons of any kind, you MUST define how a match is to
defined.

When comparing Unicode characters, my take is that you have to do things
like the IDN wg is talking about. See for example
draft-ietf-idn-nameprep-03.txt which talks about the operations you have to
do on two strings _before_ you do the actual comparison.

So, comparing human readable text is hard, very hard, but possible.
