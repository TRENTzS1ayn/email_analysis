I guess it just depends on which perspective you take.
If you are looking at it from the baseline point of view then the
version-controlled configuration should remain checked-in, but if you are
looking at it from the baseline-controlled configuration then it should
remain checked out.

It can be argued either way, but I think of a version-controlled
configuration as being 'more closely associated with' the baseline -- but
don't ask me to give a good reason<g>
So I would expect the version-controlled configuration to be in a
checked-in state for most of the time, then be checked out and checked in
to capture the new baseline (i.e. the opposite of the proposal).

In the above description, you're modifying the baseline-controlled
collection (BCC). You aren't modifying the VCC.

I still see no point in putting the VCC in a permanently-checked-out state.

If you're concerned about consistency between the BCC and the baseline
referred to by the checked-in VCC, then the answer is to make the BCC
readonly. Not to say the VCC is always checked out.

Checking out the VCC would then allow the BCC to be modified. I have no
opinion on whether a server can always (force) a VCC to remain checked out.
But the spec should not mandate that situation.

[ in Subversion, the VCC cannot be checked out and the BCC is readonly; you
  must use working resources to create a new baseline, all of which is then
  merged into the BCC and VCC ]
