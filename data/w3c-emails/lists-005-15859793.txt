hold on, that is what I said -- that we don't describe the label as a
language attributed value, it is just a string, a sequence of characters
with a well defined encoding scheme.

I think you are very brave to go down this road, and I predict it will end
in tears.  Are you are seriously suggesting that you will match based on
language rules?  Maybe just language name?  It is unneccessary and I
suggest beyond VCM expectations.

I agree we do not want any attributes.  I still want the Label: header.
