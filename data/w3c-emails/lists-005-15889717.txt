A label is a human-readable string. To correctly display an arbitrary
sequence of Unicode characters, a computer must know the language of the
string. This allows the computer to, for example, draw the characters left
to right, or right to left, as appropriate.

Thus the language tag is necessary.

However, this is all predicated on the label being just a single string.
What if label is changed into the pair:

(label_id, label_displayname)

Comparisons could be performed against the label_id (which is a
computer-generated ID), and the label displayname could be shown to the
user. This would keep the human readability, while avoiding the i18n string
comparison problems. Header marshalling would be ugly, but feasible.
