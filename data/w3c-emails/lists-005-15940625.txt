The CHECKOUT method is defined both in the "checkout" feature and
in the "working resource" feature.  In the "checkout" feature, you
can only apply CHECKOUT to a version-controlled resource.  In the
"working-resource" feature, you can only apply CHECKOUT to a version.

So both features have a CHECKOUT method, but they are applied to 
different kinds of resources.  In the client workspace package,
you can only apply CHECKOUT to a version (which results in a
working resource).

Cheers,
Geoff

How do you create a working resource if you don't have checkout?
