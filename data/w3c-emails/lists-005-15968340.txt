Some days late now but nevertheless I would like to give my 0.02$:

The problem that a label can be a four letter word in another language :-)
doesn't strike me as very relevant in practice.
Also the drawing direction of the characters is implicitly encoded
in the characters themselves, isn't it ?
So I think that a label as a simple string of UNICODE characters would be
good enough and simple to implement too.
Not aesthetically perfect, but a working solution if you want to draw people
from RCS, CVS, Clearcase to name a few, which heavily rely on labels.
So I would keep the label header as a simple UNICODE string.

Cheers, Edgar
