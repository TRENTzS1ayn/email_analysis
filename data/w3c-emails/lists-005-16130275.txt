In an effort to wrap my brain around all of the autoversioning options, I
developed the following table. I'm hoping some variant of this might make it
into the specification, since I believe it could increase the correctness of
implementations of this feature.  I'm also curious to see if I got it all
right (I'm most curious about the checked-in states...) :-)

Abreviations used:

ci = check-in (or checked-in)
co = check-out (or checked-out)
ul = unlock
lk = lock
-> = sequence of operations (1->2)
acoaci = always-checkout-always-checkin
acowuci = always-checkout-when-unlocked-checkin
wlco = when locked checkout
coouakco = checkout-on-update-and-keep-checked-out

Operation "write" is defined to be the state modification action of the
method. For a PUT, write = changing the body.  For PROPPATCH, write =
changing the property values.

The table is orgazined as follows:

rows correspond to specific states of the resource (e.g., checked out and
write locked).
columns correspond to specific autoversion options
cells contain descriptions of what happens when specific methods are invoked
under these conditions
