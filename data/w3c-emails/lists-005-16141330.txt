The table looks correct to me, in terms of the old DAV:auto-version
terminology.  I support Jim's suggestion that such a table go into the
specification, because it leaves much less room for misinterpretation and
error than a prose-only expression of the semantics.  Geoff has done a
wonderful job of expressing the semantics in a concise set of sentences, but
it's almost like solving a puzzle to wring out of those sentences the
semantics spelled out in Jim's table.  Rather than requiring each
implementor to solve the puzzle, and possibly end up with an incorrect
solution, I like the idea of spelling out the semantics in a table.  As I
noted in my earlier message, I also prefer the old terminology.
