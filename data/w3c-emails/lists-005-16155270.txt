   So it remains (probably you already know that yourself) that the
   beginning of 'Baseline feature' needs some rewording. Especially
   the the first sentence and the stuff on components which seems to
   imply that you have to move it out of the baseline scope to create
   a subbaseline.

Good point!  (I did realize that the subbaseline stuff needed to
be reworded, but I didn't notice that the first sentence also needs
to be changed ... thanks for pointing that out!).

   BTW, I agree with your roadmap for 15. That also means that I can
   accept a language attribute for labels. But please NO additional
   comparison rules if we can avoid it.

Agreed.  The language attributes are there for display purposes,
but do not affect the matching (which is simple UTF-8 byte comparison).

   I already shudder when I
   think about the question whether two strings which are identical
   but have nominally a different encoding (UTF8 or ASCII7) match.  So
   would it be possible to say a label must be in UTF8 and optionally
   a language attribute is allowed ?

We do require that the label be in UTF-8 when it appears in a
header.  We don't require UTF-8 in the XML, because we want to
just use standard XML language encoding rules (which among other
things, allows a language attribute).  But the transformation
between other Unicode encodings and UTF-8 are well defined.

Cheers,
Geoff
