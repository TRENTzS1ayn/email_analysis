Yes.  It would be preferrable if the features had names that did not
collide with method names since that triped me up, and I can imagine it
being a source of confusion in the future -- e.g. "when you say your server
implements checkout, do you mean the 'checkout' feature or the 'CHECKOUT'
method?", the feature being a subset of the method.

wrt packages of features, I'm quite indifferent to the idea.
