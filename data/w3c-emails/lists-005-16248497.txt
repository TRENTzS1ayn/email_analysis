Jim:

Your conclusions are correct.

In particular, as you surmise, you do not use COPY.
This is deliberate, because a "copy"
does not share the same "version history"
as the resource it was copied from because they are two
different resources.

But you do use VERSION-CONTROL.  In particular, you would
use PROPFIND (Depth:Infinity) to find out the DAV:checked-in
and DAV:checked-out versions in /users/lisa/projectX.
Then you would use a VERSION-CONTROL requests with the 
appropriate version URL in the request body to initialize
the version-controlled resources in /users/chuck/projectX.

Or if /users/lisa/projectX is under baseline control,
you could initialize /users/chuck/projectX with a baseline
from /users/lisa/projectX in a single request.

Cheers,
Geoff

Subject: Workspace question


I'm trying to figure out how the following scenario would work:

Say there are two people, Lisa and Chuck, and they each want to have a
server-side workspace for a small project.

Let's assume Lisa creates the initial workspace:

MKWORKSPACE /users/lisa/projectX/

Then populates it with the project files.

PUT /users/lisa/projectX/makefile
PUT /users/lisa/projectX/main.c
PUT /users/lisa/projectX/proj.h

Then place them under version control:

VERSION-CONTROL /users/lisa/projectX/makefile
VERSION-CONTROL /users/lisa/projectX/main.c
VERSION-CONTROL /users/lisa/projectX/proj.h

So, workspace /users/lisa/projectX now contains three version-controlled
resources:

/users/lisa/projectX/makefile
/users/lisa/projectX/main.c
/users/lisa/projectX/proj.h

At this point, how do I create the workspace for Chuck?

One thing that seemingly might make sense is to just do:

COPY /users/lisa/projectX  TO /users/chuck/projectX
Depth: infinity

But, there are no defined COPY semantics for workspaces.

Alternately, it seems Chuck would need to do:

MKWORKSPACE /users/chuck/projectX/

Then create new version-controlled resources for the existing version
histories:

VERSION-CONTROL /users/chuck/projectX/makefile
VERSION-CONTROL /users/chuck/projectX/main.c
VERSION-CONTROL /users/chuck/projectX/proj.h

Do I have this right?
