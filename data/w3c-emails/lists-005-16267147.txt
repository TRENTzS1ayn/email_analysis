I am completely neutral on whether we use the term
"configuration" or the term "component" to mean
"a collection and all members of that collection".

I would still use the term "baseline" to mean 
"component version", since the term baseline is
commonly used, and it ties our concepts to common
usage.

Is anyone else either for or against switching from
"configuration" to "component"?

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,
I know that it's late and probably Geoff is busy rewriting 14.1 to produce
15, but nevertheless here I have a proposal which would make some concepts
easier to understand IMHO.
In 11 (Baseline feature) a couple of new terms appear:
Configuration, meaning a tree of resources rooted at a root (:-) collection,
a technical term.
Baseline, a technical term which probably is just there because the feature
is
called like that, because basically it's just another word for
'configuration version'
Components, a logical term which is used to rationalize subbaselines.
So I would like to introduce just one new term: Component. And define it
like
the old Configuration (So Configuration disappears)
Instead BASELINE-CONTROL use COMPONENT-CONTROL. The necessity for Baseline
disappears. It's just a 'component version'.
Subbaseline-set becomes subcomponent-set and so on.
A 'Component feature' would show better I think what we want to gain than 
'Baseline feature'.
So the beginning could e.g. be:

11 COMPONENT FEATURE
A "component" is a set of resources that consists of a root collection and
all
menbers of that root collection which aren't a component themselves. ...

This would just be a (Not so small I admit) editorial change. No different
functionality.
I hope I didn't miss something you can't do if you drop Configuration and
Baseline.

Cheers, Edgar
