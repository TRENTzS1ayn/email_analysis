Acceptable. Perhaps we shouldn't be too puristic.

Yesterday a posting told me that 15 is already availabe.
(For some time already it seems if I look at the DELTA-V page).
The introductory part on baselines is much clearer now.
Nevertheless I still would like to drop 'configuration' which
only appears in this context and replace it by 'component'.
As Geoff seems to be neutral on this topic, I really would
like to see at least one or two other opinions.

Cheers, Edgar
