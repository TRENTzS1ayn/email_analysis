   What is a 'file area'?

See above.  A file area is "a tree of files on the client that
reflect the state on the server".

   Sounds similar to the operations currently available under baseline
   -- but I'll wait to hear what a file area is first.

Yes.  The only difference is that it allows you to have multiple file
areas before you are ready to baseline (e.g. you want to compile on a
couple of different platforms before creating the baseline).

Similarly, it is a convenient way to initialize a new workspace to
select the same versions as an existing workspace, even when you are
not ready to "baseline" the state of that existing workspace.

Cheers,
