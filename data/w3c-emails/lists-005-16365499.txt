   How would you do this?  I'm not seeing how this would work from
   reading the spec.

You get the baseline with a DAV:expand-property report or a
couple of PROPFIND's (get the DAV:version-controlled-configuration
of /users/lisa/projectX, and then get the DAV:checked-in baseline
of that configuration).

Then apply BASELINE-CONTROL to /users/chuck/projectX, specifying
that baseline.

Geoff
