I assume by "released", you mean "assigned an RFC number at
proposed draft level?  My personal guess is that an optimistic
answer is 3 months, and a pessimistic answer is 9 months.

We've handed the draft off to our area directors, so they
should be able to give a better estimate (Ned?).

Cheers,
Geoff

Hello, 

I'm wondering if there's a target date for versioning extensions to DAV
standard to be released.
What are the most optimistic and the most pessimistic estimates?

Thanks,
