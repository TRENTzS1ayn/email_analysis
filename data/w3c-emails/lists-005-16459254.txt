   DeltaV people: What does it mean to get the time file content was
   last "modified", if the file is versioned?

Same as if it is not versioned.  The DAV:getlastmodified changes
if the content that would be retrieved by GET changes.

   I don't see that the behaviour of getlastmodified is specified for
   a Version-Controlled Resource, can this be a recommendation in the
   spec to promote consistency?

We normally only mention things that we change/extend.  Since we don't
change anything about the semantics of DAV:getlastmodified, it is not
mentioned.

   For one thing, should 'getlastmodified' on the VCR change when it
   is checked out, or when it is checked in, or both?

Since neither checkout nor checkin modify the content of a VCR,
neither affects the DAV:getlastmodified value.

Cheers,
Geoff
