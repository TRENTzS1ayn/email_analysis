The semantics of Last-Modified is not phrased in terms of
what operation is being applied to a resource (i.e. it doesn't
say "a PUT always causes Last-Modified to be updated"),
but rather is phrased in terms of whether or not the content
(as returned by GET) has been "modified".  So although a server is
allowed to update the Last-Modified date (to the current date)
whenever it wants, an interoperable client cannot count on it
changing unless the content has changed (which would not be
the case for an idempotent PUT).

Cheers,
Geoff

Well, if a client were to PUT the same bytes twice, the content returned by
GET did not change, but I would expect the Last-Modified timestamp to
change.  I guess that is a HTTP/1.1 discussion, and RFC2616#sec14.29 seems
quite flexible on the issue.
