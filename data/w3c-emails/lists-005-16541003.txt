At Adobe our various servers take different positions on this.  We 
have found that clients which have transitioned from doing FTP to 
doing DAV and HTTP 1.0 clients tend to use getlastmodified where they 
really should be using etags, so servers that cater to those clients 
("general purpose servers" :^) are careful not to tamper with 
getlastmodified unless the content changes.  But our high-end 
workflow servers expect savvy clients and users who really care about 
property (read workflow) changes, so they update whether or not 
content changes.
