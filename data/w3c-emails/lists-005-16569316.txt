Adobe's InScope server does a similar thing distinguishing "Assets" 
from "Versions" (which are the content and dead property snapshots of 
the asset); assets as a resource have content and properties (the 
latest version) but also properties that the version doesn't have. 
Many of these "non-content" properties are about the workflow.

Our approach (prior to delta-V) has been to establish a conventional 
relationship between the asset URLs and the version URLs; in fact 
assets are (non-DAV-compliant) collections of their versions.

With delta-V stabilizing we are hoping, going forward, to use delta-V 
mechanisms to connect assets and their versions.
