We always supported tracking the checkin date, but we never
supported tracking the checkout date.  Even with working
resources, although the DAV:creation-date of the working
resource is the checkout date, the working resource is
deleted when it is checked in, and the DAV:creation-date
of the new version resource indicates when that version resource
was created, i.e. the checkin date.

The DAV:checkin-date property was removed from the spec
when we observed that the DAV:checkin date of a version will
always be the DAV:creation-date of that version, so the
DAV:checkin-date was redundant.

The versioning protocol does not modify the behavior/definition
of DAV:getlastmodified, so it just displays its standard behavior,
i.e. it MUST change if the content of the resource changes, and
it MAY change for other reasons (such as a change to some property
value). 

Cheers,
Geoff

Just wondering...

In early versions of DeltaV there was a DAV:checkin-date property
defined on version resources.  Together with DAV:creationdate, one
was able to track both, the checkin and the checkout date.
According to the current draft, should I use DAV:getlastmodified
instead?  (Note on issue WRITE_DAV_PROP: This would require the
lastmodified date not being affected, when properties on version
resources are modified.)

Greetings,
            Juergen
