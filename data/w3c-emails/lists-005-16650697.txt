I scanned the archives, but could not find anything about
this. In case I missed it, my humble excuses for posting
this again:

The response to a VERSION-CONTROL request does not carry
a Location header similar to CHECKIN (Draft 15). Now, I
would propose that the client receives such a header
in case the resource changed status from versionable to
versioned (and is now checked-in).

Scenario: with basic versioning a user might have checked
out a number of resources for editing. Now he adds a couple
of new resources which are initially not under version control.
Then he (or rather his client application) tries to check in
all resources he has created or changed, issuing CHECKIN and
VERSION-CONTROL requests.

Outcome 1: all requests succeed and the client application
can display the version URIs of the checked-in versions to
the user by using the Location headers of the responses.

Outcome 2: resources were checked in our put under version
control by someone else. In this case the client application
can be aware of the modified resource by
a) failed CHECKIN requests for already checked in resources
b) missing Location headers for resource already under version
   control.

Does this make sense to anyone but me?
