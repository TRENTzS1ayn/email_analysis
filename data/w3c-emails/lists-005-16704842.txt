Apologies to "dist-auth", my mailer is screwed up and this went to the
wrong list, twice.
I intended it to go to Delta-V.
------------

Just to be pedantic, in versioning-15

section 14.2
"A collection has all the properties of a version."
Taken out of context this is misleading.

Section 14.3
"In particular, a working [collection] resource is initialized to contain
... of the checked out [collection] version."

I suggest adding the word 'collection' twice, as indicated above.

Section 14.3.1

Should this be marked a required property?
