I completely agree with a).  Thanks for all of the details making it very
clear why this is necessary for versioning.

(a) We should extend <DAV:resourcetype> to provide all this classification
    information in a single property.

As far as

I don't see why that's that much different from what we do right now (get
all of the names and see if the one you want is there)
