   Given that the checkout feature only applies to version-controlled
   resources, and not to versions, does this mean that Fork-Control only
   applies to VCRs?  Shouldn't it apply to versions as well?

The fork-control properties are on versions, not VCR's, but I agree
that since both the "checkout" and the "working-resource" features
introduce a CHECKOUT method that is affected by these properties,
the fork-control properties should be identified in
both features.  Since this is just an editorial change that has no
semantic impact, I'm assuming nobody will object if I make this change
during the IESG last call period?

Cheers,
Geoff
