This touches on an issue I (the guy with the webdav [maybe caching
a little] proxy) have with discovering type and status of a WebDAV resource.

As Geoff made quite clear, DAV:supported-live-property-set contains all
there is to know about a versioned resource. But what about versionable
resources? Will/Should they have any versioning props apart from
DAV:supported-method-set with at least VERSION-CONTROL as content?

How is supported-method-set supposed to work in conjunction with other
WebDAV extensions (ordered collections, reference, etc.) Will all those
methods be mentioned there as well? Won't deltaV become a necessary
functionality for these extensions, then?
If not, does OPTIONS then remain a better place to look for methods?
