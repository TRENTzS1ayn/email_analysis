I am Mrs vivian chinamasa , a widow and national of
zimbabwe . I was married to late Mr.peter chinamasa , a
left - Wing leader and a strong opposition to the
government of zimbabwe. led by Robert Mugabe. My husband ,
late Peter chinamasa's death was politically motivated
during white farmers Revolt over land ownership and
acquisition by government last year which led to mass
killing, rape and treason in  zimbabwe.My husband, WILLand
TESTAMENT as executed by a reputable attorney shows that he
bequeath his personal effects ,his two houses here in
zimbabwe , and fifteen Million Dollars (US$15M)which is
presently with a security company Abroad to me his widow
and our seven year old son,Tony Chinamasa absolutely. My
son and I as the trustee of this WILL can apply the fifteen
Million Dollars (US$15M) in any viable investment with the
aid of an investor we so desire.
I really need your advise and cooperation so that this
money ,Fifteen million United States Dollars (US$15M) can
be invested in your company or any viable project in your
country as my safety and that of my son is no longer
guaranteed in zimbabwe.Government forces keep watch on my
husband's house twenty four hours daily.

not fail me.
