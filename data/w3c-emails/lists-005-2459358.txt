Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Mr Dave Austine I got your contact through a friend who attended a trade
mission in your country, but I did not disclose the nature of the business
to him.I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On
June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor, Mr. Charles Ballassi
with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, made a numbered time (fixed)
deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,700,000.00(Twenty Million
Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a rountine
notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.After a month,we
sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that he died in the plane crash
of 31 October 1999[with Egyptian 990] with other passengers aboaed as you
can confirm it yourself via the website below:
www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html

on further investigation, i found out that he died without making a WILL,and
attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further
investigation and discovered that Mr. Charles Ballassi did not declare any
next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank
deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$20,700,000.00 is still in my
bank and the interest isbeing rolled over with the pricipal sum at the end
of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian
law, at the expiration of (five)years, the money will revert to the ownership
of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently,my
proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of
kin to Mr. Charles Ballassi so that the fruit of this old man's labour will
not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple,I
will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that
the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will
put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ
the service of two attorney for the drafting and notarization of the WILL
and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration
in your favour for the transfer. Any bank account in any part of the world
which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to
you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account
for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk
at all, the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney
and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution
of ths transaction. If you are interested,please reply immediately via the
private email address below,upon your responce,i shall provide you with
more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction
would be most profitable for both
of us because i shall require your assitance to invest my share in your
country.

Please upon the reciept of this mail message, send to me the following,to
enable start the process of the fund into your bank account:

1. Your full Name
2. Your private Telephone and fax numbers
Immediately I recieve a mail indicating your interest I shall send you more
details.
