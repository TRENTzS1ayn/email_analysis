of state and commander in chief of the armed forces of the Federal Republic
of Nigeria. She (MRS. M.ABACHA), has as a result of the trust and confidence,she
has in me mandated that I search for a reliable and trust worthy foreign
partner, who will help receive some funds which she had in cash totaling
US$80M (Eighty Million United States Dollars only) into a personal, company
or any reliable foreign bank accounts within or outside your country as
all their personal and family Bank accounts within and outside Nigeria have
all been frozen by the Nigerian authorities.

This money in question has however, been Deposited with a security company
that has branches in Africa, Europe and various parts of Asia. It may also
interest you to note that she (MRS. ABACHA) and her family have, since the
inception of the present democratic government, been placed under partial
house arrest, with their international travelling passports seized pending
when the current fund recovery face off between them and the present (RTD)
GEN, OBASANJO led Democratic Government is resolved, in which from all indication
will not exceed this year. She has decided to offer anybody who will be
willing to render this tremendous assistance, 20% of the total sum. Note
that this transaction involves no risks whatsoever, as you will have no
dealing with my country, Nigeria. Rather you will deal directly with the
Security Company, which is based where the money will be recieved by you.
