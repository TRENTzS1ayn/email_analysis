FROM THE DESK OF:
MR.LEU CHENG 
DEPARTMENT OF AUDIT AND RECORDS
BANK OF CHINA 
SHENZHEN CHINA
 
    
 
I am Mr.Leu Cheng , a senior officer of the Bank of China, Shenzhen Branch,
Chin
a. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.
On june 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid
Mine
rals Corporation, Lawrence Smith made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for
twelve
 calendar months, valued at US$30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million Dollars) in my
bran
ch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but
g
ot no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from
hi
s contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. Lawrence
S
mith died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out
tha
t he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was
f
ruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.
Lawrenc
e Smith did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,
incl
uding his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$30,000,000.00 is
sti
ll sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal
s
um at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.
According
 to Laws of Republic of China, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money
wi
ll revert to the ownership of the Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim

the fund. 

   Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in

as 
the next of kin to Mr. Lawrence Smith so that the fruits of this old man's
labor
 will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is
simpl
e, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that
th
e attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put
you
 in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for
dr
afting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and
le
tter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account
in
 any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer
o
f this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into

your account for us to share in the ratio of 90% for me and 10% for you. There
i
s no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the
a
ttorney and my position guarantees the successful execution of this
transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address
ab
ove. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and
relevant
 documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your
co
nfidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please observe
utmo
st confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most
profita
ble for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share
in
 your country.
 
Awaiting your urgent reply via my email address. 
 
Thanks and regards. 
 
Leu Cheng
