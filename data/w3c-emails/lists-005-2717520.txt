Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. I am MR.ANDR? LA GRANGE, the chief executive officer of one of the topmost banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank, Late ANDREAS SCHRANNER, a citizen of Munich, Germany who perished with his whole families on 25TH JULY,2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] with the whole passengers aboard. There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral WILL attatched to the account. Until his death he was the manager,SCHRANNER GOLD[pty]SA. No other person knows about this account or anything concerning it and the account has no other beneficiary.

The fund in question amounts to TWENTY SIX MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS[$26 Million]. Since I discovered this fund,I have personally and quitely made several,deep and extensive enquiries to find out every thing about the late great industrialist,MR.ANDREAS SCHRANNER . The summary of my investigation shows that late ANDREAS SCHRANNER who is a citizen of Germany has no surviving relation. I came across your name and contact on the course of my personal searching for the late ANDREAS SCHRANNER's relations,so I decided to contact you for this project.

I am contacting you to assist me in repatriating and securing the wealth left behind in a fixed deposit account by late ANDREAS SCHRANNER , before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by my bank. The board of my bank, has issued a notice that after 2 months from now and no next of kin shown up for the claim, the funds will be confiscated and declared unserviceable. Since late ANDREAS SCHRANNER died without a HEIR/WILL,I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin of the deceased since you are a foreigner, so that the proceed of this deposit valued at twenty six million United States dollars($26 Million Dollars) can be released to you.

The bank will release the funds to any foreigner who has all related information / documents to the bank account which I am going to provide to you on your positive response. Everything is under my control.

I have secretly discussed this matter with the operational manager in account management section incharge of credit and foreign bills of the bank who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. 

The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of domancy. 

I shall provide you all the information and copy of the certificate of deposit issued to late ANDREAS SCHRANNER when he deposited the fund. I shall also involve a confidential attorney who is a government acredited attorney to the bank who shall represent you in all the appropriate offices for the claim. I also have all necessary information we need for the claim and once the money is transferred to you, I shall destroy all the documents used for the claim and leave no traces. AFTER EVERYTHING, YOU SHALL HAVE 35% OF THE TOTAL SUM, 65% FOR ME, WHILE 5% WILL BE FOR EXPENSES BOTH OF US MUST HAVE INCURED DURING THE PROCESS OF TRANSFERING THIS FUND.

We will start the first transfer with $6 Million. Upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your side, we will go ahead to transfer the balance of $20 Million to the same account and we share. All I require from you is your honest/humble  cooperation to enable us see this business successful. I guarantee you that this business will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Late ANDREAS SCHRANNER was a very good man and it is not wise to allow his hard earned wealth to go in vain. 

Further details awaits your response by my private
email: andregrange@workmail.co.za

PLEASE,TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET.

Best Regards

MR.GRANGE
