  RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 136,000.000.00 USD
  ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS

Dear Sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 136,000.000.00 USD)
One hundred and Thirty six million United States
Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you to
quietly look for a reliable and honest person who
will be capable and fit to provide either an existing
bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately
to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve 
to receive this money, as long as you will remain
honest to me till the end for this important business
trusting in you and believing in God that you will
never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr.Donald Frank, the Auditor General of a bank
in Africa, during the course of our auditing I
discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the
bank in 1995 and since 1998 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files
in the records I discovered that the owner of the
account died without a [heir] hence the money is
floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently
it will be forfeited for nothing as the owner of this
account is Mr. Frankline Sullivan, a foreigner, and a 
sailor, and he died, since 1998. and no other person
knows about this account or any thing concerning it,
the account has no other beneficiary and my
investigation proved to me as well that Frankline
Sullivan until his death was the manager Sulliv
Coy.(pty). SA.

We will start the first transfer with Thirty six
million [$36,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall 
re-apply for the payment of the remaining rest amount
to your account.All this transfer will be tthrough a
bank in London which we have a contact.

The amount involved is (USD 136M) One hundred and
Thirty Six million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $36,000.000 [Thirty Six million
United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest,but I don't 
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this
money can not be approved to a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international
passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is in us dollars
and the former owner of the a/c Mr. Frankline Sullivan is
a foreigner too, [and the money can only be approved
into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us
together I got your contact address from my secretary
who operates computer, I am revealing this to you with
believe in God that you will never let me down in this
business, you are the first and the only person that I
am contacting for this business, so please reply
urgently so that I will inform you the next step 
to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to sign a binding agreement that will bind 
us together before transferring the money to any account 
of your choice where the fund will be safe. Before we fly 
to your country for withdrawal, sharing and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your 
positive response and once I am convinced that you are
capable and will meet up with instruction of a key
bank official who is deeply involved with me in 
this business.

I need your strong assurance that you will never, ever
let me down. With my influence and the position of the
bank official we can transfer this money to any
foreigner's reliable account which you can provide
with assurance that this money will be intact pending
our physical arrival in your country for sharing. The
bank official will destroy all documents of
transaction immediately we receive this money leaving
no trace to any place and to build confidence.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive
this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward 
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries
and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
25% of the total amount, 70% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through this email address
or donald_frank@k.ro



Sincerely,
 
Mr.Donald Frank.
