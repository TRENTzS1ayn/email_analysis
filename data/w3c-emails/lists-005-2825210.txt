FROM: ENGR. AMACHI NNAMCHI PAUL
MEMBER, PETROLEUM (SPECIAL) TRUST FUND 
{PTF} HQTRS
Dear Sir,
I Am MR, AMACHI NNAMCHI PAUL a senior civil sevant in the contract award committee for the petroleum special trust fund. I know that this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have not met in person. please bear with me. 
We are in search for a reliable and honest partner abroad that we can entrust with the sum of us$35million.(THIRTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) These funds originated from contract we executed for the petroleum trust fund (PTF) Purpose -for the supply and installations of oil-pipeline to Port-Harcourt and Warri Refineries. This contract has been executed and full payments have been made to the contractors who executed these contract leaving behind us$35million as an over-invoice amount for we the committee members on a mutual understanding. 
In view of this, my colleague has mandated me to look for a foreign partner abroad who will receive the money on our behalf since as civil servants with restrictions on financial matters, we can not put up claims for the money in our names, neither are we alloowed to own or operate foreign accounts. Which means that you will provide us with any account of your choice where we can lodge this fund immediately. I will be visiting your country upon your confirmation of recieving the fund in your nominated account, to know you better and discuss viable investment ideas such as importation of goods back to our country since it will be unwise to return with such huge cash. 
DISBURSEMENT OF THE FUND IS AS FOLLOWS: 25% of the total sum will be your share asaccoumt provider and the one to be fronted and register here as the bonafide beneficiary of the fund towards seeking the necessary approvals that would enable its remittance to the account you nominate. 70% will be for me and my colleague . 5% will be an outstanding amount to settle any incurred expenses during the transfer. WE ASSURE YOU THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE AND VERY LEGITIMATE AS ALL MODALITIES HAVE BEEN PERFECTED BY US WITH OUR CONNECTION IN GOVERNMENT. What matters most is honesty on your side and for you to keep everything confidential until this fund is dully remitted into your nominated account. 
If this business interests you, please do not hesitate to email me as a matter of urgency with your contact phone and fax numbers so that I can give you more details. Cheers and God bless you.
MR, AMACHI NNAMCHI PAUL
