Sir/Madam,

  We are heartened to inform you of the unique result of the Diana Trust fund Lotto program held on the 15th of March, 2004. Your e-mail address attached to ticket number: 678950347487 with corresponding serial number: 099-563588 drew lucky numbers: 84-34-23-11-20-18 which consequently won in the 3nd category. You have therefore been approved for a pay-out of 400,000.00 EUROS (Four Hundred Thousand Euros).

We advise you to keep your winning information undisclosed until your claim has been processed and your fund remitted to you. It is a part of our security procedure to avert double claiming and unwarranted abuse of this program by some unscrupulous participants. All participants were selected through a computer ballot system drawn from over 20,000 companies and 30,000,000 individual email addresses and names from all over the world.

 This lottery was promoted and sponsored by eminent personalities whose names would be made public soon. We hope that with part of your winning, you will participate in our next year 5 MILLION EUROS GRAND LOTTO SUPER.

Please you are requested to come personally to file in your claim, however if you cannot make it to London, please contact below approved private attorney to assist you with the release of your fund into your desired bank account or by check.
