Hello

 First, I must solicit your confidence in this
transaction, this is by virtue of its nature. Though I know
that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that
all will be well at the end of the It all. For the purpose of introduction, I am TONY OSHOMO, Head Banking Operations, Pacific International Bank Ltd, 

                    
              THE PROPOSITION:
A foreigner, late Engineer Johnson Creek, an Oil
Merchant/Contractor with the Federal Govenment of
Nigeria, until his death three years ago in a ghastly
auto crash, banked with us here at Pacific
International Bank PLC., Lagos, and had a closing
balance of  15.2M ( Fifteen Million Two Hundred
Thousand US only) which the bank
now unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his
available foreign next of kin or alternatively be
donated to a discredited trust fund for arms and
ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria.
Efforts have been made by the Bank to
get in touch with any of the Creek family or relatives
but all have proved to no avail. It is because of the
perceived possibility of not going to be able to
locate any of late Engr. Johnson Creek's next of kin
(he had no known wife and children) that the
management under the influence of our Chairman, Board
of Directors, Retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu,
that an arrangement for the fund to be declared 
"UNCLAIMABLE" and then be subsequently donated to the
Trust Fund for Arms and Ammunition which will further
enhance the course of war in Africa and the world in
general.

In order to avert this negative development, myself
and some of my trusted colleagues in the bank now seek
for your permission to have you stand as late Engr.
Johnson Creek's next of kin so that the fund, would be subsequently transferred and paid
into your account as the beneficiary next of kin.

All documents and proves to enable you get this fund
have been carefully worked out and we are assuring you
a safe transaction. Your share shall be told to you as soon as you are willing to stand

If this proposal is acceptable to you reach me for a more detailed picture.
