Greetings,

Please permit me to contact you through this medium. I am a medical practitioner, Dr. Stephen Eneli. I have a patient I am treating privately because of her status. She is the wife of a prominent politician here in South Africa. She is Mrs. Susan Yengeni and has been ill for a couple of months now. This woman confided in me based on the free medical attention I have been giving to her and revealed to me her life ordeals, which is very touching. Her husband, Mr. Tony Yengeni, was arrested and charged to court for a multibillion dollar arms deal fraud which she said was politically motivated by his enemies as her husband was the chairman of parliament in South Africa and the former chief whip of the ruling political party. 

She also told me that he accented to plead guilty in exchange for his acquittal on corruption charges but was later convicted on trumped-up charges. This led to his bank accounts in South Africa and abroad being frozen. Now, things are really bad for her husband and children. Based on this, she cannot even afford to take care of her medical expenses. This is why I am rendering her free medical attention. Due to the fact that her husband is still being monitored, she was advised by him to source for a credible and trustworthy partner abroad who will help in managing and investing some funds he secretly deposited in a security firm for safe keeping some years ago. The amount is US$117.5million contained in sealed boxes. 

He deposited these boxes with a safe security company in one of the European countries for safekeeping as family treasures and African artifacts to prevent the officials of the company from raising eyebrow. I wish and believe you will be in a position to assist in managing this large sum for a profitable venture and also to help create a safe heaven for her and her children by making a residential arrangement for them in your country. After she had disclosed this information to me, I saw the reason to request that she allows me see the documents relating to this deposit of which she did. I will oblige you with more information as soon as I receive your response via my personal/confidential email: seneli@5fm.za.com for security reasons. 

You can find more about her husband's predicaments at the following websites:

Let me assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free. From my discussion with her, she has agreed to give you a reasonable percentage of the money for your assistance, which will be negotiated and agreed on by both sides. I am obliged to assist this lady knowing that she has a limited knowledge in the business world. I will need from you a mutual understanding and then we shall make plans of how the funds would be secured into an account in your name. 

Thanks and God bless you for your understanding. Please do not forget to email me your private telephone number so that I can give you a call to discuss this matter if you are interested in this offer. 

Best regards. 

Dr. Stephen Eneli
