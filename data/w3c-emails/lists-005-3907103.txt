DEAR Friend ,


 Please don't be surprised to receive this letter from me since we do not know each other before now. I am MRS. JULIANA MBULUKU MAKELE, the wife of late TATE MAKELE , a farmer in ZIMBABWE who was murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through network online hence decided to write you.

 Before the death of my husband, he made a deposit with a security Firm. The consignment was declared to contain GEM STONES shipped on diplomatic cover to avoid customs detecting the actual contents. The actual content is the sum of US25.5 million (twenty Five Million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars only). This was done when he noticed the looming danger in Zimbabwe on land policies.The security company does not know the actual contents of the one-box out of the three trunk boxes/ consignment as it was not disclosed to them for security reasons.

 This mount was meant for the purchase of new Agricultural machineries and chemicals for our Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland.
 This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr.Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few black farmers alike. This resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society during political electioins in my country. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my husband wasone of the victims.


 It is against this background that, all my family members fled zimbabwe for fear of our lives. We are currently taking refuge in the Ghana where we sort political asylum. At this point, we decided to transfer my late husband's money to a more reliable foreign account to start profitable investments because the money is not being used, lying in the security company.

 I must let you know that this transaction is free from risk because I have all the necessary documents.
 If you accept to assist us, do please contact our Lawyer via mail or telephone for details of what is to be done to finalize all the arrangements with the security company for the delivery of the consignment to you after reaching a workable agreement with you.

 He would conclude all arrangements with you to clear the consignment[in which the funds are secretly packed ) already in 
the custody of the Diplomatic Firm.
 He would also enlighten you on the sharing (80%/20% basis) and the subsequent investment to be made in your country with our share with
 your advice

  THIS MATTER REQUIRE MATURITY AND TRUST.

 Regards,
 Mrs. JULIANA MBULUKU
