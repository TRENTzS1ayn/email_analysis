Dear,

I am MONI MILLAT,from iraq a very close friend to the formal
Iraqi President General Saddam Hussein. I was Tortured and
Incarcerated for speaking out against the Devilish and Inhumane
actions of his son Uday Hussein.

While I was working with the former President, i was entrusted with
Many assets and Funds which i was keeping safe for the family, upon
my release from Prison. all the assets and funds in my possession
were
all retrieved except a certain Fund amounting to the tune of
$40,000,000.00(Forty Million United States Dollars) which is proceeds
from Crude Oil sales of one of his numerous Oil Companies and i am
the
only person who knows about this Fund and also has all the necessary
information's and Documents about the security company,
were this fund is presentlly, which i will give to you.

It is in view of the above facts that i am contacting you as a
Foreigner to help me in transferring this Money abroad into your
account
as the current restrictions on traveling and other factors has made
it impossible for me to do it as it was only possible for me to escape
from Iraq to IRAN from where I am currently contacting you.

We are going to sign a Binding agreement of Trust to make sure that
None of the parties involved will be cheated in the transaction as i
will travel along with my family to your Country for sharing and
Investments as soon as the transaction is concluded.

I will like you to assit me as this is my only hope of suvival in life
all my belongings were set on fire due to the fact that i did not
coop-
ate with his devilish act.

I look forward to your positive and co-operative response. my
private mail is millat@arabia.com 

Yours,
MONI MILLAT
