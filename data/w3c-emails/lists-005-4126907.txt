Good day,

My name is Jane Bintu Okoli,and my kid brother's name is Nonso Papis Okoli.I'm 23 years old and my kid brother is 20 yers old we are both from Senegal.

Sir I got your contact from my serious search in the net,my father Alhaji Pakikpo Okoli and my mother Mrs Lolo FIfi Okoli.They both died in a car motor accident as they were on thier way to my Villege on the 7th day of June 1999.Before they died my father was assigned to one company in Spain; Dan-Mar Company,Inc is the name of the company and after my father has finished the contract the company rufused to pay the Bank which was surpose to issue the cash to my daddy.

After 4 years,on the 7th day of December 2003 an information passel was sent to us from the Bank in spain that the company has payed the money they are owing my daddy.The bank has orderd us to come for the money.The total amount is 382,000 dollars.I have the agreement letter and all the documents in regards to the contract and I wish to ask for your surport in helping me to transfer the fund to your account in your country.

Sir I belive that you will not betray me at last,like I told you I'm 23 and I strongly belive in the great phylosophy of life which is God;as hapiness becomes the faith of every human I mean God is life and life is love but above all, God is all.

looking foward to hearing from you

God bless you.

Sincerely,

Jane & Nonso
