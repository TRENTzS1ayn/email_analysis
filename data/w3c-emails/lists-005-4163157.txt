FROM

FRED AKIN THOMAS
REFUGEE CAMP
CALABAR
NIGERIA.

DATE:28-04-2004

Dear Friend,

With warm heart I offer my friendship and greetings,
and I hope this mail meets you in good time.

I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its
importance and the immense benefit it will be to you.

My Name is FRED AKIN THOMAS, the special Aide of
President Charles Taylor of Liberia.
As you may know the president was recently removed
from office forcefully due to pressures and was
granted a political assylum in Calabar by the Nigeria Government
for security.

At the height of the civil war during his administration we had to resort to a lot of
trans-border Diamond sales in cash to raise funds for operations which were not accounted for.
Most of this cash amounting to US$31,500,000 were taken out of Liberia hurriedly when he was deposed and deposited
in the warehouse vaults of a classified Security company in Europe pending.

Because of our present situation and the very need for
true and solicited help with respect to Ex President Taylor. Your assistance is needed to transfer/move these funds from
its present location of deposit in Europe to another place
or an account that you may hopefully provide.
The reason for this is that plans are now underway to
confiscate not only his known fixed assets but also
all his liquid assets.
I have been mandated to seek and find a reliable
person, based overseas that is disposed to help us
hold the funds and invest the funds on our behalf. For this we are offering you 20%
of total funds as benefit.
Kindly contact me immediately by email and let me know
your position.

Sincerely yours,
FRED  AKIN THOMAS
