Hello,
Compliments of the day.
 
My colleagues and I are  officials 
of my country's Contracts Review Panel   who are 
interested in diverting  some funds that are presently floating in 
in an accounts in my country. In order to commence 
this transaction, we solicit for your assistance  to enable us 
transfer into your nominated account the said floating  funds. We 
are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this 
quarter 
The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military 
regime in my country,government officials set up companies and 
awarded  themselves  contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in 
various ministries and  parastatals.The present civilian government 
set up the Contract Review Panel, which  has the mandate to use the 
instruments of payments made available to  it by the decree setting 
up the panel, to review these contracts and pay those who are being 
owed outstanding amounts. 
However our positions as civil servants and members of  this 
committee, we cannot acquire these money in our names or in the 
names of companies that are based in my country. 
we are looking for a reliable  overseas partner into whose account 
we can transfer the sum of   Twenty million, five 
hundred thousand .That is why I am  seeking your assistance. We 
have agreed to share the money to be transferred  into your 
account, between you and us in the ratio I shall tell you  if you agree with our proposition,
We wish to invest our share in foreign stock markets and other viable 
business till we are ready and able to have access  to them without 
raising any eyebrows here at home. 
We intend to effect  the transfer within fourteen days. we will use 
your company name to  apply for the payment and backdate the award 
of the contract in favour of your company.
I will bring you into a more detailed picture of this business when 
I hear from you.Please treat the above information in confidence. for urgent response reach me at ufombassey@fastermail.com
Thank You
Ufom Bassey
