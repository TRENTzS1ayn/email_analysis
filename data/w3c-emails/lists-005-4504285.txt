ATTN,

Compliments of the day.I do hope this letter will not
come to you as a surprise. It was borne out of my
desire to share a mutual business relation ship with
you.

My name is Mr. cole hans,a Secretary,a Ghana
national married with four children. I work as an
administrative Secretary to Diplomatic Courier
Securities and Finance company,in Accra-Ghana.

I decided to contact you believing that by the grace
of God, you will accept to be my patner in this
business. I earn a salary of ?1.4M -200 USD equivalent
monthly. I joined the services of this company in 1991
as an office assistant. I decided
to contact you believing that by the grace of God the
you will accept to be my partner in this business.

I have been working with this company for nine years.
Within this period, I have watched with meticulous
precision how African Heads of States and government
functionaries have been using Diplomatic Courier
Securities and Finance to move huge sums of money USD,
Pound sterling, French France - (Cash) to their
foreign partners.

They bring in these consignments of money cash and
secretly declare the contents as jewelleries, gold,
diamond, precious stones, family treasure, documents
etc. Gen. Sani Abacha of Nigeria (dead), Mobutu Sese
Seko of Zaire (dead) Foday Sankoy of Siera - Leone,
Babangida of Nigeria etc. All these people have
hundreds of consignments deposited with Diplomatic
Courier Securities and Finance. Their foreign
partners, friends and relatives, are claiming most of
these consignments. A lot of them are lying here
unclaimed for as much as 15 yrs. No body may ever come
for them because in most cases, the documents of
deposit are never available to any body except the
depositors most of them dead.

Since the inception of the 2000 millennium, Diplomatic
Courier Securities and Finance changed the procedure
of claims of consignments. As soon as you are able to
produce all the secret information as contained in the
secret file of any consignment, it will be released to
you upon demand. From our record, more than 120
consignments belonging to Gen Abacha / Mobutu Sese
Seko, has been claimed in the past six months. This is
why I am soliciting for your co-operation and
assistance. Gen. Abacha has 85 consignments deposited
with several names and codes. 35 have been claimed in
the past six months.

I have finished every arrangement for you to come and
claim consignment No 1201 containing USD 7.5M and
consignment No 1200 contain USD 1.5M. My duty is to
supply you with all the information and documents
by fax. You will deal directly with the management.

The procedure is simple:You will apply officially to
the Director of Operations of Diplomatic Courier Securities and Finance
for the elease of consignmentNo 1200 and No 1201. They will demand some
documents and secret codes. Call me, I?ll supply you with every detailed
information.Fax it to them.As soon as they confirm it to be correct. They
will invite you forthe
collection.

If you do not want to come to Accra, you can arrange
with them to transfer the consignment to any where on agreement.No body
will ever know I am involved in the deal except the Lawyer who will write an
agreement for us.I?ll suggest upon conclusion we share 50 - 50.At the
succesful conclusion of the deal,you?ll arrangefor me and my family to
come over to your country. I assure you that the business have been
hatched for 5 years now,it isvery very secure and risk free.

You can get back to me on this mail address giving me
your secured phone and fax numbers for further
explanations and directives
on the procedure.

God Bless You.
Sincerely Yours,

Mr. cole hans
