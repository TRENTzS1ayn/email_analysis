Dear Friend,
 
 Greetings"

 I am Hajia (Mrs.) Mariam Abacha, wife of late
 Nigerian head of state- Gen. Sanni Abacha. We have
 not met before,I got your contact through Nigerian
 Chamber of Commerce and I felt I should trust you.
 It is no news telling you that my family has been
 going through untold hardship since the 18th June
 1998 when my husband died.
 
 My family has lost so much including some fixed
 assets my husband acquired while in office.
 Evidently, the pages of all Nigeria dailies, which
 you can equally get from Nigeria embassy in your
 country, will tell better our story. Even now, our
 homes are under surveillance, worst of all, the
 Government has restored to consficating everything
 that has to do with our family.
 
 Before the death of my husband, he ran among other
 business of his own, bureau de change, which was
 flourishing with every Government support. From the
 bureau de change business, which has now been
 clamped down by Nigeria Government, I was able to
 save USD$24,000,000.00 in cash. I tried to safeguard
 it in a security company here in Nigeria but
 couldn??t. Through the help of a close family friend
 who works in a security company, I delivered the
 USD$24 million and moved it out of Nigeria under the
 label of photographic materials to a security
 company in EUROPE.For security reason,I wouldn??t
 mention the name of the country until I hear from
 you.
 
 In view of our condition here and the high interest
 rate the security company charges, the money could
 not be safe there.
 
 I would therefore need your honest assistance to
 move this fund from the Security Company to your
 nominated bank account. Once the money is
 safeguarded in your account, I would require your
 directives to enable me invest same in any viable
 business venture. If you accept this offer, of
 assistance you are requested to contact me via my
 email address as above or my lawyer Barrister Ahmed
 Bako & co. via his e-mail address: barrister 
 [ahmedbako_ass100@irangate.net] As soon as he receives
 your acceptance notice, he will furnish you with the
 details which includes; lodging code and clearance
 permit to enable you clear the consignment from the
 Security Company. Note that, You will be accorded 
 with 20% of the total sum for your assistance.
 
 Finally, you are requested to indicate your
 telephone and fax numbers to me or my lawyer for
 easier communication.
 
 While thanking you for your anticipated
 co-operation, I look forward to your urgent reponse.
 
 
 Best regards,
 Hajia Mariam  Abacha.
