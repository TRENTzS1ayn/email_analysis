Dear Friend,

SINCERE URGENT REQUEST

I am contacting you on business transfer of a hugh sum of money from a 
deceased account, Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude 
will make any one apprehensive and worried but I am assuring you that 
all will be well at the end of the day. We decided to contact you due 
to the urgency of this transaction.

PROPOSITION:
We discovered an abandoned sum of US$5,500,000 Five Million Five 
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family. Since his death none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay claims for this money as the heir We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.

Upon this discovery we now seek your permission to have you stand as a 
next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by us for the funds to be released in your favour as the
beneficiary's next of kin It may interest you to know that we have 
secured from the probate an order of madamus to locate any of the 
deceased beneficiaries.
Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavour by furnishing me with the following:

Beneficiary name and address;

Direct Telephone and fax numbers

These requirements will enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favour before the transfer can be made. You will be compensated with a Million Dollars on final conclusion of this project,while the rest shall be for us. 
Your share stays while the rest shall be for us for investment purposes.
If this proposal is acceptable by you do not take undue advantage of 
the trust we have bestowed on you. I await your urgent mail.

Regards.

Adrian Learf
