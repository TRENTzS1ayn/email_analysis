Hello:


I received the same e-mail like yours. What do you think? This is a joke. You won in the same category that I won and the same date,the same sume of money,600,000.00 euros.
It can't be true. I will paste my e-mail bottom of this. Please tell me what did you do about this. I think that we have to stop this kind of people. If you know that this is serious and you received your prize already, please tell me what to do. I will appreciate it. Otherwise lets work together against them. Thank you and forgive my poor english. Please compare my e-mail with yours. I taulked to Mr. de Leon by phone already.
