Hello Friend,  

I have to first of all apologise for using this way to contact you especially
because of the seriousness of this message and because we have not met,but
I am desperately in need of help. I got your contact email address from
a search I made on the Internet.

I am Eng. Donald Ademola an Executive Director Projects, of
the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING (FMWH).
And after due verication with my colleagues,I decided to
forward to you this business proposal in anticipation
that you may be in position to assist/handle this
business with me.

We want a reliable person, who could assist us in
receiving funds resulted from over invoiced bills
from contracts awarded under the budget allocation for
FMWH.These bills had been approved for payment by
the concernd ministry.In this year`s (2004) budget speech,
The President has ordered that all foreign
contractors debts be paid in order to boost more
Foreign investors into Nigeria The contracts had been executed,
commissioned and the contractors had been paid their
actual contractual sums.What we are about to receive
now is a kick back from the contractors and Under
the protocol division as civil servants, we are forbiden
to operate or owm foreign accounts,this is why am
soliciting your assistance in this manner.
On our part, all modalities had been worked out in
ensuring a smooth transaction

On this note, I have been unanimously mandated by my
colleagues to seek an honest and trustworthy Foreigner
like you who will assist in ensuring the successful transfer
of twelve million United States Dollars(US$12,000,000.00)
into a personal /company account since the Nigerian code of
conduct does not allow us (Civil servants) to operate foreign accounts.

It is pertinent also to let you know that 15% of the
total fund will be for you if you will assist to act
as the beneficiary of the fund, while 5% will be used
to settle any expenses that might be incurred by both
parties and the remaining 80% will be for us (my
colleagues and I) to be invested in your country.
We have chosen you to benefit with us
in this transaction due to the respect your country
commands here. In this regards, I request you to send me
your full names and address, telephone and fax number
to enable me brief you in details about this transaction.
Be rest assured that modalities and logistics towards
the successful transfer of this fund has been worked out.
All we require from you is your co-operation. This
transaction is risk free.

We kindly request that you accord the highest level
of confidentiality this transaction deserves.

Your urgent response will be highly appreciated.

Best regards,

Donald Ademola.
