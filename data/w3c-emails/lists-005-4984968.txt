Good day, 

I have to first of all apologise for using this way to contact 
you especially because of the seriousness of this message 
and because we have not met, but I am desperately in 
need of help. I got your contact email address from a 
search I made on the Internet. I cannot contact any of my 
known father's associates because of the on-going 
situation in my country  and the predicament facing my 
family. 

 I am the son of the late leader of the Movement for the 
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), Jonas Savimbi, 
who was killed in a fierce gun battle with government 
troops loyal to Edwardo Dos Santos on the 22nd of 
Febuary 2002.
I am Almendo Savimbi, the  son of Jonas Savimbi. I was 
aware of sales of diamonds and crude oil to individuals and 
countries that clandestinely come and purchase these 
products. After the PEACE ACCORD was broken, the 
United States of America government abandoned my 
father and the United Nations (UN)imposed sanctions on 
all products coming out of UNITA controlled areas. It is the 
proceeds of these sales that were used by UNITA to 
purchase arms to prosecute the war. 
 To learn more of the injustice and situation my father 
faced, check the website:

 My late father, Jonas Savimbi  was able to deposit some 
fund in Europe with a Security Company that he intended 
to  make purchases with. I happen to be in possesion of 
documents and information of the deposit and some 
others.
 
 Our movements presently(including me) is restricted.
We are forbidden to either travel abroad or out of our 
localities. 
Presently, the funds my father transfered  to Europe before 
his death for some purchases he intended to make is safe 
and is in the Security firm. I have the passcode and the 
documents to the Security firm. This is where I will need 
your help because at present i cant travel. And I want to 
act fast before the government finds out about the funds.
 
 With this password and information and power of attorney 
you will be able to proceed to the Security firm. I can get 
access to a satellite phone for communication. When you 
are ready I will give you the information needed before you 
can get access to the fund you will then  proceed to the 
Security company where the funds will be given to you as 
payment either installmentally or depending on the advice 
of the security company.
 
YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY IN THIS TRANSACTION IS 
REQUIRED.
  
Yours sincerely,
 
Almendo Savimbi.
