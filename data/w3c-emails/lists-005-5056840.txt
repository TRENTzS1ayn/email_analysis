Reviewing 3G Licence Conditions
Regulatory and Commercial Implications 
of Reviewing 3G Licences in Europe
21st & 22nd April 2004
Marriott Kensington, London
 <<ole0.bmp>> 
The background to this conference: 
It has been three years since European mobile operators won their 3G licences.
Operators have adjusted to stock market falls and funding constraints,
GPRS has given a new lease of life to existing 2G networks, and operators
who have launched 3G networks are finding teething problems impacting
service reliability, and are still to demonstrate a 3G killer application to make
2G obsolete. As a consequence major operators have tried to re-negotiate the
obligations attached to their licence rights.

This visiongain conference will bring together the key stakeholders involved in,
and impacted by, the debate surrounding 3G rollout obligations. Participants
will be able to engage in the debate, and have their say on 3G licence
obligations, their alternatives and the future of 3G services.

Speakers from major players within the 3G arena will include:

Robert Mourik, Senior Manager, Public Policy, Vodafone
Rui Lemos Pereira, Vice President, Regulatory Affairs, T-Mobile International
Christer Hammarlund, Principal Administrator, DG Information Society, European Commission
Andrea Camanzi, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs, Telecom Italia
Steve Jordan, Head of European Regulatory Policy, mmO2
Joachim L?cking, Deputy Head of Unit, DG Competition, European Commission
Graham Louth, Director of Spectrum Markets, Ofcom (UK)
Jaroslav Kubista, Director, External Affairs, Eurotel
Vincenzo Monaci, Commissioner for Networks and Infrastructures, Agcom (Italy)
Marc Furrer, Director General, Federal Office of Communications (Switzerland)
G?raldine Philippe, General Counsel, Comfone
Magnus Axelsson, Senior Advisor, Post-och telestyrelsen -PTS (Sweden)
