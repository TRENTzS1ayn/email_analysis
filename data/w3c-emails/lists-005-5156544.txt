Dear Friend,
Good day to you. My name is Lynda Muller, owner and director of Wattle Group of Companies (PVT) Ltd., established by my late husband here in Zimbabwe,southern Africa. We have had various interests in mining (precious stones and coal), in tobacco, Real Estates, and in large scale farming through our Inyabamba Farms. In these we
have achieved tremendous success for several years.However in the past few years, our business has been drastically affected by government policies which have been against white minorities (of which my family is one) controlling the nations wealth. This has led to our being compelled to sell most of our interests, leaving only the Farms. But with the recent land Seizure Policy by the government, our farms and lands were forcefully taken from us by the majority blacks led by ex-war veterans. The physical attacks and trauma led to my husband?s ill health, which sadly led to his demise. With the continuous discrimination and insensitivity to our situation, it has become impossible for my
children and I to continue in the only environment we have always known. I am now seeking to invest our saved resources abroad in a safer environment were I intend to subsequently relocate with my family. Thus I make research from the Internet for reputable companies with whom I can open discussions on business partnership and investments abroad. For this, I make contact with you, and hoping to commence business relationship with you. I thank you for your understanding, and look forward to hear from you soon.
Sincerely,
PLEASE REPLY  TO THIS EMAIL BOX {lynda@whipmail.com} IF YOU ARE INTRESTED IN HELPING ME
