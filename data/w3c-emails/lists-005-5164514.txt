Mrs. Joy Jones Khushab

I am Mrs.Joy Jones Khushab,a Pakistani national  I was
married to Dr.Dish Khushab who worked with Pakistan
embassy in China for nine years before he died in the
year 2001.We were married for eleven years and the
union unfortunately did not produce any offspring. .
Before his death we had given our lives to Christ and
were living according to the Word.
A few weeks ago i was diagnosed with cancer and the
doctor has informed me that i do not have much time to
live. Presently I am practically an invalid as the
cancer has ravaged my body and i can feel my life
slowly ebbing away. I do not have much time to do the
Lord's work but He will give me strength to see my
last assignment through.
My husband, Dr .Khushab before his death deposited his
life savings of approximately $6.5Million (Six Million
Five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with a financial
institution in the European continent. Before his
death, we were committed to the growth of the church
and the propagation of the word, but I can no longer
partake in these noble tasks. I need a church,
Christian individual or individuals who can continue
the work in our stead. who will utilize this money the
way I am going to instruct here into-fund churches,
orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and
to ensure that the house of God is maintained. To care
for the sick, the poor, the downtrodden wherever they
may be The Bible made us to understand that blessed is

the hand that gives. I took this decision because 
I don'thave any child or next of kin who can inherit
these monies. 
Though the internet is a seemingly unlikely
place to find such individuals, I believe that the
Lord hide s jewels in the most unlikely places. It is
not the means that is important but the message.
 I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the
Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my
case and I shall hold my peace. With God all things
are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall
give you the contact of financial institution in
Europe. I will also issue you a letter of authority
that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of
this fund. I want you and the church to always pray
for me because the lord is my shepherd.  Happiness is
that I lived a life of a worthy Christian.
Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I
stated herein. Hoping to hearing from you. Remain
blessed in the name of the Lord. 
N.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE LAWYER IN
CHARGE A CALL IS PRECENTLY IN Spain,HE DOES EVERYTHING
ON MY BEHALF
AND HE'S VERY UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL 
LEAD YOU TO YOUR SUCCESS IN JESUS 
NAME:      MARK ADAMS

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Yours in Christ,
Mrs. Joy Jones Khushab
