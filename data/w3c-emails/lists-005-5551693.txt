Dear Friend ,

I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha, the widow of the late Gen. 

Sanni Abacha 
former Nigerian Military Head of State who died 

mysteriously as a result of Cardiac Arrest. Since after 

my husband?s death my family is under restriction of 

movement and that not withstanding, we are being 

molested, policed and our Bank Account both here and 

abroad are being frozen by the Nigerian Civilian 

Government. 

Furthermore, my elder son is in detention by the 

Nigerian Government for more interrogation about my 

husband?s assists and some vital documents. Following 

the recent discovery of my husband?s Bank Account by the 

Nigerian Government with Swiss Bank in which the huge 

sum of US$700Million and DM450Milllion was logged. I 

therefore decided to contact you in confidence that I 

was able to move out the sum of US$25Million Dollars, 

which was secretly lodged in a trunk box and deposited 

with a Security Company as materials of Inheritance. 

I therefore personally, appeal to you seriously and 

religiously for your urgent assistance to move this 

money into your country where I believe it will be safe 

since I cannot leave the country due to the restriction 

of movement imposed on the members of my family by the 

Nigerian Government. 

You we be contacted by my family Attorney Ademola stamps 

and my lawyer shall arrange with you for a face to face 

meeting outside Nigerian, in order to liaise with you 

toward effective completion of this transaction. 


However, arrangements have been put in place to move 

this money out of the country in a secret vault through 

a diplomatic security company, as 
soon as you indicate your interest, forward to my lawyer 

your Telephone 
Number, Fax Number and your Postal Address so that he 

can send to you 
the Certificate of Deposit and other necessary 

documents, so that you 
can help to claim the luggage. 

Conclusively, we have agreed to offer you 30% of the 

total sum while 70% is to be held on trust by you until 

we decide on a suitable business investment in your 

country subsequent to our free movement by the Nigerian 

Government. 

Please reply urgently and treat with absolute 

confidentiality and sincerity. 

Best 
Regards, 
Hajia Mariam abacha(Mrs.)
