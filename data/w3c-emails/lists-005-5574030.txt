DEAR SIR,
WITH DUE HONOUR AND RESPECT,I AM FRANK BOBBYTHE DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF AUDIT AND ACCOUNTS UNIT,FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT. OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK OF AFRICA, NIGERIA WEST AFRICA.
I GOT YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS THROUGH BUSINESS DIRECTORY OF 2001/2002 MAGAZINE AND I DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU FOR BENEFICIAL AND A 100% RISK FREE BUSINESS TRANSACTION.DURING OUR AUDITING AND INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS BANK MY DEPARTMENT CAME ACROSS THE SUM OF EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$18,000.000.00) ONLY BELONGING TO A MORROCCAN INTERNATIONAL USINESSMAN(HADJI MUSTAPHA) WHO DIED ALONG WITH HIS NEXT OF KIN IN 5TH NOVEMBER 1997 AERO PLANE CRASH IN ABIDJAN BEFORE OUR DISCOVERY TO THIS DEVELOPMENT, THERE WAS NO TRACE OF CLAIM FROM ANY PERSON AS THE FUND REMAINS DORMANT IN HIS ACCOUNT WITH THIS BANK. ALTHOUGH I KEPT THIS INFORMATION SECRET WITHIN MY JURISDICTION TO ENABLE US PUT CLAIM AND TRANSFER THE SAID AMOUNT THROUGH A TRUSTWORTHY FRIEND OVERSEAS WHOM WE SHALL PRESENT TO THE BANK AS THE BONIFIDE NEXT-OF-KIN TO THE DECEASED FOR A PROFITABLE AND SUCCESSFUL DEAL. MEANWHILE ALL THE ARRANGEMENT TO PUT CLAIMS AS THE BONAFIDE NEXT-OF-KIN TO THE DECEASED 2C TO GET THE REQUIRED APPROVAL AND TRANSFER OF THIS MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE. 
THE DIRECTIVES AND THE NEEDED INFORMATION WILL BE RELAYED TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU INDICATE YOUR INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO THIS GREAT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.
INFACT, WE COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONE BUT BECAUSE WE CIVIL SERVANTS ARE NOT LEGALLY ALLOWED TO OPERATE FOREIGN ACCOUNT AND IT WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE EYEBROWS ON OUR SIDE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER BECAUSE WE ARE STAFF OF THE BANK. 
THESE ARE THE ACTUAL REASONS IT REQUIRES A SECOND-FELLOW WHO WILL FORWARD CLAIMS BY OUR SUPPORT AS THE BONAFIDE NEXT-OF-KIN WITH BENIN COURT AFFIDAVIT TO THE BANK AND ALSO PRESENT A FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNT WHERE THE MONEY ON HIS/HER REQUEST WILL BE RE-TRANSFERED INTO. ON CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU WILL BE ENTITTLED TO 25% OF THE TOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION 5% OF THE TOTAL SUM WILL BE USED TO REINBURSE EXPENSES THAT MIGHT ARISE FROM TELEPHONE BILLS AND OTHER EXPENSES DURING THE TRANSACTION WHILE 70% WILL BE FOR ME AND MY COLLEAGUES HERE.PLEASE YOU HAVE BEEN ADVICED TO KEEP TOP SCRET AS WE ARE STILL IN SERVICE AND INTEND TO RETIRE FROM SERVICE AFTER WE CONCLUDE THIS DEAL WITH YOU.
I WILL BE MONITORING THE WHOLE SITUATION HERE IN THIS BANK UNTIL YOU CONFIRM THE MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT, WE THEN COME DOWN TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR SUDSEQUENT SHARING OF THE FUND ACCORDING TO THE PERCENTAGES PREVIOUSLYINDICATED AND FOR INVESTMENT IN ANY COUNTRY YOU MAY ADVICE US TOO.
ALL OTHER NECESSARY INFORMATION WILL BE SENT TO YOU WHEN I HEAR FROM YOU.I SUGGEST YOU GET BACK TO ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE STATING YOUR WISH IN THIS DEAL. 
YOURS FAITHFULLY FRANK BOBBY.
