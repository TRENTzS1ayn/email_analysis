The Lady And The Basket
A funny story tells about an old lady who was living in the village. 
She had never owned nor even been in a car before. One day, she was 
returning home from the market carrying a big heavy basket on her 
head,when a rich man riding his car passed by. Kindly,he offered to 
drive the lady to her home. She thanked him and got into the car with 
her basket.

On the way, the man glanced at the lady in the mirror, still holding 
her basket over her head. Astonished, he asked her to lay the basket 
down in the car and rest.

The old lady naively replied, "Oh my son, your car is carrying me; 
this is enough, I should not burden it carrying my basket too!"

What an innocently funny response!
We sometimes do the same with God. Everyday, God carries us during 
the day. Still, we insist on carrying our heavy baskets of worries 
and fear of the future, for family, kids,spouse, money, job, etc...
We are carried by Almighty  Hands, watched over by Sleepless Eyes and 
God plans our future. Let us then relax and lay down everything in 
God's Hands.  The old lady, if she agreed to lay down the basket, 
would have to carry it again when back home. But the beautiful thing 
about God is that once we cast our heavy basket in His Hands, we do 
not need to think about it anymore.

"Delight yourself also in the LORD, And He shall give you the desires 
of your heart." (Psalm 37:4)

Have a wonderful blessed week - free of "baskets."
