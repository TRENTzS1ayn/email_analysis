Attention: Director


Dear Sir,

I am Barrister Richard Williams, a solicitor at Law. I am the personal attorney
to Alkalid Alfares, an Iraqi national who used to work with Shell-development
Company in Port Harcourt. Herein after shall be referred to as my client.

On the 11th of March 1998, my client, his wife and their 2 children were
involved in a car accident while on a picnic along Port Harcourt express
road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since
then I have made several enquires to Iraqi embassy to locate any of my client?s
extended relatives, this has also proved abortive.

After these several unsuccessful attempts to locate any member of his family,
hence I contact you. I am contacting you to assist me in claiming the money
and property left behind by my client before they got confiscated or declared
unserviceable by the bank where this fund was deposited.

Now, the finance institution where the deceased had the account value of
USD25M, has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account
terminated within the next 3 months. I now seek your consent to present
you as the next of kin to the deceased, so that the proceeds of this account
valued at USD25M can be paid to you and you and I can share the money 70%
for me and 30% to you.

I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim
we will make. All I require is your honesty and cooperation to enable us
concludes the transfer. I guarantee that this will be done under a legitimate
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get
in touch with me through the above phone, or e-mail immediately so that
we can discuss further about this.

Regards.

Richard Williams(ESQ
