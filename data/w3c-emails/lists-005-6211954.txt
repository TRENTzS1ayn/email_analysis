April 2004 Top Pick of the Month
Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc.
(OTCBB: LETH)

LETH Receives $250,000,000 in Financing to Fund the 
Manufacture of the Environmentally Friendly Biosphere 
Process System "waste-to-energy" Units in the United States. 

First Unit to Roll-out in New Orleans in early Second Quarter. 

We are expecting earth-shattering upcoming news leading a 
strong rally in LETH for a Company that has announced over 
$100 Million in sales orders in the past year, and tops that 
record-setting achievement by acquiring the equivalent of 
$8.62 per share in cash for major worldwide expansion.

The Biosphere Process System - Soaring Worldwide Demand:

LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their 
Biosphere Process System to generate revenue from the disposal 
of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour 
which makes a major impact on the global waste problem. This 
profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean, 
"green" electricity such waste materials as Municipal Solid 
Waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, 
industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, 
and the huge market of used tires. LETH profits from the sale 
of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous 
basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity 
which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid.

The Biosphere Process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide 
need for cost-effective renewable energy sources and a 
corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the 
disposal of waste. LETH has secured worldwide acceptance for 
a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact the 
global waste problem while a major push for generating 
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot 
topic due to shortages and massive power failures.

Financing of $250 Million Positions LETH for Astronomical Sales:

The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the 
fact that this $1.50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent 
to $8.62 per common share in cash. There are 26 Biosphere Process 
Systems presently in operation worldwide. The available funding 
could easily be used to produce 100 additional Biospheres. Now 
factor in that average sale price is $7 Million per Biosphere. 
We cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for 
with a potential $700,000,000 in future sales with 29 million 
shares outstanding!

LETH Stock Guidance:
Current Price: 1.55
Near-Term Target: 4.80
Projected High for '04: 12.50

LETH's Blue Chip Partner - Fortifying the System:

LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, 
$21) a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, 
mechanical, and electrical management consulting services 
primarily for the US Government with annual sales of $800 Million. 
Tetra Tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits, 
installation, and continuous worldwide monitoring of the 
Biosphere Process System for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the 
process of obtaining Department of Environmental Quality 
permitting for the Biosphere Process in the state of Louisiana. 
This is a monumental event for LETH which opens the floodgates 
for major project revenues in Louisiana while having a parallel
effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge near-term announcement.

Political Power Fosters Rapid Global Expansion:

LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both US and 
international investors by embracing a major foothold on the 
global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate 
electricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished 
by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the 
globe through the political contacts at the highest level from Dr. 
Albert Reynolds, Chairman of LETH, who is also the former Prime 
Minister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds international stature has been 
instrumental in guiding LETH into a position of worldwide 
dominance in an industry with such high global demand that it 
is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Uncommon Value for a Company of this Caliber:

We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the 
frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the Biosphere, 
the impressive backlog of over $100 Million in sales orders, and 
the Company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly 
timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional contracts 
that will perpetuate the shattering of the Company's own sales 
records. As our Top Stock Pick for April, we anticipate the 
continuation of strong positive developments that will ignite 
LETH shares which carry our highest rating for short-term trading 
profits followed by robust long-term capital gains.
