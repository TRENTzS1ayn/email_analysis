"maybe caching a little" <g>

Did he?  I'll have to re-read that post (joking!)

Correct, VERSION-CONTROL would identify the resource as versionable to a
client.

Yes.

No.  DeltaV defines those properties so if there is no DeltaV the client
would use some other way to distinguish a resource's classification as
written in whatever spec. they are probing for.

Pass -- we've been round that loop a few times.  Geoff has written it both
ways, probably more than once.

The intent was not to have a monster type name, rather something cumulative
like:

<DAV:resourcetype>
   <DAV:collection/>
   <DAV:workspace/>
</DAV:resourcetype>
