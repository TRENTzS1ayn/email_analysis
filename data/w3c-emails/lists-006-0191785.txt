I agree with Tim.  The changes proposed since version 15
have been minor marshalling changes, editorial changes,
or changes with generic WebDAV impact
(and therefore are more appropriately handled in the
rev of 2518 and not in the DeltaV spec).

I've been keeping this list
just as a folder of email messages,
but I'll try to get it posted in summary form to the website
this weekend or next week.

Cheers,
Geoff

Agreed -- though I suspect this will be uncontrovertial.

Agreed -- ideally it would be sent to the WebDAV WG so that it may apply to
ACLs and friends equally well.

I believe that this was agreed as a non-issue, or rather that Stefan wanted
to know when VERSION-CONTROL had affected a resource and when it had not.

Again, a trivial change that I believe will be non-controvertial.

Editorial change.

Editorial change.

I'm kicking myself for not keeping the list, but I guess I was expecting
Geoff to do so.  I have asked him to make it generally available as I
believe that there are other issues that were raised (but don't ask me to
name them without searching<g>)

Your point is well taken, but I don't think it is as bad as you make out.

Tim
