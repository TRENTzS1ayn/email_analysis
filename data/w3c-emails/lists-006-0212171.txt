Could you explain?

Old servers will ignore the "include" element -- a new client will be aware
that is was ignored because the additionally selected properties will not
turn up anywhere in the multistatus response. An old client will never use
the "include" element, therefore there'll be no interoperatibility issues.

With your proposal, how would one get a) the RFC2518 standard properties +
b) dead properties + c) selected computed properties from DASL/ACL/... with
one PROPFIND?

It wasn't meant to solve this problem -- it's a way for a client to
specifically request "almost all" properties + selected properties that
wouldn't show up otherwise.
