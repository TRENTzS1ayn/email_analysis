I don't understand what you're saying about the "include" element.

Nevertheless, I do have strong logic for putting the property names under
some container, and that's to distinguish property names from non-property
names.  "all-dead-prop" is not a property name.  "checked-in" is.  If they
are glommed together in a list, then that's treating "all-dead-prop" as if
it was a property name.  That prevents the server from ever having a
property called "all-dead-prop", since the XML element with that name was
used the way you're proposing.
