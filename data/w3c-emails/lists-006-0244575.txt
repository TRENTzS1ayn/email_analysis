Maybe you should go back to the proposal. We have suggested adding an
<include> element as child of <propfind>, which can be used to specifically
add properties to those which would be reported by <allprop>. This allows to
get the RFC2518-<allprop> *plus* specific properties from DeltaV/ACL with
one call.

So do I. Please check what we proposed -- you were quoting from Geoff's
example, not ours.

We are currently doing it this way (with "include" in our own namespace):

<propfind xmlns="DAV:">
  <allprop/>
  <include>
    <checked-in/><checked-out/><version-name/>
  </include>
</propfind>
