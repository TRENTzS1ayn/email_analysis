I agree with Lisa's criticism of my counter-proposal,
i.e. that it prevented DAV:all-dead-prop from being
used as a property name.

To avoid the introduction of the DAV:include element,
and to reflect that fact that we are "adding stuff to what
DAV:allprop returns", another minor variant we could consider
would be:

<propfind xmlns="DAV:">
  <allprop>
    <checked-in/><checked-out/><version-name/>
  </allprop>
</propfind>

Cheers,
Geoff

Maybe you should go back to the proposal. We have suggested adding an
<include> element as child of <propfind>, which can be used to specifically
add properties to those which would be reported by <allprop>. This allows to
get the RFC2518-<allprop> *plus* specific properties from DeltaV/ACL with
one call.

So do I. Please check what we proposed -- you were quoting from Geoff's
example, not ours.

We are currently doing it this way (with "include" in our own namespace):

<propfind xmlns="DAV:">
  <allprop/>
  <include>
    <checked-in/><checked-out/><version-name/>
  </include>
</propfind>
