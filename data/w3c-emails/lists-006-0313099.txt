As Tim surmised, the answer to (1) is in fact "yes".
Each version is a separate resource, and each resource
can have its own distinct access control list.

You'd have to ask the ACL-folk that question, but I would sincerely hope
the answer is 'yes'.

Yes.  Working resources have distinct server-defined URLs.  They can be
locked using their URLs just like any other resource.

Yep.
