Well, that would be invalid for the same reason (I think).

OK, I'll put together a proposal.

Other to make it simpler to find out to which spec a "new" property belongs
to? No. Right now we have the unfortunate situation that deltaV defines live
properties in the DAV: namespace which could apply to base WebDAV as well --
so for an implementor it's not obvious where to find the definition.
Additionally, deltaV requires a change in the RFC2518-defined behaviour for
<allprop>, which should be defined in the base WebDAV spec instead...
