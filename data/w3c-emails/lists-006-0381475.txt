Following the principal that the document does not redefine existing
standards, and only describes extensions and departures, I think you could
drop the following:

on the grounds that it is an incomplete description of these 'stati'
already defined by HTTP/1.1.

I agree with Tim's responses.  To make sure that nobody misunderstands
the semantics of the method preconditions and postconditions, I propose
to modify section 1.6 to read as follows:

---------------------

1.6  Method Preconditions and Postconditions

A "precondition" of a method describes the state on the server that must be
true
for that method to be performed.  A "postcondition" of a method describes
the
state on the server that must be true after that method has completed.
If a precondition is violated by a request or a postcondition cannot
be satisfied, the response status of the request MUST be 403
(Forbidden) or 409 (Conflict).  A 403 (Forbidden) status indicates
that an error has occurred that the client cannot resolve, and
therefore the request should not be resubmitted.  A 409 (Conflict)
status indicates that an error has occurred that the client can
resolve, after which the request could be resubmitted.

In order to allow better client handling of 403 and 409 responses, a
distinct XML element type is associated with each method
precondition and postcondition of a request.  When a particular
precondition is violated or a particular postcondition cannot be
satisfied, the appropriate XML element MUST be returned as the child
of a top-level DAV:error element in the response body, unless
otherwise negotiated by the request.  In a 207 Multi-Status response,
this element would appear in the appropriate DAV:response-description
element.

----------------------

Lisa: Does this address your concern?

Anyone: Is this wording OK?

Cheers,
Geoff

Sure it is.  All resource properteis described in versioning-15 sec 3.1
states "The version-control feature introduces the following REQUIRED
properties for any WebDAV resource.", and since "The version-control
feature
MUST be supported if any other versioning feature is supported." it follows
that you can always ask a versioning resource for its supported methods.

Please clarify what you mean by the "current" version?

This case is not called out by the spec., so I would expect 403 Forbidden
with no interoperable extended error info.  Just as there will be other
cases that servers (say for implementation reasons) refuse methods and have
interop way of explaining why.

Yes, potentially.  The postcondition is required to fix up the history to
show a continuous ancestry for the remaining versions.

... from clients.  There are many examples of protected properties that a
server can/will modify.

It is a postcondition of the DELETE method for a version, therefore if it
cannot be made true it MUST be as though the method was never sent.  No
partial results will be left by the server, whether the fix up is done
before/after the action is up to the implementation -- the spec states
effectively that by the time 'the response is dispatched' the postcondition
is true.  This is the same for all methods (not just DeltaV).

> #4) Can situations arise where resources can have no versions?

No.  Take a look at the 3.12 postcondition
     (DAV:must-be-root-version): If the root version of a version history
is
     deleted, there MUST be another version that is the new root version,
     i.e. that is the ancestor of all other versions in the version
history.

See above.

A what? <g>

The way to create a version-controlled resource is with VERSION-CONTROL
which always creates a version-controlled resource based on a version.  If
the target resource was versionable the new version is created, or the
VERSION-CONTROL can reference an existing version in the request body.
