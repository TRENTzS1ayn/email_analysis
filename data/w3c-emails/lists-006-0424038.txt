Yes, it is :-) That's why I tried to carefully phrase my last reply..

I'd say, if the request was

<allprop> <include>...</include> </allprop>

the result of "ignoring" would indeed be:

<allprop> </allprop>

However, if the request was

<allprop><include>...</include></allprop>

it would surely be

<allprop></allprop>, which for all practical purposes is the same as
<allprop/>.

I feel you're right.

How do we proceed?

I've done interoperabilty tests with "our" version of the include element
(with mod_dav, IIS and Sharepoint). Should I redo them using "your" format
before we proceed with one of them?

Sure. That's why I would like to see those moved out of deltaV (and into
RFC2518's successor).
