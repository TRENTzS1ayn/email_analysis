Why don't you write up an Internet-Draft?

It's pretty easy to do.

Just describe (a) the problem you're trying to solve, and (b) your proposed
solution.

There are a few simple guidelines, described in:

http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-guidelines.txt

Some tools for doing this are listed at:
http://www3.innosoft.com/~chris/rfctools.html

As well, if you like working in XML, there are some tools for I-D authors
available at:
http://xml.resource.org/authoring/
described in:
http://www.innosoft.com/rfc/rfc2629.html

But really, a simple text editor will do the job.

Let me know when you're ready to submit, and I'll give you an I-D name to
use.
