Ok, our tests showed that
<allprop/><include>...</include>
   works with moddav, IIS and our servlet, while
<allprop><include>...</include></allprop>
   works with moddav and IIS. Julian's PROPFIND
   handler is throwing the book at me with 422s.

However our code is not in production and can easily
be changed by twisting Julian's arm a little. Sitting
opposite of him helps.

If anyone else has a public server which I should test,
please let me know.
