We're always happy to have people test Xythos WebFile Server at
http://www.sharemation.com.  You can set up your own account through the
GUI, then point your DAV client at http://www.sharemation.com/~yourusername.

I assume you tested IIS by running it yourself?  There isn't a
publicly-available IIS site, is there?  Any others??
