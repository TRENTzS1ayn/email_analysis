DeltaV lists one property, DAV:predecessor-set, that MAY be protected on a
checked-out resource, it's up to the implementation.  However, on a version,
predecessor-set MUST be protected.  So far, so cool:  I understand that.

Next, note that precursor-set is NOT protected on a checked-out resource,
but MUST be protected on a version.  Might some implementations choose to
protect precursor-set in all cases as well?  Why is precursor-set handled
differently than predecessor-set?
