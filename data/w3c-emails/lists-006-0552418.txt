To beat the horse:

mod_dav uses the following algorithm in its propfind:

1) validate that the root element (if provided) is DAV:propfind
2) if no body was provided, or a DAV:allprop child is present in the root
   element, then the PROPFIND is an "allprop"
3) look for a DAV:propname as a child of the root element; if found, then
   the PROPFIND is a "propname" style
4) look for DAV:prop; if founc, then it is a "prop" style
5) else fail

6) For a prop style fetch, only the immediate child elements (whether a
   start element, or an empty element) of the DAV:prop element are used.
   Children of those elements are not examined.

-- whitespace is completely ignored in the entire PROPFIND processing


So... mod_dav is going to be extremely flexible with any kind of screwing
around you might want to perform in the PROPFIND body :-)
