(Sorry about that -- but I can't talk about bytes on the wire for too long
without getting a bit silly.)

Agreed.  Or, indeed a PROPFIND depth zero, whatever.

Ok, but I've also never seen anybody confused by the DAV:collection
'marker' or its purpose either, so we can assume that it is a reasonable
thing to do.

One suggestion is to annotate DAV:resourcetype with those types and
categorizations adopted by the Delta-V specification (version, working
resource, baseline, etc.)  Those types were obviously considered important
when writing the specification to aid in its understanding, so it seems
reasonable to reflect them in the resources themselves.

So, for example, a resource may have a DAV:resourcetype as follows:
    <DAV:resourcetype>
        <DAV:collection/>
        <DAV:version/>
    </DAV:resourcetype>
and another may have:
    <DAV:resourcetype>
        <DAV:version-controlled-resource/>
    </DAV:resourcetype>

I'm guessing that I don't need to explain what the additional annotations
are conveying(?) and that is my point.  Isn't it more intuative to see
<DAV:version/> in the resource type rather than looking for the
DAV:version-name property and deducing that therefore the resource is a
version?

> and a specific reason for that addition

It is going to make the adoption of deltav easier because people will
understand it better.
It will also remove the possibility of ambiguity being inadvertantly
introduced by some later addition to the specification (though due
diligence would dictate that the future designers avoid such pitfalls).

I agree that giving resource type a new value will not give clients any
further capabilities.  I never intended to portray this as a failing of the
specification, and it certainly should not hold up its progress through the
process.  It is a matter of style, and I think that is why there is a
protracted debate about it.  The problem has already been solved, and I
have had the opportunity to express my viewpoint.  I have no objection if
the authors 'pull-rank' and proceed.
