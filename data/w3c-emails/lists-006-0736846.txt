I agree with Greg. I believe that all client implementors can correctly
implement a simple string comparison against the value(s) in
DAV:resourcetype. I do not have faith that *all* client implementors will
(a) think about the issue long enough to realize that they can, in fact,
infer the resource types from the supported live properties, and (b)
implement the inference logic uniformly and correctly. Clients and servers
don't even support the "charset" MIME parameter uniformly, and this is
relatively simple in comparison.

Therefore, I recommend that the DeltaV specification *keep* the
DAV:activity, DAV:version-history, and DAV:baseline resourcetype values.
