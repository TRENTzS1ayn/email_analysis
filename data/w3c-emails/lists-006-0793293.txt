What can I add?  They are an integral part of the specification and should
be read carefully and understood.  At least for me, the layout and style do
not imply that pre/post-conditions may be glossed over or ignored.  In
fact, I find it useful to have the conditions stated explicitly in this
way, and _named_ for easy reference.
