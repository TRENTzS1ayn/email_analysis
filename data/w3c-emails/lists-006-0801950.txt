   I think it's not only future interoperability, but also
   interoperability as such which can be improved by explicitly
   stating the type of a resource.  Rumour has it that code can have
   bugs.  Sticking to the analogies in this thread, if your
   mother-in-law does not report a property properly, the alligator
   might look like a duck and eat your client alive.

So the reason for adding values to DAV:resourcetype is that it is more
likely for a server to be able to return the correct DAV:resourcetype
value than it is for it to return the correct DAV:supported-method-set
or DAV:supported-live-property-set value?  I find that rather hard
to understand (much less, believe :-).

The reason I'm applying so much time/energy to this thread, is that it
is really a general DAV question that shows up (and will continue to
show up) in every DAV extension.  I'd like to develop some guiding
principle for "what goes in DAV:resourcetype", so that we don't end up
having these same (often metaphysical :-) arguments every time the
topic comes up.

For some historical background, I orginally proposed
DAV:supported-method-set and DAV:supported-live-property-set because
DAV:resourcetype wasn't giving me the detail I needed to populate my
GUI's.  Certainly, before I had these two properties, DAV:resourcetype
was essential.  This may therefore be one of those times where a
protocol feature that was required has become redundant through the
addition of later features.

Cheers,
Geoff
