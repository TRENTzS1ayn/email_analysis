The only use case this addresses is that your client has
issued a MKWORKSPACE/LOCK sequence, and that in the narrow
time interval between the completion of the MKWORKSPACE
request and the LOCK request, some other client has managed
to discover the name of your new workspace and has issued
a LOCK request that somehow gets in before yours.

I believe that not only is the likelihood of this happening
vanishingly small, but even if it does happen, your client
would just use the "that workspace is already in use
by someone else" response that it needs in case
somebody got their MKWORKSPACE request in ahead of yours. 

Cheers,
Geoff

What other way would you create a workspace and guarantee that it can't be
altered by other people before you set permissions and such correctly?

Same goes for ACTIVITY.
