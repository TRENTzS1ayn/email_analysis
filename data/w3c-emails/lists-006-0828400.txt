It's not "vanishingly small" if you lose your network connection between the
MKWORKSPACE and the LOCK request.  Or if the LOCK request is lost.  Or if
the latency is ~2 seconds each way.

If somebody who's not supposed to, gets in and changes something inbetween a
MKWORKSPACE command and a ACL request, that's a serious problem.  Null
resources help avoid that.

It's not that somebody got their MKWORKSPACE request in ahead of
mine --that's not the purpose of null resources at all.
