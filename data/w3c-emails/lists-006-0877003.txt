I am beginning to seriously disagree with the whole notion of "cut
everything until there is nothing left to cut."

You are taking it to the extreme, leaving a specification that is obtuse,
hard to understand, and requires a half-dozen readings just to figure out
the subtleties and interactions between the elements, such that you can
*infer* what should have been outright specified.

Cutting features is great. Creating obtuse specifications is absurd.

If you want a *STANDARD*, then it must be obvious to *all* implementors what
the standard should be. If one out of twenty people can figure out ALL of
the implications and inferences to implement the "standard", then you simply
DON'T have a standard. You've only created a guide. The other 19 people
implemented something wrong because they couldn't grok the darned document.

I'm not making a statement on the <owner> thing. Instead, I'm arguing that
your policy is erroneous. It needs to be tempered.

[ I believe this applies more to the DeltaV spec than the ACL spec (I
  haven't read the ACL spec lately); the DeltaV spec is currently a very
  opaque document because of the "say it once; anything more is redundant"
  attitude taken towards it. ]
