My view of the world...

Here's the list of elements that could appear in a DAV:resourcetype.  Some
of these can be combined to provide a really meaningful experience for the
client.  Obviously, some combinations are invalid.
     <DAV:checked-in/>
     <DAV:checked-out/>
     <DAV:collection/>
     <DAV:working-resource/>
     <DAV:version-controlled-resource/>
     <DAV:version/>
     <DAV:version-history/>
     <DAV:workspace/>
     <DAV:version-controlled-configuration/>
     <DAV:baseline/>
     <DAV:activity/>

So,
<DAV:resourcetype>
     <DAV:activity/>
</DAV:resourcetype

would be good, that is, not surprisingly, an activity resource.

<DAV:resourcetype>
     <DAV:checked-out/>
     <DAV:version-controlled-resource/>
     <DAV:collection/>
     <DAV:workspace/>
</DAV:resourcetype>

would be good too, it is a checked-out, version-controlled resource for a
workspace collection.  And so on.
