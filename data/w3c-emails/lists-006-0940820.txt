The pre- and post- conditions are not "error code sections".  They are an
integral part of the specification.  Furthermore, each condition is
individually stated in its own paragraph so you don't have to disentangle
them from the prose, and as a bonus the conditions are _named_ so that we
can talk about the <DAV:version-history-is-tree> precondition and know what
we mean without having to recount the entire description.  I think this is
very important and very productive (an analogy with pattern languages
springs to mind).  As an added bonus, these names are to be returned by the
server so that clients can determine why some operations failed!

Delta-V's conditions sections are not the same as RFC2518's Status Codes
sections.
I'd much rather have the conditions set out like this than have to mark-up
the document with each condition as you come across it in the general
description.

This is good practice anyway.
