I agree, but probably prefer leaving it undefined. We know using 
DAV:root-version won't be useful to almost any client even though its the 
only good choice servers currently have. If its undefined, servers that 
support activities could advertise a "main" activity that they use. This 
might be a good differentiator without introducing any interoperability 
issues.
