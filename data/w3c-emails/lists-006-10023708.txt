I'm happy to change this from "the DAV:root-version" to be
"undefined".  Before I do so, does anyone want to argue in
favor of keeping it as the DAV:root-version?

And in case anyone needs some context, the question is:

When a new version-controlled collection is created by
applying VERSION-CONTROL with a collection version
to an unmapped URL, what should the DAV:checked-in
property value be for the initial version-controlled
internal members of that new version-controlled collection?

Cheers,
Geoff

I agree, but probably prefer leaving it undefined. We know using 
DAV:root-version won't be useful to almost any client even though its the 
only good choice servers currently have. If its undefined, servers that 
support activities could advertise a "main" activity that they use. This 
might be a good differentiator without introducing any interoperability 
issues.
