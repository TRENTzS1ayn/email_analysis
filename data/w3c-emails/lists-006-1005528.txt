I think Tim's point was that if "under version control" 
(e.g. "version-controlled-resource") is part of
the "type" of a resource, then "checked-out" and "checked-in" 
would equally usefully be considered as part of the type
(since the significantly affect what methods can be
applied to that resource).

In each case, you have the same resource (i.e. when you
put a resource under version control, it is the same resource
but has some additional live properties and methods you can
apply to it).

Cheers,
Geoff

What is your rationale for checked-in/out in the type? I think
I have missed something in the spec, since it feels like a
property to me.
