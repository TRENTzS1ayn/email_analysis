Author(s): G. Clemm, J. Amsden, T. Ellison, C. Kaler,
                          J. Whitehead
Filename: draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-16.txt

This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types 
that define the WebDAV Versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol. 
WebDAV Versioning will minimize the complexity of clients that are
capable of interoperating with a variety of versioning repository
managers, to facilitate widespread deployment of applications capable of
utilizing the WebDAV Versioning services.

Send a message to:
mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-16.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
