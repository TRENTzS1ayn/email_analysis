Hi,

I don't know if anyone else has already noticed, but in revision 16 of the
deltav document we 
have lost a crucial '1' from the last paragraph of the introduction (section
1).

In revision 16 it now reads:

"An implementer that is only interested in basic versioning should 
 skip the advanced versioning sections (Section 0 to Section 15)."

I think it should be 10 to 15.

Maybe this was intentional, perhaps the whole spec is advanced :-)

Regards,
