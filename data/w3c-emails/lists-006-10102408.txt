Well, actually, on
<http://www.webdav.org/deltav/>
only links to HTML and Word versions of the draft are provided.

I looked for a link to a text version of draft-16, but couldn't find
any.  Do you know where/if it can be found?

Hm... that's too bad.  I wonder if that's fixable with a suitable tidy
parameter?  Hm... the ASCII art in
  <http://www.webdav.org/deltav/protocol/draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-16.htm>
is broken in Opera, but shows up correctly in Netscape 4.72 on linux
(which is actually pretty unusual...:-) )
I'll try later, and publish the results.
