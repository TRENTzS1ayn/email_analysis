Hi,

Section 10.2 of the specification defines a "Baseline-Controlled Collection"
as follows:

A "baseline-controlled collection" is a collection from which baselines can
be created.

But section 12 says:

A collection that is under baseline control is called a "baseline-controlled
collection".

They can't both be right, is a BCC a resource from which a Baseline CAN be
created
or is it a resource from which a Baseline HAS BEEN created?

The definition in Section 10.2 seems wrong, I don't think you create a
Baseline from a
collection, you create it by checking-in a version-controlled configuration,
which
itself was created by placing a collection under BASELINE-CONTROL.

Infact, am I right in thinking that a "Baseline-Controlled Collection" is
simply a
collection which has a DAV:version-controlled-configuration property?

I am trying to get my head around what steps are needed to create a new
Baseline, 
populated with the contents of a collection, for example:

There is a Version-Controlled Collection /build/src/

My client issues a BASELINE-CONTROL on that Version-Controlled Collection
At this point a new "Version-Controlled Configuration" is created
The original collection gets a DAV:version-controlled-configuration
property set to the newly created resource
The Version-Controlled Configuration gets a
DAV:baseline-controlled-collection property set to the original collection
A new Baseline History resource is created
A new Baseline version is created (the "root baseline")
The DAV:checked-in property of the Version-Controlled Configuration
is set to the "root baseline"
            A new collection with no members is created
The "root baseline" has a DAV:baseline-collection pointing to the
above empty collection

So at this point I have a "empty" baseline, how do I populate it with the
checked-in versions of resources
from the original collection?

I guess I check-out the version-controlled configuration that was created by
the BASELINE-CONTROL and 
just check it in again???

This is not clear in section 12, perhaps an example or diagram of creating a
new baseline might help in this 
section....something like this:

               +-----------+

                                                       +-------------+
       
Am I on the right track?
