I agree that if a client is likely to get disconnected
in the middle of its MKWORKSPACE/LOCK request sequence, and if a server
lets you change the ACL's on a workspace but does not let
you create a workspace, and if a workspace can have its ACL's
updated by anyone other than the owner, then there is a use
case for issuing a MKWORKSPACE against a lock null resource.

But as you said earlier, RFC 2518 only constrains what HTTP
and DAV methods can be applied to a lock null resource,
so a compliant DelataV server can support this use case if it wishes.
We can't say it MUST support this use case, since a DeltaV
server is not required to support lock null resources at all.

Cheers,
Geoff

The problem is that the "client that got there before them" may have
permission to alter a workspace, but they may NOT have permission to CREATE
a workspace.

The problem is not that the other client locked it, but that they might
apply changes before you get a chance to prevent them!  I create a Workspace
(or a resource, or a collection).  I want to then set the ACLs so that I'm
the only one that can alter this resource, because it's MINE.  But, in
between the MKWORKSPACE and the subsequent LOCK, the other client comes in
and sets ACLs so that they can write the workspace and I can't!  Ouch.

Null resource went through similar discussions, and was kept for reasons
which apply to MKWORKSPACE the same way they apply to PUT, MKCOL.
