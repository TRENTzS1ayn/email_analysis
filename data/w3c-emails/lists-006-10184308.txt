Hi,

Despite some excellent e-mail threads recently regarding
Version-Controlled-Collections
I am still not clear how to find the specific version of a resource which is
referenced
by a version of a collection resource.

Section 14 goes to great lengths to explain why we chose to have the
binding-set
of a version of a collection point to a VHR not a version of a resource and
this is fine,
it makes sense.  But what is still not clear (at least to me) is how having
found the
binding (URL segment bound to a VHR) do I find the DAV:checked-in version of
the resource identified by the VHR.

So I can do a PROPFIND with a Depth=0 for the
DAV:version-controlled-binding-set
of a version of a collection.  This gives me the binding names and
references to
Version History Resources.  Now how do I find the DAV:checked-in version?

This is something a client may do quite often, eg display directory
structure (of a 
workspace) and when a directory is selected display versions of files
contained 
within the directory.

Regards,
