Hi,

In section 1.6.1 we have an example of a CHECKOUT method which fails with a
DAV:must-not-be-checked-out
and returning a 409 Conflict.

I cannot actually see in the spec where the Precondition
DAV:must-not-be-checked-out for the CHECKOUT 
method is defined?

CHECKOUT has a DAV:must-be-checked-in Precondition NOT a
DAV:must-not-be-checked-out
Precondition.  So is the example wrong or should the condition for CHECKOUT
be changed.

I also note that DAV:must-not-be-checked-out is used as a precondition for
the LABEL method.
Perhaps they should be consistent and both use DAV:must-not-be-checked-out?
 
Regards,
