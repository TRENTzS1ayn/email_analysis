Your are correct on the distinction between adding and setting a label. 
Its there to avoid inadvertant reuse of a label. See the precondition for 
DAV:must-be-new-label. This indicates that for DAV:add, the label MUST NOT 
currently select a version. The postconditions for add and set are the 
same.

I don't know what you mean by "the labels that are in use". Do you mean 
the intersection of all labels on all resources? If so, why would you need 
this? To see if a label is already used? This might be useful information, 
but just because a label is used in one version history doesn't prevent it 
from being used in another. You can find out if a label is used by using 
DAV:add. It will fail if a version in that version history already has 
that label. There's really no need to get the labels first.

Hi, 
I have a couple of questions about Labels. 
1)  What's the difference between DAV:add and DAV:set of a label? 
     Section 8 of the spec does not spell this out.  My best guess is that 
     DAV:add will fail with a DAV:must-be-new-label if the label is 
already 
     used by any version of the resource, but DAV:set will remove any 
existing 
     use of that label and then set the label on the specified version, 
but I don't 
     see this documented in the spec. 
 
2) How does a client get a list of labels to present the user with a 
choice? 
    The only way I can see is to request the DAV:label-name-set property 
of every 
    version resource.  Wouldn't it be useful to have a report which listed 
the labels 
    that are in use? 
Regards,
