Here my understanding of this stuff:
A configuration is a set of resources located at a root collection.
A baseline is a version of a configuration.

A "baseline-controlled collection" is a collection which is a container for a configuration
and therefore you can create baselines (configuration versions) IN it.
The statement in the draft isn't that clear I guess.

Doesn't give that much information I think. Just defining a synonym.

You can also start without a Version-Controlled Collection. Baseline-Controlled
Collections also work without Version-Controlled Collections.

And probably the additional condition that the version-controlled-configuration's
DAV:baseline-controlled-collection is just this collection itself like you show in
you ASCII art. There I would propose to change the caption of your first box to
'Baseline Controlled Collection'. But I can see why you choose the name.

Just do it like that. OTOH I think it would be intuitive to say that if there are
already checked-in version-controlled resources in a collection you put under
baseline control just take these for the initial version.

[ ASCII art]

> Am I on the right track?
IMHO, yes.

Another thing I just noticed: A BASELINE-CONTROL precondition is
DAV:must-have-no-version-controlled-members. The description then states that the
request URL 'MUST have no members'. Wanted restriction or should it read
'MUST have no version controlled members' ?
