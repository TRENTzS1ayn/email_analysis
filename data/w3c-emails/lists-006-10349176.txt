I Agree.

Also sounds like a good idea, but could be a big job to review each
pre/post condition and decide under what circumstances a 409 or a 403 
should be returned.

While we are on the subject of pre/post conditions I also wonder if anyone
can explain why the post condition XML elements are not worded as
"negatives",
but the preconditions are worded as "negatives".

For example on DELETE in section 3.12 we have:

DAV:cannot-delete-referenced-version as a precondition.
I like the wording of this XML element it is clear that you have done
something that is forbidden (eg it says cannot).

BUT in the same section we have:

DAV:update-predecessor-set as a postcondition.
Why didn't we call this XML element DAV:update-predecessor-set-failed
or some wording that indicates failure.

I am just intrigued as to why they got worded this way.  The status code
already indicates that something is forbidden (403) or there is a conflict
(409).  So you could actually argue that we should remove the "negatives"
from all the elements (pre and post)...eg in the above example we should 
have:

DAV:referenced-version
DAV:predecessor-set
