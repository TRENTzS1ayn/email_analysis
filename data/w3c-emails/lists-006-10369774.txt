Please make it simple and normative!

> The preconditions are statements that must be true for a method to
succeed,

Sounds like if the precondition is not true the operation is "Forbidden",

> and the postconditions are statements that must be true immediately after
the method has suceeded.

Sounds like there must be a "Conflict" if the postcondition cannot be met.

If there are no strong objections, I propose that we adopt the simple
normative rule a precondition is returned with 403 and a postcondition is
returned with 409.
