Thanks! I'll fix those up.

Bitten once more by the "silently trash your references" feature
of Word (:-(.

Cheers,

I don't know if anyone else has already noticed, but in revision 16 of the
deltav document we 
have lost a crucial '1' from the last paragraph of the introduction (section
1). 
In revision 16 it now reads: 
"An implementer that is only interested in basic versioning should 
 skip the advanced versioning sections (Section 0 to Section 15)." 
I think it should be 10 to 15.

I just noticed that in Section 8 (Labels) we are missing a reference. 
The text in version 16 of the specification reads: 

I think it should be referencing section 8.3.
