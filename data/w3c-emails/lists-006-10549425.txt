(By "asked-for" I was trying to long the long winded description of
creating a version controlled collection resource using VERSION-CONTROL.
I will try to avoid loose wording in the future! - maybe!! :-)

I had misunderstood. I had thought it bound them to the root version.
Or maybe the behavour is different inside workspaces to outside workspaces.
But undefined I hope it means the server can pick whatever version it
likes rather than having 'undefined nebulous unbound resources in
a collection'.
