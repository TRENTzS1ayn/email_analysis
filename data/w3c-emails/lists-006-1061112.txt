Are DeltaV servers then not required to support locking at all?  Lock-null
comes along with lock.  I can (barely) beleive that a server might implement
DeltaV but not support locking.  In fact, you acknowledge in section 14 that
lock-null may be implemented:

"Non-version-controlled bindings are not under version control, and
therefore can be added or deleted without checking out the
version-controlled collection.  This feature is essential for the support of
lock null resources, since a lock null resource is a temporary internal
member of a collection that should only exist for the duration of the lock,
and should not be captured in the version history of that collection."

You're doing what Greg (justly) accused you of and leaving things to be
inferred, or out of the spec entirely.  If DeltaV says nothing, then
implementors and servers that do locking and deltaV will be left without
guidance, on an issue over which the experts (heh) have argued.  Their
implementations will differ.

Why not state that MKCOLLECTION and MKACTIVITY can be used on lock-null
resources if they would be legal otherwise?  If you object, then please make
your arguments against the concept, but do not allow the spec to remain
silent.
