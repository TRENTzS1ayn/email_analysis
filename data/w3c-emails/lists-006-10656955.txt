Obviously I misunderstood the meaning of "locked-update" in
"DAV:auto-checkin".  See separate mail already sent on the confusion of that
section.

What I'm most interested in is a server that will checkout/checkin if a
client does a PUT outside the context of a lock.  But it will
checkout/checkin only once for a series of PUT requests inside the context
of a lock.  Tim says that would be the case if "DAV:auto-checkin" has a
value of "unlocked-update".

So to confirm:  A client can legally perform this sequence of commands on a
single resource:

1. LOCK version-controlled resource
2. verify that VCR has "locked-update" in DAV:auto-checkout and
"unlocked-update" in DAV:auto-checkin
3. PUT
4. UNCHECKOUT

Other than the confusion over the meaning of DAV:auto-checkin, the spec
ought to say that an automatic checkout can be checked-in or unchecked-out
manually.

Next question reserved for a different mail!
