Dr. Helmut,
It is possible that the DeltaV specification will be promoted to proposed 
standard within the next six months. The members of the working group are 
certainly working towards that goal. See the DeltaV working group charter 
for details at http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/deltav-charter.html.

There are a number of WebDAV versioning servers under development 
including a number of open source projects. You can find all the latest 
information about WebDAV at www.webdav.org. And thank you for you interest 
in DeltaV.

        Subject:        Question: after the current state

 

Hello,

I would like to ask, whether we can expect, that your internet draft
will be released as official RFC within the next six month.
Are there any products (server and clients) which will implement the
versioning protocol soon?


Mit freundlichen Gr??en / Best regards
 
Dr. Helmut Ackermann
