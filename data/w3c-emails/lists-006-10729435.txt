(sorry for the long, and perhaps confusing title)

On the versioning teleconference call, 6/29/01, the participating working 
group members reached consensus on the following approach to updating a 
version-controlled-resource on checkin of a working resource that was 
created by checking out the version-controlled-resource with 
DAV:apply-to-version.

I would like get a sense if the rest of the working group agrees with this 
proposal. I think it makes sense as the result of checking out a VCR, 
modifying what you checked out, and checking it back in is the same 
regardless of where and how the state of the updated resource was managed, 
on the client or on the server, with or without a working resource. It 
does mean changes to the spec, but this seems to be within the boundary of 
what's reasonable to do now. What do you think?

Here's the proposal from the teleconference:

When you apply CHECKOUT directly to a version URL, the semantics of
the protocol are unchanged (so if you liked the old semantics and
didn't want any auto-update on checkin, you would always apply
CHECKOUT directly to a version URL

When you apply CHECKOUT with a DAV:apply-to-version flag to a VCR, you
create a working resource whose DAV:checked-out version is the
DAV:checked-in version of the VCR (as is required currently), but
which now also has a protected DAV:auto-update property which contains
the URL of the VCR that was checked out.  (This requires one new
postcondition for the CHECKOUT semantics in the working-resource
feature).

The MOVE operation is required to update the DAV:auto-update property
if the VCR is moved (or it can fail the MOVE), so the DAV:auto-update
property is always valid.  (This requires one new postcondition
for the MOVE semantics in the working-resource feature).

When you CHECKIN a working resource with a DAV:auto-update property,
the CHECKIN fails if the DAV:checked-out property of the working
resource does not match the DAV:checked-in property of the VCR.
If the CHECKIN succeeds, the VCR identified by the DAV:auto-update
must have been updated to have the content and dead properties
of the new version, and the DAV:checked-in version of the VCR
must have been updated to identify the new version.  (This requires
one new precondition and one new postcondition for the CHECKIN
semantics in the working-resource feature).
