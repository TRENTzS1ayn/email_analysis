So are we back to saying that supporting Working Resource feature requires
also supporting UPDATE?  That's what I'm trying to avoid.  Is there a better
way for these two features to not depend on each other?

Furthermore, it's surprising to me, and perhaps to clients as well, that
working resource checkins and in-place checkins work so differently: one
ends up with the VCR pointing to the latest version at the end, and the
other doesn't (by default).  I would expect the default behaviour of both of
these to be the same.

Perhaps Jim's proposal could instead be worded so that auto-update was the
default, and "do not update" is the exceptional behaviour that the client
must request.
