No I'm not saying that.  I have an application in mind that creates
versions and doesn't update any version-controlled resource.  It always
references the versions by their version URL.  In this case there is no
need for DAV:auto-update or an UPDATE method, so I would object to making
them required.

In the case of a working resource created directly from a version, there is
no version-controlled resource to update on CHECKIN.  So it doesn't seem
too surpising to me, but whatever.

That would require setting the DAV:auto-update value, or passing in the URL
of the version-controlled resource during CHECKIN.  I prefer to leave the
proposal as is.
