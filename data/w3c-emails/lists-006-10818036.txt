That really badly serves the purposes of non-versioning clients.  The server
can't interact with those clients in your scenario, because those clients
would always just GET the VCR, and end up with the root version instead of
the latest versions.

Let me phrase the problem in these terms, I must find a solution to: How do
I write a server implementation that
 - supports Working Resources
 - supports non-versioning clients

Some of the assumptions I've made in framing this problem are that
 - UPDATE is not supported
 - I may not be able to rely on versioning-aware clients to use the
auto-update flag in CHECKIN.  I don't know how to send an error if they
don't use this flag.
 - It's the wrong thing to always show non-versioning clients the root
version.  They will never have the opportunity to see the latest version.
