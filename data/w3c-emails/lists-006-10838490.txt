If the server supports WORKING-RESOURCE, how does the client know that
it also supports CHECKOUT-IN-PLACE (other than trying to do a CHECKOUT
on a VCR without <apply-to-version> and getting an undefined error?

Note that WORKING-RESOURCE section #9 says that the OPTIONS must return
"working-resource" but is silent on "checkout".  How can that be right,
when you must use the verb CHECKOUT to use WORKING-RESOURCE?

Proposal:
4.5:
MUST include "checkout-inplace", "checkin", "checkout".

9.5:
MUST include "working-resource", "checkin", "checkout".
