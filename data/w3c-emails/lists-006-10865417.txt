As I understand it, there is no way for a client to tell that a working
resource has been created.

VCR checked in, no working resources have been created.  Server doesn't
allow forking.  Server supports WORKING-RESOURCE and CHECKOUT-INPLACE.

ClientA: CHECKOUT <apply-to-version> VCR.
=> creates working resource and leaves VCR untouched.

ClientB: Since VCR is untouched, it is impossible to detect that CLientA
has performed their operation.  Therefore:
CHECKOUT VCR

=> 409 Conflict
<checkout-of-checked-out-version-is-forbidden>

Is there some way I'm missing that Client B could have seen this one
coming?

Currently, I don't support forking so only 1 checkout (INPLACE or
WORKING) is allowed.  But if I did support multiple checkouts, I'd still
keep a count so I could tell Client B, that forking was 'discouraged',
for example.

Are people implementing this without tracking the count of working
resources created off the versions of a VCR?
