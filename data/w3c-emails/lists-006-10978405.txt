Other than mimicing auto-checkout-unlocked, what purpose would this option 
provide? Looks like:
- Versioning aware clients wouldn't need to use it, they can (should?) do 
the checkout
- Non-versioning aware clients could create checked out resources they 
can't check back in

What's the use case?

They wouldn't.  I don't think we should define that state.  It is there
because it mimic's the effect of
The old auto-checkout-unlocked without an auto-checkin-unlocked.
