Once the "reasoned debate" has concluded it can drift off into the
archives.  Clearly this debate falls far short of RFC2026's description of
a basis for dispute which is "(a) [an individual's] own views have not been
adequately considered by the Working Group, or (b) the Working Group has
made an incorrect technical choice which places the quality and/or
integrity of the Working Group's product(s) in significant jeopardy"
