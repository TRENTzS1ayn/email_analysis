It is a fact that (in the current protocol) that whether or not 
you can check out a version or version-controlled resource is
not affected by whether some other version in the version history
is checked out.  So it is more of a conclusion than an assumption.

The fact that some other version has a checkout has no effect
on whether or not your checkout will create a fork that might
require a merge.  That is determined solely from whether or not
the version you are checking out already has a descendent or
checkout.

Yup, but we first have to get Stefan to agree (:-).
