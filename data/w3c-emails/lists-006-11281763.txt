To: DeltaV<ietf-dav-versioning@w3.org>

   From: Lisa Dusseault [mailto:lisa@xythos.com]

   To be consistent with how 2518 does PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, etc. I would
have
   expected:
     <D:supported-live-property-set xmlns:D="DAV:"
   xmlns:x="http://www.xythos.com/schemas/StorageServer"/>
<D:getcontentlength/>
<x:quota/>
...
     </D:supported-live-property-set>

   But the DeltaV draft requires the following syntax:
     <supported-live-property-set>
<supported-live-property name="getcontentlength" namespace="DAV:"/>
<supported-live-property name="quota"
   namespace="http://www.xythos.com/schemas/StorageServer"/>
...
     </supported-live-property-set>

   Is there some merit to doing things this way that isn't immediately
   obvious?

This was done at the request of the folks who care about syntactic
validation (e.g. DTD or XML-Schema).  It is expected that this
report will be extended with other interesting metadata about the
supported live properties (e.g. DAV:is-computed).  By using the
DAV:supported-live-property node, this can be declared as:

<!ELEMENT supported-live-property (is-computed?)>


   Aside from consistency and stylistic considerations, the syntax in the
draft
   is just plain broke. The DTD for supported-live-property set hardwires
the
   namespace to DAV:

   <!ATTLIST supported-live-property namespace NMTOKEN "DAV:">

This does not hardwire the namespace to be "DAV:", it just specifies
that the "DAV:" is the default if no explicit namespace attribute is
specified.

Cheers,
Geoff
