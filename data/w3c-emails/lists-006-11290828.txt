That could have easily been done by adding it in the form of:

<x:quota xmlns:D="DAV:" D:is-computed="true" />

Now that you mention that: this breaks reporting of live properties that
actually happen to be in no namespace at all (no, I wouldn't suggest using
things like that, but ...).

I assume that currently no server uses DTDs to validate. Which raises the
question how they should process element where the attribute is missing:

a) assuming the property is in the DAV: namespace,
b) assuming it's in no namespace.

For consistency, I'd prefer b). If it's a), that should be clearly stated
somewhere (and a way to report properties in "no" namespace -- such as
namespace="" -- should be documented).
