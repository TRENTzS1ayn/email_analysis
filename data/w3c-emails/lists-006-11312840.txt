It would make the spec more logical.

So, among those who have implemented clients that use
supported-live-property-set -- how many of you are currently treating a
missing namespace name as being "DAV:"? I'd say that the current wording
almost *guarantees* that clients will implement this wrongly.

Yes, but the DTD as it stands can't be used for validation (1. DTDs and
namespaces don't work well together, 2. there are only DTD *fragments*).
Therefore I'd say that the DTD excepts can't be normative.

...in no namespace...

I think this is wrong. The spec needs to be clear. Omitting something
because you want to discourage it doesn't seem to be the right approach.
