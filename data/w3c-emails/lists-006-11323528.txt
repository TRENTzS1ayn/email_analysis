John,
VERSION-CONTROL is permissible on a resource that is already under version 
control to allow clients that use VERSION-CONTROL to interoperate with 
servers that automatically put all resources under version control without 
requiring any special cases. It is a a no-op in this case.

23.4 Why should VERSION-CONTROL be listed on a resource that is already
under version control?  It would be interesting if we allowed
VERSION-CONTROL to remove a resource from version control, but we don't.
If VERSION-CONTROL only appears on versionable but non-versioned
resources then that can communicate something interesting to the client.

23.9 UNCHECKOUT (checkout-in-place) is missing.
