Well, I personally expect the CHECKIN URI to be the same as the CHECKOUT
URL.

Note that when using working resources (where this is a concern) that we
have a proposal with the following characteristics:

A CHECKOUT of a VCR with a <apply-to-version> will cause the working
resource to track the VCR from which it came, and a subsequent CHECKIN
of the working resource will checkin the working resource and update the
vcr.

That seemed to be what you were after, or did you hope for a broader
ability to do something like this?
