When using the checkout-in-place feature, the URI of the VCR (that the
client is editing) will not be the same as the URI of the version that is
created upon CHECKIN, right?

It doesn't provide the client the ability to display / insert the URI of the
version that *will* be created upon CHECKIN into the document, or am I
missing something?
