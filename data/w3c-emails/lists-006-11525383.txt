Hi,

During one of the IETF deltav breakout sessions I was "challenged" to try to
find a way to
draw ASCII art to show the resources and relationships involved in baseline
creation
(and still have it fit in 72 columns).  The idea being we could include this
in the specification
to clarify the relationship between baseline-controlled collections,
version-controlled
configurations, and baselines etc.

Here are my two possible candidates (I think I prefer the first one):


  +-------------+ 
  |Baseline-    |     DAV:version-controlled-configuration
  |Controlled   |----------+ 
  |Collection   |          |
  |             |          |
  |/src/applet  |          |
  +-------------+          |
                           |
                           |
  +---------------+        |
  |Version-       |--------+ 
  |Controlled     |     DAV:baseline-controlled-collection
  |Configuration  |
  |               |
  |/vcc/src/1     |----+ DAV:checked-in 
  +---------------+    |
                       | 
                       |
                       | 
                       |
                       |   +-----------+ 
                       +-->|Baseline   | DAV:baseline-collection
                           |           |----+
                           |           |    |
                       +-->|/blh/1/b1  |    |
 +---------+           |   +-----------+    |
 |Baseline |           |                    |
 |History  |-----------+                    |    +-----------------+
 |         | DAV:root-version               |    |Collection       |
 |/blh/1   |                                |    |                 |
 +---------+                                +--->|/blh1/1/b1/bc    |
                                                 +-----------------+

Here is my second attempt.....

  +-------------------------------------+
  |Baseline-Controlled Collection       |
  |                                     |
  |/src/applet                          |
  |-------------------------------------|
  |DAV:version-controlled-configuration |-----+
  +-------------------------------------+     |
                                              |
                                              |
  +-----------------------------------+       |
  |Version-Controlled Configuration   |       |
  |                                   |       |
  |/vcc/src/1                         |       |
  |-----------------------------------|       |
  |DAV:baseline-controlled-collection |-------+
  |-----------------------------------|
  |DAV:checked-in                     |----+
  +-----------------------------------+    |
                                           |
                                           |
  +-----------------+                      |
  |Baseline History |                      v
  |                 |       +-----------------------+
  |/blh/1           |       |Baseline               |
  |-----------------|       |                       |
  |DAV:root-version |------>|/blh1/1/b1             |
  +-----------------+       |-----------------------|
                            |DAV:baseline-collection|------+
                            +-----------------------+      |
                                                           v
                                                     +--------------+
                                                     |Collection    |
                                                     |              |
                                                     |/blh1/1/b1/bc |
                                                     +--------------+


For either diagram I would suggest some surrounding text something like:


"This diagram shows the collection identified by /src/applet has been 
placed under baseline control, creating a new version-controlled 
configuration (/vcc/src/1), new baseline history (/blh/1), new baseline 
(/blh/1/b1) and a new collection (/blh/1/b1/bc).  The new collection has 
members whose checked-in versions capture the state of the /src/applet 
collection at the time the baseline-control method was processed.
When /vcc/src/1 is checked-out and checked-in new baselines and
collections are created to take another snapshot of the checked-in state
of the resources in /src/applet."


Does the group have any preference as to either of these, do you think it
helps clarify the baseline feature?  Did I get anything wrong?
