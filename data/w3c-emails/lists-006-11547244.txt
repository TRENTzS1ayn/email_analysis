In W3C we have both:

1) the URI of the version controlled resource, for instance
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt> points to the "latest" version of the XSLT
recommendation.

2) we also have URIs for the equivalents of the checked-in versions, for
instance <http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116> will always refer to
the XSLT recommendation published on Nov 16, 1999. *Right now*, it refers to
the same document.

Note that the document referred by
<http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116> *contains* this URI as part of
it's content. Under deltaV this means that a client must be able to know the
URI of the version (when checked-in) before actually doing the CHECKIN to
accomplish the same.

I didn't say that (hopefully :-).

Sure. So does ours. But it generally will use an (internally) well-defined
mechanism to allocate the next URI, so a server possibly could pass the
information about the *expected* next checkin URI to the client unpon
checkout. If it can't provide it, it doesn't need to (and a client will have
to live with this). If it does provide it, but upon CHECKIN the server
decides it can't use that URI after all, the client will get an error
message (allowing him to recover).

1) If the feature is implemented as outlined below, it shouldn't cause
interoperability problems. Servers can signal that they can't determine the
"expected checkin URI". If they do, they are also free not to accept this
URI upon CHECKIN (and to produce a new one). This would happen in the case
you mentioned.

2) I think I have given the use case. It basically requires that a
checked-in version can carry it's own URI (of the checked in version) in
it's content. This is a mandatory requirement for the versioning system we
have to expose through WebDAV, so we have to either define a proprietary way
to achieve this, or the protocol needs an extension. We think this use case
may apply to many others, and this is why we are trying to get a discussion
and possibly a consensus here...
