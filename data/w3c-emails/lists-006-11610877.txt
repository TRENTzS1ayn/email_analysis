I believe that the current behavior is the desired and expected
behavior.

When Fred LOCKS the document and starts working on it, he knows very
well that each and every change he makes is seen by everyone
immediately.  The fact that it is then checked in because he went to
lunch would not seem to be a problem.  At worst he just has more
versions in the version history, but no versions that he didn't intend
to make available.

Now the client program, if continuously operating, should be refreshing
the lock.  If it isn't, then when it is restarted I assume it needs to
check if the lock exists and reaquire it if not.

The worst case is that if the client wasn't written with this in mind,
it will just start doing PUT's with an invalid IF header lock token.  

Is a PUT supposed to be rejected if the IF header provided specifies an
invalid lock token and the resource is not locked?
