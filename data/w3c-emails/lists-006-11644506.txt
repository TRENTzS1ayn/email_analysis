   From: Julian F. Reschke [mailto:julian.reschke@greenbytes.de]

   [The use case] requires that a checked-in version can carry it's
   own URI (of the checked in version) in its content. This is a
   mandatory requirement for the versioning system we have to expose
   through WebDAV, so we have to either define a proprietary way to
   achieve this, or the protocol needs an extension. We think this use
   case may apply to many others, and this is why we are trying to get
   a discussion and possibly a consensus here...

OK, that makes it clearer.  Most systems I know of use RCS-style
keyword expansion to achieve this effect, so that the server can
provide this functionality uniformly, rather than depending on
the client to do so.  But there certainly are advantages to the
approach you suggest (i.e. explicit insertion by the client).

My preference, though, would be to defer standardizing this 
particular feature, since the spec is already quite complex
and it is an orthogonal feature that could be provided later
if experience indicates that this "client side" metadata insertion
is preferred over "server side" keyword expansion.

Cheers,
Geoff
