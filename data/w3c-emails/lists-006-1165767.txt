It is important to distinguish descriptive text that we
add to the protocol document (which is read by humans, and which
can take advantage of the fuzzy distinctions that humans can make),
from protocol elements, which are used by the software (clients
and servers) we write.  We use the terms "working resource" and
"version controlled resource" and "checked out resource" when we
organize and document the protocol for human readers.  The question
at hand is whether those fuzzy distinctions are appropriate for use
at runtime by software that we write (i.e. clients and servers).

I'll also observe that there is a certain level of fuzziness
that is not useful to even a human (i.e. is more likely to be
misunderstood than it is to make clear).

As for the issue of obtuseness (and who is displaying it),
I'll probably avoid that subject altogether (:-).

Cheers,
Geoff

No, no, no!!!!

We're not asking software to automatically distinguish what we call a
difference in type, vs what we call a difference in state.  That kind of
decision-making is, at present, a human activity.  We're capable of saying
"checkin/checkout is a change of state, not type", even if software cannot.

Geoff, don't be obtuse about this.  We can make fuzzy distinctions, because
we're humans designing the deltaV spec in order that the way it works makes
sense to us.  Help us make DeltaV make sense to _humans_.  AND THEN humans
can write the programs that interoperate with each other.
