It is likely that a server that supports working resources will
have ACL's on the working resource that only allows modification
of the working resource by the principal that created the working
resource.  Also, another client is extremely unlikely to encounter
the working resource, since it has been given a new (virtually
guaranteed to be obscure) URL.  So the window between when the
working resource is created and when the working resource is locked
is likely to be of extremely low risk.

Cheers,

Let's say as a client I want to protect my version-controlled resource (VCR)
and associated working resource (WR) from being edited by other users while
I check it out and edit it.  One might think the user could issue:

 - LOCK VCR
 - CHECKOUT VCR
 - LOCK WR
 ...

This won't work, however.  There is a window when other users can lock my
WR, edit it, etc, before I manage to lock it.   Having another client "take
over" my WR is a situation which I think most clients will want to prevent,
or will not know how to handle, or both.

Any way of dealing with this?
