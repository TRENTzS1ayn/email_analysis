John asks:
Is a PUT supposed to be rejected if the IF header provided specifies an
invalid lock token and the resource is not locked?

The if header would likely be ignored since the resource isn't locked and
there's no token to check. But servers could implement this as a failed If
header since it doesn't match the resource. Looks like a clarification
might be needed in the spec.
