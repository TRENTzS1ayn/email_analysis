During the working group meeting we agreed to note this issue on the list:

What does the (HTTP/1.1 defined) Allow: header mean? and should it be the
same as the (DeltaV defined) DAV:supported-method-set property?

The meeting attendees agreed that "allowed" and "supported" should mean the
same thing, and concensus was that both should report methods that will
succeed for some state of the resource, not necessarily the current state.

For example, a version-controlled resource can be checked-out or checked-in
and therefore only one of CHECKOUT or CHECKIN will succeed for a given
state of a version-controlled resource.  It is proposed that, for
version-controlled resources, "Allow:" and "DAV:supported-method-set"
include both CHECKIN and CHECKOUT (amongst others).

Send any objections to the list.

Regards,
Tim
