I agree, and I think that is why people were happy enough to say that the
response includes methods that are valid for different states of the same
resource.

Yes, and there are other examples.  You could have changed the state of the
resource (or DELETEd it for that matter) between me asking for the allowed
methods and then actually issuing it.

Don't think so, other than to say the principal use of the supported-*-sets
is to allow for resource 'classification' which is typically required for
high-level UIs to choose icons, grey-out or enable menu options, and so on.
