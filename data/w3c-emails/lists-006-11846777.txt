If we reject it, then a client could detect that their previously active
lock had expired.

So ... I'm wondering if the spec should require the rejection.  I'm also
wondering if my implementation should reject it even in the spec is
silent.

John asks:
Is a PUT supposed to be rejected if the IF header provided specifies an
invalid lock token and the resource is not locked?

The if header would likely be ignored since the resource isn't locked
and there's no token to check. But servers could implement this as a
failed If header since it doesn't match the resource. Looks like a
clarification might be needed in the spec.
