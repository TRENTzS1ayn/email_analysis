DAV:locked-checkout does not automatically follow the update
method with a checkin.

You probably are thinking of the "checkin on when the lock is
removed" behavior, which is true for all write-locked auto-checked-out
resources, not just ones resulting from DAV:locked-checkout.
Since this behavior always applies, it does not
need to be specified in the individual auto-version values.
In fact, it would be misleading to specify it in just one of
the values, since that might mislead people into thinking it
only applies for that one value.

Cheers,
Geoff

I was confused by the name "locked-checkout" in the values of
auto-version -- it seemed to me that the server would never do an automatic
checkin if it had this value, but the text says it does.

Let's sacrifice brevity for clarity, and call this value
"locked-checkout-unlocked-checkin".
