I joined the DeltaV mailing list only recently after the Interop event, however, I would like to
make some comments to the DAVE proposal.

Actually, event notification would open many new opportunities and it could possibly turn the
current philosophy of maintaining prohibitions (LOCK, CHECKOUT) into a new approach towards
supporting collaboration (event notification, awareness).

Additionally, this could be the right time to replace the current two-dimensional resource model
(url + version) by a more natural three-dimensional model (url + principal + time). Please note that
the three-dimensional model would make locking, checking in/out as well as versions superfluous. It
would make multiple team members working on one source file the normal case as it is already today
in software development projects where I am involved in. Obviously merging resources becomes more
and more important in such a szenario. Maybe a specification could also provide some framework for
this activity?
