   From: Peter Raymond [mailto:Peter.Raymond@merant.com]

   After reading through sections 3 & 4 & 5 (with a group of other
   MERANT staff) here is a list of issues/questions (some of these
   issues are editorial and simply need clarification in the spec,
   others are real issues/questions).

I agree with Tim's responses to the issues.  I'll limit my responses
to the editorial comments he didn't cover.

   In the specification some of the sections eg, 10.1,10.2 have no
   white space after the section number, others (eg section 9.7,1.6 do
   have a single space). Some sections, eg 13.10 are followed by
   multiple whitespace characters.  I think this is caused by
   conversion from Microsoft Word to ASCII.  We should correct this
   before submitting the draft.

Yes, I will be doing this (I used to do this for the internet drafts,
but after around draft 6, decided it was not a productive use of my
time :-).

   Section 4.4 starts to talk about the UNCHECKOUT on a Working
   Resource.  I think this text would make more sense if it was in
   "Working Resource Feature" section 8.

Done.

   Section 5.5 defines this mechanism where OPTIONS can be used to
   find a possible location in the namespace that is to be used for
   version histories.

   I also think an example of the OPTIONS method being used for this
   would be good as it is quite different from other uses of OPTIONS.

Done.

   Reading section 5.6 it took us quite a while to decide how to
   delete the last version from a version history.  I think the answer
   is "you don't" you must delete the version history itself in order
   to delete the last version.  Did we interpret this correctly?  Do
   you think we should clarify this in the spec?

Done.

Thanks for the review!

Cheers,
Geoff
