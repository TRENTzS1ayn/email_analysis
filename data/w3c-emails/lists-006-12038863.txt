   From: Peter Raymond [mailto:Peter.Raymond@merant.com]

   Another issue which was raised at the London IETF was what would 
   happen if the CHECKIN failed perhaps because forking properties 
   would disallow it?

The protocol currently states that the CHECKIN is a postcondition
of the UNLOCK, which means the UNLOCK MUST fail if the checkin
cannot succeed.  I'll add a note to this section to indicate that
this applies both to an explicit UNLOCK as well as to an implicit
unlock resulting from the lock timing out.

   And also I raised a question asking if a more 
   explicit error code should be returned when an If header specifies 
   a lock which has timed-out rather than an invalid lock, I believe 
   that at the moment a client cannot tell the difference. 

I'll comment on this in a note to the WebDAV mailing list, since
this is a WebDAV question, rather than a DeltaV question.

Cheers,
Geoff
