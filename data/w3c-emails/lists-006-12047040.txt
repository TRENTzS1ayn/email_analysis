   I think it is sufficient for the spec to state what it means when the
   property includes a given value, without having to distinguish between
   missing and empty properties.  However, to make the document readable and
   unambiguous I support the (purely editorial) change to refer to the
   properties being removed.

I agree.

   I don't think that there is any distinction to be made.

I agree.

Cheers,
Geoff
