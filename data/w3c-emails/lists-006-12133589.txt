We'd have to introduce push technology into HTTP.

Sounds like fun and certainly something I would be interested in.

But, how would we do that over HTTP? Since the protocol is 
request-response based the client
would
have to be polling at regular intervals asking if any events of interest 
have occurred.
Would this perform well?
