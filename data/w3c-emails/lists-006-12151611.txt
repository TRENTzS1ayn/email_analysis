The semantics of DAV:checked-in and DAV:checked-out are so
different, that it would be misleading to unify them into
a single property.  DAV:checked-in says "this version is a
copy of the current state of this resource, and you can use
this version URL if you want to remember or pass around a
reference to this current state.  The DAV:checked-out just
says "here is a state that is arbitrarily different from the
current state of the resource, but does reflect the last
state of this resource prior to the current state that is
captured in the version history.  So other than the fact
that they both contain version URL's, there is no semantic
similarity between these two properties.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

I was thinking about the issue of properties being removed or empty
depending on the
state of the resource and the effect this has on PROPFIND and
supported-property-set
etc.  It struck me as odd that the protocol defines DAV:checked-in and
DAV:checked-out
as two separate properties, rather than having one property to identify
the version and
another to identify the state (eg is it checked-in or checked-out).
I would have thought something like the following would be more logical,
this way the
properties are always present:

3.2.1DAV:version (protected)

This property appears on a version-controlled resource, and identifies a
version that
has the same content and dead properties as the version-controlled
resource.

<!ELEMENT version (href)>


3.2.2DAV:status (protected)

This property appears on a version-controlled resource, and identifies
the state of
that resource (checked-in or checked-out).  This property is changed
when the resource
is checked out or checked-in.

<!ELEMENT status ANY>
ANY value: A single element which can be either a DAV:checked-in element
or a
DAV:checked-out element.

<!ELEMENT checked-in EMPTY>
<!ELEMENT checked-out EMPTY>


Is there a good reason why the above is not desirable or why the current
behaviour
is better?
