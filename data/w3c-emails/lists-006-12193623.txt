Peter,
The delete from the merge-set is deleting the version URL from the 
merge-set, not deleting the version itself. This just indicates the user 
is done doing the merge from that entry.

Hi,

I just noticed a potential problem with versions being used for a merge
operation
being deleted during the merge.

Section 11 says a checked-out resource has a DAV:merge-set identifying
versions
to be merged.  DELETE (section 11.5) says it will remove entries from
the
merge-set.  Shouldn't the server disallow the DELETE, someone somewhere
is in the
middle of a merge using this version, also there would be a race
condition if someone
deletes the version while the client is processing the DAV:merge-set of
a checked-out
resource.

Regards,
