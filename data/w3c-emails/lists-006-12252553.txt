Well, the client's listening port could also be the standard http port if it is not occupied by a
running web server. This should reduce firewall problems

Alternative ways to get the invalidation responses through could be:
- consider the use of UDP packages
- let clients know about each other to a certain degree and use them to spread out messages (maybe
btree like)
I am not quite sure about the consequence of this approach but it could reduce the server's number
of sockets considerably.

Maybe polling could be offered as a fallback in case a firewall blocks all other communication.
However, opening a listening port on client side will probably provide to less overall network
traffic and to least delay.
