   Given that you cannot simultaneously lock all the versions (identified by
   the DAV:merge-set property on all the checked-out version-controlled
   resources), and to reduce the requirements for a locking server, I'm more
   inclined to make a guess that deleting conflicting versions is
infrequent,
   and simply retry the entire merge to get the latest server state.

I agree with Tim's suggestion here.

Cheers,
Geoff
