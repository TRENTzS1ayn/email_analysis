In an attempt to unify the responses from MERGE and UPDATE, and to address
the concerns some have expressed for parsing the responses of these methods,
I propose that:
(a) the DAV:ignore-set is dropped from the responses.  What would you do
with them anyway?  Speak up if you have a use-case that requires these; and,
(b) the response marshalling should be in the Multi-Status format so that
implementations can reuse their existing code.  I think the responses will
fit well in this format.

Note that (a) will simplify the protocol, and (b) will simplify the
implementation without changing the semantics of the operations.  They are
relatively minor changes.

Regards,
Tim
