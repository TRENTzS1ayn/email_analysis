Ah, the wonderful ambiguities of English ... (:-).

This thread was about deleting the "last" version in the sense of
"the only version left in the version history".  The result of this
would be a version history with no versions in it, which is not
allowed by the spec.

I believe you are referring to the "last" version in the sense
of "the one that was created most recently in a linear history".
That is totally legal to delete (assuming it is not the only
version left in the history), and having the VCR revert to the
immediately preceding version is very reasonable (although not
required by the protocol).

Cheers,
Geoff

As currently implemented, my server will allow you to delete the last
version.  That version goes away and the VCR reverts to the next to last
version.

That solution works because I don't fork.

But if the consensus is to prohibit this I can prohibit it (except as a
side effect of UNCHECKOUT, though).
