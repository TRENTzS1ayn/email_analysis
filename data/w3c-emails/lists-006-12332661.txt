The protocol described in the ESI document allows to invalidate documents that have been downloaded
to a local machine by applying a push technology. This could solve already several conflict
situations or even partly prevent problems.

On the other hand there seems to be an increasing need for more fine-grained notification services
that extend the traditional access control systems. Picture 1 in the following longer article tries
to classify them:

"Beyond 'Yes or No' - Extending Access Control in Groupware with Negotiation and Awareness"
(http://www.informatik.uni-bonn.de/~os/Publications/COOP98a.ps)

Maybe those needs are also worth discussing if they could be supported in the spec in order to allow
applications to build up on them. The invalidation protocol seems to be a good basis also for this.

Check out
http://www.esi.org/invalidation_protocol_1-0.html for some work that looks pretty similar
to what we are talking about.
