To:ietf-dav-versioning@w3.org

This draft is also available in word and html format on the deltav
web site, but if you could review the text document (to catch typos
induced by the Word-to-txt process), that would be best.
Note that many of the section headings in the text version
have a space removed ... I will fix that in the final editing pass.

There will be a 2-week IETF wide last call issued sometime soon.
Please report any typo, no matter how small or trivial!

Thanks,
Geoff

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Web Versioning and Configuration Management
Working Group of the IETF.

Title: Versioning Extensions to WebDAV
Author(s): G. Clemm, J. Amsden, T. Ellison, 
                          C. Kaler, J. Whitehead
Filename: draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-17.txt
Pages: 107
Date: 22-Aug-01

This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types 
that define the WebDAV Versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol. 
WebDAV Versioning will minimize the complexity of clients that are
capable of interoperating with a variety of versioning repository
managers, to facilitate widespread deployment of applications capable of
utilizing the WebDAV Versioning services.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then

Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:

In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-17.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
