   Or, could you also just merge from the DAV:checked-in version of the VCR
to
   the working resource, and then check in the working resource? (Now that a
   working resource can be a merge target).

Not by the current protocol, since the DAV:no-overwrite-by-auto-update
postcondition states:

 If the DAV:auto-update property for the checked-out resource
 identifies a version-controlled resource, the DAV:checked-out property
 of the checked-out resource MUST identify the same version as the
 DAV:checked-in property of that version-controlled resource.

We could relax that constraint to say:

 If the DAV:auto-update property for the checked-out resource
 identifies a version-controlled resource, at least one of the
 versions identified by the DAV:predecessor-set property of the
 checked-out resource MUST identify a version that is either the same
 as or a descendant of the version identified by the DAV:checked-in
 property of that version-controlled resource.

If there are no objections, I'll place this on the "editorial fix"
list for draft 17.

Cheers,
Geoff
