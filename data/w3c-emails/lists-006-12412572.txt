During last call, I will be maintaining the "changes and issues"
document in real time, i.e. every time a change is proposed for the
draft, I will add it to the changes-and-issues file on our web site, i.e.:
http://www.webdav.org/deltav/protocol/changes-and-issues.htm
Ignore the "date" listed on the web page for this resource ... I probably
won't bother updating the date field each time I update the
changes-and-issues document.

Cheers,
Geoff
