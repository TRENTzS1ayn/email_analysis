That was an editorial change made by Tim Ellision.
The intent of the "advanced server workspace" and
"advanced client workspace" packages was a recommendation
that a server SHOULD implement all of the advanced
features if it implements any of the advanced features.
It was more direct to just make this statement directly,
which is what now appears in second paragraph of section 10.

Cheers,
Geoff

Draft 16 formally defined the "Advanced-Server-Workspace"
and "Advanced-Client-Workspace" packages in Section 10.3.
Draft 17 does not formally define such packages. Is this
change intentional?
