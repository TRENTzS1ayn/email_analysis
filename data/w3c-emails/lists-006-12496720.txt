The WebI WG in the IETF is also working on cache invalidation.  I've been
following this effort in order to ensure that it works for DAV permissions
changes as well as content changes.  As far as I can tell with their
requirements, it will work, because invalidation of caches due to
permissions changes is simple:

 - the only documents with permissions that can be cached at all are those
that are publicly readable
 - the only permissions change that affects the cache is a reduction in read
permissions, from publicly readable to not publicly readable
 - the only message that needs to be sent to the cache is "invalidate your
cache for this item"  Possibly the only detail to add is whether a new
download is recommended or not.

You specifically mention push, which could mean just sending a simple
notification, or it could mean pushing the body.  I don't like pushing the
new body to clients.  The only thing that should be pushed is a message, as
simple as possible, saying "invalidate your cache for this item; a new
download should be done".   This leaves the client able to make the request
when most appropriate, which is more likely to be "just-in-time" than
pre-fetch.

It's possible for web sites to push a new body to sophisticated caching
servers that they have a special relationship with; that makes web sites
that update in the night able to vastly reduce traffic by using low-load
times to get the new content out one hop.  However, that's very different
than pushing to all clients.  I'd point out that these caching servers are
trying to figure out how to charge the web sites to improve their
availability and reduce load in this manner.  In other words, push is
something web sites are likely to have to pay for, because most end-points
don't want to receive a costly push for free.
