That sounds like a sensible suggestion to me.
I'll make that change in the final editorial pass,
if nobody objects.

Cheers,

Subject: No recommendation for how to make a resource unversioned



Given the controversy and the problems with every method that's been
suggested to make a resource unversioned, I suggest that the DeltaV draft
should be silent on the question.  That means striking the non-normative
note on how clients might achieve this with COPY, DELETE, MOVE (a
problematic approach because COPY creates a new resource, and thus
initializes all sorts of new-resources stuff like default ACLs,
creationdate, owner, access history).

I think we'll need to deal with this issue in the future, but it can wait.
