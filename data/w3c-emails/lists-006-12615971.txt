Yes, as long as the extension elements can safely be ignored by servers
and clients that don't understand them (this is a WebDAV requirement,
not a DeltaV requirement).

just a check:

is it ok to put "arbitrary" extension elements into deltaV request/response
bodies, as long as they don't live in the DAV: namespace?
