This was discussed in the ondon IETF meeting and reported in the minutes
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-dav-versioning/2001JulSep/0193.html


As I recall, there was little objection in the room to this report as it
was considered a relatively simple recursion for the client and/or server
to implement.

Not sure what you mean here.  The 'redirect' to the version is simply a
convenience.  What do you mean by "each version in the VCR"?  The report
will be applied to all versions in the version history of a version.

No, the properties will be returned for all versions on a single REPORT
request.

The version tree report reports properties on versions.  You would simply
use PROPFIND to get the properties for a version-controlled resource.  Of
course, you could use the expand property report to get properties for a
version-controlled resource and its checked-in/-out version and/or version
history.

I have no strong objection to tis, but would like to see the `compelling
use case' that warrants a change.

This is already covered in the postcondition for REPORT, right?
