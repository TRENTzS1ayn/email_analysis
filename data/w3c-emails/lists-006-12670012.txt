The expand-property report is precisely a recursive PROPFIND
(i.e. when the server hits a specified property value that contains an
href, it recursively invoke PROPFIND on that href (just dumping the
results to the same output stream as nested XML). How is this not a
simple recursion?

And note that no rewriting of your client is necessary ...  your
client does not have to invoke expand-property unless it choses to do
so, since it is just a performance optimization (i.e. decreases the
number of roundtrips).

Note that "consensus" does not mean "unanimous".  Note also that
"SHOULD" (unlike "MUST") tells the client that it needs to be prepared
for servers that chose not to implement it, so a server is in
compliance even if it does not implement a SHOULD.

Perhaps you could provide more explanation about why you can't just
invoke your PROPFIND code recursively on your server to produce the
expand-property report?
