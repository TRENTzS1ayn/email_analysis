Sorry, can't help you there<g>

I'm not implying that it is, but reporting my view of the opinion expressed
in the meeting.

Ok, but with the greatest respect that is not a good enough reason to
object to the spec.  Clearly it is technically possible becuase a number of
others have either already implemented it without too much pain, or did not
object on the grounds of technical difficulty.

There were no objections raised in the meeting or when the minutes were
published.  I'd consider that a consensus.

From RFC2418 "Working Group Guidelines":

'The core rule for operation is that acceptance or agreement is achieved
via working group "rough consensus".'

'Note that 51% of the working group does not qualify as "rough consensus"
and 99% is better than rough.'

How does this help?  They are both imply the functionality is optional.
