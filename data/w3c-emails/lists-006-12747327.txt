There is no material difference to a client implementer,
since both MAY and SHOULD means that your client needs to
prepared for it not being implemented.

The only difference is to a server implementer, and even
there, it is just a hint from the working group to the
implementor, not a requirement.

The consensus at the IETF meeting was that the expand-property
report was valuable enough (as demonstrated on the mailing list)
for it to be worth strengthening the MAY to a SHOULD.
Currently, we have only received objections from one vendor
about this, which does not in my opinion represent sufficient
opposition to reflect a lack of consensus.

Cheers,
Geoff
