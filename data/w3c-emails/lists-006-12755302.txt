Hey, if you can run a country that way, I'm sure we can write a spec like

Let's agree on what it _ought_ to say rather than on the process that got
us to this point or what you will recommend.

Given that the report will be useful in a number of interesting scenarios I
think it is a useful optimization that servers SHOULD implement.  Note that
clients are free not use use it, and servers are free not to implement it
and both will be within the spec.  But servers should be encouraged to
implement it and clients should be encouraged to look for it and use it.
