Hi,

This is a minor editorial issue...

In the properties for a working resource (section 9.2) we define
DAV:checkout-fork and
DAV:checkin-fork.  I propose we refer back to sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2? By
defining them
in section 9.2 it gives the impression that they have some other behaviour
when defined 
on a working resource rather than any other checked-out resource.

Regards,
