That change is fine with me.  I'll make it if there are no objections.
Cheers,

This is a minor editorial issue... 
In the properties for a working resource (section 9.2) we define
DAV:checkout-fork and 
DAV:checkin-fork.  I propose we refer back to sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2? By
defining them 
in section 9.2 it gives the impression that they have some other behaviour
when defined 
on a working resource rather than any other checked-out resource.
