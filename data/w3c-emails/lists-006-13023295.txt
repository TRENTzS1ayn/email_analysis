Abstract

   In many cases, a versioning-aware client might want to
   display/include the URI of the version it's editing while it's being
   edited.  For instance, an editor might include this as meta
   information, or the author of a document might want to know the URI
   of the version before it's checked in.  A well-known example is the
   W3C way of referring to document versions in recommendations: it
   contains references to "the current version", to "this version" and
   to the "previous version".  Something like this is currently
   impossible with the current draft version of WebDAV deltaV [deltaV],
   as the version URI is determined at the time of CHECKIN.

   Distribution of this document is unlimited.  Please send comments to

Internet-Draft      CHECKIN URI in WebDAV versioning      September 2001


2. Introduction

   In many cases, a versioning-aware client might want to
   display/include the URI of the version it's editing while it's being
   edited.  For instance, an editor might include this as meta
   information, or the author of a document might want to know the URI
   of the version before it's checked in.  A well-known example is the
   W3C way of referring to document versions in recommendations: it
   contains references to "the current version", to "this version" and
   to the "previous version".  Something like this is currently
   impossible with the current draft version of WebDAV deltaV [deltaV],
   as the version URI is determined at the time of CHECKIN.

   This specification builds on the infrastructure provided by the
   WebDAV Versioning Protocol, adding support for servers willing to
   compute an "expected CHECKIN URI" upon CHECKOUT, and using this URI
   at time of CHECKIN.

3. Changes for CHECKOUT method (when applied to a version-controlled
   resource)

   A client may ask for an "expected CHECKIN URI" upon CHECKOUT.  This
   is done by placing DAV:compute-expected-checkin-URI as top-level
   element into the request body.  The server is free to either ignore
   the request, or to return it's best guess about what the URI for a
   version resource created upon CHECKIN would be.

   The client can detect the "expected CHECKIN URI" by parsing the
   response body for a top-level element called DAV:expected-checkin-
   URI.

3.1 Example for successful CHECKOUT with computed-checkin-URI

    >>Request

      CHECKOUT /foo.html HTTP/1.1
      Host: www.webdav.org
      Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
      Content-Length: xxxx

      <D:checkout xmlns:D="DAV:">
        <D:compute-expected-version-URI />
      </D:checkout>

    >>Response

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Cache-Control: no-cache
      Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
      Content-Length: xxxx

      <D:checkout-response xmlns:D="DAV:">

<D:expected-version-URI>http://repo.webdav.org/his/23/ver/32</D:expected-ver
sion-URI>
      </D:checkout-response>

   In this example, the server was able to compute the "expected CHECKIN
   URI" and returned it in the DAV:expected-version-URI element.

Internet-Draft      CHECKIN URI in WebDAV versioning      September 2001


3.2 Example for successful CHECKOUT without computed-checkin-URI

    >>Request

      CHECKOUT /foo.html HTTP/1.1
      Host: www.webdav.org
      Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
      Content-Length: xxxx

      <D:checkout xmlns:D="DAV:">
        <D:compute-expected-version-URI />
      </D:checkout>

    >>Response

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Cache-Control: no-cache

   In this case, no response body was returned, and thus no "expected
   CHECKIN URI" is available.  Simarily, the server may also return

    >>Response

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Cache-Control: no-cache
      Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
      Content-Length: xxxx

      <D:checkout-response xmlns:D="DAV:">
          ...other content...
      </D:checkout-response>

   where a response body is available, but it doesn't contain the
   DAV:expected-checkin-URI element.

4. Changes for CHECKIN method (when applied to a version-controlled
   resource)

   A client may submit the "expected CHECKIN URI" (obtained during
   CHECKOUT) upon a CHECKIN by placing it into a top-level DAV:expected-
   checkin-URI element in the request body.  A server may

   o  simply ignore the presence of this information or

   o  use the information and try to checkin the resource using the
      "expected checkin URI" as location for the version resource.  A
      failure to create a version resource at the "expected checkin URI"
      MUST cause the operation to fail with a status code of 403
      (forbidden) and a response body containing the top-level element
      DAV:cannot-assign-expected-version-URI.  In addition, a server MAY
      return a new "expected checkin URI" in it's response body.


4.1 Example for successful CHECKIN with computed-checkin-URI

   >>Request

     CHECKIN /foo.html HTTP/1.1
     Host: www.webdav.org
     Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
     Content-Length: xxxx

     <D:checkin xmlns:D="DAV:">

<D:expected-version-URI>http://repo.webdav.org/his/23/ver/32</D:expected-ver
sion-URI>
     </D:checkin>

    >>Response

     HTTP/1.1 201 Created
     Location: http://repo.webdav.org/his/23/ver/32
     Cache-Control: no-cache

5. Compatibility Considerations

   This specification does introduce new protocol elements for the
   request and response bodies for CHECKIN and CHECKOUT.

   Clients not aware of this specification will never submit the new
   protocol elements in a request and therefore never will see the new
   response elements.

   Servers not aware of this specification will ignore the additional
   two request body elements which is legal behaviour according to this
   protocol (indicating that the protocol extension is not available).

6. Internationalization Considerations

   This proposal builds on [deltaV], and inherits its

   This proposal does not introduce any new IANA considerations, since
   it does not specify any new namespaces (in the general sense), but
   merely uses existing ones.
