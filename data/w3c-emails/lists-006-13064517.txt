My impression is that there is more support for having the
default value of the Depth header for a given method to
be the "natural" value for that method, not some global
default (and as you point out below, section 9.2 of 2518
supports that position).  

For the UPDATE method, Tim pointed out that
Depth:0 is the more natural default for the Depth
header since Depth:infinity only makes sense when the label
feature is supported and DAV:label-name is specified in the
request body.  That argument makes sense to me.

(And just for the record, I believe that
making the default Depth value for PROPFIND be Depth:infinity
was a mistake, and that it should be changed to Depth:0
in the next rev of 2518, but that's a thread for a different
mailing list :-).

Cheers,
Geoff

My objection is that if this is being done for consistency, then the spec
should be consistent with RFC 2518.

From section 8.1: "By default, the PROPFIND method without a Depth header
MUST act as if a "Depth: infinity" header was included. "

Section 8.8.8: "The Depth header is unnecessary as the default behavior of
COPY on a collection is to act as if a "Depth: infinity" header had been
submitted. "

On the other hand, from section 9.2: "Methods which support the Depth header
may choose not to support all of the header's values and may define, on a
case by case basis, the behavior of the method if a Depth header is not
present."
