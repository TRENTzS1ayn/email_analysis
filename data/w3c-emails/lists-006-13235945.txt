This is the final version of the deltav draft, which
has been submitted to the IESG for approval and "nroff'ification".

All issues raised during the IESG last call (which ended
on September 7) have been addressed.
The changes from draft 17 to draft 18 are described in
the "changes and issues" document
<http://www.webdav.org/deltav/protocol/changes-and-issues.htm>.

I'd like all of my co-authors to carefully review the text
version of draft-18 (I have hand edited this version, to fix all
of the various Word-generation anomalies).  If any other member
of the deltav working group has some time to review the text
version, that would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks to everyone in the DeltaV working group for all the hard
work over the last three years!  Now we can all focus on
finishing up our implementations (:-).

Cheers,
Geoff

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Web Versioning and Configuration Management
Working Group of the IETF.

Title: Versioning Extensions to WebDAV
Author(s): G. Clemm, J. Amsden, T. Ellison, 
                          C. Kaler, J. Whitehead
Filename: draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-18.txt
Pages: 106
Date: 12-Sep-01

This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and resource types 
that define the WebDAV Versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol. 
WebDAV Versioning will minimize the complexity of clients that are
capable of interoperating with a variety of versioning repository
managers, to facilitate widespread deployment of applications capable of
utilizing the WebDAV Versioning services.

In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-18.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
