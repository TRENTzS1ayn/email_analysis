   From: Peter Raymond [mailto:Peter.Raymond@merant.com]

   Reading section 11 it implies that when DAV:source is a workspace
   (or collection) and the target URL is also a workspace (or
   collection) if a VCR is found in the source collection but not in
   the target it is ignored and not added, this seems odd.  Why is
   this? Surely the file should be added to the target collection.

   From: Geoff Clemm

   It could be, but if the owner of the target workspace has just
   explicitly deleted the VCR that referenced the VHR of the version,
   to recreate that VCR as a result of the merge would be wrong.
   Similarly, if all of those VHR's were moved into a different
   baselined collection (not visible in the target workspace), to
   recreate them in the collection they were just moved from would
   be wrong.

I should have added that if the inverse were true, i.e. the files
were added in source workspace, it would be wrong *not* to add the
files into the destination workspace.  So it is ambiguous.

Note that there is no problem when the server supports versioned
collections, because the collection version would be merged first,
and it would add the VCR to the destination that would then be the
target of the merge for the new version.  If the server does not
support versioned collections, then the client should do a merge-preview
first, and ask the user what should be done about "ignored" versions.
If the user says "ignore", then just invoke MERGE.  If the user says
"add them", then the client would first add the appropriate VCR's
to the destination, and then invoke merge.

Cheers,
Geoff
