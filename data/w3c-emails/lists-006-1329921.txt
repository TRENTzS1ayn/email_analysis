OK, that's enough of a consensus for me (:-).

Unless anyone objects, I will add a sentence to
section 1.8 (Versioning Methods and Locks) explicitly
identifying MKRESOURCE and MKACTIVITY as additional
methods that can be applied to a lock null resource.

Cheers,
Geoff

Given that DeltaV will be streaking through the standards process faster
than 2518 can get a revision out (:-), I think unfortunately this is
required.

Agreed.

This is the real 'solution'.
