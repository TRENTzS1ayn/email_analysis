Hi,

Yes, what you said matches how I thought Version Controlled Collections
work, but does not match the specification.

A Version Controlled Collection DOES have bindings to Version Controlled
Resources
and this is fine, I understand this and it makes sense.

A Collection Version (for example the DAV:checked-in version of the Version
Controlled Collection) has bindings to Version Histories.

But the issue I was reporting was that section 10.2 defines the bindings of
a COLLECTION VERSION to be bindings to Version Controlled Resources.  This
is incorrect and does not match what you said in your reply.

I propose we make two changes:

1.

It takes some time to understand section 14, it would have helped if the
diagram 
was complete and showed that /x is a Version Controlled Collection, and that
V2 
of VH14 is a Collection Version.


2.

The current text of 10.2 says:

Collection Version Resource

       A "collection version resource", or simply "collection version",
       captures the content, dead properties, and version-controlled
       bindings of a version-controlled collection (see Section 14).  A
       version-controlled binding is a binding to a version-controlled
       resource.....

I propose we make this clearer and say:

Collection Version Resource

 A "collection version resource", or simply "collection version",
       captures the content, dead properties, and bindings to the 
       Version History Resources identified in the the version-controlled
       bindings of a version-controlled collection (see Section 14).  A
       version-controlled binding is a binding to a version-controlled
       resource. A binding of a collection version is a binding to a
       version history resource.
