Peter,
I found this quite helpful. Greg, how could we host this on 
webdav.org/deltav? Just save as HTML and provide a link off an notes page?

Hi, 

Here are two slides representing Version Controlled Collections in 
powerpoint... 
Is my understanding of VCCs (as shown in these slides) correct? 
Is this useful stuff to put on www.webdav.org/deltav? 

 <<Version Controlled Collections.ppt>>
