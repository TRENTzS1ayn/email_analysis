Looks fine to me.  Do you have a web site you could post this on,
that I could link to from the deltav site?  That was how most of the
document references are currently handled.
Otherwise, we could also just put the source of these slides
directly on the deltav site.

Cheers,
Geoff

Subject: Powerpoint slides of Version Controlled Collections....


Hi, 
Here are two slides representing Version Controlled Collections in
powerpoint... 
Is my understanding of VCCs (as shown in these slides) correct? 
Is this useful stuff to put on www.webdav.org/deltav? 
<<Version Controlled Collections.ppt>> 
Regards,
