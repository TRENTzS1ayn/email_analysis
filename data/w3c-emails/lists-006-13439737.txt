I added the .mdl source for this model to the web site, and added a link
in the deltav home page.

Note that this model is somewhat out-of-date.  I am currently working on 
producing a version that accurately reflects the final draft (18).

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

I am trying to implement DeltaV and I could find the HTML Rose model.
Can someone send me the source model?

Thanks in advance,
