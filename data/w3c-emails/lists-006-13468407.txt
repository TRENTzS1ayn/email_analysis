Yes, it should have been marked "V3".  I'll get
that fixed.  Thanks for finding that typo!

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi, 
A very minor editorial point but the diagram of 
activities in section 13 is missing a 
version name.  In the diagram foo.html has a version
pointed to by Activity Act-1 
but this has no version name.  I think it should be V3.
