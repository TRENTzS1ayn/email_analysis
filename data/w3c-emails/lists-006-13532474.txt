The DAV:merge-preview Report's response used to look like
the responses of MERGE and UPDATE, but then DAV:ignore-set
was dropped from MERGE and UPDATE, and MERGE and UPDATE's
responses were brought in line with Multi-Status format
following Tim Ellison's suggestion on August 21:

Does it make sense to bring the DAV:merge-preview Report
request and response format in line with the current format
for MERGE and UPDATE?

Also, as of draft-18, DAV:merge-preview Report identifies
the common ancestor version for merge targets that need
logical content merging by clients, but MERGE does not
(though of course of client can still request a
DAV:version-tree Report and compute the common ancestor
itself). Does it make sense to introduce a mechanism (such
as a property) for the server to identify common ancestor
versions after a MERGE?

Thanks,
Roy
