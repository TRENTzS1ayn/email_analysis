Yes, all modifications to the baseline collection are illegal -- in many
implementations the collection will be a 'virtual' reflection of the
contents of the baseline.  Clearly there is already the mechanism within
DAV to disallow these methods (e.g., supported method set) but calling them
regular version-controlled resources is misleading -- they are in no way
'regular'.

Hi,

The Baseline Collection captures the state of resources that were in the
Baseline-Controlled Collection when the Baseline was created or when the
Version-Controlled Configuration checked-in.
In my opinion the resources in the Baseline Collection should be frozen
(since they just capture state), but, the specification only seems to
disallow CHECKOUT of a member of this collection.

Section 12.11 defines (in precondition
DAV:must-not-update-baseline-collection)
that CHECKOUT cannot be done on a member of a Baseline Collection.
Shouldn't
other operations, eg COPY, MOVE, PUT, DELETE, PROPPATCH also be prevented
on
members of a baseline collection?

If these methods can be done on members of the baseline collection then
the baseline is not stable and can be changed without checking out the
Version-Controlled Configuration...this seems odd....
