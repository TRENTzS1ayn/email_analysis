The definition of the DAV:baseline-collection property states:

"each member of this collection has the same 
DAV:checked-in version and relative name as a 
member of the baseline-controlled collection at
the time the baseline was created"

I believe this makes it sufficiently clear that no operations
that would add/remove/change members of the DAV:baseline-collection
are allowed.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi, 
The Baseline Collection is a collection so there is nothing to stop you 
doing a PUT on that collection.  Unless we explicitly have a precondition 
for PUT that says you cannot put to a baseline collection. 
Same for destination for a MOVE or COPY.
