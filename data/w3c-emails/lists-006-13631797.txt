   From: Peter Raymond [mailto:Peter.Raymond@merant.com]

   It was the text in section 12 where it says "... that are not
   members of another configuration" that leads to the confusion.
   Lets imagine you have the structure in the e-mail below and you put
   the build collection under baseline control by issuing a
   BASELINE-CONTROL request.  Can you now issue another
   BASELINE-CONTROL request on build/src?  I guess not since the
   resulting configuration would contain members of the configuration
   defined by the initial BASELINE-CONTROL request.  Also the
   pre-condition (DAV:version-controlled-configuration-must-not-exist)
   would be triggered because build/src already has a
   version-controlled configuration property.

Yes, that is correct.

   BUT...I guess you could
   have done that in the reverse order...eg...  If I issue a
   BASELINE-CONTROL method on build/src first I would then be able to
   later put the build collection itself under BASELINE-CONTROL.  Is
   that right?

Yes.  You could also take  a collection that was under baseline
control and MOVE it under another configuration (it would not 
become part of that other configuration, but just would be located
under it from a namespace perspective).

   Would the second baseline contain members from build
   and build/include but no members from build/src? Because the second
   configuration can not contain members from the first configuration?

Yes, also correct.

Cheers,
Geoff
