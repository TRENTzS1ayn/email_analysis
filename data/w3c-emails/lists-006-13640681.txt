Hi,

OK...I guess that section does make it clear.

But, how much of the normative text should be captured in pre and post
conditions? Without any pre or post condition to enforce the paragraph
that you quoted do vendors have to obey that paragraph?

Would I am getting at is that other areas where we are enforcing something
we explicitly enforce it using pre or post conditions.  But not this one.

Regards,

The definition of the DAV:baseline-collection property states:

"each member of this collection has the same 
DAV:checked-in version and relative name as a 
member of the baseline-controlled collection at
the time the baseline was created"

I believe this makes it sufficiently clear that no operations
that would add/remove/change members of the DAV:baseline-collection
are allowed.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi, 
The Baseline Collection is a collection so there is nothing to stop you 
doing a PUT on that collection.  Unless we explicitly have a precondition 
for PUT that says you cannot put to a baseline collection. 
Same for destination for a MOVE or COPY.
