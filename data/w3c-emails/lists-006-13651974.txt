Yes, we normally prefer to define constraints in the form of preconditions,
but in this case, the single statement "must never change" in the property
definition was so much simpler that repeating it in each "mutating" method.
But I agree that this normative aspect of the property
definition should be highlighted.  I suggest we change the "has" to a
"MUST have" in the definition to make this point (a change that fits the
"no-repagination" goal :-).

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi, 
OK...I guess that section does make it clear. 
But, how much of the normative text should be captured in pre and post 
conditions? Without any pre or post condition to enforce the paragraph 
that you quoted do vendors have to obey that paragraph? 
Would I am getting at is that other areas where we are enforcing something 
we explicitly enforce it using pre or post conditions.  But not this one. 
Regards,
