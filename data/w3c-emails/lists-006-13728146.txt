Hi,

I was reading section 13 with a group of other staff in MERANT and we came 
across section 13.12 which talks about automatically checking-in any 
checked-out resources referenced by an activity which is specified as part 
of the DAV:source set for the MERGE.

Why does MERGE behave like this for activities and not for other resources 
(see the precondition DAV:cannot-merge-checked-out-resource in section 11.2.

This auto-checkin behaviour seems to add more complexity to the
implementation 
of MERGE and seems to be inconsistent.  What was the use case for including
this 
auto-checkin behaviour only for activities?

Regards,
