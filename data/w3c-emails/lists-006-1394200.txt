Yes, I thought that was pretty clear from Tim's preliminary statement
for the lists, i.e.:

  The defining feature is noted in square brackets (so if your server
  "doesn't do activities" then you don't get to play with any [activity] 
  properties).

Jim: If you have an idea on how to reword this to make it clearer, please
let me know (but I don't think it best to repeat this in the title of
each section).

Cheers,
Geoff

Indeed, and that goes for all the resources -- each property only appears
*if* the server supports the listed option.
