I presume this would mean that I could check out a Baseline into the
activity, and that baseline would be checked back in with the activity? And
that the VCC would be updated?


But all that probably isn't going to help anyways. We check out version
resources. The DAV:auto-update mechanism does not work when dealing with
version resources.

I object. :-)

The existing specification provides for an atomic check/merge of a set of
resources. Dropping the activities from the MERGE would eliminate that.
