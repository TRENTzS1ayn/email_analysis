The webdav.org machine has 15 gigabytes of free disk space. And that disk
space is dedicated exclusively for use of webdav.org. Heck, the whole
machine is dedicated :-)

In other words, please feel free to put the big files up there. I've already
had inquiries for mirroring the web site in Australia and Japan. It's a

they will be mirrored, and those are *exactly* what you want to mirror :-)
