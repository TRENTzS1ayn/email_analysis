Hurray!

Congratulations to the entire DeltaV working group for reaching this
milestone!  This is a significant event as it reflects confidence in the
work of the group over a number of years, the first step along the Internet
Standards track, and protocol stability for client and server developers.

Special thanks and credit is deserved, of course, for Geoff Clemm,
DeltaV-er extraordinaire for his tireless progression of the work.

I'm sure we'll see DeltaV implementations being written to the new Proposed
Standard imminently.  In the meantime the entire working group should take
a moment to reach over and pat ourselves on the back!

The IESG has approved the Internet-Draft 'Versioning Extensions to
WebDAV' <draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-18.txt> as a Proposed Standard.
This document is the product of the Web Versioning and Configuration
Management Working Group.  The IESG contact persons are Ned Freed and

Technical Summary

  This specification defines a set of methods, headers, and resource types
  that define the WebDAV Versioning extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.
  WebDAV Versioning includes:

       - Automatic versioning for versioning-unaware clients,
       - Version history management,
       - Workspace management,
       - Baseline management,
       - Activity management, and
       - URL namespace versioning.
