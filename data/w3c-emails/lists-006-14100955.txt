We use cheap copies, not branching.

Not supported.

Effectively, we do:

$ svn cp /trunk /branches/gstein-work


Hmm. I just realized that the original question made it seem like some weird
side effect. But in the case under discussion, you're doing a MERGE on an
*activity*. Thus, it makes perfect sense to take all resources contained in
that activity as the merge source.
