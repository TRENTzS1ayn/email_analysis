That rewording is fine with me.  I'll make the swap.

Cheers,

Greg's description seems to be clearer, I like it.

Maybe change to: 
       "A configuration is a set of resources that consists of a root 
       collection and all members of that root collection except those 
       resources which are members of another configuration." 
IMO, that is a bit clearer that the resources *can* be in another 
configuration, and that they are excluded from the parent collection.
