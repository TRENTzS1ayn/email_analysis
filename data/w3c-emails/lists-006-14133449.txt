Fixed.  Thanks!  (Actually, it should be DAV:activity-checkout-set, but that
was clearly what you meant).

Cheers,

Spotted a typo in section 13.9, the DAV:update-checked-out-reference
postcondition mentions 
a property called DAV:activity-checkout.  I think it should be
DAV:checkout-activity-set. 
The -set is missing.
