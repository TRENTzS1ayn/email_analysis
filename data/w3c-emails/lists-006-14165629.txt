The DAV:activity-checkin functionality is required
to be atomic.  Since an activity is a "single logical change", it
is reasonable to expect a repository to support atomic
operations on a single logical change.  On the other hand,
it is not as obvious that a repository can/will support
the atomic checkin of an arbitrary set of resources.

So this is a reasonable issue to discuss, but it is a
non-trivial extension beyond the currently defined functionality.
So although capturing the current auto-checkin behavior of
MERGE in an explicit flag has no effect on the semantics,
extending the behavior to other non-activity checkin is
not something that I think reasonably fits in a final editorial
pass.  

Cheers,
Geoff

DAV:auto-activity-checkin would help. 
But, why only apply the auto-checkin to sources related to an activity? 
If we are going to add DAV:auto-activity-checkin.  Why not call it 
DAV:auto-checkin and also apply this logic to collections and other 
DAV:source elements?  I think this flag would be useful, eg to auto 
checkin ANY extracted merge source. 
One of the reasons that I raised the initial question was that 
the behaviour was inconsistent, eg checked-out resources were 
being treated differently by MERGE just because they were related 
to an activity.
