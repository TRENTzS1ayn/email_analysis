Don't need to tell the difference :-)  We only support the former.

Well, that is just dandy for our case :-)

Correct. And those new resources become version-controlled upon checkin.

Purely sequential, global revision numbers. Each revision is effectively a
baseline for the whole repository. No branching; just work on stuff in a
different "subdirectory" within the virtual filesystem.

Because CVS sucks so hard at the merge process, nobody ever uses branches
for temporary hiding of checkins. They are normally just used for longer
term branches.

[ yes, some people *do* create branches for every change. they're masochists ]

And creating a branch on *every* commit, just to support the two-phase
CHECKIN / MERGE? Bah. I don't care for persistent data artifacts that result
from a faulty design spec.
