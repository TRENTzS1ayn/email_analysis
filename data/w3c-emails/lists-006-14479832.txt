One more thing, I also looked at DeltaV draft-18
Section 1.8, which says

   If a write-locked resource has a non-computed
   property defined by this document, the property
   value MUST NOT be changed by a request unless the
   appropriate lock token is included in the request.

But since 13.1.1 and 13.1.2 define the
DAV:activity-version-set and DAV:activity-checkout-set
properties of an activity as computed, it still holds
that write locks on activity resources do not restrict
checkouts or checkins in that activity. 

Someone please correct me if I've missed something.

Thanks,
Roy
