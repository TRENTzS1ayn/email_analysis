   I'm following up on this discussion from 

 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-dav-versioning/2001OctDec/0021.html

   in a separate thread. Would it be appropriate to consider part of
   these changes in the editorial pass for the initial RFC?

I believe that this functionality can be achieved in a way that is
compatible with the current draft, i.e. no changes to the current
draft are needed for servers to support this extension.  (Note: I 
would not want to actually make the extension in the editorial pass).

      - Autoversioning (extension), baseline feature (use case): In
Section 3.2.2, change the EMPTY elements in the
DAV:auto-version property values to ANY, enabling DAV:checkin
and DAV:checkout elements with default checkin and checkout
options for the autoversioned VCR to be applied at
auto-checkin and auto-checkout time. Use case: multiple
workspaces share the same DAV:current-activity-set and the
same DAV:checked-in baselines for their version-controlled
configurations, and those VCCs' DAV:auto-version properties
are DAV:checkout. There is a problem because
baseline-controlled members of those workspaces cannot be
checked in even if they are for different version histories -
only the first workspace can auto-checkout its VCC unreserved
in the shared DAV:current-activity-set.

I agree that this is a reasonable use case.

   Continuing this discussion, is there a possibility that some of the
   following changes might be made in the first RFC?

      - In Section 3.2.2, change the EMPTY elements in the
DAV:auto-version property values to ANY to enable better
extensibility of those property values.

(The extension I have in mind is to include a
DAV:checkout or DAV:checkin element within the
DAV:auto-version property value to allow options
to be specified in auto-checkout and auto-checkin
operations.)

I wouldn't want to embed it in the DAV:auto-version property values,
since that would make it hard for the client to discover whether
this extension is supported.

     or, 

      - Around Section 3.2.2, define additional property names to hold
options for auto-checkout and auto-checkin operations.

That is how I'd want to define the extensions, but is more than I'd
want to do in an editorial pass.  Let's define those new properties in
draft form, and add it to the "proposed extensions" list.  (we already
have one such proposed extension on the web site, the "checkin URI"
extension).

Cheers,
Geoff
