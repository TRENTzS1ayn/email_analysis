   One more thing, I also looked at DeltaV draft-18 Section 1.8, which
   says

      If a write-locked resource has a non-computed property defined
      by this document, the property value MUST NOT be changed by a
      request unless the appropriate lock token is included in the
      request.

   But since 13.1.1 and 13.1.2 define the DAV:activity-version-set and
   DAV:activity-checkout-set properties of an activity as computed, it
   still holds that write locks on activity resources do not restrict
   checkouts or checkins in that activity.

Correct.

Cheers,
Geoff
