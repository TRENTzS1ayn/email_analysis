DeltaV supports an in-place editing model for situations where the server
does not support the Working Resource option, and where the client does not
do all their edits on their local copy.

By "in-place editing" I mean that when the VCR is checked out, clients can
do any number of PUT, PROPPATCH and other write operations, before finally
checking in.  In the meantime, this work-in-progress is available for other
users to see if they have permission to read the resource.

First question: Does anybody plan to implement DeltaV this way?  [I believe
Subversion effectively will (correct me if I'm wrong) but in practice
Subversion clients wouldn't do their write operations until just before
checking in, so there would only be a small window of opportunity to see
works-in-progress. ]

Second question:  Is there a way for clients to view working resources and
only see the latest checked-in versions?  E.g. I may be uninterested in
seeing "works in progress" affected by in-place editing.  Can I do a
PROPFIND depth-1 against the latest checked-in versions in a collection,
rather than the works-in-progress?
