Hi,

As I have mentioned before section 13.12 talks about auto-checkin of a
working baseline and seems to 
suggest that the MERGE method should then use the Baseline-Controlled
Collection (referenced by the 
working baseline) as the merge target.  My problem is how to find the
Baseline-Controlled Collection 
given a working baseline.

Does the working baseline have a property which identifies the
Baseline-Controlled Collection?
I do not see this property defined in the specification, so the only way I
can see to find a 
Baseline-Controlled Collection given a working baseline would be to:

*Find the Baseline History for this working baseline:
This is more than one operation because a checked-out resource does
not have a DAV:version-history 
property.  You need to find a version in the DAV:checked-out
property and query the DAV:version-history 
from that resource.

*Find a Version-Controlled Configuration that references the baseline
history (there should only be one?):
This is also not possible in one operation, you must find all VCCs
in the system (you probably do this 
by assuming they are all rooted in some server defined collection eg
/vcc) for each one you PROPFIND the
DAV:version-history property looking for a reference to the desired
baseline history.

*Now you have the VCC you can query it's
DAV:baseline-controlled-collection property!

This seems like a lot of work, I would propose that we add a
DAV:baseline-controlled-collection property to 
either the baseline resource and/or the working baseline resource.

Questions/comments, did I miss something?
