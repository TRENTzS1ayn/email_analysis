Hi,

I was talking with some people in MERANT about the baseline feature and we
were
discussing the various preconditions that enforce that members of a
baseline-collection
cannot be modified (eg the DAV:must-not-update-baseline-collection
preconditions).

It seems odd that the only way to identify a resource as a member of a
baseline-collection
is by looking at it's URL (eg where it lives in the namespace). Other
preconditions can be
enforced by looking at the type of resource (eg by looking either at
DAV:resource-type or
by looking at it's properties as in section 22), but these preconditions can
only be checked
by looking at the namespace.

It would be nice if all members of a baseline-collection had some property
to identify them
as such, so that the implementation of the code to enforce the preconditions
can be simple
and so that clients can also identify these resources (perhaps show them
greyed-out to 
indicate they cannot be modified).

Regards,
