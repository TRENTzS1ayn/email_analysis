Yes, the situation with baseline-control is the same as that
for version-control, i.e. that the COPY/MOVE is the best way
to take something out of baseline-control.  A server could
chose to allow the removal of the DAV:version-controlled-configuration
from a baseline-controlled configuration to mean "remove from
baseline control", but this is not something defined/supported
in the current protocol.  If a server allowed deletion of the
baseline history, then this is likely to "unbaseline-control"
all baseline controlled collections for that baseline history,
but here as well, this is not something defined/supported in
the current protocol.

Cheers,
Geoff

Subject: Removing a collection from baseline-control and deleting VCCs etc


Hi, 
I cannot see an obvious way to remove a collection from Baseline-Control. 
Would it involve copying the baseline-controlled collection, deleting the 
baseline etc and then renaming the copy of the collection back to it's 
original name? (Similar to removing a resource from version-control)? 
Copying a large configuration (with subbaselines etc) would be costly. 
I know we were saying that perhaps deleting a VHR would remove a resource 
from version control...does that also apply to deleting a baseline history? 
Can I delete the Version-Controlled Configuration or the Baseline History 
and what effect would this have?
