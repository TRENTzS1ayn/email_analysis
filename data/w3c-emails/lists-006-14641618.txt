Just to make sure we're on the same page, the interaction between
the client and a server will not be to ask each resource "where is
your xxx-collection-set", but rather to ask the first encountered
resource in a session "where are the xxx-collection-set values on
your server", and then use those values for the rest of the session.

This means that you would not be combining requests for xxx-collection-set
information with the other property information, but rather will be
asking for xxx-collection-set information around the same time you
are asking for OPTIONS information (i.e. what options are supported
by your server), which is why the xxx-collection-set information is
currently marshalled via OPTIONS, since *that* allows you to get all
this "configuration" information in one request.

Cheers,
Geoff

Obviously, it MUST be consistent across deltaV, ACL and future WebDAV
versions.

I honestly think that 2) is the best solution. For instance, it allows a
client to collect all it needs to know about a resource with one request.
