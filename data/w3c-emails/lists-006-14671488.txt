OK, this is useful to know and in my opinion should be spelled out in the
protocol
document that the only way to create a working baseline is by doing a
DAV:apply-to-version
checkout of a VCC.  Then I would be happy that my server can just look at
the
DAV:baseline-controlled-collection property of the VCC identified by the
DAV:auto-version.
At the moment I cannot guarantee that the working baseline has been created
by checking
out a VCC so I have to do the complex looking of properties and collection
members etc
as in my last e-mail.

Out of interest, are there any clients out there (or clients under design)
that
would be checking out a baseline to create a working baseline (as opposed to
checking
out a VCC with apply-to-version)?
