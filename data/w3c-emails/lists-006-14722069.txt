That makes sense and would be fine with me ("name" and "prop" even
have the same number of characters :-).

If nobody objects, I'll make that change.  I think this easily fits
within the "minor editorial change" criteria.

Cheers,
Geoff

My memory from mailing list discussions was the supported-live-property-set
should present property names the same way they're presented in other XML,
e.g. in propfind requests and responses.

The spec says:

3.1.4           DAV:supported-live-property-set (protected)
This property identifies the live properties that are supported by the
resource.  A live property is supported by a resource if that property has
the semantics defined for that property.  The value of this property MUST
identify all live properties defined by this document that are supported by
the resource, and SHOULD identify all live properties that are supported by
the resource.

<!ELEMENT supported-live-property-set (supported-live-property*)>
<!ELEMENT supported-live-property name>
<!ELEMENT name ANY>
ANY value: a property element type

I believe this should read:

3.1.4           DAV:supported-live-property-set (protected)
This property identifies the live properties that are supported by the
resource.  A live property is supported by a resource if that property has
the semantics defined for that property.  The value of this property MUST
identify all live properties defined by this document that are supported by
the resource, and SHOULD identify all live properties that are supported by
the resource.

<!ELEMENT supported-live-property-set (supported-live-property*)>
<!ELEMENT supported-live-property prop>
<!ELEMENT prop ANY>
ANY value: a property element type
