Yes, that was what I remembered (i.e. the question was asked,
the reason for not doing so was given, and there was no further
discussion).  But given the minor nature of the marshalling change, if 
nobody disagrees, I'd be willing to make the change.  But even
a single disagreement would veto the change.  Any vetos?

Cheers,
Geoff
