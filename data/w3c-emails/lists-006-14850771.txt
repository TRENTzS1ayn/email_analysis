Hi,

It's not only "can never checkout" it's also..."can never COPY into this
collection", 
"can never MOVE out of or into this collection".  The Baseline Collection
itself is
not VERSION-CONTROLLED and as such does not need to be checkedout to be
modified.

I agree it is something for an extension.  I may propose an extension to the
baseline
feature to make the behaviour of working baselines, the protection of the
baseline
collection, and the behaviour of deleteing various resources (eg how to 
un-baseline-control) etc.

I agree with all your answers to my recent questions about the baseline
feature.
I just feel we need to capture them somewhere more "concrete" than simply in
a
e-mail thread otherwise different vendors may miss some of these "subtle"
points.

P.S.  I also like the VCCl and VCCn abbreviations and will use those in
future.

Regards,

I personally don't think "member of a baseline-collection" merits a special
icon or a special property.  The fact that it is read-only is reflected in
both the fact that it is checked-in, and for a server that supports the ACL
spec, the fact that it is marked read-only.  The only thing you can't tell
is "and all attempts to check it out will fail".  I don't think that "can
never check out" is an important enough piece of information to warrant a
special icon/property.  As for the server, it will know whether or not a
resource is a member of a baseline-collection (after all, it would have to
generate the property value if we defined one), so it doesn't need a
property to remind it what it already knows (:-).

But this certainly is a candidate for a DeltaV extension, in which case,
adding it to the "extension" section of the FAQ would be the way to go.

Cheers,
Geoff

Subject: How to enforce the preconditions regarding modifying a baseline c
ollection


Hi, 
I was talking with some people in MERANT about the baseline feature and we
were 
discussing the various preconditions that enforce that members of a
baseline-collection 
cannot be modified (eg the DAV:must-not-update-baseline-collection
preconditions). 
It seems odd that the only way to identify a resource as a member of a
baseline-collection 
is by looking at it's URL (eg where it lives in the namespace). Other
preconditions can be 
enforced by looking at the type of resource (eg by looking either at
DAV:resource-type or 
by looking at it's properties as in section 22), but these preconditions can
only be checked 
by looking at the namespace. 
It would be nice if all members of a baseline-collection had some property
to identify them 
as such, so that the implementation of the code to enforce the preconditions
can be simple 
and so that clients can also identify these resources (perhaps show them
greyed-out to 
indicate they cannot be modified).
