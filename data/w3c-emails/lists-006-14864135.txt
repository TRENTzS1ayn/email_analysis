Yes, that's what I'm concerned about. Without going too much into
detail, I have a server with an internal plugin-structure and all
"server" protocol values (xxx-set, DAV header, methods) can and will
vary. For now, they can vary with each collection. If we have BINDINGs
in the future, it may vary with each resource.

So, getting those values "once for the session" is wrong and clients
following that advice are broken.
