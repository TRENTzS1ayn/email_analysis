Hi,

Let me make sure I understand your "multiple server" scenario correctly:

Imagine some parts of the namespace are being maintained by different
servers
the namespaces used to store version-histories, baselines, workspaces,
activities, 
principals etc may differ.

Consider the situation where I have a workspace hosted at:

http://www.server1.merant.com/dav/project1

and in that workspace we have a collection which has a binding to a resource
on some 
other server), eg:

http://www.server1.merant.com/dav/project1/src has a member which is a
binding to
http://www.server2.merant.com/dav/project2/src/main.c

If my client connects to server1 and does a OPTIONS on /dav and gets back
the
DAV:version-history-set they might get:

http://www.server1.merant.com/dav/vhr

If the client did a PROPFIND on
http://www.server2.merant.com/dav/project2/src/main.c
for it's DAV:version-history property it might return:

http://www.server2.merant.com/dav/vhr

It seems to make sense that the version histories for resources live on the
same
server as those resources.  Which implies that if you have "cross-server"
bindings
then different collection sets apply to different parts of the namespace.

So I guess I support option number 2.

I also like the idea of all the specifications being consistent.

Yes, that's what I'm concerned about. Without going too much into
detail, I have a server with an internal plugin-structure and all
"server" protocol values (xxx-set, DAV header, methods) can and will
vary. For now, they can vary with each collection. If we have BINDINGs
in the future, it may vary with each resource.

So, getting those values "once for the session" is wrong and clients
following that advice are broken.
