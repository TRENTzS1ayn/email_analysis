Yes, I agree that it is  worth formalizing this extension.
As we get more experience with multiple implementations, we
will be able to better identify which extensions need to
be standardized for interoperability.

Cheers,
Geoff

It's not only "can never checkout" it's also..."can never COPY into
this collection", "can never MOVE out of or into this collection".
The Baseline Collection itself is not VERSION-CONTROLLED and as such
does not need to be checkedout to be modified.  I agree it is
something for an extension.  I may propose an extension to the
baseline feature to make the behaviour of working baselines, the
protection of the baseline collection, and the behaviour of deleteing
various resources (eg how to un-baseline-control) etc.  I agree with
all your answers to my recent questions about the baseline feature.  I
just feel we need to capture them somewhere more "concrete" than
simply in a e-mail thread otherwise different vendors may miss some of
these "subtle" points.  P.S.  I also like the VCCl and VCCn
abbreviations and will use those in future.
