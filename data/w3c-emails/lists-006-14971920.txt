I agree with Jim's position on collecting implementation experience
before mutating/extending/subsetting the versioning specification.

Speaking of interesting follow-on work for DeltaV, one thing we (very
sensibly) defined as out-of-scope initially was "change request
management".  This is a core feature in all "web content management"
systems, in many cases as much if not more important than versioning.

This topic came up a few weeks ago (in the context of defining some
"states" for an activity).  This would probably be a very interesting
and valuable topic to pursue as we are gaining implementation
experience with the DeltaV specification.

Is this of interest to anyone?

Cheers,
Geoff

   I'm inclined to declare victory on our DeltaV charter and let some
   servers get built on what we have before we start making a lot of
   immediate changes. Of course I would welcome any BOF to determine
   level of interest in extensions, new packages, etc. DeltaV is now
   firmly on the standards track. The next step is to get some
   implementation and determine interoperability issues. If the
   community fragments immediately on different packages that aren't
   interoperable in meaningful ways, then certainly that's good
   information for the standards process that would need to be
   addressed. But I think the community would benefit from attempting
   to implement the spec as written so we encourage interoperability.

   As for shutting down DeltaV, we're only at proposed standard. We
   could consider updating the charter to move to the next stage in
   the lifecycle. I would be happy to entertain suggestions as to the
   content of such a charter, and if there's sufficient interest, we
   can propose the next set of work items to the AD's as either
   continuation of DeltaV (with a new charter), or other working
   groups focused on more specific tasks.
