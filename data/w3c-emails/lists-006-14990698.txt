Not to mention all the wonderful live properties (DAV:supported-xxx) which
really should be part
of a WebDAV core spec. Maybe that's what Dylan has in mind?

  I think now that work on deltaV and ACL nears completion, we *badly* need

    I would like to see some work on server defined attribute sets
(categories and attributes) as a new level of webDAV support.
