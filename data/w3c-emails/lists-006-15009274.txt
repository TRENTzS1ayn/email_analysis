No, what I have in mind is the ability for a server to define attribute sets
(categories) that are associated with collections some of these attributes
and/or categories are mandatory (i.e. must be given a non empty valid value)
when creating new resources in the collection, the client MUST supply values
for these mandatory attributes otherwise the resource cannot be created.

This is used widely in document management and record management systems.

However it is a complex topic and does tie into RDF.

  Not to mention all the wonderful live properties (DAV:supported-xxx) which
really should be part
  of a WebDAV core spec. Maybe that's what Dylan has in mind?

    I think now that work on deltaV and ACL nears completion, we *badly*
need to go back resolving issues on the WebDAV core (maybe including parts
of bindings, redirect refs, ordered collections and SEARCH).

      I would like to see some work on server defined attribute sets
(categories and attributes) as a new level of webDAV support.
