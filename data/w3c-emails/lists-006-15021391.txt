However, creating a resource and setting properties can not be done in a
single operation, right?

  No, what I have in mind is the ability for a server to define attribute
sets (categories) that are associated with collections some of these
attributes and/or categories are mandatory (i.e. must be given a non empty
valid value) when creating new resources in the collection, the client MUST
supply values for these mandatory attributes otherwise the resource cannot
be created.

  This is used widely in document management and record management systems.

  However it is a complex topic and does tie into RDF.

    Not to mention all the wonderful live properties (DAV:supported-xxx)
which really should be part
    of a WebDAV core spec. Maybe that's what Dylan has in mind?

      I think now that work on deltaV and ACL nears completion, we *badly*
need to go back resolving issues on the WebDAV core (maybe including parts
of bindings, redirect refs, ordered collections and SEARCH).

        I would like to see some work on server defined attribute sets
(categories and attributes) as a new level of webDAV support.
