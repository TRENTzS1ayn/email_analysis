I think the definition of this deltav subset is very much needed
and that Lisa has made a very good start with it. To be more specific:

- Our server falls (from deltav point of view) into the same group
  as sharemation does: linear versioning on resources, no versioning
  on collections. There is definitly a need for such servers.
- DeltaV is so rich (and for good reasons) that as an implementor
  you have to make quite a lot of choices. The definition of a subset
  would give guidance in this process and ensure interoperability.
  Without such a definition, I see interworking between deltav
  servers and clients as a much longer and more painful process
  than it needs to be.
