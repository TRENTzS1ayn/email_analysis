During testing we found the following issue with the Microsoft webfolder
client (sent here so it is propertly archived):

Given a WebDAV collection mounted as:

http://host/localdir,

a collection resource

http://host/localdir/collection

and a member

http://host/localdir/file

Upon trying to move "file" into "collection", the MS webfolder client will
send the following request:

MOVE http://host/file HTTP/1.0
Host: lisa.greenbytes.de:8080
Destination: http://host/localdir/collection/file
Translate: f
Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Length: 0
Overwrite: F
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Language: en-us
User-Agent: Microsoft Data Access Internet Publishing Provider DAV
Accept-Language: de, en-us;q=0.2

So in the request URI, the path is wrong. Note that this only happens if the
webfolder client "thinks" that it's operating in the root of the mounted
namespace -- that is, if http://host is mounted instead of
http://host/localdir, the request URI will be correct.
