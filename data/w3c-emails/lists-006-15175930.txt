A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


Title: DeltaV Subset for Simple Authoring
Author(s): L. Dusseault
Filename: draft-dusseault-deltav-subset-00.txt
Pages: 19
Date: 22-Oct-01

This document specifies a consistent profile or subset of the 
features from the DeltaV specification [DeltaV].  The subset is 
suitable for simple linear document versioning in a WebDAV [RFC2518] 
environment.  The subset is intended to limit functionality in order 
to improve predictability and thus interoperability.  If a server 
advertises support for this subset, then a client can interoperate 
with that server very easily due to its predictability.  A server 
advertising support for this subset MUST also support DeltaV.

In the body type:

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
