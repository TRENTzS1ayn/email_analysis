I have my doubts that defining a common subset of DeltaV that makes sense to
a big group of people is achievable (I remember similar discussions in
xml-dev about removing "unnecessary" features from XML: everybody agreed
that there are some, but it wasn't possible to agree about *which* were
unnecessary).

In particular, Lisa's proposal says that a server MUST support the
version-history feature. Ours doesn't (and can't be easily changed to
support it). Yet, information about the existing versions can be retrieved
using REPORT, so *I* would argue this is an unnecessary feature :-).

That said, it is certainly a good thing to publish detailed information
about specific deltaV implementations (and their recommended usage).
However, I'm not so sure that this belongs into an Internet Draft.
