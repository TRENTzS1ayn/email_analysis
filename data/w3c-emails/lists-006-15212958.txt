 Hi all,
 
 we (a colleague and me) are currently implementing a DeltaV 
 compliant webdav server. Our reflections about a "basic" webdav 
 server are very close to the deltav subset. The actual state of the 
 implementation looks very close to lisas subset, excluding the version 
 history feature. We haven't taken a closer look at this yet. 
 
 We think, this subset is quite a goot idea for implementing 
 the basic operations for a webdav server without having a 
 deeper knowledge of the DeltaV standard. We actually really 
 enjoyed reading it. 

 The subset seems to be a first impression about the most important
operations
 and properties of DeltaV. If other is needed, one can consult the 
 DeltaV standard.

 We are of course open for discussions. 
 
 greetings
 
 Cristina
