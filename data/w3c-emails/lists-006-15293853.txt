Hi,

I have been reading through section 22 of the deltav document with other
staff here at MERANT.
We noted a few issues:

22.3 (DeltaV-Compliant Collection) should support the MERGE method.  A
collection can be
      a target for a MERGE operation.

22.7 (Checked-In Version-Controlled Resource) should support the LABEL
method.  
     Label can be applied to a checked-in VCR.
 
22.13 (Activity) The DAV:unreserved live property should be listed as a
supported live property.

22.18 (Checked-Out Version-Controlled Configuration) should support all
checked-out version controlled
      resource properties and methods as well as supporting all
version-controlled configuration 
      properties and methods.

Why isn't there a section for Checked-Out Version-Controlled Collection? Is
it assumed that this
resource is just a checked-out version controlled resource?

Regards,
