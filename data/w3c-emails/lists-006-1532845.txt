This is clearer, but still problematic.  You've disguised a normative
requirement as a clarification.  Without this "Note" on the end, my
implementation would have done away with (deleted, gone, byebye) all the
versions that are no longer associated with a version-controlled resource.

If it is a requirement that the versions already created MUST stay around,
even when the version-controlled resource is replaced by a
non-version-controlled resource, then this must be a MUST.

I'd prefer to say that the versions that are no longer associated with a VCR
MAY be gone.
