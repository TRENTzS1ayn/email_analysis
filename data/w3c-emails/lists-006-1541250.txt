   From: Lisa Dusseault [mailto:lisa@xythos.com]

   DeltaV supports an in-place editing model for situations where the server
   does not support the Working Resource option, and where the client does
not
   do all their edits on their local copy.

Note though that this is not a "package", this is just a "feature"
that is used in the "workspace" packages.

   By "in-place editing" I mean that when the VCR is checked out, clients
can
   do any number of PUT, PROPPATCH and other write operations, before
finally
   checking in.  In the meantime, this work-in-progress is available for
other
   users to see if they have permission to read the resource.

   First question: Does anybody plan to implement DeltaV this way?

We will be supporting the advanced-server-workspace package,
which includes the in-place-checkout feature.

  [I believe
   Subversion effectively will (correct me if I'm wrong) but in practice
   Subversion clients wouldn't do their write operations until just before
   checking in, so there would only be a small window of opportunity to see
   works-in-progress. ]

No, subversion supports the advanced-client-workspace package, so
it provides the working-resource feature, not the in-place-checkout
feature.

   Second question: Is there a way for clients to view working
   resources and only see the latest checked-in versions?  E.g. I may
   be uninterested in seeing "works in progress" affected by in-place
   editing.  Can I do a PROPFIND depth-1 against the latest checked-in
   versions in a collection, rather than the works-in-progress?

This question is really only relevant for the workspace packages, with
in-place checkouts and not working resources.  This is because working
resources are sprinkled around the URL space at the server's whim, and
are not collected into a collection that you can "PROPFIND Depth:1".
So with working resources, the *only* kind of version-controlled
resources you see in collections are checked-in ones, so you would
never see "works in progress".

Note though, that if your server does support in-place checkouts, you
can get the behavior Lisa describes by using the DAV:expand-property
report.  In particular, you would ask to expand the DAV:checked-in and
DAV:checked-out properties of the version-controlled resources.

Cheers,
Geoff
