Yes, for consistency with the use of attributes in
the DAV:expanded-property REPORT, the "name" attribute in
DAV:supported-method would be in the default namespace,
not in the DAV: namespace.

Cheers,

To further clarify. Neither with

<D:supported-method-set xmlns:D="DAV:">
<D:supported-method name="PROPFIND" />
</D:supported-method-set>

nor with

<supported-method-set xmlns="DAV:">
<supported-method name="PROPFIND" />
</supported-method-set>

the name attribute would be in a namespace. For an attribute to be in a
namespace, it MUST be qualified, such as:

<D:supported-method-set xmlns:D="DAV:">
<D:supported-method D:name="PROPFIND" />
</D:supported-method-set>

or

<supported-method-set xmlns="DAV:">
<supported-method D:name="PROPFIND" xmlns:D="DAV:" />
</supported-method-set>

However I think that the *first* two versions use the intended format,
right?
