   From: Peter Raymond [mailto:Peter.Raymond@merant.com]

   22.3 (DeltaV-Compliant Collection) should support the MERGE method.
 A collection can be a target for a MERGE operation.

Yes.

   22.7 (Checked-In Version-Controlled Resource) should support the
LABEL method.  Label can be applied to a checked-in VCR.

Yes.

   22.13 (Activity) The DAV:unreserved live property should be listed
      as a supported live property.

DAV:unreserved is a checked-out resource property, not an activity property.

   22.18 (Checked-Out Version-Controlled Configuration) should support
 all checked-out version controlled resource properties and
 methods as well as supporting all version-controlled
 configuration properties and methods.

Yes.

   Why isn't there a section for Checked-Out Version-Controlled
   Collection? Is it assumed that this resource is just a checked-out
   version controlled resource?

Yes.

I'll see if I can squeeze this info into the final editing pass.

Cheers,
Geoff
