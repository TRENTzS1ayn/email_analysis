I'm not sure about the first one, but the rest of these items aren't
dependent on versioning.  Thus, you might find more interest if you post
your suggestions to the wider WebDAV group, and I encourage you to do so.

Josh Cohen has started work on an event notification mechanism for WebDAV,
and I'm sure he'd appreciate help, input or review.
