   From: Peter Raymond 

    "A configuration is a set of resources that consists of a root
    collection and all members of that root collection except those
    resources that are members of another configuration"

    "A baseline is a version resource that captures the state of each
    version-controlled member of a configuration"

   The configuration DOES include members that are not
   version-controlled, but the baseline does NOT capture them.  Right?

Correct.

   So, my question is: 

   Will non-version-controlled members of a configuration that is
   under baseline control return a value for the
   DAV:version-controlled-configuration property?  I think so, but am
   not 100% sure.

Correct.

Cheers,
Geoff
