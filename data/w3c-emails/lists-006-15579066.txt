Section 22.8 of the deltav specification lists the supported live properties
of a 
checked-out resource, but it does not say that a checked-out resource also
has all 
the live properties of a deltav-compliant resource. 
I think the line saying: 
"- all DeltaV-compliant resource properties." 
Is missing in this section. 
If a checked-out resource did not have all the properties of a
deltav-compliant 
resource then it would not have supported-method-set and other useful
properties.
