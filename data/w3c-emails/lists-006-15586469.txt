Hi,

Version 19 of the protocol document had a couple of references to the term
"Working Baseline"
in section 13.12.  In version 20 of the protocol document this has
gone....there is now no
reference to working baselines in the whole document.

Was this change intended? I didn't see it listed in the changes and issues
document.

Regards,
