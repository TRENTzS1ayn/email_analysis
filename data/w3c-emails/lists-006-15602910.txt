I just joined this list, so I am sorry if my questions were already discussed:

1. How the user can update his private workspace: UPDATE method just
replace all versions in my workspace with versions from the UPDATE
source, MERGE method will handle conflicts and merge my changes with
the latest versions but looks like it is not able to handle resource
renaming and deletion  (unlike UPDATE). So I am confused how can I do
something like "cvs update"?

2. It seem to me to be very convenient to have something like
<DAV:displaypath/> live property which contains URL of the
correspondent version-controlled resource. It actually contains the
same value as returned by <DAV:locate-by-history/> report.
Why it is better to have it as property and not as report?
For example, I can use PROPFIND method with Label header to extract
some configuration of the project marked with specified label. I can
do it with one WebDAV request by specifying Infinite depth. But to be
able to  store this configuration to the local disk, I need to know pathes to
all these resources. Certainly, for each version I can perform
locate-by-history REPORT, but it means that I need to send twice more
requests (instead of one PROPFIND + n GET requests, I have to send 1
PROPFIND + n REPORT + n GET requests)

3. Is there some plan to support sending deltas instead of complete
resource body by PUT/GET methods?
