The spec is saying that but I think it's wrong :-)
In my understanding A BASELINE IS A VERSION OF A CONFIGURATION.
The purpose of a version is to capture the state of the thing it's a version of.
So if a configuration can contain not-version-controlled members and a
baseline doesn't capture them a baseline isn't really a version of a configuration.
At least in the sense I defined the meaning of 'version' above.

Therefore I would change the definitions Peter cites:

  "A configuration is a set of resources that consists of a root
   collection and all version-controlled members of that root collection
   except those resources that are members of another configuration"

  "A baseline is a version resource that captures the state of each
   member of a configuration."

This question doesn't make sense any more because there aren't such members by
definition. The question Peter would have now is:

  Will non-version-controlled members of a collection that is under baseline 
  control return a value for the DAV:version-controlled-configuration property?

I would answer no. I think we should make clear the difference between the
configuration (The set of version controlled resources. A logical entity) and
the collection which just serves as a temporary anchor/root  to "display" the
configuration.
This root collection can obviously contain non-version-controlled members
which can be added and removed from the configuration by changing their
version-control status.

Cheers, Edgar
