A "configuration" is just a concept defined by the spec
(i.e. the definition quoted below).  It always existed in
WebDAV, but didn't have a name (it was the "Depth:infinity
state of a collection").  You manipulate it with
standard operations like PUT/MKCOL/DELETE/COPY (a Depth:Infinity
copy allows you to copy an entire configuration from one spot
to another).

Cheers,
Geoff

I didn't think non-version-controlled configurations were defined by the
spec.
How do you create and restore such a configuration?
