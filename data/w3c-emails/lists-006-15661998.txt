Hi,

So we have this "concept" called a configuration which is ALL resources
rooted
at a collection (with Depth:infinity) and we have a concept called a
"version-controlled 
configuration" which is all VERSION-CONTROLLED resources rooted at a
collection which 
is captured in a baseline.

I think the terminology is a little odd because every member of the
configuration has 
the DAV:version-controlled-configuration property even though some of the
members of 
the configuration are not in the "version-controlled configuration" (eg they
are not 
version-controlled).

I know it's too late to change this, but feel we should have some
explanation of this 
available somewhere, eg in the FAQ, use case doc or somewhere.  It would
have been very 
easy for me to miss this subtle point and incorrectly code the property to
ONLY appear 
on version-controlled resources.

Regards,

A "configuration" is just a concept defined by the spec
(i.e. the definition quoted below).  It always existed in
WebDAV, but didn't have a name (it was the "Depth:infinity
state of a collection").  You manipulate it with
standard operations like PUT/MKCOL/DELETE/COPY (a Depth:Infinity
copy allows you to copy an entire configuration from one spot
to another).

Cheers,
Geoff

I didn't think non-version-controlled configurations were defined by the
spec.
How do you create and restore such a configuration?
