Yes, I get my hands on the spec one last time (after the RFC editor
converts it to nroff).  In particular:

   Final Review Period

   Once an RFC has been edited and is ready for publication, author(s)
   are given 48 hours to look over their document for editorial
   nits. We STRONGLY suggest that authors check for spelling and
   missing words and that they make sure the references, contact
   information are up to date. Also, if your document is a MIB we
   encourage you to take one last look at your CODE. We DO NOT make
   changes to RFCs once they have been published, so please look over
   your document carefully.

So please do send me any typos, so I can get them fixed in the
final review period!

Cheers,
Geoff

I don't know if you've still got a chance to fix small typographical
errors in the deltav draft, but in section 1.3 in the definition of a
working resource the specification reads:

"a working resource is a deleted when it is checked in." 
It should be: 
"a working resource is deleted when it is checked in."
