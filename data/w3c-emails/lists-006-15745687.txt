That's good enough for me. So I won't discuss the definition of a configuration
any more for the time being.
Out of curiosity :-) Could I get a feedback from some of the readers
of the mailing list ? Just a note whether they think this topic should be
discussed in the future or that they think it's irrelevant and I should
forget about it.
Then a plea to the parties I think are big players concerning implementing
DeltaV. Is there any chance of a joint effort for creating a scenarios or
validation suite document.
From the top of my mind I can imagine Rational, Oracle, Merant, Microsoft,
Apache, ...

Cheers, Edgar
