hi,

I have  a question regarding the Rational Rose model available at the Delta
V web site.
What is the reason for the Resource class not having the Report method
listed as one of the operations.

thanks,
rajkumar

That's good enough for me. So I won't discuss the definition of a
configuration
any more for the time being.
Out of curiosity :-) Could I get a feedback from some of the readers
of the mailing list ? Just a note whether they think this topic should be
discussed in the future or that they think it's irrelevant and I should
forget about it.
Then a plea to the parties I think are big players concerning implementing
DeltaV. Is there any chance of a joint effort for creating a scenarios or
validation suite document.
