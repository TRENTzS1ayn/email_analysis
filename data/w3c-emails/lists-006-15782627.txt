Is the current rational rose model at the Delta V web site for the server
side or for the
client side.

thanks,

Just a bug (:-).  That model is missing a goodly amount of stuff,
and should be considered as just a very preliminary pass at creating
such a model.  I am working on a more extensive model for the WVCM
effort (a client-side API for DeltaV/WebDAV), and I'll post that as
soon as it is in a reasonably stable form (unfortunately, I can't
yet predict when that will happen).

Cheers,
Geoff

hi,

I have  a question regarding the Rational Rose model available at the Delta
V web site.
What is the reason for the Resource class not having the Report method
listed as one of the operations.

thanks,
rajkumar
