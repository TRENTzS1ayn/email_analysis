    "12.3.1 DAV:baseline-collection (protected) 

    This property contains a server-defined URL for a collection,
    where each member of this collection MUST either be a
    version-controlled resource with the same DAV:checked-in version
    and relative name as a version-controlled member of the
    baseline-controlled collection at the time the baseline was
    created, or be a collection needed to provide the relative name
    for a version-controlled resource."

   This seems to be saying that live properties like DAV:displayname
   will not be captured by the baseline (only DAV:checked-in will be
   captured).

The semantics of DAV:checked-in require that the dead properties
on the VCR are identical to the dead properties on the DAV:checked-in
version, but you are correct that this requirement does not apply
to live properties.

But the protocol does not prevent a server from capturing live
properties, it just does not require it to do so.  In the case
of D:displayname, I expect that most servers will chose to capture
that as part of the version state, but that is up to the server.

   In my opinion a baseline should record the exact state
   of the configuration (including properties of it's members).  A VCR
   must have the same content and dead properties as it's checked-in
   version, but it's live properties may differ and would not seem to
   be captured in the baseline.

All the reasons for why we didn't require live properties to be
captured by versions (I'm not sure if that issue made it from the
mailing list into the FAQ yet) apply to why would wouldn't require
them to be captured by baselines.  (examples include the
DAV:version-controlled-configuration property and the DAV:lockdiscovery
property).

   Is my understanding of this correct? 

Yes.

   Do other members of the group agree that it makes sense to capture
   other live properties of the VCR that is under baseline-control?

I agree that a server should be allowed to capture other live
properties, but I do not agree that we could/should require that
all live properties be captured by a version/baseline.

Cheers,
Geoff
