I don't see anything in the spec that requires DAV:comment
to be copied from checked-out resources to versions on
CHECKIN, or from unversioned resources to the initial
version on VERSION-CONTROL.

In particular, since DAV:comment is a live property, it
doesn't get copied with the dead properties, and it is not
mentioned explicitly in postcondition
DAV:initialize-version-content-and-properties of Section 4.4
or postcondition DAV:put-under-version-conrtrol of Section
3.5.

Is this the intended behavior?

Thanks,
Roy
