Currently, the server gets to decide which live properties
of a VCR are captured by versions.

It would be reasonable to identify a set of live
properties that SHOULD/MUST be captured by versions,
and publish this list in an internet draft and on
the DeltaV web site.  This list would then be added
to the protocol document when we go to the next standard level.

Cheers,
Geoff

Subject: Copying DAV:comment on CHECKIN and VERSION-CONTROL


I don't see anything in the spec that requires DAV:comment
to be copied from checked-out resources to versions on
CHECKIN, or from unversioned resources to the initial
version on VERSION-CONTROL.

In particular, since DAV:comment is a live property, it
doesn't get copied with the dead properties, and it is not
mentioned explicitly in postcondition
DAV:initialize-version-content-and-properties of Section 4.4
or postcondition DAV:put-under-version-conrtrol of Section
3.5.

Is this the intended behavior?

Thanks,
Roy
