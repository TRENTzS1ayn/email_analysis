That sounds like a good process to me.

On DAV:comment, I think the common use case is for authors to use a
new comment most times they CHECKIN a new version, to document the
changes specific to that version.

To support this common case, I think the property list should say
that servers MUST copy DAV:comment from the checked-out resource to
the new version on CHECKIN. This allows clients to consolidate the
PROPPATCH of DAV:comment with the PROPPATCH of any dead properties
of the VCR (and other copied live properties) before CHECKIN, and
makes the behavior atomic. I also think the property list should
say that servers SHOULD NOT copy DAV:comment from the predecessor
version to the VCR on CHECKOUT, so that clients do not need to do a
PROPPATCH to guarantee that DAV:comment was not incorrectly carried
forward from the previous version.

Thanks,
Roy
