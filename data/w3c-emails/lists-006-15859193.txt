It seems to me that MERGE with activity should cause applying only
logical change captured by the activity to the merge target.
But I didn't find confirmation of this my assumption in the
specification. Moreover it was mentioned here (13.12 additional MERGE
semantic) that the latest version selected by this activity is a merge
source. So looks like merge with activity is equivalent to a sequence
of merges with the last versions from the activity. And in this case
the role of activity as logical change is lost! It is not
possible to apply only that changes which are identified by the
activity without any changes done in the intermediate versions between
common ancestor and merge source. So it will no be possible for
example to apply bug fix from the development of new release project
(development) to the current release support project
(production) automatically.
If activity is really can be applied as logical change, then why it is
not described in the specification?
