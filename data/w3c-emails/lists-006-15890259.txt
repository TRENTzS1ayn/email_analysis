No, a MOVE does not cause a BCC to be removed from baseline
control (a MOVE is required to maintain all the DeltaV live
properties).  A COPY/DELETE would though.

Does moving of baseline-controlled-collection (not part of the
baseline-controlled-collection, but the whole collection) cause
removing it from baseline-control. Or collection is moved together
with it's baseline history?
