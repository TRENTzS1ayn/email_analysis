It doesn't really matter where they are as there is no way for clients and
servers to interoperate on the semantics of the properties anyway. So unless
you're doing something custom on both the client and the server side, the
properties might as well not exist as far as the server is concerned.

  Hi !

  I'd like to know how does a webdav server to store file properties.
  I undestrand that you put a/some propertie(s) with a PROPPATCH, and you
get them with a PROPFIND, but WHERE are these properties on the server ?
  I'm actually working with an Apache server (withe mod_dav module), and I
don't understand how does that works...

  Thanx in advance.
