Hello,

The Delta-V standard introduces the resource type "version resource". Would
you expect the webdav (un)lock command to work on a "version resource" too.
A server may implement the delete method on a "version resource".

Am I correct with the assumption, that (un)lock should work on a "version
history resource" and a "version controlled resource" too.

Best regards

Juergen Pill
