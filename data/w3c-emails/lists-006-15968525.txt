It is correct that checkout/checkin should not work on version
history resources.

If the server supports the working resource feature, then checkout
would work against a version resource (but checkin still would not).
Checkout of a version creates a working resource, and a working
resource supports the checkin operation (but not the checkout operation).

Cheers,
Geoff

Hello,

The Delta-V standard introduces the resource type "version resource" (VR)
and "version history resource" (VHR). 

Am I correct with the assumption, that the (un)check in/out methods should
NOT work on a "version history resource" and a "version resource" ?

The only resource type, that can be checked out/in is a "version controlled
resource" (VCR).

Best regards
