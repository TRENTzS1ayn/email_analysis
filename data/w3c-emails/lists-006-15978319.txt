Yes, please do post the method/resource compatibility matrix.
And that's great to hear that you'll be working on a client!
Did your reference to jsr-147 indicate that you hope to use
that as your client API?  If so, that's great to hear as well!

Cheers,
Geoff

Hello Geoff,

thanks for your answer. 

I mostly work on a WebDAV server implementation (Jakarta Slide) and
currently I am preparing a method/resource compatibility matrix. If you are
interested, I can post it soon.

Best regards

Juergen

PS. I want to start working on the client side too starting next year.

The primary use cases requiring lock/unlock are for version-controlled
resources.

A server certainly could also support locking on a version resource,
but since a version resource is largely immutable (except for its
live properties, where whether or not they are immutable depends
on the characteristics of that live property), servers may not
bother with supporting locks on them (unless they get that functionality
for free from their underlying implementation).

Just for interests sake, did you have a client scenario in which
version locking was  interesting?

Similarly, it is unlikely that a "lock" on a version history resource
will be of much interest to a client, and servers may not support it.

Note though that unlike LOCKing, which is only really interesting on
version-controlled resources, ACLs support is interesting and worthwhile
on all resource types, including versions (to control "delete" behavior)
and version histories (to control who can add versions to that version
history)

Cheers,
Geoff

Hello,

The Delta-V standard introduces the resource type "version resource". Would
you expect the webdav (un)lock command to work on a "version resource" too.
A server may implement the delete method on a "version resource".

Am I correct with the assumption, that (un)lock should work on a "version
history resource" and a "version controlled resource" too.

Best regards
