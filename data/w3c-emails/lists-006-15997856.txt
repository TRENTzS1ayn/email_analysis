"multistatus" in the DAV: namespace is the top level XML node in the
response body to PROPFIND (and various other methods).  It just groups the
"propstat" elements, in case there are more than one resources affected by
the request).
 
Yes, the xmlns="DAV:" makes "DAV:" the default namespace for the multistatus
node and its children.
 
And no, the fact that there is a namespace declaration for the
http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/ <http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/>  does not make
it a live property.  The DeltaV extension to WebDAV defines a
"supported-live-property" report, which tells you which properties are live.
Several of us planning on making sure this report gets "promoted" into the
next rev of the WebDAV protocol.
 
Cheers,
Geof

I've seen in this document : http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2518.txt
<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2518.txt>  some exemples of DAV request and
responses.
But there are still some things I'm not sure about...
 
When you see that :
 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
   <multistatus xmlns="DAV:">
     <response>
         <href>http://www.foo.bar/container/</href>
          <propstat>
               <prop xmlns:R="http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/">
                    <R:bigbox/>
                    <R:author/>
                    <creationdate/>
                    <displayname/>
                    <resourcetype/>
                    <supportedlock/>
               </prop>
              <status>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</status>
          </propstat>
    </response>
 
What does "multistatus" mean ?
The line xmlns="DAV:" means that DAV is the default namespace ?
And since xmlns:R=... defines the URL of the resource, is R:bigbox a live
property ?
 
Thanx in advance
