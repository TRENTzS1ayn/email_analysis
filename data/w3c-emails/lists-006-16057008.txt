Yes. I think a really nice thing about DeltaV is that it allows
versioning of containers (directories). Its not mandatory, but
certainly is supported. I would suggest having a bit of a read.

To me the only special thing about a workspace is that it imposes
additional constraints on that you are only allowed to check out
one version of a resource under it. (Note, you could have multiple
bindings of URLS to the same resource, but they would be the same
version of that resource).
