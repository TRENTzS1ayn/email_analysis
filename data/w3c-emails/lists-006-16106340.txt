So the only way to do it - is to place source collection under
baseline control???
But what is the result of applying VERSION-CONTROL method with
<DAV:version> refers to version-controlled-collection? It will create
version-controlled resource in the target workspace for this collection
iself but not for its members, right? What in this case is the result of PROPFIND
with Depth=infinite applied to such version-controled-resource?
Is there any good motivation for restricting VERSION-CONTROL source to
be a version and not a version-controlled-resource, which capture
information about the resource version and workspace to which it
belongs?

It seems to me that the current model of version-control method for
existed version history is contradicting and not clear...
If the only way of importing information in workspace from other
workspaces is baseline, then we should prohibit version-control method
for existed version history at all. Otherwise, version-control method
should be able to correctly place the whole specified subtree in the
target workspace.



EEd> Cheers, Edgar
