To reconstruct a whole tree of version-controlled resources, 
you would need a baseline (that is why the version-controlled
collection feature is always bundled with the baseline feature
in all the defined packages).

I faced with the problem of placing existed version controlled
collection (with all members) in my workspace. Section 6.7 (Additional
version control semantic) says that VERSION-CONTROL method
<DAV:version> element in body should be used in this case. But
<DAV:version> elements specifies only version of the root collection
to be placed in my workspace. And how can I determine versions of
members of this collections? Version controlled collection contains
just bindings to version histories of its members. It is not possible
to select particular version from the version history without
knowledge about workspace from which take this subtree. But workspace
is not specified in VERSION-CONTROL method and there is no way to get
it.
  
So, in few words, I do not understand how to do the following
operation:
- I have some project (version-controlled-collection) in some workspace (for
example /ws/his/project1)
- I want to place this project (copy all its resources) in my workspace
/ws/my
How it can be done?
