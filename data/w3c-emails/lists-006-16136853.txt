Well, its not the *only* way to do it. We are not planning to support
baselines at this stage. We are planning to use other details such
as a time point to find the appropriate version of every single
thing we want to check out and then do an update to get the appropriate
version for each individual resource at that point in time.

Mind you, we might not be using the DeltaV protocol to do the check
out initially. We might be doing it behind the scenes in a way compatible
with DeltaV to simplify DeltaV support later.

It may be true that baselines may be more appropriate for your situation.
