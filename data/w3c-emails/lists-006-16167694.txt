Hi, me again!

This time I have some questions concerning configurations.

1.DeltaV differentiates a baseline-controlled collection and a
version-controlled configuration. My understanding is that a collection C
put under baseline-control becomes the root of a version-controlled
configuration (VCC). So puting a collection C under baseline-control means
all resources subordinate to C will be part of the configuration rooted at C
and theire last checked in version is captured in the baseline.

The pic below (taken from DeltaV draft 20) implies a 1:1 relationship of the
two concepts.

                                 +--------------+

2. What about creating "components"/subbaselines/subconfigurations. Because
of the definition of a Configuration given in DeltaV one would assume that
the components have to be created before the "component container" otherwise
there would be a problem with the definition:

A "configuration" is a set of resources that consists of a root
collection and all members (not just internal members) of that root
collection that are not members of another configuration.  

But in my opinion the "component" baselines/configurations created that way
would be no subbaselines. Or would they be?
The only way of getting it straight (means creating components after the
superior container was created) is that the container is created/put under
baseline control first and then subtrees of the configuration put under
baseline control on their own. But this would contradict with the definition
as well.
So what is the way of creating subbaselines? My reading of the draft did not
reveal this fact to me (unfortunately).

Daniel
