This is true.

The baseline captures all version-controlled resources 'reachable' from C.

Agreed.

Yes.  Furthermore, the subbaselines are not constrained to capture parts 
of the namespace rooted by C, they can be disjoint.

No, the subbaselines have to be created first, and can be added to the 
DAV:subbaseline-set property of a checked-out version-controlled 
configuration.

The baseline is created using BASELINE-CONTROL, and they become 
subbaselines by virtue of being added to the DAV:subbaseline-set.
