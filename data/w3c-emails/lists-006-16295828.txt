Well, it's got the same name, so I guess it is the same method<g>.

It is defined in both places because both specs were at the stage where, 
technically, could not be referenced from one another.  Rather than wait 
for one to advance along the standards track and delay the other, it makes 
sense to include this duplication.
i.e., just consider it the same method.
