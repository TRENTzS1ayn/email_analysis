Right on!
Your description is correct.

Hi,

i've got this (at least I think so ;o) ). Now we advance a step further:

Suppose this situation:


    +--------+               +-------+               +--------+
    |  VCR1  |               |  VH1  |               |  VCR2  |
    +--------+               +-------+               +--------+
    | CIN V2-+------+        |  V1   |      +--------+-CIN V2 |
    +--------+      |        |   |   |      |        +--------+
                    +--------+->V2 <-+------+
                             +-------+

The checked-in (CIN) versions of VCR1 and VCR2 are located in the very 
same
VH and they are even the same version.

Now same problem to checkouts on the same version via the VCR's. To be
precise there is a checkout on VCR1 with DAV:apply-to-version flag which
creates WR1 with DAV:auto-update = VCR1. And there is a checkout on VCR2
with DAV:apply-to-version flag which creates WR2 with DAV:auto-update =
VCR2. Performing a checkin on both WR's would cause no failed checkin but
produces this situation:

    +--------+               +-------+               +--------+
    |  VCR1  |               |  VH1  |               |  VCR2  |
    +--------+               +-------+               +--------+
    | CIN V3-+------+        |  V1   |      +--------+-CIN V4 |
    +--------+      |        |   |   |      |        +--------+
                    |        |  V2   |      |
                    |        |  / \  |      |
                    +--------+>V3 V4<+------+
                             +-------+

Am I right with this? Please let me be! Otherwise I should give up trying 
to
understand this (at least for this week) ! ;o)

P.S.: Obviously there MUST NOT be any DAV:checkin-fork forbidden property 
at
V2.

Regards,
Daniel
