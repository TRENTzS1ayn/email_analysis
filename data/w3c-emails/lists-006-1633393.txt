I think he wants a version-independent ACL to be the 'real' ACL but he
wants a historical record of the ACL.

I would not like to retain historical ACL lists.  Let alone create new
versions because the ACL list kept changing.

It seems that Yaron's scenario would be better served by a historical
log of who had accessed a particular item, stored in a manner that was
permanent.  After all, you want to know if the spy read it, not if he
could have read it.

Isn't "the ACL list it currently uses to decide who gets to see the
version" the ACL on the version history resource, or is what you want a
version- independent ACL that applies to all versions of a resource,
that can override the ACL on that particular version?
