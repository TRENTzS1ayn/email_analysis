I appreciate you taking time to raise these questions.  They're far from 
'dummy' questions, too.  I'd encourage you to contribute to the FAQ 
(http://www.webdav.org/deltav/faq) all that you have learned that you felt 
was not well described by the specification.

I'm confused by this diagram, what are the arrows that are going from the 
baseline(s) to the version(s)?  You did not give then a property name so I 
cannot guess what they are.  Maybe you are thinking of the 
DAV:baseline-collection? In which case this is not in the version history 
as you depict.

Furthermore, I don't see what the relationship is between /DEV and VCR1? 
So let's assume that VCR1 is called /DEV/foo

I'm confused.  Perhaps you can restate the problem, answering my questions 
above, and I'll try again.

One way to do this is to create the consolidation workspace and bring it 
under baseline control.  Then create /DEV, /DEV1, etc as required and 
bring them under baseline control specifying an existing baseline of /DAV 
in the body of the reuest (as you showed above).  This will initialize the 
/DAV workspace to contain version-controlled members whose DAV:checked-in 
versions and relative names are as captured in the baseline of /CONS.
