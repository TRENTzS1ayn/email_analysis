Yes, VCR2 would have the same DAV:checked-in version and the
same DAV:version-history as VCR1.  You are using this feature
exactly the way it was intended to be used.

Cheers,
Geoff

HI,

next topic (looks like after I'm done with all my questions we could write a
book called "DeltaV for Dummies - A virtual reality dialogue" :o)), anyway.

The Worksapce precise /DEV is under BASELINE-CONTROL. V2 of VCR1 is captured
in V2 of the VCC1 (Baseline /repo/blh/1/v2). Now a new workspace /CONS is
created and put under BASELINE-CONTROL that way:

MKWORKSPACE /CONS

BASELINE-CONTROL /src HTTP/1.1 
Host: www.webdav.org
Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
Content-Length: xxxx

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<D:baseline-control xmlns:D="DAV:">
  <D:href>http://.../repo/blh/1/V2</D:href>
</D:baseline-control>

(see DeltaV 12.6.1)

Well what happens to /CONS is explained in 12.6.1 of DeltaV. But take a look
at VCR1. Am I right that the copy of VCR1 in /CONS (VCR2) points to V2 of
VCR1 in VH1 to? Or is there a new VH for VCR2 and there is no connection
between VCR1 and VCR2. My understanding would be that VCR1 and VCR2 sharing
the same VH. (At least this is what suits me and my application best)

BAckground:
I have a software project under development. The Sourcetree is originally
located in workspace /DEV. /DEV is under baseline-control. At some time in
future I will close development and set up a consolidation codeline. This
consolidation codeline is placed into workspace /CONS using the reference to
a baseline of /DEV to populate it with the then closed development codeline.
As far as I understand this /DEV and /CONS are VCC's on their own and have
distinct baseline-histories. 
What I want to achieve is, that the changes applied to my sources via the
VCR's in /CONS should be a branch/fork of the version-tree/history of the
corresponding VCR in /DEV.


Regards,
Daniel
