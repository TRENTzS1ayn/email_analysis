Hi,

another question I'll add to the faq soon:

I don't think I've got an understanding of what this means:

12.3.1 DAV:baseline-collection (protected)
This property contains a server-defined URL for a collection, where
each member of this collection MUST either be a version-controlled resource
with the same DAV:checked-in version and relative name as a
version-controlled member of the baseline-controlled collection at the time
the baseline was created, or be a collection needed to provide the relative
name for a version-controlled resource.
<!ELEMENT baseline-collection (href)>

Suppose a collection /DEV under basline-control. This collection has a
member collection /src and the latter has a member source.c. Is it right to
undersatnd it that way that the baseline-collection property of a baseline
of the VCC tracking /DEV contains a copy of the tree rooted of /DEV (except
for those memebers tracked by another VCC) at the moment the snapshot was
done? 
Well was this sentence really more understandable than the definition above?

Regards,
Daniel
