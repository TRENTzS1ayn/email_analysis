The DAV:baseline-collection is a mechanism for 'viewing' the contents of a 
baseline without 'restoring' it.

A baseline resource is not a collection, it is a blob that captures the 
state of version-controlled resources in a configuration.  However, it is 
useful to be able to see which (version-controlled) resources were 
captured by the baseline, and that is provided by the 
DAV:baseline-collection.

The DAV:baseline-collection will appear exactly the same as the 
(version-controlled resources in the) configuration that was baselined. 
Since there may be collections that are not version-controlled, whose 
members _are_ version-controlled, it may be necessary to include 
'place-holder' collections in the DAV:baseline-collection to ensure that 
all the version-controlled resources appear at the correct relative name.

Ok, /DAV/src/source.c

Yes, again, provided they are themselves version-controlled.

So if
/DAV/ is baseline controlled but not version-controlled,
/DAV/src/ is not version-controlled,
/DAV/src/source.c _is_ version-controlled.

Then a baseline of /DAV/ will have a baseline-collection with two 
collections only there to make up the namespace (i.e., their members only 
includes resources that are version-controlled, or have version-controlled 
members).
/DAV/
/DAV/src/

and a version-controlled resource
/DAV/src/source.c

which as you can see is at the 'right' point in the namespace.  Its 
content and dead properties are those as captured by th baseline (and it 
cannot be modified).
