   I don't think I've got an understanding of what this means:

    12.3.1 DAV:baseline-collection (protected)
    This property contains a server-defined URL for a collection, where
    each member of this collection MUST either be a version-controlled
    resource with the same DAV:checked-in version and relative name as
    a version-controlled member of the baseline-controlled collection
    at the time the baseline was created, or be a collection needed to
    provide the relative name for a version-controlled resource.

   Suppose a collection /DEV under basline-control. This collection
   has a member collection /src and the latter has a member
   source.c. Is it right to undersatnd it that way that the
   baseline-collection property of a baseline of the VCC tracking /DEV
   contains a copy of the tree rooted of /DEV (except for those
   memebers tracked by another VCC) at the moment the snapshot was
   done?

   Well was this sentence really more understandable than the definition
above?

The problem with that sentence is that the only definition we have of
the term "copy" is "the result of a COPY request", and this would not
correctly characterize the baseline-collection.  A "copy" of a
baseline-controlled collection (as produced by a COPY request) does
not necessarily create a tree of version-controlled resources, but
does whatever a PUT/MKCOL would do at that destination, which usually
is to create non-version-controlled resources.  In addition, a COPY
would copy both the version-controlled and non-version-controlled
members of the baseline-controlled collection, while a
baseline-collection only contains the version-controlled members, as
well as any collections needed to identify version-controlled members.

Cheers,
Geoff
