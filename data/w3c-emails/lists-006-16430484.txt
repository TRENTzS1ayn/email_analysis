Yes, that is right.

"copy" wasn't ment as COPY but as "structured equally". Well I understand
that there are only VCR and collections needed to identify VCR's. Any other
stuff is not under version-control and therefore irrelevant for baselining.

O.k., using my example again the baseline-collection contains members:

/src (Collection)
/src/source.c (VCR)

The prefix /DEV must be left out because the uri must be relative to the VCC
root and that is /DEV. right?
