Some more questions about baselines and subbaselines. Sorry, if there
are already answers for this question in the archive, but search is
not available, so I failed to find them.

Assume that I have some project /project1 (version-controlled-collection) placed under
baseline control. I have some baseline with subbaselines. Subbaseline
refer to some components in the project - some collections which are members of
the /project1 collection.
Now I want to place project in my workspace. I create directory
/ws/my/project1 and place it under version control, right?
But what how subbaselines will be handled? The expected behavior is
that subbaselines will be extracted to the correspondent
subdirectories of /ws/my/project1 which will be placed under baseline
control? But I didn't find confirmation in the specification.

Also specification doesn't require that baseline-controlled-collection of
the subbaseline is member of baseline-controlled-collection of the
super-baseline. In this case I will not be able to create collections
for subbaselines when I place /ws/my/project under baseline control.
So while behavior explained in the previous section seems to be
natural and obvious, I afraid that it is not what intended for
subbaselines by specification. Unfortunately there is almost nothing in
specification about subbaselines, except brief explanation of
subbaseline property.

Now when I am going to prepare new baseline, I will have to
explicitly setup subbaselines property for this baseline.  Why the is
no notion of "subconfiguration". It seems to very convenient and
natural: I have version-controlled-collection /project1, I have
component /project1/gui, project1/db and project1/core.
I place them under baseline control and declare that configuration of
/project1 has three subconfigurations. Now when I checkin this
configuration and produce new baseline for /project1, this baseline
will automatically be assigned subbaseline property, referred to the
checkedIn baselines selected by subconfigurations. Does it make sense?


And one more question about baselines: it is said in specification that
"the root collection of a configuration is unconstrained with respect
to its relationship to the root collection of its components".
First of all,  the notion "root collection of configuration", been
introduced in the first abstract of section 12 (Baseline
feature), is never more used. So it is not clear what is it and how it
can be used.

BASELINE-CONTROL method creates new configuration and either create new baseline bounded
with specified version-controlled collection either initialize specified version-control-collection
with existed baseline. This version-controlled-collection is stored in
<DAV:baseline-controlled-collection/> of the configuration. It is
"root collection of configuration"? If so, how it is possible that
components of this collection are not members of this collections?
