Please try it again (the link was pointing to the collection instead
of to the .mdl file).

Cheers,

Hi,

I tried to get the Web Versioning Model from the deltaV web server
at http://www.webdav.org/deltav/
I can access it in the browser version only, 
but I don't get the permission to download the corresponding mdl file.
Is there a way to get a copy of this model ?

thanks and regards
Matthias
