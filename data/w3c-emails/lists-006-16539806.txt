Hi Geoff, my interpretation of Konstantins question is different.
If /x/y is the root collection of another configuration it doesn't belong to /x
and if it also isn't a subbaseline of /x it must not be created when /x is
extracted in a new workspace.
Just as a reminder: In my understanding the BASELINE-CONTROL feature can
exist without the VERSION-CONTROLLED-COLLECTION feature.

Cheers, Edgar
