Yes, a server is allowed to prohibit DELETE of a version history.

If a server does support DELETE of a version history, it is faced
with two unpleasant alternatives: either delete all references to
that version history from collection versions, or to leave those
references dangling, with undefined results when that collection
version is selected as the DAV:checked-in version of a version
controlled collection.

Cheers,
Geoff

Postcondition for DELETE in section 5.6 DAV:delete-version-set says
that it is possible to delete version-history. By what should I do
with bindings to this version-history from parent versions? There is
nothing about it in specification. Is it possible for server to
prohibit DELETE of VERSION-HISTORY? (as it is allowed for VERSION)
