   Why should this be allowed ? A baseline "... captures the state of
   each version controlled member of a configuration.". So /ws/kk/x/y
   isn't captured in the baseline and I see no reason to restore it.

This is allowed to provide consistent semantics in the presence of
versioned collections.  A version of a collection captures a set of
version-controlled bindings, and an appropriately named binding to a
VCR must exist when that collection version is restored
(i.e. specified in the DAV:checked-in property of a version-controlled
collection).

   Why should this be required ? /ws/kk/x/y wasn't captured in the
   baseline, so there is no information how to restore it.

The baseline /repo/bl/22 contains a collection version for "./x/y",
and this collection version has a version-controlled binding named
"y".  This means that after /repo/bl/22 is merged into /ws/kk, there
must be a VCR named "y" in the version-controlled collection
identified by /ws/kk/x.

   In your agenda BASELINE-CONTROL is giving different results
   depending on another 'competing' feature being supported or
   not. This shouldn't be.

That's why the server is given the "choice" of what to do.  If it does
not support version-controlled collections, it doesn't make sense to
require it create a VCR named /ws/kk/x/y.  But if it does support
version-controlled collections, then it doesn't make sense *not* to
create a VCR named /ws/kk/x/y.  So we leave this particular choice up
to the server.

Cheers,
Geoff
