I believe Yaron was just saying he both wanted "what the ACL was at
the time it was checked in" (i.e. a historical record, that
presumably could be re-instated with you "update" a VCR to select
that version), as well as an ACL that actually affects who
can access the version.

My response is that in practice, nobody does anything like what
Yaron describes, and so we can leave it as a "server value add"
for now.  Realistically, you won't get all that much interoperability
from ACL's anyway (although they are a lot better than nothing),
so the chances of any significant interoperability benefit from
defining a standard way to access historical access values is
vanishingly small.

Cheers,
Geoff

Isn't "the ACL list it currently uses to decide who gets to see the version"
the ACL on the version history resource, or is what you want a version-
independent ACL that applies to all versions of a resource, that can
override the ACL on that particular version?
