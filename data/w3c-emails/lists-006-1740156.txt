When I version a resource I will also likely want to version the access
control list it had when I 'froze' it. This is very important for things
like security checks. Imagine that an employee who was fired a year ago
turned out to be a corporate spy, you are going to want to check what
resources he had access to back then. This means that a version really needs
two sets of ACLs. One if the ACL list it had when it was frozen. The other
is the ACL list it currently uses to decide who gets to see the version.
