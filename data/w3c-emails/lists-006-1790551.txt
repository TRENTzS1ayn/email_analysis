Oops, I meant "view a bunch of version-controlled resources and only see
latest checked-in versions".  I can see that's what working resources are
made for, only unfortunately existing clients don't support working
resources.  I'm trying to make our implementation work as much as possible
with existing WebDAV clients and still have the desired behaviour.  If we
didn't have to be compatible with DeltaV, it would be easy.  ;)

Why wouldn't viewing checked-in versions work with anonymous access, as long
as the 'anonymous' principal is granted read privilege on the resources?
