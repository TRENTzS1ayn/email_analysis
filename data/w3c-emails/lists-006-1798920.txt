If "frozen" == "checked in" then you have no way of knowing what
resources an employee used to have, since they may have selected
an older version with a particular workspace.

I guess the basic question is whether or not ACLs are versioned like
a dead property.  In other words, does changing the ACL create a new
version?  I think that if you do create a new version when you change
the ACL, you will get what you want, since by correlating the
creation date of each version with the ACL on each, you can figure
out what versions of the resource a particular user had access to
during a particular period of time.
