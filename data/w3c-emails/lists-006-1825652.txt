I don't think anyone was suggesting "either/or" here.
The ACL on a version resource will always be the ACL
that control access to that version resource (and can
be changed, when you change your mind about who can
access that version resource).

Yaron was just suggesting that we add *another* property
that captures the ACL of the version-controlled resource
at the time of check-in.  This would not be the DAV:acl
property, but would be something like the DAV:checkin-acl
property.

In an earlier message, I indicated that I believed there
is not sufficient value or interest in a DAV:checkin-acl
property to merit its inclusion in either
the versioning or the acl protocol.

Cheers,
Geoff

If "frozen" == "checked in" then you have no way of knowing what
resources an employee used to have, since they may have selected
an older version with a particular workspace.

I guess the basic question is whether or not ACLs are versioned like
a dead property.  In other words, does changing the ACL create a new
version?  I think that if you do create a new version when you change
the ACL, you will get what you want, since by correlating the
creation date of each version with the ACL on each, you can figure
out what versions of the resource a particular user had access to
during a particular period of time.
