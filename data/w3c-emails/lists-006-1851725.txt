If you were to use the model of an RDBMS;

If a version is related to anything then you must archive everything at that
point of time before removing the relation and the version.

If something in the version control system depends on or is a child of the
version that is to be deleted then that version can not be deleted.

Do not allow the versioning standard to allow defined corruption...

Normally I'd agree with what you're saying, but cleaning up old versions can
be server policy.  Server administrators can't force clients to do that, so
it must be a possible server behaviour.

I understand it can also be server policy to keep around all old versions
and NEVER delete them.  That's why DeltaV MUST support both.
