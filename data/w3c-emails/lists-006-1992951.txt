How about an alternative approach:

Add a new postcondition to DELETE that says:

"If a server does not support the version-history feature,
then it MAY automatically delete a version resource if that
version no longer appears in the DAV:version-tree report
of any version-controlled resource."

I believe this allows John and Lisa to do what they want,
without violating the concern of several of us that
a client should be able to count on a version being
preserved by a server while it is still being referenced
by another resource visible on the server.

I believe this approach is better than adding a body
to DELETE, because it does not require adding additional
protocol elements.

Cheers,
Geoff
