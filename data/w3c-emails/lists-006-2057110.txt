Me too :-).
My understanding is that a versioning unaware client should NEVER
have the side effect of deleting version resources it doesn't know
about. The server side concerns Lisa raises are another matter I don't
have the time to discuss at the moment.

Now to Geoffs proposal.

Here you draw a fine line between explicitly having a version
history ('support the version-history feature') or implicitly
having it ('appears in the DAV:version-tree report') because
the version tree is the fundamental data of a version history.
Or isn't it ?
To me it seems that VERSION-CONTROL is providing a version-history
light in the form of the version-tree report. Does that make sense ?

Cheers, Edgar

P.S. I would like to write more but I'm leaving for a birthday
party just now.
