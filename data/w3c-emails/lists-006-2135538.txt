Before we got much further with this thread, let's examine the
underlying premise that "deleting the versions when the VCR is
deleted" is an important use case.

This is the web, so everybody and their grandmother (and for sure,
www.google.com) will have cached copies of anything you put up on the
web, so an argument that blowing away old versions at server defined
URL's will somehow make that data go away is rather unrealistic, isn't
it?  And if it doesn't really go away, why do we care that there
are also a few obscure server-defined URL's that contain a copy
of a version of this data?

So perhaps we should reach agreement that this is a compelling use
case before we consider supporting it by introducing either additional
protocol
elements or making server behavior less consistent and predictable.

So my revised position is that we defer any action on this proposal
until the group reaches consensus that this is in fact a compelling use
case.

Cheers,
Geoff
