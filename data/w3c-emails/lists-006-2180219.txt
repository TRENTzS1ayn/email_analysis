A working resource can be created by checking out
an arbitrary version, so in general, it is not
associated with any VCR.

So you do need to support either the update feature
or the merge feature if you support the working resource
feature (that is why
the client-side workspace package contains the
update feature. 

Cheers,
Geoff

right?



My user performs a CHECKOUT, PUT, and CHECKIN.  He wants the contents to
change, and he wants a new version.

I'm using working resources.

To get this behavior, the user must:
1) CHECKOUT the VCR.
2) PUT on the working copy identified by the Location URL in the
CHECKOUT response.
3) CHECKIN the VCR.

It appears that if they do a CHECKIN on the working copy, they will not
get what they expect.  9.4 indicates that they create a 'version' but
that the VCR doesn't know about it.

Since I don't support UPDATE or MERGE I seem to have two options.  Fail
the CHECKIN on a working copy or treat it as a CHECKIN on the VCR
silently.
