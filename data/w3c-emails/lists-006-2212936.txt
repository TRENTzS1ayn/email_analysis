So does this mean that support for working resources effectively has a
dependency on the UPDATE feature?  It's at least consistent that both are
included in the "basic client workspace" package.

Section 9.4 does state that UPDATE or MERGE are required after a checkin
from a working resource, but this is misleading.  Merge can only be done if
there are a couple things that can be merged.  That's not always the case;
nor is the server always capable of doing a merge.  Imagine I check out an
image in my repository, I get a working-resource URL, and I PUT the new
image to the working-resource.  Now you can see that UPDATE is absolutely
required ror the version-controlled resource to ever have its contents and
dead properties change.

This dependency should at least be made clear.  We might also consider
trying to remove the dependency, since one would think that in a non-forking
server, a CHECKIN would 99% of the time be followed by a UPDATE to push the
latest content to the VCR.  Rolling those two actions into one request
(unless specified otherwise) would save a round-trip, because the CHECKIN
and UPDATE can't be pipelined if you have to wait for the successful
response to the CHECKIN before knowing how to send the UPDATE.
