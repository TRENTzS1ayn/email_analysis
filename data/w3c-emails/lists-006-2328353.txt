I think something like this would be highly desireable.  It removes the
dependency on UPDATE/MERGE, it makes the meaning of CHECKIN on a working
resource with this flag the same as a CHECKIN on a edit-in-place
resource, and it simplifies the life of simple clients / servers
greatly.  

Not supporting working copies and instead giving people
'checkout-in-place' introduced the unwanted side effect of exposing
users to works in progress.

As I understand it then, the language goes something like this:
DAV:apply-to-version  -- If this property is present, a CHECKOUT of a
WORKING COPY on the VCR will set the property checked-out-VCR on the
working copy.  An implementation MAY support this feature.  An
implementation MAY allow this property to be changed.  An implementation
that supports this property, the feature WORKING COPY, but not the
features UPDATE or MERGE, SHOULD prevent this property from being
modified.

<!ELEMENT apply-to-version EMPTY>

DAV:checked-out-VCR

If this optional property exists on a working copy, then a CHECKIN will
also update the VCR listed.  An implementation MUST support this
property if it supports WORKING COPY but not one of (UPDATE, MERGE).

<!ELEMENT checked-out-VCR (href)>

CHECKIN postcondition:

If the property checked-out-VCR is present, then a CHECKIN will
automatically update the VCR to reflect the content and dead properties
of this version.
