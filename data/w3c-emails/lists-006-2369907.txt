Enthusiastic clapping from the audience.

My server WILL allow version delete.

I believe it is unreasonable to ask a client that wishes to reclaim
space on the server to do a REPORT version-tree, loop through the
versions, issue separate DELETE's on each version, and then delete the
VCR.

I believe it is unreasonable for DeltaV to assume that no
client/user/customer would ever want to do that.

At this point I'd prefer that a DELETE of a VCR *fail* if the client
doesn't specify <keep-versions> or <destroy-versions>.    I'd rather not
have a default action at all.  

If we do have a default I think it should be <destroy-versions>, because
that is what I think a version-unaware client/user will expect.  But I
could live with the default being <keep-versions>.
