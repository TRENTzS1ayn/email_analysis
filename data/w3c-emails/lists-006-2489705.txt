Tim is of course correct ... only the most compelling implementation
issue or use case should cause one to insert a MAY in the protocol.

So unless I hear from a defender of the DAV:precursor-set property,
I will delete it from the next draft of the protocol.

Cheers,
Geoff

No.  I think we should either make it mandatory or scrap it altogether.
Unless you have at least one 'compelling' use case for each option offered
by "MAY" (i.e. COPY should update the DAV:precursor-set property, and COPY
should not update the DAV:precursor-set property) then we are doing a
disservice to clients by stating that servers can choose.
In this case, unless someone can defend the property I suggest we remove
it.
