UNCHECKOUT cancels exactly one checkout, namely the in-place
checkout on the VCR.  More significantly, it reverts the content
and dead properties of that VCR back to the state of its
DAV:checked-out version.

Do you say this because an UNCHECKOUT will kill multiple checkout's (if
those are allowed) while deleting the working resource will only cancel
that particular checkout, returning the VCR to the uncheckedout state if
and only if that was the only checkout?
