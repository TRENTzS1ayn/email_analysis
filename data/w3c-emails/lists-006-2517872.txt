The precursor-set property seems to be an important concept of a versions 
history. Without it there is no indication that a version has a 
relationship to another version history.

I don't think it will be unusual for a client to create a new version by 
copying from a different version history. Will it be important to know the 
new version came from a different version history? I think the answer is 
yes and the precursor-set facilitates this.
