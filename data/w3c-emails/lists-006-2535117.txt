I just wanted to verify that there still was somebody out there
who was willing to stand up for it.  There actually was consensus
reached a while back that this property merited inclusion in the
protocol.  So now that one of the supporters has spoken up,
once it is clarified that COPY sets the DAV:precursor-set 
property to be the URL of the version (as opposed to, appending
that URL to the existing contents of the DAV:precursor-set),
are there any implementation objections to making this a
required property?  As Tim pointed out, we only make something
optional if it truly presents an implementation barrier, not
just because a particular client isn't planning on using it.

Cheers,
Geoff

The precursor-set property seems to be an important concept of a versions 
history. Without it there is no indication that a version has a 
relationship to another version history.

I don't think it will be unusual for a client to create a new version by 
copying from a different version history. Will it be important to know the 
new version came from a different version history? I think the answer is 
yes and the precursor-set facilitates this.
