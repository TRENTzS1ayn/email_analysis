OK, I officially recuse myself from this issue.  Every time I read
a post from one side or the other, I find myself agreeing with
whoever posted last (which means I currently agree with John, but
I'm sure it won't take much to switch me back again :-).

So the only thing I am against is "MAY".  Either we keep it in the
protocol as a MUST (i.e. MUST be set on COPY), or we delete it.
Other than that, just tell me which side won (:-).

Cheers,
Geoff

I disagree.

I see no difference between creating a new version from scratch and
copying data from somewhere else to create a new version from scratch.
If I open file1 and then do a save-as on file2, the server doesn't know
and precussor isn't set in any case.  So why is it so important to know
that someone grabbed a copy of file1's current version and copied it to
file2 without editing it first?  If you really want the version history,
use MOVE not COPY.

Do you have a 'for example' use case where that origin information is
valuable?  And would it still remain valuable after a few more edits
were done?
