I went thumbing through the archives (which I should have done
in the first place ...), and found another motivation for
the DAV:precursor-set property.

A workspace is only allowed to have one VCR for a given version
history, to ensure that baselining and merging is unambiguous
(baselining and merging in a workspace is based on finding the
version history that corresponds to the version being merged),
so if you want to create a "variant" of a resource in the same
workspace, this requires two different version histories.
In order to track the relationship between these two variants
(i.e. when the diverged, and from what common version), the
DAV:precursor-set property was introduced.

It was then decided by the working group that this "history of
a COPY" was something of general utility (using arguments similar
to those that Rick posted), and since it provides utility with
minimal server implementation cost, it was made part of the base
protocol.

With respect to John's argument that a resource created by COPY
has its content "overlaid" by later changes, that's the case for
any new version in a version history as well, so I don't see this
as an argument against tracking this relationship.

So in conclusion, although it is fair to ask the working group
to defend any element of the protocol (and desireable to remove
anything that has no such defense), I believe the case for the
DAV:precursor-set has been resurrected, so an implementation
difficulty would need to be identified in order to remove this
protocol element.

Cheers,
Geoff

I still can't see where it is useful to know about two different version
histories, one that you have poor information on (the source of the
COPY) and an old version history that is no longer relevent to the
actual content (since you overlayed it).
