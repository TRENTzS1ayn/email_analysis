I think this thread calls for the definition of a "Quantum Property"
which is spontaneously created and annihilated and exists in a
probabilistic state as long as nobody looks into the mailing list
archives.

Clients and servers implemented during this time, will share the
probabilistic state. It will be unknown if they are brilliant
or rather a piece of junk until "Geoff starts thumbing".

Notice that a collapsed quantum property can be made probabilistic
again when
a) someone asks a questions about it on the list
b) enough time has gone by that Geoff did last "thumb".
c) it is not mentioned in the spec what happened last time

I therefore propose to document the result of "thumbing" in
the Spec.

Regards, Stefan
