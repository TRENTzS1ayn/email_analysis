Not sure that I follow this argument, since 'down-level' clients will only
be looking for DAV:collection.

But I take this to mean you do not support extending DAV:resourcetype.

What do you mean?  I thought you just stated that we can't introduce new
resource types to retain forward compatibility.

The type is made quite explicit by the supported live properties and
supported methods.  The only debate was how to marshal the 'type'.
