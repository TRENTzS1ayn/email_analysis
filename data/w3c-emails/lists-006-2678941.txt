'I don't mind if it is added'

I do support your comment that additions like this only continue to add to the 
complexity of the protocol, however useful they may be.  I think it is fair to 
say that a draft specification really needs to be nailed down soon and that 
additional features like DAV:checked-out-vcr be added in the next version of 
the specification.  

     Thanks,

     Mark
