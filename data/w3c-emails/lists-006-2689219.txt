I would like to see someone stand up, with their hand on their heart, and
say that this is an important use case for them.  I'm increasing resistant
to adding new functionality to DeltaV unless we have these 'compelling'
cases.

Is it really the case that clients would not wish to recover from this
situation should it occur rarely, or lock the version-controlled resource
should it occur frequently?

Skeptically yours,
Tim
