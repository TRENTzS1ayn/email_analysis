I guess I agree with John. This sort of information is generally kept in 
comments or application specific properties. The question we have to ask 
ourselves is if there is any need to have precursor information available 
in an interoperable way. I don't know off the top of my head any other 
system that supports this, but it could be something I just never used.

I also agree with Geoff in that there are good arguments either way. 
However I'd lean in the direction of leaving things out if there is any 
doubt. They can always be added in later when we have more experience and 
the use cases are more crisp. We don't want to hold up the protocol on 
such issues either if we can help it.




I still can't see where it is useful to know about two different version
histories, one that you have poor information on (the source of the
COPY) and an old version history that is no longer relevent to the
actual content (since you overlayed it).
