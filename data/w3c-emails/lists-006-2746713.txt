Consider this a stand up, hand over heart, this is a vital use case for
them (me) statement.

Note that my use case is different from the one Geoff stated.  I don't
want to support UPDATE or MERGE.  Just CHECKOUT (the VCR to a working
copy) and CHECKIN (working copy to update the VCR).  

That is how I wish to build my server, and it tracks the semantics of
the 3rd party non-DeltaV versioning server I want to be compatible with.
