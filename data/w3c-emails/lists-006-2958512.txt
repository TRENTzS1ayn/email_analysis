I think you may have said this already, so apologies if you did.  Instead of
a new property on a working resource that tracks MOVEs (which I think will
be hard to implement on distributed systems), how about a new CHECKIN option
to do the checkin and version-controlled resource update atomically with a
specific error condition if either cannot be achieved?

I'd be happier with that.
