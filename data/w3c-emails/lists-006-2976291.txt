This would be the pessimistic approach, to prevent the MOVE.

That is going to occur anyway with an explicit UPDATE of a
version-controlled resource.

That argument has already been debunked (by Greg and others with their
high-jumping analogies :-)

On what basis do you say this?  We have no other examples of the server
being required to track resource MOVEs and I believe that it will require
substantial housekeeping for a number of implementations to do this.

I'm not suggesting the client track them either.  I think the client should
be pessimistic or be prepared to deal with the consequences (as for all
other MOVE scenarios).
