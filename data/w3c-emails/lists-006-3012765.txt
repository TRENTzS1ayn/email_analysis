First, to reiterate, this is a very important feature to me (CHECKIN of
working copy to update a VCR).  I'm willing to accept almost any
solution that accomplishes that goal.  Note that on my server this is
the only CHECKIN of a working copy that is allowed.  

I thought that Geoff's proposal to have the VCR address be updated in
the CHECKIN to be quite sensible, and I didn't mind tracking the VCR
even if it was moved.  Probably because that was easy for my
implementation to do.

However, Geoff's proposal said that I had to let the client modify the
contents of this property.  That means that I have to deal with the case
where the client specifies a bad value (I need an error either on the
PROPFIND or the CHECKIN.  If I prohibit the bad value from being set the
error is on PROPFIND.  If the bad value is set, then an error may occur
on the CHECKIN and update VCR where it won't work.).

If I had written the proposal, I'd have made the new property
"apply-to-VCR" removable but not client modifiable.  That way everyone
knows that the field either exists and is valid or doesn't exist.

I would also have considered having the element apply-to-version sent on
the CHECKIN rather than the CHECKOUT (which means "apply-to-VCR" would
always be set).  But that is a nit.  I'm happy with it on the CHECKOUT.

So my full proposal, based on Geoff's, would be:

CHECKOUT postcondition:
If CHECKOUT is sent with the "apply-to-version" element, then the
working copy will have "apply-to-VCR href-of-VCR" set.

If "apply-to-VCR" is set, then this field will be updated if the VCR is
moved.  (You could let the server refuse to move such a VCR but I'm
assuming that is a non-starter).

"apply-to-VCR" may be removed by a client, but not modified.

CHECKIN poscondition:
A CHECKIN of a working copy with the "apply-to-VCR" property set will
update the VCR associated with the working copy.  If this isn't
possible, an error "FILL-IN-HERE" is generated if this isn't possible.

A CHECKIN of a working copy without "apply-to-VCR" set when the working
copy can not be used to update a VCR will fail with the error
"DAV:update-of-vcr-impossible".  (Well, I thought I'd ask.  Our server
will fail such a checkin.  The only question is the error code that gets
kicked back.)
