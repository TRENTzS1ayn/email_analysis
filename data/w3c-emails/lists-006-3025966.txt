I thought we had rather strong guidance that working around bugs in a single
implementation was NOT recommended.  Clarification, Jim?

I'd also point out that frequently it will be OK even with buggy clients to
introduce new resource types.  For example, I don't suppose it will be that
easy for non-versioning-aware clients to stumble across URLs of collections
of version-histories, activities, baselines and workspaces.  Not all of
these new resources are even browsable, and they may not appear in any
regular URL space that regular clients are expected to use.
