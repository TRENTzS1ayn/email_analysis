Yes, the consensus of the working group was that we would not
use a bug in a single (albeit very widespread :-) implementation
as a driver for this issue.

So the current argument for removal of these resourcetype values
is not because they interact poorly with the buggy client, but rather
that they are not needed for any client (buggy or not).  

Cheers,
Geoff

I thought we had rather strong guidance that working around bugs in a single
implementation was NOT recommended.  Clarification, Jim?

I'd also point out that frequently it will be OK even with buggy clients to
introduce new resource types.  For example, I don't suppose it will be that
easy for non-versioning-aware clients to stumble across URLs of collections
of version-histories, activities, baselines and workspaces.  Not all of
these new resources are even browsable, and they may not appear in any
regular URL space that regular clients are expected to use.
