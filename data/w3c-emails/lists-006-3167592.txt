Nice summary, Stefan!

One addendum: Notice that the binding protocol addresses
the 2518 omission of a few critical collection operations
(BIND, UNBIND, REBIND).  If we merge the "bind"
protocol into the next draft of 2518 (which we should do),
then DAV:supported-method-set allows you to distinguish a
collection from a non-collection.  Arguably, there are a few
key collection properties (e.g. DAV:child-count) that should
be added as well.  My experience is that every new type
of resource normally brings at least one new method or property
in with it.

Also note that Tim recently posted on this thread:
  I support taking them out.  We don't need them.

So that puts Tim and me pretty much in the same camp.

Cheers,
Geoff

DAV:baseline resource type values


Well, I'm amazed how much energy is spend here on that
DAV:resourcetype thing and MS WebFolders.

IF (and that's the point worth discussing) deltaV introduces
_types_ of resources, then it can define a protected live
property DAV:subtype/DAV:interface/DAV:reallyresourcetype,
put it's new type definitions there and leave DAV:resourcetype
as it is. (Include the new property in an <allprop/> response,
MS Webfolder will never see it, it does not use allprop.)

The alternative is to have no new types and introduce only
new live properties, which a client can learn about with
DAV:supported-live-property-set.

I got the impression somehow that Geoff is in favour of the latter
one, Tim is undecided, Greg is opposed to it, and the rest
is trying to figure out what DAV:supported-live-property-set
means, how it is interpreted and how it might survive future
extensions.

What other examples beside deltaV do we have in other drafts:
- Redirect Refs: -> new DAV:resourcetype + property
- Ordered Collections -> new property
- Binding: none
- DASL: none
- ACL: none

Best Regards,

Stefan
