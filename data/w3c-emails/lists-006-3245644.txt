Stefan makes a good point. But I think the answer is that a resource's 
supported properties and methods are not static, but are rather dependent 
on its state. So getting the supported live properties may return 
different results at different times.

All this resourcetype and state thing aside:

What is a supported property?

A resource has properties, let's call these existing properties,
which might or might not have values. But when a client does
a PROPFIND on them, he will get them listed in a propstat
element with 200 OK status code. I think that is a good definition
of an "existing property of a resource".

Now, every existing property would also be a supported property
and, being live, would appear in the supported-live-property-set.
Ok.

Now Geoff mentioned that a VCR with in-place editing would have
both DAV:checked-in and DAV:checked-out as supported properties,
and that independant of the checked in/out state of the resource!

Now, here I became confused, since it means that not every supported
property is an existing property! 

If we define supported properties with: 
                 a property which will exist, when a method is applied 
successfully
then all non-versioned resources will have the DAV:checked-in as
supported property, since you can apply VERSION-CONTROL. So, that
does not seem to be a good definition...

And what about supported methods? Is CHECKIN a supported method for
a checked-in resource, too? It will fail all the time...

Geoff and Tim to the rescue, please!

Stefan
