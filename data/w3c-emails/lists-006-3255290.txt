That is how I would implement it.  But it isn't required, and I could
change my implementation in the future.

Since a Location record is returned with the invisible-checkout, just
like with a WORKING-RESOURCE checkout, there is no reason there
theoretically could not be more than one.  I deliberately said that a
deletion of the URL you were given would undo the checkout that resulted
in the working resource being created, not perform an UNCHECKOUT that
would zap all checkouts.  So a repository that provides multiple
checkouts like this would be advised to count them.

No, I don't see that as a major drawback.  But that is because I'm
developing a simple document server that doesn't allow forking and its
complications anyway.  Not allowing multiple concurrent checkouts is not
an *additional* drawback, and it isn't a drawback at all if you don't
need those features.

I'm not building a versioning repository that could be used in a
diskless workstation environment for software development.  It doesn't
follow that what I am building is useless.
