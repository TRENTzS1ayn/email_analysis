For those (likely very few) new resource types that have exactly
the same properties and methods as an existing resource type, you would
be free to add an additional value to the DAV:resourcetype property.
But since none of the resources introduced by the versioning protocol
have this characteristic (i.e. they all have a set of new properties
or methods that they support), we needn't add new resource type values
in the DeltaV protocol.

Cheers,
Geoff

I agree with Geoff that *most* new resource types do result in at least 
one new method and/or property. But this is fundamentally a poor thing to 
depend on as we know there can be (and therefore probably will be) 
subtypes that don't add new methods or properties, but only override 
behavior of their superclass. By not resolving the resource type issue to 
support such situations, we may be just putting the problem off in such a 
way that it will need to be solved in some very different manner by some 
future protocol extension. This is what keeps nagging at me.
