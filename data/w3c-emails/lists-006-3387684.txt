I thought it would be more informative to say that customers wanted it,
rather than to say that Xythos developers thought it would be "a good idea".
An appeal to (customer) authority can be an even stronger argument than
simply personal experience or educated guesses, particularly in this case
where Geoff asked for "use cases".  Who can do a better job of providing use
cases than the customer?  But I accept the due diligence point.

Let me give a use case that's entirely non-opaque, where I can give full
details, and where the due-diligence is automatic.

The site www.sharemation.com uses quotas.  We couldn't afford to run this
free service without quotas, and note that usage numbers count both regular
resources and stored versions.  We also couldn't run this quota-based
service without allowing users to free up their quotas.

So here's the problem scenario on Sharemation: user 'scrooge' turns on
versioning on /~scrooge/foo.txt through the UI or through a hypothetical
DeltaV client.  Then Scrooge uses Web Folders one day to delete a bunch of
stuff.  Web Folders issues a plain DELETE, possibly even issuing DELETE on
entire collections.  Once Web Folders' DELETE is issued, Scrooge would have
no way of finding or cleaning out old versions or version history resources
that still are counted under his quota.  Scrooge's quota would soon be
unusable.

This use case applies to any situation where quotas are needed.  Just a few:
 - A university provides web storage and collaboration space to its students
and professors.  It limits this space (quotas) in order to discourage
improper use.
 - A ISP offers web site hosting to its customers, on a fee-based service.
Customers pay for their quota.
 - XDrive, IDrive etc. - all these free hosting services (some of which
supported Web Folders) restricted quota.
