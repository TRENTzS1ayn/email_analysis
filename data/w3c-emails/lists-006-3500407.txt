Assume the server wants to implement multiple concurrent checkouts.

User1: CHECKOUT /foo.txt <invisible>
Response:
OK
Location: /invisible?file_id=4301&ver_id=7549

User2: CHECKOUT /foo.txt <invisible>
Response:
OK
Location: /invisible?file_id=4301&ver_id=8051

User3: CHECKOUT /foo.txt <invisible>
Response:
OK
Location: /invisible?file_id=4301&ver_id=9051

User1: PUT /invisible?file_id=4301&ver_id=7549

User2: DELETE /invisible?file_id=4301&ver_id=9051

User2: PUT /invisible?file_id=4301&ver_id=8051

User2: CHECKIN /invisible?file_id=4301&ver_id=8051
Response OK // I win!

User1: CHECKIN /invisible?file_id=4301&ver_id=7549
Response:
Conflict
<cannot-modify-version-controlled-content/>

========================================================
At that point you have a number of places you can go.  The simplest for
User1 is to vow to use a lock next time, but in this case (to be
polite):

GET /foo.txt
Diff _local_copy_with_working_copy
Edit _local_copy_with_working_copy
PUT /invisible?file_id=4301&ver_id=7549
CHECKOUT /foo.txt
CHECKIN /invisible?file_id=4301&ver_id=7549
========= OR if not polite ==============
CHECKOUT /foo.txt
CHECKIN /invisible?file_id=4301&ver_id=7549

----------------------------
Is that clear how multiple checkouts of the same version could work?
Basically, you have the same mechanism you had with your
WORKING-RESOURCE feature to allow multiple checkouts (the Location
header).  Now, ALLOWING mutliple checkouts yeilds the problem of
conflict / merge resolution.  The simpliest policy is to make the user
resolve it.
