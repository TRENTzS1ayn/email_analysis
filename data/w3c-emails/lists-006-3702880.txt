I don't know what you mean by static and dynamic for a web resource.  There
is only dynamic.

Neither does adding tags to DAV:resourcetype.  If I state <DAV:collection/>
what does that mean for the semantics of GET, PUT, etc.?  I claim it has to
mean what is written in RFC2518 for a DAV:collection otherwise clients have
no hope.

I strongly disagree.  If a 'subtype' does not honour the semantics of the
supertype then existing clients are screwed.

[Java digression]
If you try subclassing java.util.Hashtable and redefining the methods to
play tunes, you can still pass those instances to methods that expect a
hashtable; but I guarantee you that those clients will not work properly.
You have to honour the semantics of the superclass.

They have extended, compatible behaviour.  We don't (for example) say that
MOVE no longer moves the resource as described by RFC2518.
