I don't think we are getting close to a consensus on this issue.  I'm
personally in favor of using dav:resourcetype for type information 
(after Yaron used his Jedi mind tricks on me), but I don't care enough
to argue about it anymore.

Is there a defined IETF procedure for flipping a coin to decide on what
to do with a spec, or some other source of randomness?  How about if 
everybody agrees that if the Dow is an even number on Monday (at the
close, truncating fractional part) we will put type information in 
dav:resourcetype, and if it is an odd number,
we will use supported-*-resource-set (and go back to <dav:is-principal>
in the ACL spec)?

Deal?  Geoff?

(P.S.  I have a suggested topic as an alternative for those who want to 
argue about this more:  Is operator overloading in C++ a good idea or
not?  Discuss.)
