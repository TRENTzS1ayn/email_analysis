From following the whole discussion, I can see what you're trying to get
at, but that wording is incredibly confusing. If I saw that in a 
specification with no further explanation, I'd have no idea of
what it meant. 

It's even misleading: "a live property is supported ... if that
property has the semantics defined for that property ...". It reads like
the property must exist for the resource - and yet, what we're talking
about is the set of properties which *can*, but may not currently, exist
for the resource. 

I *think* that the meaning of a supported property is the following
(which is very close to what you said, but unfortunately re-introduces
that dangerous "type" word). 

A live property is supported for a given resource if, according
to the semantics of the resource type, that property may
exist for that resource.

Assuming that I'm right about what it means, that's not a difficult
concept, but it's hard to find a precise way of wording it that 
doesn't appear circular.
