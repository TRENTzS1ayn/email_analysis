You can't really make an analogue between RCS commands 
and version-controlled resources, because RCS does not
provide the concept of a version-controlled resource
(it has version history resources - the ,v files, and it
has workspaces).

Cheers,
Geoff

I guess you want the feature you get in RCS with 'ci -u <filename>'.
If that's basically what you want then I wholeheartedly agree. That's
at least my default usecase while creating new versions. I just hope I
didn't
miss something :-)

Cheers, Edgar
