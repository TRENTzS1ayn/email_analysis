   One comment: the definition probably has to include a reference to
   the set of features supported by a resource.  For example, the
   activity feature adds the DAV:activity-set to a version, so it is
   not the case that all versions support the DAV:activity-set
   property, but rather that all versions that support the activity
   feature support the DAV:activity-set property.  Happily, the
   concept of "feature" *is* well defined, so we're OK using that
   term.

Oh, ARGHHH. My brain is a twisty maze of passages,
all of which are starting to look alike.  The "depends
on the feature set" only applies to the DAV:supported-method-set,
not to the DAV:supported-live-property-set.

So I need to take out the reference to features in
DAV:supported-live-property-set, and retract my bogus example from
the quoted message.  A correct example would be:

"For example, a VCR that supports the activity feature must
support the various semantics added by the activity feature,
but a VCR that does not support the activity feature does not."

Here's the revised (proposed) definitions:

--------------

3.1.3DAV:supported-method-set (protected)

This property identifies the methods that are supported by the
resource.  A method is supported by a resource if an application of
that method to that resource has the semantics defined by the features
supported by that resource.

3.1.4DAV:supported-live-property-set (protected)

This property identifies the live properties that are supported by the
resource.  A live property is supported by a resource if that property
has the semantics defined for that property.

3.1.5DAV:supported-report-set (protected)

This property identifies the reports that are supported by the
resource.  A report is supported by a resource if it produces the
results defined for that report.

Cheers,
Geoff
