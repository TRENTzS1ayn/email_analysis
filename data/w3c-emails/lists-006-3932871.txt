   You're right, I can't find that statement any longer in the spec.

Tim: In this case, your memory wins out over your eyesight (:-).
In particular, look at the following PROPPATCH postcondition:

(DAV:cannot-modify-unsupported-property): An attempt to modify a
property defined by this document whose semantics are not enforced by
the server MUST fail.  This helps ensure that a client will be
notified when it is trying to use a property whose semantics are not
supported by the server.

   I think allowing properties to be set in the DAV: namespace that do not
   have the semantics defined in the DAV protocols is extremely dangerous.

I agree.  Although I do not believe this thread matters for the
DeltaV protocol (the DeltaV protocol explicitly forbids this kind
of redefinition), I believe this thread does matter for WebDAV
future evolution (to ensure that other extensions do not violate
this principle).

But we can require that those other extensions have compatible
semantics.  An explicit registration of property names with IANA would
be an appropriate path to take here.
