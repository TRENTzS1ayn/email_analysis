   Missing objects is fatal.

Not for the servers of many members of this working group.

   Deleting objects that have references, in a loosely coupled system where
   the references are understood to be conditional (files on the web --
   ever seen a broken link?) is a feature.

Not for the servers of many members of this working group,
whose users are not happy to receive a "404" for information
they have committed to their versioning system.

   This report would not cause changes to the current feature set, but
   without it the feature set is not complete without additions.  Is
   completeness required to be a draft, or just relative stability?

There are always additional interesting and worthwhile features that
could be added to any IETF protocol, and therefore "completeness" is
never required or expected from an ietf standard.

Cheers,
Geoff
