Thanks for the response. It all makes sense (or at least I think
it all makes sense :-)... but...

I am sorry - are you saying a collection can have multiple bindings
to different resources using the same name? Or are you talking about
different versions of the same collection having different bindings
of "a" to other resources?

My use of "get out" was a vague hand wavy thing in since "check-out"
had specific semantics in DeltaV and I was not sure if I meant
check-out or not. But its all sort of making sense.

However, the above leads me on to another question. If user A checks
out a version-controlled collection and adds a new file. User B then
checks out the same version-controlled collection and adds a different
new file. (I am thinking of a CVS like model here - I don't know the
correct DeltaV jargon for this yet.) Both users then try to check
in the resource. In CVS, the second commit might fail with a conflict,
or CVS might be smart enough to do the merge. In DeltaV, what is
expected to happen? I conflict report? A merge by the server? A merge
by the client doing the second commit?

So just to clarify, if I check out /foo and /foo/a/ but not /foo/b,
then in my workspace(??), what resource type is /foo/b? I was reading
through the archives a bit and came across the term "version selector".
Is /foo/b a "version selector"?

Egad!

Hmmm. I think my eyes must have glazed over by the time I got to
section 14. I had better go read it again more carefully! It should
make more sense this time.

Thanks everyone for the feedback.
