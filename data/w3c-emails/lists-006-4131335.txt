Slide 50 of Jim Whitehead's WWW 10 talk "Delta V: Adding versioning to
the web" has an example of creating a workspace using MKWORKSPACE and
then populating it using VERSION-CONTROL commands. (These slides are
great stuff by the way. It makes it much easier to get an overall
feel for things.)

The workspace URIs were things like /users/geoff/projectX/.
The original project file URIs were like /projectX/makefile.
The VERSION-CONTROL command then created /users/geoff/projectX/makefile
from /projectX/makefile.

My reading of the DeltaV spec in Section 6.7 indicates that
VERSION-CONTROL is creating a

    "new version-controlled resource for an existing version history".

The examples the spec has then uses URIs like /his/12/ver/V3
identifying a version from a history. Jim's example in his slide
is a version controlled resource (slide 52).

Should the above text in the first paragraph of section 6.7 of the spec
be expanded to make it clear that the URI identifies a version from the
version history? Or can any sort of resource be identified (version
controlled, version, version history, etc) as long as the version
history can somehow be identified? Or is the spec OK and the example
in the slides is wrong.

Maybe the slides are a bit hand-wavy to get concepts across more
easily... The spec seems to state quite clearly that a version URI
should be supplied (it makes no comment about using a version-controlled
resource URI - unless its mentioned somewhere else I have not found!).
