I'd just point out that this is not granting the same assurances as the
original approach.

This states that the method must not only be understood (i.e. not simply
'405 Method Not Allowed') but that it must have the semantics defined for
that resource.

Similar to above for methods. This states that the server must retain the
meaning of the property defined in the specification.

Although others have argued that servers may, in the future, redefine the
meaning of methods etc., I think it is fair to state in the DeltaV spec
that when a server advertises support for a method/property/report using
the DAV:supported-*-set's it should have (at least) the semantics defined
in this specification.

Tim (desperately trying not to start another philosophical argument).
