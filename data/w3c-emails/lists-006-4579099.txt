Grr. The below doesn't work either. The Label: would apply to file.c, not
/the/baseline/selector.

Okay... separate question: can I "slash through" a baseline?

Off the cuff, I'd say "no, the baseline is an arbitrary set of version
resources, rather than a structured/hierarchical set of version resources."

The problem is how to get to a specific version resource given a label for a
baseline and a (relative) path within that baseline. And in as few
operations as possible, of course :-)

Cheers,
