That is exactly the issue that I'm pondering on :-)

Okay... thanks for the feedback. I'll figure out a way to deal with this,
then. I don't think that we can be truly interoperable because of the
question "where can I create that (temporary) baseline-controlled collection
(BCC)?" I can detect an SVN server and know where an automatically
constructed BCC exists, but if the server is *not* an SVN server, then I
will need to know a location to create that BCC.

[ effectively, I will automatically create a BCC each time a baseline is
  created (via a check-in/merge). a property on the public VCR will tell me
  the collection containing the BCCs. ]

[ attaching labels to the baselines is related to this issue ]

Cheers,
