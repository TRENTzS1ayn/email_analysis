OK, I (finally :-) get it.

The section on working resource properties should enumerate the
properties that a working resource can have, rather than requiring a
person to scan through the protocol to find them.  I'll add this
enumeration to the working resource property section, and make sure to
include DAV:workspace in that list.

Everyone OK with that?

Cheers,
Geoff

   I think that we have now strayed off from the original intention based on
   the teleconference last Friday.  At that time, it was agreed that the
   DAV:workspace property is a property of all resources that are in the
   workspace.  A working resource is one such resource which can be in the
   workspace.

   When reading section 6.1, it says that a "working resource has all of the
   properties of a checked-out version-controlled resource".  I requested on
   the teleconference for the simple addition to 6.1 specifically stating that
   one of the properties can be DAV:workspace for clarity and it was agreed.
   There are places throughout the draft in which clarifications are added and
   I feel that this aids in clarity and fully conforms to the specification as
   written.

   Thanks,

   Mark
