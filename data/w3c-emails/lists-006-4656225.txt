I recently discovered that Microsoft's Web Folders (on Windows 2000 SP1, at
least) appears to ignore a DAV header from a server when the header value is
longer than 63 characters. It behaves as if no DAV header was returned at
all, refusing to connect to the site using the WebDAV protocol. (I
discovered this after adding a bunch of DeltaV options to my server.
Non-versioning servers based on mod_dav can also run into this problem if
someone defines a live property provider with long enough property namespace
URIs, since they are also returned in the DAV header.)

I've worked around this problem by submitting a change to mod_dav so it will
emit multiple DAV headers (as allowed by the HTTP spec, section 4.2). This
is a warning to client implementors that they should be prepared for
multiple DAV headers from a server, and a warning to server implementors
about limiting the length of a DAV header (if you care about interoperating
with Web Folders).
