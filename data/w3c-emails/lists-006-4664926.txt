   No objections at all, on the contrary: I'd really like to have this 
   property.

Also note that this property allows us to get rid of the
DAV:baseline-version-set property, since you can get the same
information by doing a PROPFIND for the DAV:checked-in values in this
collection.

This is probably cleaner anyway, since the DAV:version-set property
had scalability problems (just imagine how useful it would be to get
the DAV:version-set property of a baseline with 10,000 elements).  In
contrast, with the collection approach, you can just obtain the
version info for a particular resource or subtree of interest.

Cheers,
Geoff
