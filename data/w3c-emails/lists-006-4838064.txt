Speaking for Subversion, this isn't actually a burden as we'll synthesize
the collection as the user requests it. (i.e. we don't have to worry about
constructing and tossing a set of baseline resources)

[ well, asking for an old baseline will be a bit painful since we use a
  reverse-delta storage system, but I believe the intent is to cache those
  as part of normal operation (meaning the new baseline collection won't
  burden us any more than we already had) ]
