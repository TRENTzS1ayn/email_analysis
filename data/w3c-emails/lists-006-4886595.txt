Hmm... I'm not too sure on this one. I don't do anything with collection
versions themselves, but only with working collections. The operations there
are:

*) DELETE /working/collection/member
*) MKCOL /working/collection/newcoll
*) PUT /working/collection/newmember
*) COPY /some/thing -> /working/collection/newmember

The COPY does the whole DAV:precursor-set thing.

I never actually "move" something into a working collection, thus editing
the binding doesn't apply to me.

But! I get a sneaky feeling that the DELETE might not work properly. If the
working collection had no members, then I'm guessing that I'd get a 404 on
the delete. I'd be rather upset if I needed to PROPFIND/PROPPATCH to do a
DELETE operation. (so consider that an objection if I'm correct in my
thinking)

Cheers,
