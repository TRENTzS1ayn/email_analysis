OK, Greg makes a good point that it is more convenient to do a DELETE
than to have to lock some property value and update it.

So I'll switch a working collection back to have history resources
as members (which is probably better anyway, since it makes a
working collection act much more like a checked-out version-controlled
collection), but keep the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set for
the collection version.  I'll try to get this updated draft posted
to the web site sometime late tonight.

Cheers,
Geoff

   Hmm... I'm not too sure on this one. I don't do anything with collection
   versions themselves, but only with working collections. The operations there
   are:

   *) DELETE /working/collection/member
   *) MKCOL /working/collection/newcoll
   *) PUT /working/collection/newmember
   *) COPY /some/thing -> /working/collection/newmember

   The COPY does the whole DAV:precursor-set thing.

   I never actually "move" something into a working collection, thus editing
   the binding doesn't apply to me.

   But! I get a sneaky feeling that the DELETE might not work properly. If the
   working collection had no members, then I'm guessing that I'd get a 404 on
   the delete. I'd be rather upset if I needed to PROPFIND/PROPPATCH to do a
   DELETE operation. (so consider that an objection if I'm correct in my
   thinking)

   Cheers,
