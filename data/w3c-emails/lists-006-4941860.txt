<tim>
   2.2.1 DAV:checked-in
     'This URL can be used to retrieve this particular
     state of the version-controlled resource after the
     version-controlled resource itself has been modified.'

      Given that this is a property of a checked-in version-
     controlled resource, I fail to see how the version-
     controlled resource itself can be modified.
</tim>

<geoff>
     ??  By MERGE, by UPDATE, and by CHECKIN/PUT, for example.
     (The last changes it into a checked-out resource, but it
     is still the same resource).
</geoff>

<tim_2>
     ...but each of these change the DAV:checked-in value, so after the
resource has been modified, that property cannot be used to retrieve the
previous state of the vcr (i.e., the previous state of the property can be
used to retrieve the previous state of the vcr).


and

<chuck>
     Section 2.2.1, "DAV:checked-in  (protected)", sentence 2:
     "This URL can be used to retrieve this particular state
     of the version-controlled resource after the version-
     controlled resource itself has been modified."

     This sentence should be moved to Section 2.2.2, "DAV:checked-
     out ...", because it's true there but incorrect here.
</chuck>

<geoff>
     ??  The DAV:checked-in property means that the vcr is
     checked in (thus the name :-), and the DAV:checked-in version
     captures the current state of the vcr.  This is not true
     for a checked out vcr.
</geoff>


<tim_2>
     Well it seems that Chuck and I were equally confused by this sentence.
In Chuck's defense, the sentence he proposed moving *does* equally apply to
DAV:checked-out (i.e., when refering to the DAV:checked-out property).

     However, I think that I understand where you are coming from -- namely
that a client can take a copy of that DAV:checked-in URL and use it later
to refer to the previous state of vcr when the DAV:checked-in value has
been overwritten.
