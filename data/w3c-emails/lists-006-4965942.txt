Nope.
(oops, 'nope' as in 'no objections', not nope as in 'don't do it')

Subject:  reformatting the DAV:version-tree report





One last change from Tim's review that I felt deserved a separate thread:

Tim asked:

       Why are the DAV:version-tree elements nested?  It does not convey
"true"
   structure, especially since 'A server MAY omit the DAV:prop and the
   successor DAV:version-tree elements ...'  I don't see that the nesting
is
   helpful.

And I responded:

   Another good point (and one that Lisa made as well).
   Currently, we've defined the format of the DAV:version-tree-report
   to match just one of the many ways a client might want to
   display this information.  A flat list is simpler and
   more consistent - we can just use a DAV:multistatus response
   so clients can even re-use their multi-status parsing code.

Any objections?

Cheers,
Geoff
