   5.4 Additional OPTIONS Semantics
       Is it required that the history for the resource reporting the
OPTIONS
   MUST be in the version-history-collection-set?  Probably unnecessary
since
   clients can get to the history via properties.
</tim>

<geoff>
No, there is no such requirement, and yes, it would be unncessary to make
this requirement.
</geoff>

So why would a client want to know where some (indeterminate) version
histories are stored?
