   ... I will be looking to see
   that the DAV:workspace property is described.

Oops ... I forgot to get the "delete" semantic we agreed on
(i.e. deleting a workspace deletes all resources that identify
that workspace in their DAV:workspace property) into the 11.3
draft.  I'll make sure it gets into the next draft.

I believe that's all we have as semantics for the DAV:workspace
property.

Cheers,
Geoff
