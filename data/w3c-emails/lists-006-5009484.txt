      2.2.1 DAV:checked-in
'This URL can be used to retrieve this particular
state of the version-controlled resource after the
version-controlled resource itself has been modified.'

 Given that this is a property of a checked-in version-
controlled resource, I fail to see how the version-
controlled resource itself can be modified.
   </tim>


   <tim_2>
Well it seems that Chuck and I were equally confused by this sentence.

However, I think that I understand where you are coming from -- namely
   that a client can take a copy of that DAV:checked-in URL and use it later
   to refer to the previous state of vcr when the DAV:checked-in value has
   been overwritten.
   </tim_2>

Changed the text so that it is less misleading.

7 Server-Workspace Option

para. 4
Unless the URLs are relative, the workspace name will get in the way
   of testing.
   </tim>

   The how about we delete that paragraph?  Rationale has alredy been given
   earlier.

Done.

      5.4 Additional OPTIONS Semantics
  Is it required that the history for the resource reporting the
   OPTIONS
      MUST be in the version-history-collection-set?  Probably unnecessary
   since
      clients can get to the history via properties.
   </tim>

   So why would a client want to know where some (indeterminate) version
   histories are stored?

So that it can find version histories that no longer are referenced
by any version-controlled resource.

      6.5 Additional CHECKOUT Semantics
  Additional Marshalling:
  'The response MAY include a Location header.'
  How else would you find a working resource URL?  Consider MUST.
   </tim>

The additional marshalling applies to all forms of CHECKOUT,
including a CHECKOUT of a version-controlled resource, but the
Location header is only required if a version is being checked
out.  The postcondition states that the Location header is
required if a version is being checked out.

Cheers,
Geoff
