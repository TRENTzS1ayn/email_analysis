*** DeltaV WORKING GROUP LAST CALL FOR COMMENTS ***

Web Versioning and Configuration Management PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION

We are happy to announce the second working group last call for comments 
from the DeltaV working group on the Versioning Extensions to WebDAV 
Specification, draft-ietf-deltav-versioning-12 available at 
http://www.ietf.org/ids.by.wg/deltav.html or 
http://www.webdav.org/deltav/.  This last call for comments period begins 
immediately, and ends February 1, 2001, at midnight, US Eastern time. This 
allows sufficient time for review of the specification in time for the 
March IETF '50 meeting.

At the end of the last call review period, a new draft will be issued. 
Depending on the scope of changes introduced between the -12 and -13 
versions, there will either be an immediate call for rough consensus (very 
few changes), or a third last call review period (significant changes). 
Once the document represents the rough consensus of the working group, I 
will submit this document to the Internet Engineering Steering Group 
(IESG) for their approval.  IESG review involves a (minimum) two week 
public last call for comments period.  This IESG-initiated last call 
period is in addition to the working group last call period.

This document is intended to be a "Proposed Standard".  Quoting from RFC 
2026, "The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3":

   The entry-level maturity for the standards track is "Proposed 
Standard".  A specific action by the IESG is required to move a 
specification onto the standards track at the "Proposed Standard" level.

   A Proposed Standard specification is generally stable, has resolved 
known design choices, is believed to be well-understood, has received 
significant community review, and appears to enjoy enough community 
interest to be considered valuable.  However, further experience might 
result in a change or even retraction of the specification before it 
advances.

   Usually, neither implementation nor operational experience is required 
for the designation of a specification as a Proposed Standard.  However, 
such experience is highly desirable, and will usually represent a strong 
argument in favor of a Proposed Standard designation.

Many details on the procedures used to develop an IETF standard can be 
found in RFC 2026, available at: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2026.txt

If there are any procedural questions or concerns, please do not hesitate 
to contact me, or raise an issue on the list.

Notes:

1) Issues raised during the last call period will be resolved 
individually, rather than lumped together and dealt with as a whole.  This 
follows the issue-resolution convention being followed in the HTTP WG.

2) If you've been waiting for a "stable" version of the specification 
before performing a review, you need wait no longer.  This is it.  We 
value your input, but time is running out. So please review the 
specification now in order to ensure your input gets included.

Chair, IETF DeltaV Working Group
