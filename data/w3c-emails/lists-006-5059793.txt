On my recent read through the protocol document, I found myself remembering
conversations on this list and in working group meetings that had produced
the rationale for many of the decisions and designs.

I would like to capture some of that in a FAQ (along the lines of the
WebDAV 'Book of Why'), because it is useful background for a new reader
(and will likely save me asking the same question umpteen times<g>).
However, I don't want to be the author / originator of a large FAQ!

Greg Stein has generously agreed to host a Delta-V FAQ-O-Matic on
webdav.org.  The FAQ-O-Matic shares the upkeep of the FAQ amongst everyone
in the working group.  You can add a question & answer, and append to
existing answers to further clarify or share additional information.

The FAQ is not used to discuss or debate issues in the protocol, or raise
initial queries -- that remains the role of this list.  Questions that can
be answered by a careful reading of the protocol document are also
discouraged.

The FAQ is empty at the moment.  I'll add a few Q&A as I think of them, and
I encourage you to do so.  Remember, anyone can add a Q&A; an entry will
only be moderated if it is blantantly incorrect.  I'll try to organize
subcategories as requested/required.

The URL is  http://www.webdav.org/deltav/faq  (soon to be linked from the
Delta-V homepage).

Here are some questions that I would like to see answered.

Why is LABEL not in core?
Is the server required to support...(some concept) ?
Are there any implementations to play with yet?
Why is version history described in core and appears as an option?
What combination of options are we likely to see?
Why are version-controlled collections, collection versions, and working
collections so different?
Why does the protocol not require case (in)sensitive label matching?
Is there a method for performing numerous operations atomically?
Why are there so many new methods?
Why is the DAV:resourcetype of a workspace 'DAV:collection'?
