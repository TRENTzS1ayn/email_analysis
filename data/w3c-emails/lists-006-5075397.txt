I've just been looking into how to handle content negotiation, and I 
haven't seen any implementation where content identified by a single
URL can handle multiple languages without redirection.  In other words,
if my file has Dutch content, and I'm a French user, I need to be sent
to another URL with the French version of that content (usually by the
language extension on the filename).  That other resource would have the
property values (like DAV:comment) in the correct language, presumably.

Therefore, I think there is no need to worry about internationalization
of string properties of a resource--they're going to be localized.  This
change should be reversed.
