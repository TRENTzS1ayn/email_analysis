I'm familiar with content negotiation, but I guess that negotiating on XML
properties would be 'practically impossible' given that WebDAV properties
match on name alone (and not attributes), otherwise you could image

(assuming xml:lang is the attribute for language tagging, I've no idea what
it is)

PROPPATCH /foo setting properties with language flags
...
...xmlns:D="..."...
<D:comment xml:lang="useng">Very good</D:comment>
<D:comment xml:lang="frfrench"Tres bon</D:comment>


Then a client could get the property value of choice in the language of
choice:

PROPFIND /foo
Content-Language: "frfrench"
...
</D:comment>

or even specifying the language in the body of the XML request:

PROPFIND /foo
...
</D:comment xml:lang="useng">
</D:author xml:lang="dutch"


(With big apologies to XML and HTTP syntax-ites.)

Apache does this all the time. Based on your Accept-Language request
header, Apache will return different content for a given URL. (assuming
that
you enable the Multiviews option (on by default) and have mod_negotiation
built)

Granted, it also returns a Location: header specifying the "real" URL.

But negotiation on XML properties seems practically impossible. Personally,
I think that adding DAV:string into the comment is overdone. We don't do
that with our other properties. Why is this one so special? And I seriously
doubt that a comment is going to be entered in multiple languages when the
version is created.
[ a version resource is immutable: you can't come back, translate the
  bugger, and add them into the DAV:comment ]

It seems a gratuitous change to have DAV:string in there.
