These are covered by the standard 405 (Method not allowed) status.
In addition, for future extensibility, I believe it is better
not to make these explicit preconditions.

Cheers,

I seem to recall that the document used to have the LABEL and CHECKOUT
precondition DAV:must-be-version-or-version-controlled-resource, and the
VERSION-CONTROL precondition DAV:must-be-versionable.

Why have they been dropped?
