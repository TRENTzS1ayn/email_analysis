I don't believe that the multiple comment strings were intended
for property content negotiation, but rather to allow you
to put comments in multiple languages on a resource which does
not have multiple language variants.  This could help support
searching for a document in multiple languages, even if the 
document itself is in only one language.

I agree with Greg's point that a version is unlikely to have
comments in multiple languages, but this property is intended
for an arbitrary resource, not just for version resources.

The reason this property (and DAV:creator-displayname) are
specified this way is that they can take natural language
values, which is not the case for the versioning specific
properties.

So I guess I see some benefit, with minimal cost.  To make
sure I haven't missed anything, is there any cost to this
extra layer of XML, other than a few extra bytes?

Cheers,
Geoff

I agree with Eric that this approach for internationalizing individual
properties is flawed, and that the change shoud be reversed.

I've just been looking into how to handle content negotiation, and I
haven't seen any implementation where content identified by a single
URL can handle multiple languages without redirection.  In other words,
if my file has Dutch content, and I'm a French user, I need to be sent
to another URL with the French version of that content (usually by the
language extension on the filename).  That other resource would have the
property values (like DAV:comment) in the correct language, presumably.

Therefore, I think there is no need to worry about internationalization
of string properties of a resource--they're going to be localized.  This
change should be reversed.
