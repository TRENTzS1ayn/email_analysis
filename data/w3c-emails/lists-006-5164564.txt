More reasons to avoid multilingual properties on monolingual documents:

There's always a big cost in making data an array from a scalar
unnecessarily.  Queries (in general) against this data will be
more expensive, and your example usage postulates using this data
for that purpose.

Secondly, the logical model is weaker.  If you only want to look
at the German text in a resource, you must examine each natural
language property separately to see what language it is, rather
than looking in one place.  Not only is this a query speed problem,
but it also allows the case where none of the property values matches
the language or charset of the resource's contents.

Thirdly, this is inconsistent usage with DAV:display-name, and I
think you need a compelling reason to introduce this type of
discrepancy.
