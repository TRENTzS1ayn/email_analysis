Is it possible to get at the property through an expand-property report?
Hmm. No... that always has an HREF associated with all prop listings.

Seems fine to me. I can't think of a way to get information *about* a
version resource without also being told is URL somewhere.


btw, I just noticed: the expand-property example has an error: the
activity-set for .../ver/1 is missing <href> tags.

[ also note that expand-property "violates" DTDs for properties. cool with
  me, but some DTD fanatics will be up in arms. (e.g. version-history isn't
  defined to contains a DAV:response element) ]

Cheers,
