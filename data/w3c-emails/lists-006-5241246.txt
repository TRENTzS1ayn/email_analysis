What if you got to the version through a version controlled resource and 
wanted to get the persistent version URL for some reason. Or what if you 
wanted to keep a  dictionary of version controlled resource URL and 
version URLs?

Since you cannot access a version without using the URL for that
version, the DAV:version property appears to be redundant (you
couldn't find that property unless you already knew the value of
that property).

So I propose that we remove this property.  Any objections?

Cheers,
Geoff
