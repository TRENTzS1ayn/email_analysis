Don't bother. I only mentioned it to tweak the DTD purists :-)

DAV has the overall design point of "other elements may appear within DAV:
elements; ignore those that you don't understand." This is a simple case of
that.

However, now that I'm thinking about it... it *is* important to note that
any DAV:response embedded within the "property value" is not actually part
of that value.

Hmm... Normally, we have a value such as:

  <D:version-history>
    <D:href>value</D:href>
  </D:version-history>

In the expand-property report, the D:href is moved:

  <D:version-history>
    <D:response>
      <D:href>value</D:href>
      <D:propstat>...</D:propstat>
    </D:response>
  </D:version-history>

Personally, I think that is fine, but maybe it needs a bit of clarification.
Especially from that standpoint of "what if other value(s) are in that
property?" For example:

  <D:version-history>
    <D:href>value</D:href>
    <SVN:extension>something</SVN:extension>
  </D:version-history>

Where does the SVN:extension go? Using the "href -> response" rewrite angle,
the result would be:

  <D:version-history>
    <D:response>
      <D:href>value</D:href>
      <D:propstat>...</D:propstat>
    </D:response>
    <SVN:extension>something</SVN:extension>
  </D:version-history>

Given the above, clarification might be essential :-)

Cheers,
