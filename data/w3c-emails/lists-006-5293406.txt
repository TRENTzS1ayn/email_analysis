   What about getting the DAV:version property for the base resource, which
   if pass-through is working to the current target, should result in
   getting the DAV:version for the current target?

I'm not sure what you mean by "if pass-through is working to the
current target",  but in any case, as Greg pointed out, if you
want the version URL for the DAV:checked-in or DAV:checked-out
version of a version-controlled resource, you get that from the
DAV:checked-in and DAV:checked-out property value.  There's no
need to have a second way of getting the same information.

Cheers,
Geoff
