I see your concerns :-) But for that there are some Makefiletemplates
and conventions which are used projectwide.

I guess you are right but nevertheless a SHOULD shows that the RFC authors

OK, that's a description I understand and agree with. I guessed so much but
didn't find is so clearly stated yet.

So I think we are clean enough for going to IETF !
