You can create a new baseline in the collection,
and then use the DAV:compare-baseline report
to describe the differences.

Creating a collection that just contains the
"changed files" doesn't really capture the change,
since it can only capture additions, and not
moves or deletions.

Cheers,
Geoff

What's the best way to model a patch set in deltaV?  (Let's say I want to
create a
configuration including only the files in a collection, recursively, that
have changed since
a particular baseline.)
