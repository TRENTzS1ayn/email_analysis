Sure, I agree completely.  What I was driving at was, if the server
signals that it does support the activity option, does that then
mean the server MUST allow writing to DAV:current-activity-set via
PROPPATCH?

Ah, OK, this does seem reasonable.  The text just hit me the wrong way.

That makes sense, but it should be specified.  Another perfectly
reasonable response is to flag the input as a syntax error, since
it's missing an expected XML element, and this could cause
interoperability problems.
