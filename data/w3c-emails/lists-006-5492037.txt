   From: "Vasta, John" <jvasta@rational.com>

   DeltaV methods which take request bodies are extensible, in that the DTDs
   for the top-level element in the body are all declared to allow ANY
   sub-elements. However, there are three methods which are not defined to take
   request bodies: MKACTIVITY, MKWORKSPACE, and UNCHECKOUT. Should the protocol
   explicitly declare that they can be extended by defining request bodies for
   them?

Sounds reasonable to me.  Any objections?

Cheers,
Geoff
