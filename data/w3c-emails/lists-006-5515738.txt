Dear Colleagues,

Please for give the lateness of my response.  I have finally managed to
set aside enough time to read through the protocol and discuss it here
with J?rgen Reuter.  We have a number of comment and requests. In order
to keeps some structure in the responses, I will send each topic as a
separate message.

Sincerely,
James J. Hunt
