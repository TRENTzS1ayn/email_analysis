Dear Colleagues,

The introduction is a bit short.  In particular, no mention is made of
the different operating modes that
this protocol is designed to support.  That makes it a bit difficult for
someone who has not sat in on
several committee meetings to understand why the protocol is "so
complicated".  Can a new paragraph
after the second paragraph in the introduction as follows be added?

The extensions to WebDAV described here are designed to support three
different client/server
interaction scenarios: versioning unaware clients, server managed
workspaces, and client managed
workspace.  In core versioning a compliant server provides a single
access point for each resource.
In essence, this is a default server side workspace.  A server may allow
versioning unaware clients
to modify resources in this workspace though normal WebDAV requests.
This allows sequential
modification of resources.  In order to support parallel modification of
resources, there needs to be
a method to create new workspaces.  To possibilities are supported:
server side workspaces via the
workspace option and client side workspace through the <client-workspace
resource> option.

Sincerely,
James J. Hunt
