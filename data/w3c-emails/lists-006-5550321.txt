The latest versioning draft made some improvements in specifying how
MOVE and COPY behave in all the possible combinations of whether the
source is versioned, whether the destination is versioned, whether the
destination exists, and whether the overwrite header is present.
However, it wasn't sufficient for me to determine what every combination
would produce.  I had to make some assumptions, such as assuming that
when overwrite is False the client wants the method not to be performed
if the destination exists (rather than create a new version).

In doing this work, I built a set of tables, to make sure I captured
every option and combination and could compare them.

Authors, please review every cell in the tables and make sure this is
what you intended.  Also please review my stated assumptions.  It's
necessary to do both, because there may be assumptions that I was not
aware of and could not state; or misunderstandings.

Other DeltaV-ers, please glance at it and make sure your assumptions
correspond with mine!
