Really, I don't recall any notational conventions used in terms (besides
the occasional MUST or MUST NOT<g>).

I agree.

I'd say that was quite a significant difference.

Confusing by the semantics or the name ('work...').

I think Mark made the case quite clearly that such a distinction is
unwarranted as they imply a particular use case that the protocol is not
restricted to support.

See answer above.

Not sure how to enlighten you other than recommending a re-read of RFC2616
variants which is what it took for me to 'get it'.  I'm sure others can
give more constructive suggestions.
