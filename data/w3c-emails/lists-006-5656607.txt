Agenda:

Following standard operating procedure, we've received a flood
of last-call comments on the very last day of last call (:-),
but better a flood on the last day, than not getting the 
comments at all, so thankyou to all the reviewers!

I've read all the comments, and I believe they primarily consist
of clarifications of semantics and suggestions for improving
the readability of the document.  I will go through them all
carefully, and make the suggested changes, and post the result
as a new internet draft by early next week.  I will also produce
a list of all the changes since the last internet draft,
so we can review the changes and confirm that there are none
substantive enough to require another last call period.

So there is no agenda this week, but I will be on the phone line
from 12:00 to say, 12:15, to see if anyone has any comments
that they might not have had a chance to send via email
during the last call period.

The agenda for next weeks TeleConf will be to determine whether
another working group last call is required.

Cheers,
Geoff
