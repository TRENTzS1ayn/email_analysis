Introducing server-defined status properties is starting down the slippery 
slope of document management. We intentionally kept this out of Delta-V 
because it didn't seem essential for versioning support, and would 
seriously delay its introduction. I suggest we may want to start another 
working group soon that address Delta-V extensions for interoperable 
document management. I would be happy to be involved.

Dear Colleagues,

There seem to be some confusion in the protocol description as to for
what Labels are good.  At least the example is misleading.  A label with
the name released is in general not useful, because released has the
character of status and a file may have only one revision with the label
released.  Over the course of time several versions will be "released".
A better example would be the label release_3.1.

Since there are revision control systems that support a status
property, it would make sense to support it explicitly as an option.
Status can not be implemented as a dead property for two reason:
  1) a versioned resource or working resource that is updated or created
     by a check-out request should NOT inherit the value of the status
     of the version being checked out, instead it should be set to a
     server defined base value or left empty; and
  2) status should be changeable on a version without creating a new
     version, similar to label.
Systems that implement both base-lines and status should provide a status
for base-lines.  The value of status should be an NMTOKEN.

Sincerely,
James J. Hunt
