Geoff,

I have some comments on the DeltaV spec based on an
internal review that I haven't been able to send
in on time. The major issue, though, is the
structure of the document:

Changes to WebDAV should be processed as a separate
document which updates WebDAV, with or without versioning.
It is unreasonable to attempt to "clarify" WebDAV
in the same spec that introduces versioning. The
WebDAV updates need to be reviewed by the entire
WebDAV community, and not just those people who are
interested in versioning.

Core versioning should be split into a separate spec.
Everything outside of core versioning is much less
likely to progress along standards track at the same
rate as core versioning (more time to get independent
interoperable implementations of every feature); by
linking "core versioning" with "non-core" in the
initial spec, you're setting yourself up for having
to split the documents later. Much of non-core is
controversial.

I'd dropped out of the delta-V mailing list for a while,
but I've just re-joined.

I've been searching through the email archive and can't
see where these structural issues are addressed.
