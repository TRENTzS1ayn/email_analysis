   Functionaly, labels will do it for you.
   1) They are not 'inherited' by (i.e., moved to) new versions.
   2) They do not require creating a new version to set or remove.

Labels will not "do it for me" because they are exclusive.  I can not
have two version in the same revision history with the label tested!
Label is a unique identifier and status denotes the current state of a
revision in regards to it processing.
