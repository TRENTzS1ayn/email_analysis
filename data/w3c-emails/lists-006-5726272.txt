I'd second what James says, only make it even more general.

Yes, many versioning systems have "status" properties on versions, and
the "status" property should be mutable, i.e. should be writable without
creating a new version.  (Immutable properties never change on old
versions; changing an immutable property creates a new version).

However, there are also publishing or workflow processes which require
their own mutable properties.  For example, "publishing-status" or
"editing-status" or "approval-status" or "invoice-status"...  We can't
be expected to predict all these, however it's a common need, and
defining only 'status' would not solve the general problem.

Thus, versioning needs a general way to allow creation of custom
properties which are mutable, AND custom properties which are immutable.
The server would of course reject requests for mutable properties if it
does not support mutability, but we need a standard way for clients to
ask for this.
