Xythos is planning to implement core and only core, unless and until
some interoperable DAV clients also implement some of the more generally
useful extensions such as checkin/checkout, baselines, variants or
labels, or until a customer requires such options.

"Expressed interest" is a vague statement, you could say that Xythos has
expressed interest in various extensions, however as I've stated we may
not implement any extensions anytime soon.

Any other document management vendors care to discuss what options they
plan to implement?
