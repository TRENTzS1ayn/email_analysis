Then make the requirement that the version tree be connected.  It's
quite possible for implementations to meet the requirement that the
version tree be connected, and provide this valuable functionality for
clients.

On the other hand, if you do not require that the version tree be
connected, then it's quite possible for implementations to end up with
an unconnected version tree even without deleting the root version.

I think the point here is to make the requirement state what the client
needs, rather than what you think is needed in order to get what the
client needs.
