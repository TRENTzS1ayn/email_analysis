But the Core versioning section is supposed to be features that MUST be
supported by all versioning servers.  Yet, the original paragraph
implies that "precursor-set" and the "initialize-precursor" condition
aren't required to be implemented because it says "if the destionation
of the COPY supports the DAV:precursor-set property".

Also, your explanation refers to UPDATE, which is not part of core.

Frankly, it looks like "precursor" support is yet another option, or
part of the UPDATE option.  It's important for the client to know if
it's supported or not (to know whether an missing/empty value of
precursor-set is meaningful or not) but it's optional.  Thus, it's an
option.
