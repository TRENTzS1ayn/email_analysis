In fact, it's not so much that that URLs are scarce, but that good user
interfaces are difficult.  How do I explain what URL namespaces are
reserved for special-purpose resources like VRs, VHRs, or (to take an
example from another realm) principals?  At least you could give me a
good error message to return when users try to create new resources or
collections in reserved namespaces!

How, then, can the client be expected to COPY where the source is a
version URL, and the destination is a working resource?  To the client
it "looks like" the source and destination are on different hosts, and
the client might reasonably expect this not to work, since most servers
don't implement server-to-server copy.
