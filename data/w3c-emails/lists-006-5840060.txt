I thought you were planning on supporting the variant
option?  (And if not, why did we spend all that time
working it out ... :-).  

Cheers,
Geoff

p.s.  Seriously, I think the variant
option is a valuable addition to the protocol, whether
or not you intend on implementing it in your server (:-)

Xythos is planning to implement core and only core, unless and until
some interoperable DAV clients also implement some of the more generally
useful extensions such as checkin/checkout, baselines, variants or
labels, or until a customer requires such options.

"Expressed interest" is a vague statement, you could say that Xythos has
expressed interest in various extensions, however as I've stated we may
not implement any extensions anytime soon.

Any other document management vendors care to discuss what options they
plan to implement?
