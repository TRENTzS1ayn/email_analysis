As a result of discussions in this morning's teleconference, I would like to
formally pose two questions to all members of the list and solicit your
responses and opinions.


1) Is the current form of the specification too complex?  Yes/No/Maybe.
Why?


2) Does there remain sufficient discussion going on surrounding the OPTIONS
that the draft should be split into two documents, CORE and OPTIONS, so that
we can move CORE forward?  Yes/No/Maybe.  Why?



Thanks,

Mark
