Section 6, first paragraph says this about the working-resource option:

"In order to allow two users to work concurrently on making changes to the
same resource, it is necessary to provide multiple checked out resources for
the same version history.  Even if only one user is making changes to a
resource, it is sometimes desirable to be able to make those changes (new
versions) "in private" and then expose that work at an appropriate later
time.  One way to provide this functionality depends on maintaining the
desired configuration of resources in persistent state on the client
(usually a copy of the content and dead properties of each resource in the
configuration, but minimally a URL list).  This is the working-resource
option..."

While this is all true, shouldn't it be clearly stated here that the
working-resource option provides for a mutable, persistent working resource
on the server, no matter what persistent state might also be kept on the
client?  A reader could easily come away from that first paragraph not
realizing that this option calls for the server-resident working resource,
because it focuses only on client-resident persistent state that may include
content and dead properties of each of those same resources.
