Rational intends on implementing most of the DeltaV options,
except for working resources and variants.  We will probably
implement those options as well if there is sufficient client demand
for them.

Cheers,
Geoff

   Oracle plans on implementing most of the DeltaV options,
   with the notable exception of Variants.  

   In addition to end-user clients, we may also be using DeltaV
   internally to communicate between middle tier and data servers.

   Xythos is planning to implement core and only core, unless and until
   some interoperable DAV clients also implement some of the more generally
   useful extensions such as checkin/checkout, baselines, variants or
   labels, or until a customer requires such options.

   "Expressed interest" is a vague statement, you could say that Xythos has
   expressed interest in various extensions, however as I've stated we may
   not implement any extensions anytime soon.

   Any other document management vendors care to discuss what options they
   plan to implement?
