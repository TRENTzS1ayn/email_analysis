I saw no reply to that yet so I will give my $0.02.
I think a mutable status property is essential if I want to do some
document management.
To be more flexible I also would want to to have at least arbitrary
mutable properties to add to a version.
Or can I mimic that by adding multiple labels to a version ? E.g.
doc#1 status_accepted, author_edgar
doc#2 status_working, author_lisa (sometimes authors of documents change)

Cheers, Edgar
