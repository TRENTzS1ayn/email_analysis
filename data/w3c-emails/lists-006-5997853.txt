I normally avoid to cite too much but nevertheless do it to emphasize what
Geoff said. I couldn't have said it better.

Core versioning is agreed I suppose. And the fate of options will be
decided on the marketplace by their value to the customers. So let's
finally go on to proposed standard so that implementation can start in
earnest. And please don't give versioning in two pieces to IETF.
IMHO core versioning doesn't have the functionality I need. So proposing
core and postphoning options would prolong options still longer.
As I said before. Let the users requirements decide on the fate of the
options.

Regards, Edgar
