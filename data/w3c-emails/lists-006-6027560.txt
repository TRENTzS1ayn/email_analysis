I think this header could be extremely valuable, particularly if it
could indicate either T or F.

Example: if the DAV:auto-version property indicates that auto-versioning
is off, the presence of an "Auto-version: T" header would override and
create a new version.  Also, if the DAV:auto-version property indicates
that auto-versioning is on, but the client sends "Auto-version: F"
header in the request, then the server can know it's a work-in-progress
and just modify the latest version, without requiring a checkout/checkin
or changing the version URL.

Would it be less confusing to have the header called
"Create-new-version" or some such?
