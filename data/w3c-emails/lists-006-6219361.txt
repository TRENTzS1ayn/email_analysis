   Then make the requirement that the version tree be connected.  It's
   quite possible for implementations to meet the requirement that the
   version tree be connected, and provide this valuable functionality
   for clients.

   On the other hand, if you do not require that the version tree be
   connected, then it's quite possible for implementations to end up with
   an unconnected version tree even without deleting the root version.

   I think the point here is to make the requirement state what the client
   needs, rather than what you think is needed in order to get what the
   client needs.

Good point.  I'll delete the precondition and add a postcondition that
says: "following the deletion, there must be a root version that is a
predecessor of all other versions in that version history".  In particular,
this is trivially satisfiable for linear version histories (which I'm
guessing is what Lisa had in mind :-).

Cheers,
Geoff
