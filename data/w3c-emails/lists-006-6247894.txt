   ... please modify section 2.4 to read something like:

   "If the request-URL identifies a versionable resource, a new version
   history resource MAY be created."

I agree this needs to be clarified, but I prefer JimW's wording: "In
core versioning, a version history resource is not assigned a URL, and
hence is not visible in the http scheme URL space."

This keeps the versioning model more consistent, since logically
there always is a version history which consists of all the
versions connected by predecessor relations.

Cheers,
Geoff
