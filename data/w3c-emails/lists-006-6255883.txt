   From: Roy Seto <Roy.Seto@oracle.com>

   An author uses what many existing versioning systems call a
   subbranch to develop a logical change. Then that author
   merges the subbranch into what many versioning systems would
   call its parent branch (perhaps by using a workspace defined
   in terms of the parent branch as the merge target). The
   author would like to identify the versions on the parent
   branch created by the merge process (marked as "O" in the
   diagram below).

----------------------O---- parent branch
  \                  /
   \                /
    ---------------- subbranch

       <--- ancestors   descendants ---> 

In our system (which maintains both branches and change-sets),
we open up a new "merge activity" for the merge (which is a
sub-activity of the branch activity), and then create all the
new versions on the parent branch in that "merge" activity.
So for us, the merge activity identifies those specific
versions on the parent branch that are the result of the
merge.

The versioning protocol doesn't go into this level of detail
of course, but that would be one way to do it.

Cheers,
Geoff
