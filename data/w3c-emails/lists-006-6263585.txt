I agree with the points Lisa makes below, but I believe this
kind of work should be done as a general WebDAV property
metadata effort (there are lots of interesting property
metadata information that you'd like to define and discover),
and not something embedded in the versioning protocol
(I'd say we've done more than our share by tackling the
"report" problem :-).

Cheers,

   I'd second what James says, only make it even more general.

   Yes, many versioning systems have "status" properties on versions,
   and the "status" property should be mutable, i.e. should be
   writable = without creating a new version.  (Immutable properties
   never change on old versions; changing an immutable property
   creates a new version).

   However, there are also publishing or workflow processes which require
   their own mutable properties.  For example, "publishing-status" or
   "editing-status" or "approval-status" or "invoice-status"...  We can't
   be expected to predict all these, however it's a common need, and
   defining only 'status' would not solve the general problem.

   Thus, versioning needs a general way to allow creation of custom
   properties which are mutable, AND custom properties which are =
   immutable.  The server would of course reject requests for mutable
   properties if it does not support mutability, but we need a
   standard way for clients to ask for this.
