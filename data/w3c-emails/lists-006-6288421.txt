I agree with Tim that this is more appropriate for the scenarios
document, and I strongly enourage James to sign on as a co-author
of the scenarios document, and flesh out these scenarios in that
document!

Cheers,
Geoff

   Hmm, this feels like you are leading the reader down a certain path -- I
   suggest this is better covered in a scenarios doc.

   The introduction is a bit short.  In particular, no mention is made
   of the different operating modes that this protocol is designed to
   support.  That makes it a bit difficult for someone who has not sat
   in on several committee meetings to understand why the protocol is
   "so complicated".  Can a new paragraph after the second paragraph
   in the introduction as follows be added?

   The extensions to WebDAV described here are designed to support
   three different client/server interaction scenarios: versioning
   unaware clients, server managed workspaces, and client managed
   workspace.  In core versioning a compliant server provides a single
   access point for each resource.  In essence, this is a default
   server side workspace.  A server may allow versioning unaware
   clients to modify resources in this workspace though normal WebDAV
   requests.  This allows sequential modification of resources.  In
   order to support parallel modification of resources, there needs to
   be a method to create new workspaces.  To possibilities are
   supported: server side workspaces via the workspace option and
   client side workspace through the <client-workspace resource>
   option.

   Sincerely,
   James J. Hunt
