That doesn't make sense. You're always going to have a tension between
OPTIONS for capability discovery and PROPFIND/Depth: for discovery over a
set of resources. supported-xxx was moved to OPTIONS because that is where
discovery normally occurs.

By your logic, we should move the DAV: header into properties.

The right answer is to modify OPTIONS to allow a Depth: header value.

If it comes back with a multistatus, then you know the server understood the
Depth: header. If it didn't respond with a multi, then you probably don't
have a DeltaV server.
