   Really, I don't recall any notational conventions used in terms (besides
   the occasional MUST or MUST NOT<g>).

Well, I don't really care one way or the other, and the MUST and the
MUST NOT are in fact a forward reference (albeit fairly harmless ones
:-), so I'd be happy to move the notational convention in front of the
terminology section, as requested.  Does anyone object?

   I agree.

Will do.

   I'd say that was quite a significant difference.

I agree, and also agree with all the following points
made by Tim (which I will omit).  I believe Tim makes
a compelling case for keeping the terminology as it is.

   Not sure how to enlighten you other than recommending a re-read of
   RFC2616 variants which is what it took for me to 'get it'.  I'm
   sure others can give more constructive suggestions.

Unfortunately, that's the best suggestion I have as well.
Perhaps you could explain what about RFC2616 variants don't
make sense to you, and what you need to author variants that
is not provided by the variant option?

Cheers,
Geoff
