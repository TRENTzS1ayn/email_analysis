   Good point, stating that the request is ignored but produces a prescribed
   response seems counterintuative.

Yes, this was added when a reviewer asked for a response that would
tell them whether or not the VERSION-CONTROL request was ignored
because the resource was under version control already.  This is
clearly confusing, so I agree with Tim's suggestion that we just drop
the requirement that the method return this information.  Anyone
object?

   Secondly, I agree that there are a number of places where the
   marshaling is underspecified with respect to (usually) error
   conditions (though in this case it is a 200 OK response).  For
   example, in REPORT "the response body MUST contain the requested
   report" and "The DAV:version-tree REPORT response body MUST be a
   DAV:multistatus XML element."

I didn't quite follow your point here Tim ... could you restate
or clarify?

   Agreed.  A quick check reveals that this is the only property value
   declared as ANY.

The "value" of an empty DAV:auto-version property is well defined
(it has none) ... do you mean "the behavior of an empty DAV:auto-version
property"?  If the protocol doesn't specify it's behavior, then from
an interoperable clients perspective, it has no behavior.  This
is true for all aspects of the protocol.

Geoff
