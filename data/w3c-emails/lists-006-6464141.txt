   Simply that when, say DAV:version-tree REPORT is in error, it returns an
   extended status element body (contrary to "The DAV:version-tree REPORT
   response body MUST be a DAV:multistatus XML element.")

OK, I think I get it.  These statements should be qualified by "if the
request succeeds".  Will this address your concern?
