   I really wasn't that concerned<g>, I was acknowledging Juergen/James'
   comments -- but yes, that would fix it.

Ok, I'll make that fix.  It's really bad to have false statements
in the protocol, even if there is a reasonable interpretation
very confusing to another.  I'll make this change to every
marshalling section.

Cheers,
