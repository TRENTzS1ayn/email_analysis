   The reasons for the concern over tags that are used both as empty
   tags and as tag pairs (with or without content) were problems with
   a earlier version of an XML parser that had problems with combining
   both form and the following quote from the XML specification.

I couldn't find any following quote ... did I miss it?

   For interoperability, the empty-element tag should be used, and
   should only be used, for elements which are declared EMPTY.

I don't remember seeing that in the XML spec.  Which section is
that from?

   Additionally, using tags both requires the use of ANY for dead
   properties.  The current XML parser from sun can handle them, so I
   can live with them.

Does that mean that you are OK with a property element being
optionally empty?

   P.S. I have yet to find a good solution for the display of version
   graphs.  I have a few ideas.  Could we telephone?

This week is pretty packed for me, so email would probably be
better (too many meetings :-).  Hopefully things will ease
up at some point, but it's hard to predict when.

Cheers,
Geoff
