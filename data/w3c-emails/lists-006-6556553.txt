No, that's not what I mean.  I don't mean at all that the property
passes through to the versions.  I mean that it is a property that is
not semantically sensible if you look at it on an individual version.
E.g. "Editor-in-Chief", is a property which is likely to mean "The
person who is editor-in-chief of this entire document, including all its
past versions".  I've called this a "global" property in another email.

No, that's impossible for clients that are not versioning-aware.
