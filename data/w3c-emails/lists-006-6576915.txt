Dear Geoff,

My understanding of an option is "does the server support x".  Properties
associate values to keys for a given resource.  Let us take
DAV:workspace-collection-set.  Especially when you say that the http namespace
can be spread over several servers, the question I ask with this tag is not do
you support workspaces, rather for a given versionable workspace, where can I
create a workspace for it?  In other words, I am asking what is the workspace
area associated with this resource.  That seems to me to be a property of that
resource, because every resource could answer it differently.

Sincerely,
James
