Please look again.  Section 1.5.4 states:
"If a write-locked resource has a non-computed property defined by this
document, the property value MUST NOT be changed by a request unless the
appropriate lock token is included in the request."

How does this _completely_ _define_ the locking and VERSION-CONTROL
interactions?  It contradicts your explanation, since the draft
explicitly says "non-computed property", and your explanation includes
computed properties set as a by-product of versioning methods!

More seriously, I'm starting to get very disturbed by the response
"we'll clarify in the FAQ".  Delta-V is an internet-draft defining a
protocol for the purposes of interoperability.  It should therefore
provide a complete description of the protocol.  Once the protocol is
published we'll no doubt find under-specified areas and may need to
document these in a FAQ until we can correct them in the transition to
Draft. However, it seems like very bad policy to publish a draft that we
know to be incomplete or confusing with the intention to clarify it in a
non-normative non-archival document.
