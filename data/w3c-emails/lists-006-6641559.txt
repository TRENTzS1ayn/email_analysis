I understand your reluctance to take this on, but I don't think the
versioning protocol satisfies document publishing needs without the
ability to create custom mutable properties.

What we've got in the draft so far, is the set of mutable properties
which are needed for source-control systems, like "Label-name-set" and
perhaps "DAV:workspace", and they are supposedly "Calculated"
properties.  Document publishing needs aren't met by the label option,
and there seems to be no way of adding new mutable properties short of
publishing an internet-draft.
