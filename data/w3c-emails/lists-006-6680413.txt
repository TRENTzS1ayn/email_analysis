It is in section "3.1 Start-Tags, End-Tags, and Empty-Element Tags" under
the header "Tags for Empty Elements".

Given the above quote, I am not particularly happy with it, but I can
live with it.  The main problem I have is that any application can define
a new tags for a dead property and use it in prop.  This means
that prop can only be defined as any.  If we had a dead property element,
I would be happier:

       <!ELEMENT dead-prop ANY>
        <!ATTLIST dead-prop name CDATA #REQUIRED>

That way, I could say useful things about structuring property in DTDs.

Sincerely,
James
