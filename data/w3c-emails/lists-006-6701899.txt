Agreed!

mod_dav (and, therefore, Apache 2.0 and later) will never do DTD validation
on the incoming requests. The XML is parsed (and checked that it is
well-formed), but the code that tears up the elements is more than
sufficient for detecting improper usage / violations of the expected element
construction. An XML validator won't assist that in any way.

I'm still going to write code like:

    /* get the label string */
    if ((child = dav_find_child(elem, "label-name")) == NULL) {
        ap_log_rerror(APLOG_MARK, APLOG_ERR | APLOG_NOERRNO, 0, r,
              "The label command element does not contain "
                      "a \"label-name\" element.");
       return HTTP_BAD_REQUEST;
    }

Why use a validator when an "if" command during processing does the same
thing, and can give me a very nice error message?
