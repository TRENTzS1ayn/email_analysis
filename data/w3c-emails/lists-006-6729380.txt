Dear Colleagues,

Lisa has a good point about the complexity being daunting, but I disagree
with the remedy.  This is a point were a good introduction could help.  I
tried to take a stab at this but was shot down.  My intent was to give the
reader a bit of motivation about the structure of the document.  The read
should be given some feeling up front, about what parts of the document
need to be studied to support document management, file based revision
control, and configuration management, as well as some indication as to the
choices about client vs server managed work areas.  Perhaps someone else
could take a shot at it.

Sincerely,
James
