   Agreed, but there is already a notable client that does use this namespace.
   :-(

Dear Tim,

I think we should do it anyway, with the note that the ones used by said
client(s) are grand-fathered.  Let the guilty list their sins (;-), by
naming what tags they already have in use.  Of course the list must be
in the spec.  At least then, we can keep the problem from getting worse.

Sincerely,
James
