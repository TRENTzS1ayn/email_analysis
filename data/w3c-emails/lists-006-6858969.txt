Yes, that's what I'm asking for.  Although it's true that the VHR has a
URL that a versioning-unaware client could hypothetically use, this is
actually useless since a versioning-unaware client cannot get the URL of
the VHR; it doesn't even know it's supposed to look on VHRs for that
property.

The functionality of having what I call "global" properties on VCRs is a
requirement for many document versioning scenarios.
