Tim,

I take your point about the checked-out version only being created when
the PUT is issued.  Still, some confusion remains.

The spec frequently makes statements like: "The resource MUST have a
DAV:checked-in property that identifies the new version.  The content,
dead properties, and DAV:resourcetype of the new version MUST be the
same as those of the resource.  "
Also: "Although the content and dead properties of a checked-in
version-controlled resource are required to be the same as those of its
current DAV:checked-in version..."

OK, so based on my reading of this text and others, I assumed that the
VCR ALWAYS had the body and the content of the last checked-in version,
whether or not the VCR was checked-out.  Nowhere does the draft state
otherwise, e.g. that a checked-out VCR has the body and properties of
the checked-out version.

Clearly, you and perhaps the other authors have a different mental model
of the way this works, but nowhere in the draft is this stated.  I admit
that 2.1.2, on careful viewing, does imply that the checked-out VCR
shows the body and properties of the latest version, but I want a
normative statement.

Lisa
