Ok, but we are converging!

These statements are made in the context of a checked-in version-controlled
resource.

No, when a version-controlled resource is checked in it has the same
content and dead properties (C&DP) as the version identified in the
DAV:checked-in property.  However, when a version-controlled resource is
checked-out, its C&DP are not necessarily the same as any version.

The moment it is checked out on the server, the VCR will have the same C&DP
as the version identified by the DAV:checked-out property, but the nature
of a checked-out VCR is that it can be modified, so subsequent PUTs etc.
will mean it is no longer the same as the DAV:checked-out version.

Take another look at Section 2.1.2 Modifying a Version-Controlled Resource,
in particular the diagram that shows the VCR moves to state S3 after the
successful PUT.  S3 is not captured as a version until the CHECKIN.  Of
course, there could have been multiple PUTs and/or PROPPATCHes between the
CHECKOUT and CHECKIN.

...because that is untrue.  A VCR is a first-class resource, with content
and properties.  When it is checked out it is "open for change".  There is
no checked-out version associated with a checked-out VCR.

The only way to get a checked-out version is by sending CHECKOUT to the
version itself (i.e., using the version URL, or a Label: header). The
checked-out version is called a working resource (not a checekd-out VCR).
Creating working resources is optional for the server (the
"working-resource" option).

A checked-in VCR will always have the same C&DP as the DAV:checked-in
version.  Sending it CHECKOUT essentially flips a read-only bit to
read/write (ok and jiggers the live properties a bit) and that's it!
Simple eh?
