Thanks for finding that, Greg!  Yes, it was supposed to go in the
CHECKOUT preconditions, not the UPDATE preconditions.

What did you have in mind for a new precondition for 9.9 (UPDATE)?

Cheers,
Geoff

The first precondition in 9.9 refers to DAV:apply-to-version. The UPDATE
method can have a DAV:version element. DAV:apply-to-version is used in
CHECKOUT. The name of the precondition would change, too.

However, this precondition *does* apply to section 9.8 (CHECKOUT) (where it
is missing). Basically, move the precondition in 9.9 up to 9.8, and then
write a new one for 9.9.
