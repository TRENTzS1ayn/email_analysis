Instead of calling the client versioning challenged, lets just say it is
only Core versioning aware.  As section 2.1.1 states, the version
history resource is only exposed with the version history option.  But I
would expect/want "global" properties to be part of Core versioning and
not need to implement the version history option on the client and find
a server that has also implemented the version history option.
