Tim, what you've described can make sense, but it leaves an unspecified
hole in the middle.

If a client does a CHECKOUT then a PUT then a GET, what body do they
see?

You say "when a version-controlled resource is checked-out, its C&DP are
not necessarily the same as any version."  That's not much of a
requirement!  It seems I could implement it such that when a client does
a CHECKOUT then a PUT then a GET, they see the body that existed on the
VCR before the checkout.

On the other hand, you could implement it so that the same client does
the same CHECKOUT, PUT and GET, and they see the body that they PUT,
which is NOT the body that existed on the VCR before the checkout.

The deltaV draft needs to pick one or another and make a clear
requirement.
