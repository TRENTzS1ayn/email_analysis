During the conference call this coming Friday, the top item for discussion
will be whether the document is currently in a sufficiently stable form that
it should be sent along to the IESG for IETF-wide last call, and review by
the Application Area Director(s).

One of the most critical pieces of information I need to determine whether I
personally believe the draft should go forward is a good sense of how many
people have reviewed the *entire* specification, including all options.
During the last call, I was only able to review the core capabilities, and
some of checkin/checkout, and this took me a day.

So, if you have reviewed the options part of the specification, please
answer the straw poll question below. Please indicate which options you have
reviewed.  Geoff, I'll automatically assume you have reviewed the entire
document :-) If I've cc'ed you on this email, that means you appear to have
done a thorough recent review, and are likely to have reviewed one or more
options. Hence, especially if I have cc'ed you, I would appreciate a straw
poll response.  Poll responses to the list are preferred.

1. Have you reviewed all options in the DeltaV protocol specification
(Yes/No).

2. If no, which options have you reviewed?

3. If you have implementation experience for one or more options, and can
share this experience, which options have you implemented?

Please reply by Friday morning, 7AM, US Pacific time.

Thank you!

- Jim
