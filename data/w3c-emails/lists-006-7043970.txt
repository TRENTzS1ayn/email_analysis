Jim,

  I only voted against a split at the DeltaV breakout meeting in San Diego,
but I'll repeat it here to help your accounting.  A delay in the standards
process for the workspace and baseline options, in particular, would
probably have an impact on the time until any Oracle DeltaV implementation
would be marketed.
