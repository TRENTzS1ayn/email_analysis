As a note on this straw poll, I think that the question of whether you
have reviewed all the options in the protocol is not very relevant.
Virtually nobody has expressed an interest in implementing all the
options (at least, not in their first release).

The relevant number is whether a sufficient number of people have
reviewed each option (which in fairness to Jim, was his question
number two).  And since the options are cleanly segregated into
separate sections, I'd be happy to "defer" any option that does not
have sufficient review/support.  My criteria for sufficient support is
that there are two different implementors planning on using it.

Cheers,
Geoff


   From: "Jim Whitehead" <ejw@cse.ucsc.edu>

   During the conference call this coming Friday, the top item for discussion
   will be whether the document is currently in a sufficiently stable form that
   it should be sent along to the IESG for IETF-wide last call, and review by
   the Application Area Director(s).

   One of the most critical pieces of information I need to determine whether I
   personally believe the draft should go forward is a good sense of how many
   people have reviewed the *entire* specification, including all options.
   During the last call, I was only able to review the core capabilities, and
   some of checkin/checkout, and this took me a day.

   So, if you have reviewed the options part of the specification, please
   answer the straw poll question below. Please indicate which options you have
   reviewed.  Geoff, I'll automatically assume you have reviewed the entire
   document :-) If I've cc'ed you on this email, that means you appear to have
   done a thorough recent review, and are likely to have reviewed one or more
   options. Hence, especially if I have cc'ed you, I would appreciate a straw
   poll response.  Poll responses to the list are preferred.

   1. Have you reviewed all options in the DeltaV protocol specification
   (Yes/No).

   2. If no, which options have you reviewed?

   3. If you have implementation experience for one or more options, and can
   share this experience, which options have you implemented?

   Please reply by Friday morning, 7AM, US Pacific time.

   Thank you!

   - Jim
