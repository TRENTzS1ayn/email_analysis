Well, ideally there will have been a number of reviews of the entire
document, but a high average number of reviews/option is also a good sign.

I'm not interested in defering options that haven't been sufficiently
reviewed, I just want to make sure they have been thoroughly reviewed. If
lack of reviews of one or more options is the critical path, I suspect these
sections will get reviewed quickly.

I really want to see this document progress as quickly as possible, but I
also need to know that it has been reviewed by a couple different pairs of
eyes.  It's much cheaper to fix errors now, by several orders of magnitude,
than after the spec. has been implemented N times.
