I don't understand your point.  Assuming a versioning unaware client, what
characteristics of the property could they expect that are not provided for
by RFC2518?

You missed my point, the property would be on the version history resource,
but does not require any versioning specific methods to get or set.

A versioning unaware client would have no such expectations for a property
like this.  Please explain further, I feel I'm missing it.
