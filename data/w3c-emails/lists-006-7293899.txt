To put it in short words: I totally agree with Juergen!!!

We had a lot of trouble during implementing our WebDAV client which were
caused by the fact that client and server implementers had different
understandings of the protocol. The majority of that trouble could have been
avoided with a crystal clear DTD (e. g. without or at least with a reduced
numbers of ANYs) because the likelihood of misunderstandings of the protocol
can be tremendously reduced if such a DTD exists.

Best, Hartmut
