Working group memebers:

First I would like to thank everyone for their interest and hard work. 
Thanks to you, we are really making progress on a very hard problem. I am 
particularly pleased with the mailing list participation (even though its 
getting hard to keep up). Delta-V is truly a healthy working group. 
However, as chair, I am sometimes obligated to arbitrate situations where 
there is no clear working group consensus, or when conflicting goals make 
it impossible to choose between otherwise valid options. It isn't a 
question of who's right or wrong, everyone is right but for different 
reasons. Splitting the document is clearly one of these cases. So I am 
choosing to submit Delta-V to the IETF as a single document. If this 
proves to be the wrong choice, we can consider other options when the need 
arises. So let's put this one behind us and spend some of this valuable 
energy reviewing those pesky options! Again, thanks to everyone for their 
thoughtful input. With your continued effort, we'll all come out winners.
