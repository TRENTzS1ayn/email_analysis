Lisa,

Just for the record: Our WebDAV/DeltaV server is also "not doing
source code control" and I have read the entire document (several
times :)

BTW, there's another (more famous) WebDAV server that isn't about
source control: Microsoft Exchange 2000 :)

Thanks, Ron

...  Xythos is the only WebDAV
server that is not doing source code control, that is planning to
implement any part of DeltaV.  I think I'm the only person designing a
versioning server that isn't for source control, that has bothered to
read the entire spec ...
