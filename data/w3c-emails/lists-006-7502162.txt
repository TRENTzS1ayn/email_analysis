> 1. Have you reviewed all options in the DeltaV protocol specification
No, even if I think I read every option at least once :-)

> 2. If no, which options have you reviewed?
I had a closer look at CHECKOUT, UPDATE, VERSION-HISTORY, WORKSPACE, LABEL
and BASELINE. Which doesn't mean to say that all other options aren't important.
The question is how much time you have.

I implemented sort of workspaces and baselines based on RCS some years ago.
So I was confined to local scope and would like to see these features also
being available on the Web.

Cheers, Edgar
