thanks, greg, that's exactly right.

I'll admit I also classed "web-site source control management" along
with traditional C/C++/java/whatever source code control, which is what
might have confused some people about how I was classifying different
implementors.  Web sites with source code under versioning control may
well have needs for branching, baselines, I don't know what else.  You
need to worry about files being included in other files, using the
correct stylesheet, and so on.  One might reasonably use several of the
advanced versioning scenarios to do serious web-site management.

IMHO, doing "simple document versioning", the server never needs to
worry about how one document relates to another.  Each document is
stand-alone.  No need for baselines, activities, workspaces, or labels.

Of course there's grey area, because many web pages are authored under
exactly the same conditions as "simple document versioning".  And there
are also large, complex content management problems, like authoring
technical manuals, where separate resources *do* interact.  I'l have to
come up with a better term for what I mean.  Maybe:
 "Versioning system for stand-alone resources"

Would my statement be true if I said I was the only person designing a
"versioning system for stand-alone resources"?
