Based on the opinions expressed by working group members (which tend to
favor keeping the document together more than splitting it apart), I agree
with the Chair's decision, and will abide by it. I agree that we should
focus our energy on reviewing options.

  Working group memebers:

  First I would like to thank everyone for their interest and hard work.
Thanks to you, we are really making progress on a very hard problem. I am
particularly pleased with the mailing list participation (even though its
getting hard to keep up). Delta-V is truly a healthy working group. However,
as chair, I am sometimes obligated to arbitrate situations where there is no
clear working group consensus, or when conflicting goals make it impossible
to choose between otherwise valid options. It isn't a question of who's
right or wrong, everyone is right but for different reasons. Splitting the
document is clearly one of these cases. So I am choosing to submit Delta-V
to the IETF as a single document. If this proves to be the wrong choice, we
can consider other options when the need arises. So let's put this one
behind us and spend some of this valuable energy reviewing those pesky
options! Again, thanks to everyone for their thoughtful input. With! ! !
your continued effort, we'll all come out winners.
