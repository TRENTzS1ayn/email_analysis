In the 12.2 draft, Section 2.5 states:

> If the request-URL identifies a version-controlled resource,
> the resource just remains under version-control.  This allows
> a client to be unaware of whether or not a server automatically
> puts a resource under version control when it is created.

And then lists as a Postcondition:

> (DAV:already-under-version-control): If the request-URL identified
> a resource already under version control at the time of the request,
> the VERSION-CONTROL request MUST NOT change the DAV:checked-in or
> DAV:checked-out property of that version-controlled resource.

Section 1.6 then leads one to believe that this condition would result in a
403 or a 409 status response, even though this appears to be normal
operation, and hence would warrant a 200 OK response.

Geoff Clemm's message of February 4, 2001

l) makes it sound like this Postcondition would be dropped.  Is it
intentionally still in the draft?
