Hmm, I think I was thrown off by the title of this precondition.  It seems
that the purpose of the postcondition is to flag when the property invariant
(DAV:checked-in' == DAV:checked-in) ^ (DAV:checked-out' == DAV:checked-out)
cannot be maintained, and so the name of the postcondition really should be
something like "DAV:property-invariant-violated".
