Yes, I've gone and fixed that title.

Note though that the title is always of the form "must do or not do X",
i.e. what the postcondition gets you, and not "what went wrong".
(Sort of a glass half full vs. half empty issue :-).  So a standard
error message would be "Could not ensure xxx".  And
"Could not ensure property-invariant-violated" probably isn't
what we want (:-).

Cheers,
Geoff

Hmm, I think I was thrown off by the title of this precondition.  It seems
that the purpose of the postcondition is to flag when the property invariant
(DAV:checked-in' == DAV:checked-in) ^ (DAV:checked-out' == DAV:checked-out)
cannot be maintained, and so the name of the postcondition really should be
something like "DAV:property-invariant-violated".
