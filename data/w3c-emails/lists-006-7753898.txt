I agree with Tim and John.  Although the HTTP/1.1 spec 
doesn't make GET/PUT behavior as explicit as we might want,
I don't believe there is any confusion in the community
as to the behavior of GET/PUT on an ordinary resource.
I believe any attempt by us to define the core semantics
of GET/PUT would lead folks to believe we are trying to
*change* the definition of GET/PUT, which is very much not
what we want to do. 

Cheers,
Geoff

I agree with John.

At the risk of nagging<g>, a version-controlled resource is an honest to
goodness WebDAV resource, with content and properties (version-controlled
collections have members and properties).  Intuatively, if a PUT to the
resource succeeds (200 OK) then a client is entitled to believe they will
GET the same entity back.

p.s.
I had a quick look through the HTTP/1.1 spec, and didn't see anything that
states this categorically.  In fact, Section 9.6 (PUT) states:
 "HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an origin
server."
Now, how many clients do a GET just to check what they actually will
retrieve after a successful PUT!
