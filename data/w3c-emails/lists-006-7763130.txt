OK, looks like my "if there are no objections"
precondition just got violated (:-).

Does anyone have a rebuttal to Tim's response?
(I can't think of one :-).

Cheers,
Geoff

I tried this for an earlier revision of the spec., but didn't get any
support for it.

We can give it a shot and I'm happy to provide my updated list, but I'm
reluctant to getting into a big discussion about whether/why a particular
condition is a 403 or 409 or either.

I disagree.  I think it is sufficient to reserve the DAV: namespace, and if
I choose to return
     <IBM:bad-hair-day/>
as a reason for not doing something, then I don't see that it will be
detrimental to other clients.
