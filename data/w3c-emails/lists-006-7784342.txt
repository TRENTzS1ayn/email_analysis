The intent of this paragraph was to identify a way in which
DeltaV has an impact on "Security Through Obscurity" (i.e. the
additional links decreases the obscurity).  Is there a better
title for this section?

Cheers,
Geoff

This is Section 18.3 (in -12.2) ... I read the text and it makes sense, but
not under this heading?
