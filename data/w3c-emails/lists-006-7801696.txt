I'll go you one better. Not only would I vigorously object, I simply won't
add a requirement for them to the code I write :-)

DTDs are nice from a descriptive standpoint, but they can't do anything
about the semantics. And since you're processing for semantics, the rules
emboded in a DTD just naturally come along for the ride. There is little
incremental benefit in this scenario.

Cheers,
