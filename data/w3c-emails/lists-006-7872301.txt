I'm answering for myself and a colleague:

1. Have you reviewed all options in the DeltaV protocol specification

Boris: No (Note: last time I read the spec in full its version number was 
in the 10s, but I tracked the changes as discussed on the list)
Colleague: No (But read 12.2)

2. If no, which options have you reviewed?

Boris: Everything except VARIANT and FORK-CONTROL
Colleague: CHECKOUT, UPDATE, VERSION-HISTORY, WORKING-RESOURCE, WORKSPACE, 
MERGE, LABEL, BASELINE

3. If you have implementation experience for one or more options, and can
share this experience, which options have you implemented?

sorry, no comment
