<tim>I had a quick look through the HTTP/1.1 spec, and didn't see anything 
that
states this categorically.  In fact, Section 9.6 (PUT) states:
 "HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an origin
server."
Now, how many clients do a GET just to check what they actually will
retrieve after a successful PUT!</tim>

The reason HTTP/1.1 says this is that the GET and PUT could be to a 
dynamic resource or database query. It is up to the semantics of the 
resource type (MIME type) to determine the meaning of GET and PUT. HTTP 
only says what's on the wire.
