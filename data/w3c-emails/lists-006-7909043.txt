I think having the DTDs is great (XML Schema even better), and they should 
be included in the document along with the notes that Jim W made about 
WebDAV conventions. I used the WebDAV DTDs a lot when developing DAV4J to 
define the objects being passed between the client and server. However, I 
still don't think they should be in any way required by the protocol for 
sending or receiving requests. So I encourage anyone interested to 
contribute to this valuable effort, and would be happy to consider 
including DTDs in the DeltaV spec as long as 1) they don't introduce 
unnecessary issues, and 2) we don't hold up the spec for the details. This 
is probably a refinement that can be applied after proposed draft.
