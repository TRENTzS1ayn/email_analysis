I wasn't talking only about the client that did the put.  The DeltaV
spec ought to state normatively what OTHER clients experience.  I'll
repeat from my earlier mail, my suggested language:

"In core versioning, while a VCR is checked out it may be the target of
multiple write operations.  During this period, other clients MUST still
be able to perform read operations on the VCR's URL, and the results
MUST show the results of all the write operations that have been
performed thus far.  (Note: if a scenario requires hiding a
work-in-progress from other clients, the "working resource" option can
be used.)"
