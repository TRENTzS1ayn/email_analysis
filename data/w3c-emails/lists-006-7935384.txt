I agree, it makes an excellent candidate for another appendix.

Subject:  Re: DTD Confusion (i.e., opportunity)




I think having the DTDs is great (XML Schema even better), and they should
be included in the document along with the notes that Jim W made about
WebDAV conventions. I used the WebDAV DTDs a lot when developing DAV4J to
define the objects being passed between the client and server. However, I
still don't think they should be in any way required by the protocol for
sending or receiving requests. So I encourage anyone interested to
contribute to this valuable effort, and would be happy to consider
including DTDs in the DeltaV spec as long as 1) they don't introduce
unnecessary issues, and 2) we don't hold up the spec for the details. This
is probably a refinement that can be applied after proposed draft.
