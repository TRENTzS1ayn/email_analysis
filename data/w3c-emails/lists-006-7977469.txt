This is a change request - I hope it's not too late:

A compare-baseline REPORT only contains version URLs. This makes it very 
painful to find out what the changes are in terms of the VCRs that are 
exposed by the DAV:baseline-collection. I would like to see, instead of 
version URLs being reported by the DAV:compare-baseline, the VCR URLs from 
the corresponding DAV:baseline-collection(s).

I would propose the following (just for the added-version case, 
deleted-version and changed-version would be similar):

A DAV:added-version element identifies a member of the 
DAV:baseline-collection of the compare baseline version whose 
DAV:checked-in version belongs to a version history from which no version 
is the DAV:checked-in version of a member of the DAV:baseline-collection 
of the request baseline.
<!ELEMENT added-version (href)>
As an alternative, both URLs could be reported (VCR and version URLs).

Boris.
