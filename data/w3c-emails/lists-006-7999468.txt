I'd be happy to see this language in the FAQ
(and strongly encourage Lisa to add it there),
but I think it would be confusing to put something
in the protocol that in effect says "for this resource,
GET and PUT will continue to work as defined in HTTP",
since a natural conclusion would be that we are *not*
guaranteeing that they will do so in other cases.
And we definitely don't want people to reach that
(incorrect) conclusion.

Cheers,
Geoff

Neither was I.  In general the HTTP sever has no way of knowing which
client is sending a PUT/GET request.

Thankfully the spec doesn't get into sessions or whatever for identifying
clients.  It's unnecessary.

I'd be interested to hear if others think that we need to state this.
