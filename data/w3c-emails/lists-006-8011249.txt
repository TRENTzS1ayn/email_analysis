The way we handle the version proliferation problem is to keep a maximum
number of the number of autoversioned versions to keep around.  In a
previous product, we had a limit on the number of "unreleased" (in DeltaV
terms, unlabeled and unbaselined) versions to keep around.

When either count is reached, we start deleting old versions automatically.

No (see above).  To reiterate briefly, I'm trying to avoid a proliferation
of versions created by auto-versioning.  My server would auto-version only
for versioning-unaware clients.  Versioning-aware clients would CHECKOUT,
GET, do all modifications locally on the client, then CHECKIN with the new
content as the CHECKIN request body.  What could be simpler?  I strongly
urge that this model of use be supported by DeltaV.  Note that my server
would reject any PUTS on a checked-out VCR, because it would not implement
my proposed mutable VCR option.

Yes, because of the problem of proliferating versions.
