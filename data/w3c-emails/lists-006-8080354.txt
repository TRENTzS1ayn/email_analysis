It depends how it's defined.  I'd prefer for a "shared"/"global"
property to exist on the VCR only, not on any of the versions.  That's
the easiest way for it to stay in synch across all versions.  Then,
clearly, a LOCK on the VCR would affect the property as well.  A LOCK on
a version would not.

(What is the meaning of a LOCK on a version, anyway?  If versions aren't
mutable???)

Important note:  a "global" property is NOT the same as a "mutable"
property.  A mutable property may exist on versions, may have different
values on different versions, and most importantly, may be changed on a
version without causing a new version to be created.

I strongly feel that BOTH mutable and global properties are required
functionality for many source code and document versioning scenarios.
