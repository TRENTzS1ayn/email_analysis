This might be understood as "If you support LABEL, you must support 
WORKING-RESOURCE as well." I think the section should be hedged by "If the 
server supports the WORKING-RESOURCE option..." so that this 
interpretation is no longer possible.

In Word 2000, you can select all (CTRL-A) and recalculate (F9). After 
this, the status line tells you about bad references. I don't know how to 
find them once you know they are there, though.
