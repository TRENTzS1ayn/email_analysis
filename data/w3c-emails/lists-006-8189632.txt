OK, let's get a bit more disciplined here (:-).
Does anyone else want this change to be made?
By default, it stays the way it is (i.e. version URLs)
unless the working group expresses a clear preference
for making the change.

Note that one could compute the VCR's from the
version URLs by just doing
a Depth PROPFIND for the DAV:checked-in property on
the baseline-collection, and then match up the
version URLs with the
versions from the Depth PROPFIND.

Cheers,
Geoff

Now that we have the DAV:baseline-collection for a baseline,
I agree that this is a much more appropriate value for the
results of this report.  In particular, I'd just return the
VCR URL from the DAV:baseline-collection (you could get the
version URL from the DAV:checked-in property, if you cared).

Does anyone object?

Geoff

   This is a change request - I hope it's not too late:

   A compare-baseline REPORT only contains version URLs. This makes it very 
   painful to find out what the changes are in terms of the VCRs that are 
   exposed by the DAV:baseline-collection. I would like to see, instead of 
   version URLs being reported by the DAV:compare-baseline, the VCR URLs
from 
   the corresponding DAV:baseline-collection(s).

   I would propose the following (just for the added-version case, 
   deleted-version and changed-version would be similar):

   A DAV:added-version element identifies a member of the 
   DAV:baseline-collection of the compare baseline version whose 
   DAV:checked-in version belongs to a version history from which no version

   is the DAV:checked-in version of a member of the DAV:baseline-collection 
   of the request baseline.
   <!ELEMENT added-version (href)>
   As an alternative, both URLs could be reported (VCR and version URLs).

   Boris.
