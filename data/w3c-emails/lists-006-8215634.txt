Assuming that Depth:infinity is not available (a good presumption, given the
use of baselines in the first place as a way to avoid overload), then your
PROPFINDs will take log(N) requests before you find the VCR that corresponds
to version in question.

However, if you return VCR URLs, you can get the VR URL in a single
PROPFIND.
