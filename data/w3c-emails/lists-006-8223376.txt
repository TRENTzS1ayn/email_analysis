   Thanks Geoff!

   This might be understood as "If you support LABEL, you must support 
   WORKING-RESOURCE as well." I think the section should be hedged by "If the 
   server supports the WORKING-RESOURCE option..." so that this 
   interpretation is no longer possible.

Good point.  I will add that hedge to this section.

Cheers,
Geoff
