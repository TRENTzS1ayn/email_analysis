   From: "Fay, Chuck" <CFay@filenet.com>

   Suggested corrections to the spec related to auto-versioning:

   Several sections still talk in terms of the auto-version property
   being "set" and describing behavior in that case, without
   specifying any particular setting of auto-version.  This worked
   when it only had true and false values, since "set" implied the
   true value.  Now that it has four different possible values, the
   use of the verb "set" alone is ambiguous.

Good point.

   For instance, section 2.1.2 overstates the case when it says "A PUT
   or PROPPATCH to a version-controlled resource with the
   DAV:auto-version property set will automatically check out that
   resource prior to executing the PUT or PROPPATCH."  Of the four
   different possible values for auto-version, some do not have the
   prescribed behavior (i.e., never, and when-locked-checkout if the
   VCR is unlocked).  So this needs to be reworded in order to avoid
   oversimplifying and misleading the reader.

I agree.

   For instance, paragraphs 2 and 3 of 2.1.2 could be replaced by the
   following paragraph:

   "For clients that are unaware of versioning semantics, the
   DAV:auto-version property provides for automatic versioning on PUT
   and PROPPATCH methods.  Certain settings of the auto-version
   property on a checked-in version-controlled resource will cause
   that resource to be checked out automatically, prior to executing
   the PUT or PROPPATCH.  With one setting of auto-version, the
   resource is checked back in immediately afterwards, again
   automatically.  This results in a new version immediately after
   each successful PUT or PROPPATCH.  With other settings of
   auto-version, if the resource is write-locked at the time of the
   PUT or PROPPATCH, it will remain checked out for the duration of
   the lock, so that the automatic checkin is delayed until the
   resource is unlocked.  Auto-versioning can also be turned off
   completely.  (See the sections on DAV:auto-version, PUT, PROPPATCH,
   COPY, and UNLOCK for the details on auto-version settings.)"

Thanks for the suggested rewording, Chuck!  It always makes my
life easier to see exactly what you have in mind.

   The above paragraph omits the note that "unlock" includes any way that a
   lock is removed, including lock timeout.  My thinking is that that sort of
   detail should be covered in the section on DAV:auto-version, if necessary.

I agree.

   Also, sections 2.8 and 2.9 have preconditions based on auto-version being
   "set".  They too need to be updated to address specific settings of
   auto-version.  This would clarify one remaining case that is not specified:
   PUT on a checked-in, non-write-locked VCR with auto-version =
   when-locked-checkout.  My understanding from earlier mail is that the PUT
   (or PROPPATCH of a dead property) should fail in this case, but that is not
   clear from the preconditions.

Will fix.

Thanks for catching that ambiguity!

Cheers,
Geoff
