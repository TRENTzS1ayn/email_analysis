The DAV:workspace-collection set is usually the same for a
whole server, so just like the DAV header, there is no need
to query it for more than one resource on a given server.

In contrast, the supported methods and live properties vary
from resource to resource, and therefore are more appropriately
marshalled as a property so that it can easily be retrieved
in a depth fashion with the other information about that resource.

Cheers,
Geoff

Dear Geoff,

My understanding of an option is "does the server support x".  Properties
associate values to keys for a given resource.  Let us take
DAV:workspace-collection-set.  Especially when you say that the http
namespace
can be spread over several servers, the question I ask with this tag is not
do
you support workspaces, rather for a given versionable workspace, where can
I
create a workspace for it?  In other words, I am asking what is the
workspace
area associated with this resource.  That seems to me to be a property of
that
resource, because every resource could answer it differently.

Sincerely,
James
