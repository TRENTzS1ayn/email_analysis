I agree that the duplication of PUT functionality is the
primary objection.

Cheers,
Geoff

p.s. But I don't agree that a secondary
objection concerning the undesireability of using headers
as a method argument extension mechanism is either a
red herring or "unprincipled" (:-).

Marshalling difficulty is a red herring here, and avoids the real issues
concerning the semantics of CHECKIN.

I think the principled answer is that CHECKIN with body duplicates the
functionality of PUT, and this is a bad design.
