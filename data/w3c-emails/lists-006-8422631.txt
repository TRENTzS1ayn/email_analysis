I did post a new model diagram to the web site a few weeks ago,
but it still needs to be fleshed out with details.  Let me know
if you have any trouble reading it.

Cheers,
Geoff

Folks,

Is there an object model diagram or IDL for the most recent Delta-V protocol
specification that you are aware of? If there is one, could you point me to
it. There was such a thing a long time ago that Jim A produced I think.

Thanks

Sankar
