Currently, the relationship that connects a "system" baseline
to its "component" baselines is called the "sub-baseline" relationship.
It's defined in that direction because when a baseline is created
it knows what its "sub-baseline" list is, but the inverse relationship
(i.e. super-baseline) changes over time.

Cheers,
Geoff

It's a super-baseline!
