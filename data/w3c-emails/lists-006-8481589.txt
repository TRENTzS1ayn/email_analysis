Hmm, then this is another area that needs to be fleshed out.  While a
baseline is checked-out, the server automatically maintains the value of the
baseline, right?  This would imply that at any time while a baseline is
checked out, a client could read the value of the DAV:baseline-collection of
the checked-out baseline, and receive an up-to-date, consistent baseline. Is
this correct?

If so, then this sounds like a computed property to me.

Or is it that, when checked-out, there is no DAV:baseline-collection
property, and then when checked-in, this property is created with the
correct value?

Also, just to make sure I'm not really missing the boat -- the intent is
that the client is not responsible for maintaining the value of
DAV:baseline-collection property directly (i.e., by PROPPATCHing this
property), right?

This implies that the DAV:baseline-collection property does not exist when a
baseline is in checked-out state.  Is that correct?

My point was that this says *nothing* about the baseline **history**
resource in the case where a baseline is specified in the request body.  It
specifies what happens to the baseline, and what happens to the
version-controlled configuration, but says nothing about the baseline
history.
