This makes sense to me as well.  If other protocols wish to use the REPORT
method, it would be possible for a server to implement REPORT, and not the
rest of core.  Such a server would advertise the existence of REPORT in the
Allow header returned from an OPTIONS method invocation, or via whatever
additional discovery mechanism the protocol supports. Since REPORT is
definitely required as part of core, it should be in the core section.
