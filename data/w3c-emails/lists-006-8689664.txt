The versioning draft specifies extremely case-by-case response to
OPTIONS.  I think the OPTIONS response in DeltaV can even vary depending
on the state of a resource at one point in time vs. another.

E.g. if a resource can be turned into a "version-controlled resource",
then OPTIONS should show the VERSION-CONTROL method, to indicate that it
can be converted.

Obviously that kind of design presupposes that OPTIONS depends on
precisely what resource is named in the URL.
