Consider that I have two resources:

    /non-vcr-1/vcr-a/foo
    /non-vcr-2/vcr-b/bar

I put both of these resources under baseline control and create a baseline
from them. What does the DAV:baseline-collection collection look like? Does
it include "filler" collections to reach the VCRs that are under baseline
control?

Concretely, would it look something like:

    /BCs/b72/non-vcr-1/vcr-a/foo
    /BCs/b72/non-vcr-2/vcr-b/bar

And would non-vcr-* contain *only* the children necessary to reach the
baselined values? Same applies to "/" -- does it contain just non-vcr-*, or
would /BCs/b72/ contain other bindings?

[ this doesn't apply in the Subversion scenario, so I'm not personally
  worried, but it appears to be a "hole" in the draft. ]

Note that my property proposal would resolve the situation. Each VCR under
baseline control would have a path to its corresponding VCR in the BC. Thus,
the BC could look like:

    /BCs/b72/1/vcr-a/foo
    /BCs/b72/2/vcr-b/bar

(i.e. "1" and "2" are computed as a way to differentiate each disjoint set
of resources)

The paths attached to the "public" VCRs would be:

    /non-vcr-1/       n/a
      vcr-a/          "1/vcr-a"
        foo           "1/vcr-a/foo"
      vcr-b/          "1/vcr-b"
        bar           "1/vcr-b/bar"


Hmm. Actually, to be pedantic, I only put two resources under baseline
control. The BC would thus look like:

    /BCs/b72/1/foo
    /BCs/b72/2/bar
