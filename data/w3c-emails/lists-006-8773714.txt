Actually, the want the relative path within the DAV:baseline-collection (BC)
to the VCR that corresponds to R.

Not sure that I understand this part. Maybe this refers to the situation
that I just described regarding "disjoint" baselines? i.e. we may have some
"filler" collections to reach the VCRs within the BC.

Hmm. Rereading: are you saying that there may be non-versioned resources
(say, parents of "public" VCRs) that are within the baseline? That doesn't
make sense to me. A baseline captures versions of resources. Thus, you can't
have unversioned resources within a baseline.

If I'm given the URL abspath of "/A/B/C/D/E/F/", then what is "the relative
path" and what is the "base" that will correspond to the root of the BC?
Without walking up that tree comparing version histories, I cannot tell.

If I'm within the BC corresponding to the DAV:checked-in value of the
version-controlled collection, then your comment does not apply. The
relative paths must match since the public tree (containing R) is synonymous
with the BC.
[ hmm. maybe not quite. I guess you could have checked out the public tree
  and begun to make changes before making another baseline. ]

If I move to a BC corresponding to a different baseline, then yes: I'd need
an exhaustive search to locate the matching VH.

Agreed, but I'm only considering the "current" baseline (the DAV:checked-in
value of the VCC).

That's just a side benefit that I'm looking for. It is an effect of the
definition, rather than a requirement.

Actually, the bigger problem with relative path appears to be the case where
the public VCRs may have been rearranged since the last baseline was
created. But that might still be okay since the relative-public-path does
not have to equal relative-BC-path.

[ wow. I just noticed that an UPDATE on the VCC can totally stomp all over
  changes within the public area ]
