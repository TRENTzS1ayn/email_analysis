Assuming foo and bar are VCRs themselves.

Yes, this is required for the baseline to capture the namespace of the
configuration.

baselined values?

I'm planning on 'yes', otherwise these would be empty, filler collections
-- not very useful.

only those that were required to reach VCRs.

Agreed.  Though I've not figured out yet how the proposed property works
when the VCR is a member of multiple baseline-controlled collections.

It is an important property of baselines that they capture the namespace of
the configuration, so collapsing the namespace this way into the 'disjoint
sets' would be a Bad Thing.

Two resources?  Then I assume the two resources that you put under baseline
control are 'vcr-a' and 'vcr-b', so the BC would look like this:
               /BCsb72/foo
               /BCs/b88/bar
