Of course :-)

Euh. Baselines capture a set of versions. Who said they capture the layout
of the namespace in which the VCRs appear?

Given my current understanding of baselines, I don't believe your statement
necessarily follows.

Oops. Reset. Somebody changed the definition on me in the past couple months
:-) ... I just read the intro to the baseline section. "... and their names
relative to the collection, ..."

Sigh.

Agreed.

Agreed.

Right. I'm thinking: toss the property proposal, depend upon locate-history.

Seeing the current definition of "baseline" ... I agree.


Okay... so maybe I'll go write a FAQ entry -- non-versioned collections can
appear in a BC as a way to reach the VCRs.
