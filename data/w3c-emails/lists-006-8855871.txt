OK, the WebDAV and DeltaV working group meeting slots have been assigned in
the *Draft* schedule for the Minneapolis IETF.  At present, the meeting
slots are:

WebDAV: Thursday, March 22, 2001: 9AM-11:30AM

DeltaV: Thursday, March 22, 2001: 3:30PM-5:30PM

Please note that the meeting days and times are subject to change (that's
what "Draft" implies), although a change in day would be pretty atypical.
