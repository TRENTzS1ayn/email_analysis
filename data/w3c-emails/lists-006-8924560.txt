Even though we've made it through a couple of last calls, and we're on the 
path to IETF last call and Proposed Standard, I'd still like to schedule 
some design team meetings during IETF 50. How about 3-5pm on Wed to 
prepare for the Working Group meeting, 11-3pm on Thu for detailed 
discussions, and a 9-12 on Fri to followup on any post-Working Group 
issues?
