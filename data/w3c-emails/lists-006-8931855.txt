Subject: Design team meetings at IETF 50



Even though we've made it through a couple of last calls, and we're on the
path to IETF last call and Proposed Standard, I'd still like to schedule
some design team meetings during IETF 50. How about 3-5pm on Wed to prepare
for the Working Group meeting, 11-3pm on Thu for detailed discussions, and a
9-12 on Fri to followup on any post-Working Group issues?
