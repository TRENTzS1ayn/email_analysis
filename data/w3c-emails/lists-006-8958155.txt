Looks like our DeltaV Working Group meeting got moved to Friday 9:00 to 
11:30. So I propose the following new schedule for the DeltaV design team 
meetings:

Thursday   9:00 to 11:30 WebDAV Working Group Meeting
Thursday 11:30 to 5:00 DeltaV Design Team Meeting: Prepare for the Working 
Group meeting and detailed discussion on remaining issues
Friday         9:00 to 11:30 DeltaV Working Group Meeting
Friday       11:30 to 3:00 DeltaV Design Team Meeting: Wrapup and address 
issues that were raised in the Working Group Meeting.

Even though we've made it through a couple of last calls, and we're on the 
path to IETF last call and Proposed Standard, I'd still like to schedule 
some design team meetings during IETF 50. How about 3-5pm on Wed to 
prepare for the Working Group meeting, 11-3pm on Thu for detailed 
discussions, and a 9-12 on Fri to followup on any post-Working Group 
issues?
