Good point.  If you support the workspace option, then the
initial version created by the VERSION-CONTROL request would
be determined by the DAV:current-activity of the workspace,
but without workspaces, you'd probably like a DAV:activity
element in the request body to specify this.

Does anyone object to this being added?

For the follow-on question, I'd be against adding a header to
PUT to allow an activity to be specified, but a server could
certainly fail a CHECKIN attempt that is not accompanied by
an activity.  I personally would not do that, since you are
making your server non-interoperable with a non-activity-aware
client, but that is of course your choice.

Cheers,
Geoff

Under section 11 "ACTIVITY OPTION", I can't find a way to specify an
activity with the VERSION-CONTROL request.

How do I supply an activity to track that a versionable-resource has become
a version-controlled-resource?

A follow-on question to this is...Can a server that supports activities
require that an activity be given to all updates (PUT, CHECKIN, etc.)?

Thanks in advance,
