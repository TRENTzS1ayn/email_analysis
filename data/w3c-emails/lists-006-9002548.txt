Stuart,
WebDAV can be used for dynamic resources, and would provide properties and
(potentially) locking semantics (and in the future access control).
Generally the server would be configured with virtual hosts or directories
that are DAV enabled to distinguish between access to the source of a
dynamic resource vs. its result. So I think WebDAV would be a good fit for
your application if you need to organize your resources in a collection
hierarchy (modeling containment associations), and you need additional
meta-data about the resources stored as WebDAV properties.



Accidentally caught by the spam filter.  I've added Stuart to the accept2
list, so future emails will get sent through to the list.

web interface ?



Can I use this forum to ask a dumb question? Already have....

Say I have a large database of geographic features; points/lines/areas.
All
features have a unique id.  The supply of data to read access clients is
based on a cgi script executing a query and then returning dynamic content.
(e.g. All objects in a given rectangle).

Now I want to give clients the ability to update this database via the web.
One method would be to define lock/transaction interfaces that embed
information within HTTP POST messages. (I think this is termed
RPC-via-POST?).

Perhaps another method would be to use the WebDAV extensions. But reading
the WebDAV information on the web it isn't clear if WebDAV can be used for
dynamic web pages - it all seems geared-up for editing of text pages. Am I
barking up the wrong tree in looking at WebDAV?

Out of my depth but not drowning yet,

Stuart Connelly
