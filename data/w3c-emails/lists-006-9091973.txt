How is a client with full activity support intended to know what a valid
activity name is without much trial-and-error?  I was hoping for something
like:
   MKACTIVITY * HTTP/1.1

This way the client can programmatically maintain the activity information
and the end-user could perform simple routines like: "new activity" and
"done with activity" without concern about coming up with a valid activity
identifier.

Since the client is already aware of the DAV/activity-enabled part of a
URL, couldn't it be used without the additional activity location since the
activity location is not handled by a separate handler, right?

So if the URL http://repo.webdav.org/test-23 and "/" is
DAV/activity-enabled, then could the request be something like this?

   MKACTIVITY /test-23 HTTP/1.1
   Host: repo.webdav.org
   Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
   Content-Length: long

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
   <D:mkactivity xmlns:D="DAV:">
     <D:activity-collection-set>
        <D:automatic/>
     </D:activity-collection-set>
   </D:mkactivity>

Is the additional XML really needed if the server would "assume" that the
client meant for the server to specify the correct collection?

Thanks,
Steve

P.S. Your responses to my newbie questions are greatly appreciated.
