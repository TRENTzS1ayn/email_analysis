One final comment *hopefully* ;-)

I guess my example was too simple (and wrong perhaps).  In order for a
client to find out what activity-collection to use it must first issue an
OPTIONS request with a given URL, say http://repo.dav/dav/ and gets the
property DAV:activity-collections-set.  Why couldn't I form a request,
like:
   MKACTIVITY /dav/* HTTP/1.1

And get the response (implicity do an OPTIONS request to get
DAV:activity-collections-set):
   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Location: http://repo.dav/dav/act/123
?
Or am I completely wrong in thinking it would be a valid operation of a
activity-enabled server to assign an activity identifier using MKACTIVITY?
Most bug-tracking servers have an option/configuration to automatically
assign a number but I'm trying to determine if this is outside the scope of
this protocol.

Thanks again,
Steve
