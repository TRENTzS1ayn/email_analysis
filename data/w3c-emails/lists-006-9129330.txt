As for draft-14, it's available in text form at the ietf internet
drafts site, but you are correct that I have neglected to upload
it to the deltav web site ... (sorry about that!).
I will do so as soon as IT restores
our internet connection (which has been down all day ...!).

Cheers,
Geoff

Yes, I guess it should -- at least to indicate the valid VERSION-CONTROL
body elements.

p.s.  You're not the first person to refer to a draft -14, so how is it
that I only see a -13 on the delta-v webpage?  Did I miss something?
