If it was "checked out" with a LOCK (server doesn't support, or client 
didn't use CHECKOUT), then yes. Otherwise no. There are other properties 
that can be used to determine if a resource is checked out.


Given a VCR that has been checked-out by userA. userB's versioning unaware
client performs a PROPFIND of DAV:lockdiscovery on that VCR.  Should the
DAV:lockdiscovery value be the same as if userA had performed a LOCK
request?

Thanks,
Steve
