I guess I wasn't too clear...

UserA performs a CHECKOUT on a VCR.
UserB performs a PROPFIND of DAV:lockdiscovery to determine if the resource
is "locked" (since the client is versioning unaware, ie only a class 2 DAV
client)

What will DAV:lockdiscovery be?

If UserB's client is unaware of the DAV:checked-out property, then how will
they know it is "locked"?

Thanks,
Steve
