Steve,
If UserA does a CHECKOUT, the resource won't be locked, it will just be 
checked out. PROPFIND on DAV:lockdiscovery won't show any locks to anyone. 
Now UserB doesn't know anything about versioning. If UserB just looks for 
locks and upon not finding any assumes the resource is writable, the write 
will fail because the resource is already checked out. LOCK will also fail 
for the same reason, it tries to do an implicit checkout. We assume that 
versioning unaware clients are not DAV unaware. That is, they can use 
PROPFIND and look at properties, including properties that indicate 
something is checked out. Its actually the user that's interperting this 
information, not the client. The client doesn't have to support any 
versioning specific protocol to access these properties. Although such 
clients make their users do extra work.





I guess I wasn't too clear...

UserA performs a CHECKOUT on a VCR.
UserB performs a PROPFIND of DAV:lockdiscovery to determine if the 
resource
is "locked" (since the client is versioning unaware, ie only a class 2 DAV
client)

What will DAV:lockdiscovery be?

If UserB's client is unaware of the DAV:checked-out property, then how 
will
they know it is "locked"?

Thanks,
Steve
