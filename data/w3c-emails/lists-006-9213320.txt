That's impossible. Many clients won't show properties that they're not aware
of.  C.F. Web Folders.

  Steve,
  If UserA does a CHECKOUT, the resource won't be locked, it will just be
checked out. PROPFIND on DAV:lockdiscovery won't show any locks to anyone.
Now UserB doesn't know anything about versioning. If UserB just looks for
locks and upon not finding any assumes the resource is writable, the write
will fail because the resource is already checked out. LOCK will also fail
for the same reason, it tries to do an implicit checkout. We assume that
versioning unaware clients are not DAV unaware. That is, they can use
PROPFIND and look at properties, including properties that indicate
something is checked out. Its actually the user that's interperting this
information, not the client. The client doesn't have to support any
versioning specific protocol to access these properties. Although such
clients make their users do extra work.





  I guess I wasn't too clear...

  UserA performs a CHECKOUT on a VCR.
  UserB performs a PROPFIND of DAV:lockdiscovery to determine if the
resource
  is "locked" (since the client is versioning unaware, ie only a class 2 DAV
  client)

  What will DAV:lockdiscovery be?

  If UserB's client is unaware of the DAV:checked-out property, then how
will
  they know it is "locked"?

  Thanks,
  Steve
