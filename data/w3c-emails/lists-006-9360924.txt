Not completely efficient... it adds a round trip.

With the Label header, I can "redirect through" the VCR and operate against
the Version Resource. Using the report, I send one request to run the report
and get the VR, then a second request to operate against the VR.

What would be really neat is a way to specify a label within an
expand-property report. For my particular use-case, that would collapse a
whole sequence of PROPFINDs into a single report. Is there any interest in
allowing this? (i.e. should I propose a syntax?)
