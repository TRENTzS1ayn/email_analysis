I'd be tempted to not add this yet ... if you are just asking about one
resource, then an extra round trip is not very significant.  If you are
faking baselines with labels, then we are recommending that you just
expose this as baselines (which have a baseline-collection property that
you can run the standard property report against).

If in practice we find this extra round trip to be prohibitively
expensive, we could always extend the property report later (but
looking at the extra syntax now would be a good way to confirm that
we could easily add it later).

Cheers,
Geoff

   Not completely efficient... it adds a round trip.

   With the Label header, I can "redirect through" the VCR and operate against
   the Version Resource. Using the report, I send one request to run the report
   and get the VR, then a second request to operate against the VR.

   What would be really neat is a way to specify a label within an
   expand-property report. For my particular use-case, that would collapse a
   whole sequence of PROPFINDs into a single report. Is there any interest in
   allowing this? (i.e. should I propose a syntax?)

   Cheers,
