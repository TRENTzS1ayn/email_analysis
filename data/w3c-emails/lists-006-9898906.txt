I guess that picking the DAV:root-version is the obvious choice from a
protocol-writer's perspective since it is well defined in the spec.  It
also provides behavior that is predictable by the client since they know
the root version.  However, it would seem to me that clients would 99.9% of
the time have to UPDATE / MERGE all of the version-controlled resources
created using this rule.

How do you feel about making the new version-controlled resources have a
DAV:checked-in of the (chronologically) latest version instead?
I have no great desire for this, but just think it may be more client
friendly.

Tim
