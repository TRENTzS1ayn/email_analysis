The spec only requires that /v2 be added ... it doesn't require
that /v1 be retained.  So I'd say this is at the server's discretion.

Cheers,

Suppose version /v2 is a descendant of version /v1, and that
version-controlled resource /vcr's DAV:merge-set property value is
<href>/v1</href>. Now the server receives a request

MERGE /vcr 
<source><href>/v2</href></source>

Is the server allowed to set /vcr's DAV:merge-set property value to
<href>/v2</href> instead of <href>/v1</href><href>/v2</href> because it
understands that /v2 is a descendant of /v1?
