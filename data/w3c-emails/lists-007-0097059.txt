Hi,

The <DAV:displayname> of the activity could be set to the URL defined in 
the client request. I.e. for the sample given below <DAV:displayname> of 
the activity would be 
/act/test-23

But still my question is open if it would be legal that the server moves 
the activity permanently directly on creation ...

regards
Matthias

   Betreff: server defined activity URLs
   
   
   Hi,
   
   suppose we want to implement a distributed DeltaV server which allows
   propagation 
   between workspaces residing on different servers. In order 
   to ensure unique
   activity names
   (needed to ensure activity URL uniqueness if activities are also
   distributed) in this scenario 
   we would like to have server defined activity URLs.
   
   Would it be DeltaV compliant to achieve that by using the 
   response defined 
   in section "10.3.2 301 Moved Permanently" of the HTTP 1.1 
   spec (rfc2616) ?
   
      >>REQUEST
   
        MKACTIVITY /act/test-23 HTTP/1.1
        Host: repo.webdav.org
        Content-Length: 0
   
   instead of
   
      >>RESPONSE
   
        HTTP/1.1 201 Created
        Cache-Control: no-cache
   
   we would like to use
   
      >>RESPONSE
   
        HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
        Location: /act/test-23-9C0BC5DA776811D5B3490001021DCD13
        Cache-Control: no-cache
   
        <HTML body containing href to new URL>
   
   regards
   Matthias
