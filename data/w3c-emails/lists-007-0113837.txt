So, PROPFIND with DEPTH=1 for working collection will return set of
version histories, not VCR, right?

Ok, there are some other things not clear to me in the example above.
So what happens after
   MOVE /repo/wr/wr1/foo.txt  /repo/wr/wr2/foo.txt
(assuming that foo.txt belongs to the version history /repo/vh/vh1)
   
   
Binding to MOVE /repo/vh/vh1 is removed from  /repo/wr/wr1
and is added to /repo/wr/wr2, isn't it?
Then, let's say, we checkin /repo/wr/wr1. The VCR foo.txt should be
removed, right?
Then we checkin /repo/wr/wr2. The VCR with name foo.txt referring to
the history /repo/vh/vh1 should be created, right?
But which version this VCR should select in its DAV:checked-in property?
The obvious answer - the same as was selected by foo.txt VCR
before MOVE. But working collection contains only bindings to versions
histories, so there is no way to store information about checked-in
version.

And one more obscure item for me: if we perform MOVE from versioned
collection to not-versioned collection. Is it allowed operation?
What is the result of such operation? For example:

   MOVE /repo/wr/wr1/foo.txt /new.txt

Should new.txt be a new resource (with new resource ID and the same
content as cehcked-in version of foo.txt)? Or it should be foo.txt VCR
itself? Then what is the value of DAV:displayname property of this
resource?
