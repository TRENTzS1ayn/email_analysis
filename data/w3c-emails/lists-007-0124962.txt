   So, PROPFIND with DEPTH=1 for working collection will return set of
   version histories, not VCR, right?

Right.

   Ok, there are some other things not clear to me in the example above.
   So what happens after
      MOVE /repo/wr/wr1/foo.txt  /repo/wr/wr2/foo.txt
   (assuming that foo.txt belongs to the version history /repo/vh/vh1)
   Binding to MOVE /repo/vh/vh1 is removed from  /repo/wr/wr1
   and is added to /repo/wr/wr2, isn't it?

Yes.

   Then, let's say, we checkin /repo/wr/wr1. The VCR foo.txt should be
   removed, right?

Yes (from /somedir).

   Then we checkin /repo/wr/wr2. The VCR with name foo.txt referring to
   the history /repo/vh/vh1 should be created, right?

Yes (in /otherdir).

   But which version this VCR should select in its DAV:checked-in property?

It's up to the server.

   The obvious answer - the same as was selected by foo.txt VCR
   before MOVE. But working collection contains only bindings to versions
   histories, so there is no way to store information about checked-in
   version.

That's correct.  One way a server could know to do the expected thing
would be if both working collections were in the same activity, and
the user checked in the activity as a whole.  In this case, the
server could remember information about VCR checked-in versions,
and use those as the versions when creating a new VCR.

Note that this is only an issue with working collections.  With
checked-out version-controlled collections, the MOVE actually moves
the VCR, so the DAV:checked-in value just goes along for the ride.

   And one more obscure item for me: if we perform MOVE from versioned
   collection to not-versioned collection. Is it allowed operation?

Depends on the server.  I would expect that most servers would not
support this, but they certainly could do so.

   What is the result of such operation? For example:

      MOVE /repo/wr/wr1/foo.txt /new.txt

   Should new.txt be a new resource (with new resource ID and the same
   content as cehcked-in version of foo.txt)? Or it should be foo.txt VCR
   itself? Then what is the value of DAV:displayname property of this
   resource?

RFC-3253 requires that a MOVE keep all the RFC-3253 defined
properties, so such a MOVE would have to expose the version history
resource itself at the new location (not a new resource, and not a
VCR).  It's DAV:displayname would be whatever was the DAV:displayname
of the VCR before the MOVE.  A server is likely to restrict the location
of version history resources to be in working collections and its
original server-defined location, which is why such MOVE's are
unlikely to be supported.
