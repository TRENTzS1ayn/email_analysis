Hi all,
my repository wants to have some information when I create a new
version.
So I would like to put a resource under version control like this:

VERSION-CONTROL /test.html HTTP/1.1
Host: work.edgarschwarz.de
Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
Content-Length: xxxx

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<version-control xmlns="DAV:">
<creator-displayname>Edgar Schwarz</creator-displayname>
<comment>This is a comment for a version</comment>
</version-control>

This also would apply to CHECKIN and BASELINE_CONTROL naturally.
Or should I do a PROPPATCH for creator-displayname and comment before
VERSION-CONTROL ?

Cheers, Edgar
