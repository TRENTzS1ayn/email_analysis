As I understand it, the precondition will prevent that a resource
can have dead properties of the same name as a deltav live property.

So, on a deltav compliant server, you cannot retrieve or set the
property DAV:version-history on a non-VCR resource (e.g. plain,
unversioned resource of RFC 2518 style).

A server, just followin 2518, would allow the setting of such
a property. It would be a dead properties without any meaning,
but returned on a PROPFIND nevertheless.
