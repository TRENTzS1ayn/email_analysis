The protocol currently does not support property initialization
in the VERSION-CONTROL method, so you'd have to PROPPATCH it
after the resource was created.  Note that there are three different
resources, each with their own DAV:creator-displayname and DAV:comment,
i.e. the VCR, the version history, and the initial version.
The VCR would contain the DAV:creator-displayname and DAV:comment
of the unversioned resource (i.e. the VERSION-CONTROL request does not
change those properties).  The initial value for those properties of
the new version history and the new initial version is server defined.
The protocol only defines what happens with dead properties.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi all,
my repository wants to have some information when I create a new
version.
So I would like to put a resource under version control like this:

VERSION-CONTROL /test.html HTTP/1.1
Host: work.edgarschwarz.de
Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
Content-Length: xxxx

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<version-control xmlns="DAV:">
<creator-displayname>Edgar Schwarz</creator-displayname>
<comment>This is a comment for a version</comment>
</version-control>

This also would apply to CHECKIN and BASELINE_CONTROL naturally.
Or should I do a PROPPATCH for creator-displayname and comment before
VERSION-CONTROL ?

Cheers, Edgar
