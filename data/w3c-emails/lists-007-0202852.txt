This is server defined.  In general,
the ACL on a copy can be a combination of the ACL that
a new resource at the Destination would have, with the ACL of the source
on the copy.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

When you copy a resource that have an aAccess Control List (for example,
that denies write for all users), does its copy have the same ACL ?

Thanx
