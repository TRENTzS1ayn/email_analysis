Geoff,
If I understand this correct, then a PROPFIND with DEPTH=1 on the working
collection /repo/wr/wr1 would return the URL:
/repo/vh/vh1

However, in another thread ("Relative URLs, Multiple Bindings") you replied
that URLs returned must be relative to the parent. To quote:

"My reading of 2518 is that it MUST return URLs that are relative to
the parent (e.g. A/B/x and A/B/y)."

Do we have a contradiction here or am I missing out something.

   So, PROPFIND with DEPTH=1 for working collection will return set of
   version histories, not VCR, right?

Right.
