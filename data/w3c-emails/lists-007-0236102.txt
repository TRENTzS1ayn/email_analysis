   Is the version history resource a webdav collection?

Not necessarily (a server could make it be one though).

   I could not find out RFC 3253 specifically mentioning this.

That is correct.  It is a server implementation decision.

   However, in most of the examples in the RFC, resource paths are specified
in
   such a way as to indicate that the version history resource as a
collection.

   Example: http://repo.webdav.org/his/23/ver/32

   Here it looks like "ver" is a member of the collection /his/73

There are three possibilities in this case:
-1- "ver" is a member of /his/23
-2- /his/23 is not a WebDAV compliant resource
-3- /his/23/ver is not a WebDAV compliant resource
It is up to the server which one to pick.  The most likely choices are
either -3- or -1-.  (The reason I expect -2- to be less likely is that
would mean the version history resource is not a WebDAV compliant resource,
which is certainly legal, but a bit strange).

   If version history is a collection, then why do we need the
DAV:version-set
   property? Because, we can still achieve the same by a PROPFIND with depth
1
   on the version history (or rather on /his/23/ver in the above example).

Yes, but that wouldn't provide an interoperable solution, unless we
also required that the versions are the *only* members of the version
history resource.  A server might want to give a version history other
members beyond the "ver" member.

   If its not so, then it means that we are returning a URL to which we
cannot
   browse to i.e., the version URL is not a webdav-compliant URL?

I consider that unlikely (that is choice -2-), but it is possible.

Cheers,
Geoff
