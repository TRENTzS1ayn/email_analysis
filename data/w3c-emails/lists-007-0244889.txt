Hi,

in RFC3253, A.18 Checked-Out Version-Controlled Configuration the
supported methods are defined as:

-  all version-controlled configuration methods.

In this case it looks like, for example, CHECKIN method is not supported
by a checked-out versin-controlled configuration.

I think that what is missing here is:
-  all checked-out version controlled resource methods.

Regards
Sasha
