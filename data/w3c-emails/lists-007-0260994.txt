May I encourage everyone who has read the spec to contribute to the Delta-V
FAQ.  The aim is to capture the answers that you found counter-intuitive,
required further explanation, or were simply not covered in the
specification.

The FAQ is at http://www.webdav.org/deltav/faq  -- and anyone can
contribute.

Regards,
Tim
