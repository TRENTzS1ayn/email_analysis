Thanks for pointing me at the issues page. I was just working from the
RFC as given at ietf.org, and it doesn't have any corrections listed
for 2518.

I've notified the editors of that site, so hopefully they'll add some
relevant errata entries and no-one else'll get caught by that.

(goes to read rest of issues...)
