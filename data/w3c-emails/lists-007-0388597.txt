I agree it is a bug, but I believe the bug is
having checked-out version-controlled resource
and checked-out version-controlled configuration
categories.

We should have just defined version-controlled
resource to inherit from checked-out resource
and directly introduce the checked-in properties
and methods to version-controlled resource,
and deleted the checked-out vcr and checked-out vcc
categories.

Cheers,
Geoff

I agree, this is a bug.

I'll start an errata page and post it on the delta-v website.

Thanks
