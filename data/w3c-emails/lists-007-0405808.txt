Okay, so it seems to be okay to request the following (D: and <> dropped
:-) :

REPORT
version-tree
prop
version-name
creator-displayname
creationdate
comment

In 12.6.1 we see:
BASELINE-CONTROL
baseline-control
href

Shouldn't this be (See 12.6) ?
BASELINE-CONTROL
baseline-control
baseline
href


Then I'm looking for some reports. 
First I would like to have information on a baseline. How can I get the
list of
versions and subbaselines ?
Second I want to have information on a configuration. This means state
(checked-out,
checked-in) and a list of VCRs, VCCs and their states.

BTW, after a recent post I had a first look at our FAQ and was surprised
to see that it's
a faq-o-matiq. That's very nice. I recently also installed a faq-o-matic
at work.
I also don't mind having 2518 properties listed. It's more compact than
in 2518 itself I guess.

I also twice read negative things on WebDAV recently. It was considered
a security risk.
But it wasn't clear whether WebDAV itself was the target or faulty
implementations.
I hope ACL (which I didn't have the time to follow) will cure these
problems.

Cheers, Edgar
