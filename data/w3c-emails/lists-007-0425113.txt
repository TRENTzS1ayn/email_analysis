Hi,

given a collection "/a" and a VCR "/a/b", where "/a/b" has a version
"/versions/b/1" with a label "labeltest", what would I expect from a

PROPFIND /a
Depth: 1
Label: labeltest

?

According to section 8, the label header should only be applied when the
request URL is a VCR (which isn't the case here). However, a

PROPFIND /a/b
Depth: 0
Label: labeltest

*would* take the label header into account.

This would make the PROPFIND results for /a/b depend on which is the request
URL for the PROPFIND, which definitively doesn't seem to be desirable.

(A similar problem applies to COPY with depth > 0).

Julian
