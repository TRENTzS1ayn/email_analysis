I think it breaks a very basic assumption about PROPFIND's depth handling:
for a given collection member, you will get the same response element for
depth:1 on it's parent and depth:0 for a PROPFIND on itself.

What's the motivation for this change? Currently I can't think of a reason,
and it certainly makes it harder to come up for consistent variant handling
in WebDAV.
