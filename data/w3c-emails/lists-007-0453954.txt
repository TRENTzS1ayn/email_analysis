Wait, maybe I didn't make it clear.  The label: header applies to the
version-controlled resource identified by the request-URL; and then the
depth operation proceeds on the labelled *version*.  The only version with
members is a versioned collection, whose members are version histories.

It is a short-hand for referencing the version associated with a
version-controlled resource.
