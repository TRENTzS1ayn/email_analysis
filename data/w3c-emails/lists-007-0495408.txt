No, the label: header does not apply to the members of the collection, just
the request-URI resource.  It behaves the same way as the Depth: header of
RFC2518, i.e. Depth: 1 only applies to the method at the request-URI
resource and not recursively to the members.

No, it will be ignored for the target of the method, and ignored for the
members of the collection.
