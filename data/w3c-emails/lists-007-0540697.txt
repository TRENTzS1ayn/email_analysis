How is it different to the Depth: header?  Ignoring the fact that Depth: 0
and Depth: infinity degenerate into the 'right thing'.

Rather than decide whether it should be different from the handling of a
"accept-*" header, we should agree on what is the most useful definition.
Unless you are suggesting that this difference makes it
impossible/difficult to implement, and I don't think that it does.

So, I think the reason it is the way it is, is so that the results of the
depth operation conform to the definition of multistatus, i.e. that the
results are related by collection membership.

"the multistatus XML element for a collection resource with member URIs
MUST include a response XML element for each member URI of the collection,
to whatever depth was requested"

If the label: applied to each member of the version-controlled collection,
then the results would be a set of versions that were not related by
membership.
