Well I've read the definition of a variant, and a version is certainly not
a variant of a version-controlled resource.   And I've read the definition
of the vary: header and it talks about the cache-ability of the result.
What am I missing?

If DeltaV implies that a version is a variant of a version-controlled
resource then that must be fixed.
