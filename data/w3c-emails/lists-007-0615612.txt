And since the errata document is being maintained on a WebDAV
site, and since WebDAV provides locking support, Tim and I did
not waste our time updating the same document twice ... isn't
it great to have a protocol that supports distributed authoring? (:-).

Cheers,
Geoff

Yes -- looks like that may have been introduced during the final editing
pass.
I'll add it to the errata document
(http://www.webdav.org/deltav/protocol/rfc3253-issues-list.htm).

Regards,
Tim
