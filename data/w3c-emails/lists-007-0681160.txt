Interesting point, but does RFC2616 say that deleting a resource must delete
all it's variants if those have separate URIs (returned as
content-location)?

If this would be the case, I would conclude that using the Label header so
select a version upon GET is a violation of RFC2616.

Well, that's not supported by RFC2616. Either it *selects* the version (then
it is a variant by definition), or it causes an HTTP redirect. I don't think
you can have both.
