From your example below I see that you envisage the hrefs being those of the
version-controlled resource (even though the properties come from the
labelled version).

This is too confusing.  Al the existing code that people write to associate
the href with the properties would have to be re-written as the reported
properties are from a different resource to the href.

Agreed -- I think we specify a Location: header, but whatever (i.e. resource
location, not content location).

Agreed.

Can I hedge on the vary: header in the response?  Given that the GET cache
may be invalidated by the resource /a/b coming under version control, and
acquiring a label, I may be inclined to believe that we should return a vary
header for every label: request for a version-controlled or versionable
resource.

No.  I think the href must be for the version resource selected by the
label, not the version-control resource at the request-URI.

...and I say it shouldn't apply to members, otherwise the result will
contain properties from resources that are not in the same collection
membership hierarchy, and thereby contravene 2518 (as well as complicate the
result enourmously).
