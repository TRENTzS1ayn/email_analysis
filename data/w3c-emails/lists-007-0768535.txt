That's not the only problem we're discussing. Some more:

- what happens if the collection isn't versioned?

- is the entity returned upon GET/Label on a VCR a variant of the VCR? HTTP
says: yes, by definition.

I don't have any problem with this, as long as we can agree on consistent
behaviour for the case where the request URI is a non-version-controlled
collection.
