I think the situation is as follows: regarding the label header, RFC3253
defines a behaviour for GET that clearly makes the selected version a
variant of the VCR (according to RFC2616). No matter what RFC3253 says, GET
is defined by RFC2616. If a server exposes behaviour for GET that makes a
resource a variant according to the text of RFC2616, it *is* a variant (no
matter what another RFC says). If "the other" RFC says it isn't a variant,
it clearly breaks the HTTP protocol.

That aside, why are you so opposed to this interpretation?
