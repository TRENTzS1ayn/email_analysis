Do XP and OS X really do the same thing`?

1) Regarding Mac OS X, the problem may be caused by the Mac OS File System
Calls that allow "exchanging" file contents [1], which AFAIK is used for
Save operations in traditional Mac applications. Maybe we just need to wait
for the Apple programmers to add limited RFC3253 support to fix this
problem.

2) Regarding the XP redirector: well, it's full of bugs anyway, and
Microsoft doesn't seem to consider this an issue.
