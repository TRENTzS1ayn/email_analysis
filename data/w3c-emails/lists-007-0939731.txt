Hi Stefan,
why are you so pessimistic ?
I would assume that most "safe save" algorithms will have a recognizable
pattern
like MOVE a -> b, PUT a, DELETE b.
So a clever autoversioning server could assume that b was a temporary file
which
can be thrown away (Also deleting the autoversioned history) and
autoversion a.
Or is this assuming too much and the behaviour can also be expected in the
wild
by a DeltaV client ?

Mit freundlichen Gr??en / Best regards

Edgar Schwarz

If the client first does a MOVE, then I agree there's not
much an auto-versioning server could reasonably do.

Just for interests sake, what is the motivation for
those libraries to do a <MOVE-to-temp1, PUT-to-temp2,
MOVE-to-real, DELETE-temp1> instead of the simpler
<PUT-to-temp, MOVE-temp-to-actual> ?

Cheers,
Geoff

First the good news: if you have a shell on OSX and do a
cp test.txt to /Volumes/dav/test.txt
where "dav" is a WebDAV mounted volumes, the webdav code
in OSX does basically a LOCK/PUT/UNLOCK on an existing
test.txt. So (auto)versioning will do the job.

However if you use the Finder or any Carbon/Cocoa Application,
some library code will do (on save in the GUI):
1) MOVE /Volumes/dav/test.txt /Volumes/dav/test~.txt
2) PUT  /Volumes/dav/data1234.txt
3) MOVE /Volumes/dav/data1234.txt /Volumes/dav/test.txt
4) DELETE /Volumes/dav/test~.txt

(modulo LOCK/UNLOCK)

I see no chance to keep any versioning on text.txt.
