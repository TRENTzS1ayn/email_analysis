I forgot to state a precondition: The client is telling who it is in the
HTTP request.
If this is wrong please stop reading :-)

If you know the client you probably can make a very educated guess.

Naturally, this just would mean that you have to delete the version history
you just created.

I agree that the situation can become messy. What I just want to say is:
IF the client which is causing the problem with an autoversioning server
doesn't hide it's identity
AND IF the solution to forbid this client write access isn't acceptable
THEN it could be possible to give it some special treatment by recognizing
certain request patterns.

Mit freundlichen Gr??en / Best regards
