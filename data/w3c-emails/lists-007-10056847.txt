Thanks for your review - first I have a meta question: In #2 what kind of
metadata do you mean? In case you mean the old feature discovery exchange
mechanism defined in PEP then I fully agree with you. If you mean the
extension instance parameters then I would not consider that metadata but
call parameters of a particular instance.

With respect to #3, is it that you consider a central registry sufficient
or is it the name space prefix model you are referring to? Note, however,
that as a policy neutral specification, there is nothing that prevents an
extension from being open or to be the design of multiple organizations
and/or commercial companies. This is fully up to the designers of that
particular extension.

The main purpose is to define a mechanism that allows for graceful
deployment of new extensions locally as well as globally without requiring
that two peers have complete knowledge about each others capabilities.

The HTTP extension draft in fact does separate instance data from metadata
- it simply doesn't define a mechanism for handling the latter
independently of instance data.

Thanks!
