On second reading, I realize that "metadata" is too strong a word (I have
to admit reading it with PEP tinted glasses the first time) :), and that
you're probably right that the rest is necessary to solve the namspace
clashing problem (#3).  Now, whether #1 and #3 should be solved in the same
draft is another discussion....

I can see the benefits of trying to extend the XML model to HTTP.  However,
I'd like to see how things pan out with XML namespaces before retrofitting
that model into HTTP.

A side question:  if this becomes a proposed recommendation, what do you
think will be the first application that uses this?  I ask this because I'm
wondering if there's something waiting in the wings for the completion of
this spec, and to get a good feel for a good application of this.
