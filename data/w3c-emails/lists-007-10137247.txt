Actually, the HTTP extension framework namespace model has been there for
quite some time - remember that the basic idea of this proposal goes back a
while.

There are several applications that are waiting/potential candidates for
HTTP extensions (no endorsement from my side on whether these extensions
are good or not).

* Integrating TIP in HTTP - Yaron wrote up a draft some time ago regarding
this. It has expired now but you can find it at [3].

* The W3C P3P [1] intends to use it for sending privacy agreements over the
wire

* The work going on in the conneg area with respect to CCPP [2]

* The WIRE draft [4] (although a highly revised version is soon to be sent
out this is still valid), which is a mechanism for exchanging generic
metadata in HTTP

* Negotiating new transport filters like TLS, compression, etc. would be an
obvious use of the extension framework. Rohit wrote a draft on how to use
the upgrade header but the extension framework is really a superset of the
upgrade header. [5]

And then of course there is Larry Masinter's infamous HTCPCP [6].

I am aware of others but will leave it to the extension designers to
announce this. This has nothing to do with W3C work, it's just that I don't
know how and when they prefer to announce their work.
