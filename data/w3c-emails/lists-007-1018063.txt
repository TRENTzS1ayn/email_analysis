Since this is a fairly significant change, I'd like to
hear from a few more folks before adding this to the 3253 Errata.

Thanks,
Geoff

Yes. But I think it's Tim's turn to say whether this would work for him or
not...

As stated before, I think that's not the single problem. Having GET return a
(representation of a) version rather than (a representation of) the VCR
makes the version *by definition* a variant (representation) of the VCR --
and it seems that most of us want to avoid that interpretation.

...and also use DAV:supported-live-property-set to discover the
DAV:label-name-set property.
