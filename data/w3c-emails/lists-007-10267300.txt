Hi Anup,

Thanks for the comments - I am just about wrapping up a new revision which
I hope to submit today.

I have just done exactly this!

It's for extending the declaration, not for passing extension instance
data. This has been made clear in the new revision.

They are by definition optional which makes sense when you know that they
are not part of the extension itself but of the extension declaration. This
has also been  clarified.

ok.

Depends on what you mean by "discard" - it is OK for the client to save it
as long as it doesn't try to interpret the response. I don't think it
matters here really.

All it says is that the request could not be fulfilled but it doesn't
provide any information to as why. However, the requirement is that the
server sends back enough information so that the client at least has a
mechanism for trying again. However, as has been discussed, it is hard for
the extension framework to know extensions are to be used and it is
therefore left to the extensions and the server to describe what is needed
in order to access the resource.

Thanks!
