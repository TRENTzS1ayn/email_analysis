I have now submitted a new revision of the HTTP extension draft. You can
get it from

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/ietf-http-ext/

and of course from IETF ID listing when it has gone through.

>From the page above, you can also find a diff version (PS) from the
previous version.

Thanks to all of you who have commented - I definitely think the draft has
improved!

Comments are welcome!

Henrik
