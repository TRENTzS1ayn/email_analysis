The IETF meetings tend to become too large, creating
logistics and planning problems. I suggest that future
meetings are held for two weeks, with applications and user
services issues the first week, and all other issues the
second week. Those who so wish could attend both weeks, and
other people could attend only one week. Those who choose
to attend both weeks would be able to cover more groups and
do better liaisons between the different areas. The Friday
of the first week could discuss applications issues which
might be of special interest to the other areas, and the
Monday of the second week would schedule other groups which
might be of special interest to applications people, so
some people could attend Monday-Monday or Friday-Friday.
