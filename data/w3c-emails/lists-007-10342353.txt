I have to agree with this one. If there were a document I could point to
and say that the recommended way of doing error codes can be found here
it would save me huge amounts of time with in house one shot protocols
in terms of educating people about what works and what doesn't work.

A good example is the constant re-use of RFC821's response codes. If
that itself were brought up to date and re-released on its own it would
do alot to help new protocol writers....
