Even with Chris's excellent charter which I think does a great job of
restricting rat holes a core protocol WG would still be more appropriate for
the IRTF than the IETF. In my opinion the IETF's job is to clean up the mess
left behind by the innovators. That means we follow, we do not lead. As such
I strongly encourage outside efforts like HTTP-NG who will blaze a trail
that the IETF can later follow and standardize.

However, a WG to identify common issues and equally common solutions would
provide crucial guidance for application protocol standards writers and be
very much in line with the IETF's work. For example, such a "common issues"
WG might produce a document which made it mandatory for all new application
protocols to explicitly address issues such as: Extensibility (Provide clear
rules on what to do with unrecognized protocol elements - ignore or fail?),
NAT/Proxy/Firewall support, caching, connection oriented vs. non-connection
oriented, TCP vs. UDP, reliable vs. unreliable multicast, etc. These
requirements would be in line with current requirements regarding support
for Y2k friendly dates, internationalization and general security. Just
producing a list of the most common issues would be a great accomplishment.
It would be a valuable guide for reviewers and ADs to use when evaluating
new protocols.
