I think it would be a good idea.  A quick read of the straw charter 
shows it contains those things that I can think of off the top of my 
head.  I also think that, while this could be very useful effort, it 
could also degenerate and thus needs a tight reign on scope.  The 
work should definitely be done in steps:


    1.  Identify common problems
    2.  Identify solutions used in various protocols
    3.  Analyze solutions: what elements worked, what didn't
    4.  Publish informational document
    5.  Identify core set of problems for new skeleton protocol




I'd be willing to be a document editor or chair/co-chair.
