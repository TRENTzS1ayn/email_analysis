To: IETF Applications Area Discussion List<discuss@apps.ietf.org>

I have run the HTTP 1.1 (RFC 2616) through the Acrobat
Distiller (version 3) to obtain a PDF version. The PDF
version is available at
   http://www.dsv.su.se/~jpalme/ietf/rfc2616-HTTP-1-1-draft.pdf

If, however, there is a more official PDF version
available, I will delete the file above. It would of course
be more valuable if the PDF version got clickable links in
the table of content and index, but I have not done that.
