This list might be interested in draft-iab-secmech-01.txt. It describes the 
applicability of various IETF security mechanisms to various situations, 
including applications. Steve Bellovin says he hasn't gotten much comment 
on it and wants to go to last call soon, so you should review it soon and 
let him know if you have any changes or desired additions.
