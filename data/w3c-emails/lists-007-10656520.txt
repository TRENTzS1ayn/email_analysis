I think this is a fair comment, that may also reflect the very nature of
security.

I am reminded of a little game that is very prevalent on a certain desktop
operating system:  Minesweeper.  (The goal is to uncover a number of hidden
mines by stomping on all the squares that do NOT contain mines:  to stomp
on a mine is sudden death.)

Making systems secure seems a similar kind of activity:  experts can tell
us where mines are known to exist, but it is both imperative and very
difficult to deduce where mines certainly do not exist.
