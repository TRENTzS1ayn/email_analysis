Hi,

a new version of "draft-reschke-deltav-compute-checkin-uri" is available
from the IETF ID directory [1] and our WebDAV resources page [2].

From the abstract:

"In many cases, a versioning-aware client might want to display/include the
URI of the version it's editing while it's being edited. For instance, an
editor might include this as meta information, or the author of a document
might want to know the URI of the version before it's checked in. A
well-known example is the W3C way of referring to document versions in
recommendations: it contains references to "the current version", to "this
version" and to the "previous version". Something like this is currently
impossible with WebDAV versioning [RFC3253], as the version URI is
determined at the time of CHECKIN."

Changes:

"Updated abstract not to refer to DeltaV WG anymore. Use "WebDAV versioning"
instead of "deltaV".
Changed descriptions to use RFC3253's Marshalling/Precondition format.
Changed name of cu:cannot-assign-expected-version-URI to
cu:can-assign-expected-version-URI as this is a precondition."

Next steps:

Will be probably submitted as informational RFC.
