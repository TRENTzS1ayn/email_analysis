Permit me to presumptuously re-word Larry's suggestion:

A particular set of security technology and operations constraints are 
believed by the expert security technical community to carry a particular 
set of exposures and might also carry a set of mis-perceived comforts.

It would be entirely reasonable for the IETF/IAB to produce a paper stating 
those constraints, exposures and mis-comforts.

Done objectively, the fact that the constraints might perfectly align with 
a particular group's security policies seems unlikely to create legal 
exposures (though, yes, I would expect the legal mis-comforts to continue.)
