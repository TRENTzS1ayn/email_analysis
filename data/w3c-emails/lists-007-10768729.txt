I don't agree.

In effect, 1984 makes a set of cases about general issues.  It's entirely 
generic.

I think that something which analyses current detail would be appropriate.

Ironically, this should probably be published as a BCP, noting a particular 
set of details and their particular limitations. For example, noting that 
the details in the current limitation permit highly reliable breakability 
with (what is it now?) 72 hours, or somesuch.

Just a thought.
