...or they might not. The security folks have gotten used to relying on one 
part of a government saying "you can do that" but then having another part 
say "you can't do that". And, remember, we'd have to get buy-in from *all* 
governments, or at least all the ones we thought were significant. I think 
trying to keep the security folks in all governments happy is a classic 
rathole.
