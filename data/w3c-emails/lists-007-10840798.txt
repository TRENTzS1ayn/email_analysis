Your terminology for "User Agent" tends to cast it in an active role
("performs network services"), which I think would also make it a "client".
 (Similarly, your definition of "service" agent seems to imply a passive
role.)

I am reminded of the classic case of the X-window terminal that is also a
"server".  But is it a "User agent"?  I'm dubious (based on your
definitions, it seems not).
