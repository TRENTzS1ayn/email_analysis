I am active in an EU-project about collaborative filtering.
In this project, we would like different web users to fill
in a questionnaire about how they want collaborative
filtering to work.

You can fill in the questionnairy, by going to
   http://www.sztaki.hu/servlets/voting/SELECT
and click on the link "You can cast your vote now!"

To fill in the form will take 5-10 minutes.
