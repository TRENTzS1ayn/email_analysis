one of the other ADs ran across this draft, which layers a protocol
on top of HTTP.  we're looking for a few good HTTP experts to
sanity check this draft, paying special attention to the proposed
methods and usage - and perhaps to show up at a BOF in Minneapolis
and comment on the draft.

if you're willing to look at this before Minneapolis, please send me a note.

p.s. I haven't read it yet myself...
