I would like to use the locate-by-history report
to locate _the_ VCR (if any exists) for a given
version history. So I'd expect at maximum 1 VCR
be reported per version history.

Is this a correct assumption? I would like to hear
that possibly existing working resources are not
covered by the report.

One can phrase the question also as: is a working
resource a VCR?

Thanks for the help,

Stefan
