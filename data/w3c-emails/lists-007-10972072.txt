It layers a protocol on top of something which is not
defined (yet, although it promises to): HTTP layered
over (multicast and unicast) UDP.

I think HTTP layered over multicast & unicast UDP will
be exceedingly difficult to define correctly. HTTP messages
and responses are arbitrary length, and require one-for-one
responses to requests.

The 'sanity' of this approach escapes me.
