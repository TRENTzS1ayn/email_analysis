> As for layering, why do you believe this is a layering on top of HTTP?

Because draft-cai-ssdp-v1-00.txt says:
     "SSDP uses HTTP over multicast and unicast UDP."

It doesn't say "SSDP defines a protocol that's kind of like HTTP."

Now, you can call yourself Humpty Dumpty and say that "HTTP" means
whatever you say it means, but then, you might fall off that wall.
