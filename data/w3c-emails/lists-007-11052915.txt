the apps document action page
(http://www.apps.ietf.org/DocumentActions/index.html)
has been somewhat improved:

it now lists each internet-draft, with requested status,
for each protocol action, and includes (where applicable)
pointers to the lastest drafts.  it is also capable of dealing 
with documents (informational/experimental) that were not 
last-called.  it also lists document change history.

eventually it is planned to include a log of status changes,
so you can see what happened when.

(and we're even catching up on document reviews!)
