Yes, we did.

No, it is not a good idea.

Some do, but it is still not a good idea
 - UDP fragementation
 - access control trouble (lack of HTTP headers)
 - pinelining requests give better performance ( we used to do this in the
days of HTTP/1.0 )

This is off the top of my head, there is more negative experience that I
have suppressed (we did do WAN UDP-packets for quite a while in the COM-MESH
experiment).  And of course we are changing to CacheDigest these days...
