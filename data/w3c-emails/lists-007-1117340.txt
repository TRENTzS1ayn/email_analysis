Hi,

What is semantic of DELETE on a member of a working collection that is
version
history resource ? Should it (try to) delete the version history or only the
binding ?
In case it should delete the version history then is it possible to delete
a version controlled resource without checkout-in-place feature ?

Regards
Sasha
