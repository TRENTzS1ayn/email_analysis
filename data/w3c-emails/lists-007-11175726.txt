Well, yes, but...

In the case of HTTP I believe that there does exist such a mechanism (but I
could be wrong there).

In the case of SMTP, because the necessary information is declared up front
(by EHLO response) before a transaction is initiated, the client can base a
request upon this information so I don't see a critical/nom-critical
designation is needed.

The fact that it is not needed in all cases suggests to me that
critical/non-critical marking should not be part of a *core* protocol.
