IMO, the feedback from the BOF showed that we are not going to be 
designing a "core" protocol anytime soon.  Instead, we are going to
be documenting useful protocol features.  Since that's what we're 
doing, there's no reason why we cannot document any feature that is
thought to be useful.

Also, it's far easier for a group to agree on pros and cons of certain 
protocol features, than it is for a group to decide what should or 
should not go "in" a core protocol.  The latter seems like an invitation
to political disaster.
