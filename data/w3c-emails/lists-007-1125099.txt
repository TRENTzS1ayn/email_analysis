The DELETE of a (version history) member of a working collection is
just a deletion of that binding to that version history, and that
the DELETE/MOVE semantics from sections 5.6 and 5.8 do not apply.

This information needs to be added to the next rev of the spec,
so I'll add an Errata entry for this.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

What is semantic of DELETE on a member of a working collection that is
version
history resource ? Should it (try to) delete the version history or only the
binding ?
In case it should delete the version history then is it possible to delete
a version controlled resource without checkout-in-place feature ?

Regards
Sasha
