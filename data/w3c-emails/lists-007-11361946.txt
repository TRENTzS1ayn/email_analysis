You might want to check out www.thirdvoice.com; they already do general
annotations of Web pages rather than simple ratings. Their interface is pretty
good, too, although currently limited to IE on Windoze.

And it isn't original with Thirdvoice either; I'm told that this sort of
thing was present in some of the earliest browsers.
