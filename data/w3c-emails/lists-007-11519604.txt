I have written an I-D which talks about the use of DNS as a repository for
routing "messaging" where normally E.164 numbers are used as identifiers.

It specifies that E.164 numbers should be domainnames when they are used on
the Internet (and not local part of email addresses, sip URLs etc), and how
NAPTR and SRV records can be used to look up what services one can use when
one want to contact that number.

It also talks about the use of DNS as a resolution service in the SCP when
dealing with SS7 signalling.

The name of the Internet-Draft (current version) is
draft-faltstrom-e164-02.txt. I will shortly update it with some references,
and information about a mailing list:

   Discussion on this Internet-Draft is to be held on the mailing list
   ietf-e164-dns@imc.org, which is hosted by the Internet Mail
   Consortium. To subscribe, send an email to
   ietf-e164-dns-request@imc.org, with the text "subscribe" as the only
   word in the body of the mail. There is an archive of the mailing
   list at <http://www.imc.org/ietf-e164-dns/>.
