Hi,

The rfc3253 says that: "The DAV:resourcetype of the workspace MUST be
DAV:collection".

What is the recomended way for a deltaV client to check if a collection is a
workspace ?
One possibility is that client checks if DAV:workspace property of
that collection is the same like URL of this collection.  If yes then
it is a workspace because DAV:workspace property for a workspace identifies
itself.

Any better way ?

Best regards
