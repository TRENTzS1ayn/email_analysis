Patrick,

FWIW, there is a set of "recommended" codecs in the SMIL 2.0
draft of W3C, and I'm happy to explain why we chose those, if
needed:

>      * image/jpeg ([595][MIME-2], [596][JFIF])

In general, I'm a bit confused about the request - why would the 
IETF have to comment on the minimal set of codecs in a format
defined by another organisation ? This would make sense if the
goal is to define a minimal set of codecs that need to be supported
by MIME mail readers, but otherwise, I don't see the point - am
I missing something ?
