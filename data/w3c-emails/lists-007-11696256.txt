I think it is important to be much much more detailed when specifying 
a list like this.

I am not working in this area much personally, but I feel we have 
three layers of "things" that needs to be standardized for a sender 
to be able to send data to a receiver:

   (a) Codec
   (b) Format
   (c) Transport Protocol

All three layers have to match for things to work. Several client 
(and server) software can handle many different permutations of the 
alternatives for each layer in this micro-stack.

Is it not something like this which have to be specified?
