In  various wg's (not in _one_ place) codecs are defined. This 
include AVT and VPIM wg's for example.

To be honest, it might be the case that I should have initiated some 
work on coordinating the selection of codecs earlier, but it has not 
happened. Or rather, it has happened by having individuals informally 
syncronizing between I-Ds which later turned into RFCs.

Do you belive a specific RFC should be written on what codecs to choose?

(A question to all people on this list.)

Can people interested bring this up on the VPIM and AVT (and other) 
wg meetings next week?

I am happy to sponsor the creation of a BCP on codec selections.
