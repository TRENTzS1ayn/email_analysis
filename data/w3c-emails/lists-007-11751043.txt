Do we have someone reading these messages which can let me know if I 
am right or wrong when claiming that we talk about a sort of three 
layer architecture:

    Codec
    Format
  Transport

In the case of Waw, that is not a codec, but a format, which allow 
different codecs.

Has anyone seen any compilation on what various "words" actually mean?
