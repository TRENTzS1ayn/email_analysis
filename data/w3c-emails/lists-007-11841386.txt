AIFF could be an alternative. If I remember correctly there are different 
mimetypes for aiff (uncompressed) and aifc (compressed) the aiff format 
doesn't suffer of the WAV problem of having a gazillion different options for 
compression scheme. It does (theoretically?) allow for choices in samplesize, 
sampleencoding (int/float/ulaw) and such, but at least it isn't open-ended.
