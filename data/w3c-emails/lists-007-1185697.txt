   I would like to use the locate-by-history report to locate _the_
   VCR (if any exists) for a given version history. So I'd expect at
   maximum 1 VCR be reported per version history.
   Is this a correct assumption?

Only if you are applying the request to a workspace (or a member of a
workspace).  If you are applying the request to a collection
containing a number of workspaces, you might get several VCRs reported
(at most one per workspace, though).

   I would like to hear that possibly
   existing working resources are not covered by the report.  One can
   phrase the question also as: is a working resource a VCR?

No, a working resource is not a VCR, so you would never see a working
resource in the result of the locate-by-history report, even if you
applied the report to a collection containing working resources.

Cheers,
Geoff
