How about the Ogg/Vorbis format?

It doesn't suffer from the horrendous patenting/licencing issues 
associated with MPEG1 layer 3/ TwinVQ / AAC etc...

It is also already supported by many encoders/decoders, and is set to be 
the format of the future. Disadvantage for your purpose may be that like 
JPEG/MPEG/etc.. it is a lossy compression format (don't know if that is 
relevant).
