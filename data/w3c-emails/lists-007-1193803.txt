The property is required, in the sense that it must be identified
in the DAV:supported-live-property-set, but it only actually appears
on certain working resources.  This is just like DAV:checked-out and
DAV:checked-in, which are both required properties, but only one
of which can exist on a given resource at a given time.

So you can detect whether or not a resource is a working resource by
checking whether DAV:auto-update appears in its
DAV:supported-live-property-set.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

[1] states that DAV:auto-update is a required property for a working
resource.

However, [2] states that "The DAV:auto-update property of the working
resource MUST NOT exist." is the CHECKOUT is done on a version.

So, is it required or not? If not, how can I detect that something is a
working resource?
