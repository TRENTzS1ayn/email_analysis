But at this point the message should have bounced again, but this time the MAIL
FROM address should have been blank, so the MTA should have either sent the
message to the local postmaster or deleted it entirely. Not having this happen
means either you're the postmaster or there's a standards violation in there
somewhere...

Now, I'm not saying such violations don't occur. They do. For example,
when forwarding mail back out Exchange will change a blank MAIL FROM
to the address of the message forwarder. This is far and away the most
common source of loops we see these days.
