yes, this is what the IETF interoperability tests require.

there is no requirement for implementations to undergo conformance testing or 
to pass any kind of stress test.  

this was a deliberate and carefully considered decision.  
conformance tests are expensive, and they don't tell you much about 
your ability to interoperate with other implementations..

the trick is to document those variants. then when MHTML goes
to DS, see if those variants are the only ones that have multiple
implementations.

no.  that would be adding a lot of complexity for little value.
