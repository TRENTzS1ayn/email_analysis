Where it is shown that implementations commonly limit a feature in certain 
ways, it may be appropriate to include language in standards that are 
raised on the track similar to what's in RFC 821:

"Implementations MUST handle at least <n> <metric> of <feature x>.
Implementations SHOULD choose implementation techniques that place no
restrictions on <feature x>."

The text I'm referring to is this (RFC 821, section 4.5.3):

          There are several objects that have required minimum maximum
          sizes.  That is, every implementation must be able to receive
          objects of at least these sizes, but must not send objects
          larger than these sizes.


           ****************************************************
           *                                                  *
           *  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE, IMPLEMENTATION  *
           *  TECHNIQUES WHICH IMPOSE NO LIMITS ON THE LENGTH *
           *  OF THESE OBJECTS SHOULD BE USED.                *
           *                                                  *
           ****************************************************

We could debate whether the restriction on not sending more than the limit 
is right or wrong. It renders senders that were compliant to the unlimited 
specification non-conformant to the limited specification, which I don't 
like doing.

But if all implementations limit reception at some boundary, shipping the 
standard without documenting the fact that limits are to be expected does 
not appeal to me.
