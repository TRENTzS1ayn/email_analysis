I think I understand this now.

What IETF requires for moving a standard to draft status is
that interoperability can be shown for every single feature
in the standard.

There is however no requirement that interoperability can
be shown for any combination of two or more features in
the standard. Note that nested multiparts can be seen
as "a combination of the feature multipart with the
feature multipart" two or more times.

Also, if a standard says that a certain requirement is
only valid for receipt, not for what is produced, then
interoperability is not required for this particular
feature (since interoperability testing cannot be done
on a requirement which is only valid for receipt,
interoperability testing requires that there is software
to both receive and produce the tested feature).

Is this a correct understanding of the IETF rules?
