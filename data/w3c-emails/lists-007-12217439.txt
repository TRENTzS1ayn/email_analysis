This is almost what I wrote. The only difference, is that
you are saying that what is labelled as "conformance
requirement" and which is specified only for receipt, is by
that labelling exempt from the inter-operability
requirement.

So if a standards writer wants to put into his standard
a requirement which is only for receipt, and which thus
cannot be interoperapility tested (since such testing
requires both production and receipt) then the standards
writer must label this requirement as a "conformance
requirement" in order to be allowed to progress it to
draft status without interoperability testing.
