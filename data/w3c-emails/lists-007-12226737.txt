You keep coming back to this notion that a conformance specification can
somehow defeat the interoperability requirements. This just isn't true. A
protocol can say what it likes about what it means for an implementation to be
conformant. But this has no effect on interoperability requirements at all.

Suppose, for example, a protocol came long that said an implementation can
claim to be conformant even if it implements absolutely none of the protocol.
By your logic this would completely remove any need for interoperability
testing for advancement along the standards track. But this isn't what would
happen: What would happen is that we'd still make the list of protocol features
and make sure each of them interoperated between multiple implementations.

I cannot say what the IESG looked at when advancing MIME to draft, but I can
tell you that we implementors basically paid no attention at all to MIME
conformance when we did the interoperability testing for MIME moving to draft
standard. We made a list of protocol features and checked to make sure they
worked across multiple implementations. (Actually, truth be told, we did
sufficient testing for MIME to move to draft even before it came out as
proposed.)  And speaking for myself, I don't plan on treating other
protocols any differently. If there's a feature in the protocol specification
it needs to be tested for interoperability, never mind what it means
to be conformant.

No, you have it exactly backwards. A specification of, say, what sorts of
display options a client should have is by definition not a specification of
a feature of a protocol. As such, it is simply wrong to call it an interoperability
requirement.

Now, I suppose it is possible that someone could get careless in a
specification and end up with a protocol feature being defined in a section
called "requirements for conformance". But that certainly isn't true in MIME:
We even went so far as to put the specification of what it means to have a
conforming MIME agent in a document totally separate from the MIME protocol
specification.
