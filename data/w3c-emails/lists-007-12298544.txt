I thought interoperability meant that one implementation
could receive what another implementation produced. You say
that interoperability means that two implementations will
handle the same manually generated input in the same way.
Is that really right? Or is that a special variant of
interoperability, to be applied to "receive-only" specs,
while "send-and-receive" specs will still be tested by
testing that one implementation can receive what another
implementation sends?
