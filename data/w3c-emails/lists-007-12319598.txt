When in doubt, read the specification.

RFC 2026, section 4.1.2:

"For the purposes of this section, "interoperable" means to be functionally 
equivalent or interchangeable components of the system or process in which 
they are used."

So two MTAs reacting identically to the same telnet session on port 25 are 
interoperable, even though they never connect to each other.
