Hi,

Let's suppose we have a version controlled resource (a.txt) under a version
controlled collection (mycoll) under a workspace (wsp01):

/repo/ws/wsp01/mycoll/a.txt

and we have another version controlled collection:

/repo/ws/wsp01/mycoll2

If, now, we check out both mycoll and mycoll2 with apply-to-version
(which results in creating two working collections wc_mycoll and
wc_mycoll2, where wc_mycoll contains a binding to the version history
of a.txt) and then do a move:

MOVE wc_mycoll/a.txt
Destination: wc_mycoll2

then, I suppose, the binding a.txt is removed from wc_mycoll and
a binding to the same version history is created in wc_mycoll2.
Is that correct ?

If after that we checkin wc_mycoll2 then mycoll2 will contain 
a VCR a.xml whose DAV:version-history will be the same like
DAV:version-history of mycoll/a.txt.  Is that correct ?
I suppose it is not because in this case we would have two VCR's
in the same space pointing to the same version-history (mycoll/a.txt
and mycoll2/a.txt).

In general my question is: Is it possible to move a VCR from one
VCC (version controlled collection) to another using MOVE on
working collections ?

Regards
Sasha
