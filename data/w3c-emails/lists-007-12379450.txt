The W3C is attempting to create such a thing - the XML Schema
language.  The current work divides the problem into two spaces

Structures - http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/
Datatypes  - http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/

For W3C members (I know, this doesn't help everyone here), the
working group page is:
  http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/Schemas.html
and the associated Interest Group charter page is
  http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/1999/05/xml-schema-ig-charter.html
