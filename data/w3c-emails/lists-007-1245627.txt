   From: Zivkov, Sasa [mailto:sasa.zivkov@sap.com]

   Let's suppose we have a version controlled resource (a.txt) under a
   version controlled collection (mycoll) under a workspace (wsp01):

   /repo/ws/wsp01/mycoll/a.txt

   and we have another version controlled collection:

   /repo/ws/wsp01/mycoll2

   If, now, we check out both mycoll and mycoll2 with apply-to-version
   (which results in creating two working collections wc_mycoll and
   wc_mycoll2, where wc_mycoll contains a binding to the version
   history of a.txt) and then do a move:

   MOVE wc_mycoll/a.txt
   Destination: wc_mycoll2

   then, I suppose, the binding a.txt is removed from wc_mycoll and
   a binding to the same version history is created in wc_mycoll2.
   Is that correct ?

Yes.

   If after that we checkin wc_mycoll2 then mycoll2 will contain 
   a VCR a.xml whose DAV:version-history will be the same like
   DAV:version-history of mycoll/a.txt.  Is that correct ?

Yes.

   I suppose it is not because in this case we would have two VCR's
   in the same space pointing to the same version-history (mycoll/a.txt
   and mycoll2/a.txt).

You will actually have one VCR, with two bindings to it (i.e. one from
mycoll/a.txt and another from mycoll2/a.txt).  This is required by
workspace semantics, which says that there can only be one VCR in a
workspace for a given version history, but you can have multiple
bindings in that workspace to that VCR.

   In general my question is: Is it possible to move a VCR from one
   VCC (version controlled collection) to another using MOVE on
   working collections ?

Yes.  (That is one of the benefits you get from the
"one VCR per version history" semantics).

Cheers,
Geoff
