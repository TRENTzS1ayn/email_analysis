i received the 'fake' message.  interestingly enough, i'm unable to
tell exactly where the duplicate message got filtered out---only one
ever hit our IMAP server, and our delivery system is still mostly
under control of AMS, which functions in it's own strange and mystical
ways that I do not totally comprehend.

I read this list via a shared bboard---which also has duplicate
delivery suppression (the mail system views it just like any other
user).

More interesting then your denial-of-service attack on yourself is the
problem of a mailing list that both you and I are on: 
- you receive a message, and decide to prevent me receiving it
- you immediately send me a message with the same message-id

If the mailing list exploder decided to deliver to me later than you
(especially if it's a large mailing list) you have a good chance of
denying me receiving a message.

It's hard to come up with a simple scheme to prevent this, since most
of the obvious things to hash can easily be duplicated, and you
generally want a message with the same message-id but a different body
to be repressed --- since it's probably the "[to unsubscribe, blah]"
message from a mailing list.
