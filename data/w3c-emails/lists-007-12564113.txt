The Message-ID has the advantage of identifying also not-quite-
identical messages, for example with different information in
the To, Cc and Bcc headers or Resent-From added or something
like that. You cannot make a secure hash on just the content
of a message, there is an obvious probability that several
entirely unrelated messages will have the same textual content,
for example "Yes" or "I love you!".
