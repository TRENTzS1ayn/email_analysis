I am an moderator of a LISTSERV mailing list. Sometimes,
the same message is sent twice to the mailing list. The
LISTSERV software recognizes this, even if the Message-ID
is not identical. The LISTSERV then asks me as a moderator
whether this, presumably identical message, should really
be sent to the mailing list again. This seems a good and
proper way to handle it - note the possible correlation,
ask a human what to about it.
