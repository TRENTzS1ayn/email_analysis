i have been thinking about an xml based transfer and control protocol for
future applications.  it would serve some of the same functionality as HTTP,
but would be much more flexible and could perform operations other than just
simple file transfer.  the main focus here is that it would be a general
protocol using xml, and could be extended by all sorts of applications for
communication.  is there already a working group to develop such a protocol,
and if not, would there be any interest in one?

let me know what you think.
