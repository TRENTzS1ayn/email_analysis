Subject: transfer protocol


i have been thinking about an xml based transfer and control protocol
for future applications.  it would serve some of the same functionality
as HTTP, but would be much more flexible and could perform operations
other than just simple file transfer.  the main focus here is that it
would be a general protocol using xml, and could be extended by all
sorts of applications for communication.  is there already a working
group to develop such a protocol, and if not, would there be any
interest in one?

let me know what you think.
