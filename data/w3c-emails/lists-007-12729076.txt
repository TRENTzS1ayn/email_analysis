Patrik,

I would suggest that the members of the VPIM WG have interest in this and
may be interested in this process (I can say that I am).  I think the point
of this is to define a minimum set of codecs for multimedia messaging for
3G.  We have been doing the same for unified messaging in VPIM & IVM (though
we have just been talking about voice and fax).  It is interesting to note
that with IVM we originally had support for numerous codecs suggested as the
baseline, but after discussion we reduced it to one.

I am intrigued that they list the WAV header format as baseline but do not
identify any of its 300+ codecs.  

I am not surprised they want to use their AMR/EFR codec -- but I'd like to
know how different it is from GSM 6.10 (of which a variant is the current
proposed baseline for IVM).  I believe AMR/EFR for 3G is the same as GSM
6.90.  And, of course, this is different from the North American wireless
codecs :-(

I am curious why they don't list G.711 mu-law as one of the audio codecs.
It would seem that if we are getting into transcoding, that one would want
to list the lowest common denominator.   

Cheers,
Glenn.
