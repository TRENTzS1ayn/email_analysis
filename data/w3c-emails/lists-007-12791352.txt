the root servers tell him that the following servers serve the .nu domain:

;; ANSWER SECTION:
nu.                     5h15m48s IN NS  NZ.NS.NIC.nu.
nu.                     5h15m48s IN NS  NS0.TELIA.NIC.nu.
nu.                     5h15m48s IN NS  NS0.DE.NIC.nu.
nu.                     5h15m48s IN NS  NS.NIC.nu.

(they will also inform the querier about the IP addresses of those machines).
any of these servers tell him that the following servers serve the 
kom2000.nu domain:

kom2000.nu.             1D IN NS        ns.su.se.
kom2000.nu.             1D IN NS        ns2.su.se.

If you are interested in the details, I recommend RFC 1034/1035, or the 
O'Reilly DNS books.
