When trying out different TCP-based application programs,
I have found that a piece of software named OTSessionWatcher
is very useful. This software logs every character sent
and received through all TCP connections on my Macintosh
onto files, so that I can see exactly what is actually
transferred by different clients and servers.

Does anyone know if a similar piece of software exists
for Windows 98, Windows NT and Windows 2000 computers.
