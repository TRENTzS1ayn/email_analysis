This is done just for regularity (i.e. the semantics of the Label
header are that the method is applied to the version selected by
that label).

If a client wants DAV:auto-update behavior, it would have to first
UPDATE the VCR to be the desired version, and then CHECKOUT the VCR
with the DAV:apply-to-version flag).

Cheers,
Geoff

Hello,

it is not specified (neither 8.8 nor 9.3) that checking-out a VCR with
Label: header is similar to checking-out a VCR with the DAV:apply-to-version
flag with respect to setting the DAV:auto-update property in the resulting
WR.

It it just missing or is there any reason for not being similar?

Thanks,
Peter
