I have no memory of a charter.

This is too open-ended. I want a more specific list of documents that 
you are to create, and the list of issues you are to discuss should 
also say what is _NOT_ in scope of the wg.

My personal interest is not so much in multimedia, but in a 
discussion on how one should design an application layer protocol 
(and maybe "how should one use existing protocols, like IMAP") so it 
works for "mobile" clients.

You should by the way define a "mobile client"...

I felt the discussion at the BOF ended up with "a client which have 
very limited bandwidth to the network, often connected to many 
different internet providers, limited memory and screen", or 
something like that.
