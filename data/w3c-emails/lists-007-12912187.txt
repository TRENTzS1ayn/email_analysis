Maybe. The rescap wg is looking into "capabilies" in a different way 
(I presume).

I think "discovery" of capabilities is an interesting discussion, and 
of course it should be dealt with aswell. Some of this information 
can be handled by just looking att the tcp control block :-)

Now, I would like, to be honest, this wg to more look at what 
stupid(?) design flaws have been made in the existing protocols given 
certain capabilities than the actual discovery process. IMAP in 
disconnected mode is a good idea, maybe, but might be too chatty. 
I.e. long rtt makes chatty protocols like IMAP and SMTP (just as some 
examples) quite boring. Can something be done about that (batch 
smtp?).

Say we have a very fat pipe between earth and the moon (which current 
tcp should be able to handle). Should we run IMAP over that link 
which have quite some RTT?

What happens if we have only a 2.4k inmarsat sattelite phone with 
900ms rtt, can we still do useful stuff with normal applications 
given ppp (the solution is not to change ppp in this discussion)?
