Hi,

I noticed that the RFC doesn't specify additional UNCHECKOUT semantics for a
version controlled collection resources.

However it seems to me that it's far from obvious what UNCHECKOUT should do.
Is it supposed to restore the bindings for version controlled resources? I
would guess so... What is it supposed to do for VCRs that have been deleted
since the last CHECKOUT? Restore a new VCR from a server-selected version
from the version history?

Feedback appreciated :-)

Julian
