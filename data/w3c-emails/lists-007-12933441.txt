These documents would become de facto standards (although they won't
have had the standards-review) and they would break the paradigm
of Internet-Drafts (which is "don't implement").

If you want to get public documentation on how things are done,
it would be more suitable I think to go with traditional Informational
RFCs -- and you can label them as "Informal understanding of how to
do X", if you like.
