Depending on the assumptions, it seems that either capability discovery
integrated with the actual protocol or a separate protocol (as in
rescap) makes sense. (Among other considerations, this depends on
requirements for setup delay, number of message exchanges or
restrictions on information access.) For interactive multimedia
communications, there is a nascent SDPng effort to describe
capabilities, with the current version of SDP being used in RTSP, SIP,
SAP and Megaco/MGCP. This work is still in the requirements stage, but
it may well borrow from the content negotiation work, but some
requirements differ somewhat.
