"End-to-end" means to do things at the end of the communication
as much as possible.

In this case of interactive multimedia communication, there is human
involvement. So, the end to select service is beyond mobile device
in human brain.

Users choose proper URL for his terminal capability.

Users do not want to be annoyed by the result of negotiation by
*INTELLIGENT* intermediate systems.

Users do not want to be annoyed by delay for the negotiation.

And, at the other side of the communication, users can't provide
so much variation of the content.

PS

Of course, people in telephone companies do not do it end to end
but may want to call it end to end.
