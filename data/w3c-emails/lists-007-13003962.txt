Patrik, thanks for drawing attention to this.  Other activities
in the same arena that TSV has going on are ROHC and a proto-working
group (we'll be airing a draft charter for it soon) about end2end
considerations in mobility.  It had a BOF (craps) in Pittsburgh, but the
scope of any WG will be more focuses than the BOF was.
