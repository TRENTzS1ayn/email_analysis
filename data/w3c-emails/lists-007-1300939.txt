The semantics of UNCHECKOUT are the same as UPDATE (see 14.11).
In particular, yes, restoring a deleted VCR produces a server-selected
version, unless there is already a VCR for that version history
in the workspace (in which case you just restore a binding to that VCR).

Cheers,
Geoff

Subject: version controlled collection feature, additional UNCHECKOUT
semantics



Hi,

I noticed that the RFC doesn't specify additional UNCHECKOUT semantics for a
version controlled collection resources.

However it seems to me that it's far from obvious what UNCHECKOUT should do.
Is it supposed to restore the bindings for version controlled resources? I
would guess so... What is it supposed to do for VCRs that have been deleted
since the last CHECKOUT? Restore a new VCR from a server-selected version
from the version history?

Feedback appreciated :-)

Julian
