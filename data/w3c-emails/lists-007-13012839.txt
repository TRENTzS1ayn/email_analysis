Patrik and I had a rapid-fire in-room discussion after the MMMS BOF in
Washington. I walked away with the understanding that MMMS, or something
like MMMS, would have the same role in the APPS area as PILC has in TSV.

This was a sound-byte, of course, and not a charter, but it made sense to me
at the time.

And, just FYI, there is a certain amount of hand-waving in appendices of the
PILC ERROR document, for instance, about the limits of what PILC can
accomplish without a corresponding effort at the application level. Patrik's
example of application-level stop-and-wait protocols ("enter userid", "enter
password", etc.) shows the kind of interaction that TCP can't fix (if you
wait a full round-trip for an answer before asking the next question and
waiting some more, it doesn't really matter what TCP is trying to do
underneath you, and heaven forbid you are doing this over geosynchronous
satellite hops).

If there was an MMMS, we would definitely hand this text off to MMMS (we're
TSV weenies, after all).
