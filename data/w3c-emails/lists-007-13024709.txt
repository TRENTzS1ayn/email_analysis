The beauty of the Internet End-to-End model is that people don't have
to wait for the IETF to create a working group, a charter, a chair,
, blessings, .... to move forward.

Remember the web (http, ...)? 
What was IETF's role in Internet's main modern application?


As far as the domain of Internet services for mobile devices go, the
key issue is "Efficiency".


Completely outside of the IETF but in the tradition of Internet
technical community which includes:

- Stable and wide publication (RFC publication)
        - Patent-Free Specification
        - Open working group protocol development and maintenance

A large body of work exists which addresses the Mobile Messaging
area. 


It is called 
    
     LEAP: Lightweight and Efficient Application Protocol.


To fully describe our vision of the Mobile Messaging industry, there
is a 200 page document called:

     "The LEAP Manifesto"

The LEAP Manifesto addresses every topic so far touched on in this
thread -- and a great deal more.


Those who believe in the IETF's exclusivity in protocol development
can start from scratch and form yet another working group, write yet
another charter, and go and talk, ...


Those who want to build good things and move forward fast, can evaluate
the merits of LEAP and participate in its evolution and enhancement.

The starting point URL is: http://www.leapforum.org/

The main current areas of work for LEAP are:

    - Efficient Security Services
    - Compact Markup Languages
    - Portation of the reference implementation to additional
      platforms


Those interested are invited to join the relevant mailing lists.


In the early stages of formation of an industry, competition amongst
open protocols is healthy. 


...Mohsen.
