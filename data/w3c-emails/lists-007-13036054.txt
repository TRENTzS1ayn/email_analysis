Yes, the next document milestone from PLIC seems to have been delayed:

 DoneDraft on asymmetric network paths.
 Oct 99Draft of TCP Over Wireless document to the IESG as BCP
 Nov 99Document on low bandwidth links to IESG for publication as BCP.

Does anyone know who is supposed to be working on the PLIC Wireless 
document?  The closest I could find was:

Cheers,
