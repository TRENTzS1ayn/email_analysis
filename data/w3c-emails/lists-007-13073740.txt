See RFC 2506, RFC 2533, RFC 2534.

But also note...

There is work in W3C (CC/PP working group) that addresses exactly this 
area, from a perspective of data format.  Some initial public drafts are 
available for comment at http://www.w3.org/Mobile/CCPP/.

There was also a BOF held in Pittsburgh to garner interest in HTTP 
extensions to convey capability information described using CC/PP, and 
maybe other formats.

Both the CONNEG and CC/PP work have (rightly in my view) focused purely on 
formats for expression of capabilities.  Details of protocols for conveying 
such information may reasonably vary between applications (HTTP, SIP, 
e-mail, etc.).
