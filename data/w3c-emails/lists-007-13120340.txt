Here are some questions about the plic minutes:

Is this WAP "work in progress" available for public inspection and 
review?  If not, would someone who can see it please abstract it and 
post (anonymously if need be) please?  

Does any WAP product use TCP at all?

I would certainly support doing anything that would encourage DoCoMo 
to use end-to-end Internet protocols, and if they are as close as that 
draft suggests, publishing it as an Information RFC might help them 
provide TCP application services more easily.

I think the TCP parameters and resulting behavior might be more 
different than typical TCP stacks than whoever made that comment
might think.  There seems to be a lack of understanding about the 
parameters involved, and most if not all of the important ones are 
at least touched on in the DoCoMo I-D and the documents it cites.

What is the ecn document?

WAP is designed as if Moore's Law didn't exist.

Is there any evidence to back this comment up?  It seems that ICMP 
traffic is specifically addressed by Magret and Yang.

Like what?

Thanks.
