I wouldn't say it was an oversight, but rather a use
case that wasn't sufficiently common to warrant making
the protocol more complicated to support it.
In particular, you would have to define the semantics
of what would happen if one part of the request would fail
and the other would succeed, and how to marshall that
error information.

Cheers,
Geoff

Subject: LABEL request only allows one set, one add...




Is it an oversight that the LABEL request only allows one set, one add, or
one remove at a time (or one of each, but not two of any?)

For example, say I wanted to add <label-name>foo</label-name> and
<label-name>bar</label-name> to a version in one request.  The definition of
the LABEL request body is:

  <!ELEMENT label ANY>
  ANY value: A sequence of elements with at most one
  DAV:add, DAV:set, or DAV:remove element.

  <!ELEMENT add (label-name)>
  <!ELEMENT set (label-name)>
  <!ELEMENT remove (label-name)>

  <!ELEMENT label-name (#PCDATA)> PCDATA value: string

Since <add> can only contain one label-name, only one label can be added per
each request.  I would have to issue two LABEL requests to add both foo and
bar labels.
