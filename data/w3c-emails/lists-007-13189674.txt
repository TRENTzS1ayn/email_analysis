Mark,

Thanks for your message:

Absolutly; I'm worried that even mentioning the RTO maximum will 
detract attention from the maximum retransmition timeout which is 
the REAL problem with TCP over wireless, more than all the other 
TCP parameters combined, certainly.

I mean, what difference does it make if you have to wait an extra 
minute to get a connection back as long as you can get it back 
instead of having it dropped after nine minutes?

Cheers,
James
