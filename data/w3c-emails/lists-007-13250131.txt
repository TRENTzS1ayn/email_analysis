Regrettably this confusion has lasted for some time. Martial (a Latin poet)
was not happy 2000 years ago when he discovered that somebody had presented
as his a work by Martial. He was the one who coined the word "plagiarius".

"intellectual property". 

A German philosopher had the idea that there should be no property at all.
153 years ago  he published a program of work which was implemented and had
some success for some time. What about publishing a similar manifesto for
_intellectual_ property?

Right, please do so for _your own_ "intellectual property".

In the little country village I live there is a saying: "Don't teach cats to

This is what the followers of the philosopher above did for some time with
some success (net and IPR should be properly renamed in the new context)

no.  for everyone else.  the "owners" of the proprietary technology can go
bankrupt, for all I care, and the rest of the world will be better off if 
they do so.  of course, we'd be even better off if they got a clue.

the term "intellectual property" is a misnomer.  the use of the word
"property" to describe ideas and expression of ideas has led to a widespread

confusion that ideas are like tangible property.  they're not.  for one
thing, 
the laws of supply and demand that apply to tangible property do not apply
to 
"intellectual property".  quite often "intellectual property" is worth more 
if you give it away than if you try to control it.  holders of IPR 
midunderstand this at their peril.

meanwhile, the net will treat IPR as damage and route around it.
