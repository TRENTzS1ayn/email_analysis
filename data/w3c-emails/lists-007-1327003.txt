That's a great point, but it makes me realize I may be reading the
definition wrong.  I had assumed it to be possible to add one label, remove
a second and set a third, all in the same request. This assumption was based
on the following language:

     The request body MUST be a DAV:label element.

      <!ELEMENT label ANY>
      ANY value: A sequence of elements with at most one DAV:add,
      DAV:set, or DAV:remove element.

Perhaps this is supposed to mean that only one child element can be inside
label, but "a sequence" does imply more than one.  If you mean to restrict
it to one only, then the definition should be:

<!ELEMENT label (add | set | remove)>
