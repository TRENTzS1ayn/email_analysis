That's exhorbitant compared to the cost of the software, which is zero.
of course, this might explain why there are so many unlicensed players 
and encoders out there - people are widely ignoring these patents.
still, while it's heartening to see patents being routinely ignored, 
it's not good to have the developers or distributors of free software 
threatened by the possibility of patent lawsuits.  

protocol standards need to be free, period.
