Something like the cost of doing business

So what? Tens of million people use them. And I am one of them because I
know that when I send a word attachment people can read it.

One day I should tell you the MPEG story. I like the idea of my last 13

1-2% of parts cost or of retail cost?  when I was doing hardware
engineering for a large consumer electronics firm, even a fifty
cent increase in parts cost needed considerable justification.

what about them?  they're not standards, they present considerable
security risks to those who use them, and powerpoint seems to be 
detrimental to the minds of those who use it.  I discourage their
use as much as possible.

of course not!

but it might be well to point out that while he was quite 
experienced at sea, the nature of the vessels he was captaining 
had changed.  when a crisis struck, he wasn't prepared for those changes...
