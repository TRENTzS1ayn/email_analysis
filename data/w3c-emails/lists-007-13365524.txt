As Area Director of Applications Area which uses this mailing list 
for discussions of various topics, I ask you all to now stop this 
discussion in its current form.

I have been talking with several  people the last couple of months, 
and it is clear that there are some interest in having some 
discussion in the IETF using the IPR rules IETF uses, and using the 
open process which IETF uses.

Because of this, I ask people to to to focus so the goal is to 
present an agenda for a BOF in London during the 51'st IETF.

IETF will by itself follow liason agreements regarding "new work 
items" with other organizations like ISO and W3C to minimize the 
amount of duplicate work which is done.

I therefore ask people to synchronize, and come with a proposal for a 
BOF when the IETF is announced, and BOF proposals are asked for.
