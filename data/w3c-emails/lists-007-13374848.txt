Of course not.  I was merely dealing with a common complaint about 
licensable technology -- that people seem to be unable to obtain 
licenses.  I wanted to point out that this was not the case here.  As 
you note, I am merely pointing out a fact of public knowledge:  that 
Apple and Real have agreed on terms for Real to use the QT Streaming 
format.  This is also true of a number of other companies who also 
support the QT Streaming format.
