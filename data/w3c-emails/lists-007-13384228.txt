Hi!
Hopefully you're the right person to be talking too, if not, please pass
this message to the appropriate person in your organization or delete it
and accept our apologies! We are a web hosting company and we receive many
enquires about web design, which we do not do. As a service to our
customers and web designers we are launching a free searchable database of
designers and design firms.

If you or your company would like to be listed, please take a moment to
visit http://www.asgard.net/us/ and click on the Web Design link.
Every person who adds themselves before April 15 will go in the draw for a
new Microsoft Optical Intellimouse.

There are absolutely no obligations to list in the directory, but we would
appreciate it if you also review our services. We offer .com domain
registrations for US$12/yr (free with our business plan) and websites from
US$4.95/mth. Furthermore, we pay *ongoing* commissions up to 30% to
businesses and individuals who refer clients to our services. This can be
quite a lucrative addition to your existing income, with no extra
expenses. You can review more information about our services and partner
program on our website.

Again, our apologies if this reached you by mistake. We retrieved your
email address from search engine listings under 'web design' which is
undoubtedly a less than perfect method! Be assured it is a once and only
mailing and we won't bother you again.

Thank you for your time!
