FYI,

I've submitted a revision of the date and time draft Chris Newman wrote 
some time ago.

One of the goals for the current revision is to create a separate 
specification that answers a clear and present requirement from other parts 
concerning which there is less clear consensus.  Specifically, this draft 
aims to move forward the timestamp elements of Chris' original work, while 
allowing the trickier "schedule events" elements to be picked up and 
developed by a group with more specific relevant expertise and goals, if 
required.
