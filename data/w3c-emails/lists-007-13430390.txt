My extemporaneous talk on "Security Design for Application Protocols" at the 
Apps Area session at the 50th IETF (Minneapolis) is now available here in 
.html & .pdf formats (URLs folded; the .pdf is the easier to deal with and use 
imho)..

I'm working on getting the .ppt source file up there on my website and hope to 
have there in the next few days.

thanks,
