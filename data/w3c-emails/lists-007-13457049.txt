I only glanced at this, so maybe I misunderstood it.  However...
given that the components of a multipart/interleaved aren't likely to be
usable by a traditional MIME reader anyway, I see little point in
using the MIME multipart syntax to distinguish one chunk from another.
and I don't really see a good way to build this in such a way that
existing MIME readers are likely to deal with it well.

I would suggest a new application/multiplexed content-type which would
be divided up into chunks, each chunk representing the next consecutive
element of some stream.  Each stream could be a MIME body part, with
the normal header and content, but each stream could also be fragmented
as necessary.  Ideally, the semantics would be similar to multipart
related, and it would be possible to transform an application/multiplexed 
content into an equivalent multipart/related content - just that in
the first case the various components would be divided up into chunks
and multiplexed into a single body part (as far as MIME was concerned)
and in the second case the components would each appear as a separate
MIME body part within an enclosing multipart/related.
