By way of historical context, I will note that my own reaction to the idea 
of these specifications was that they should just use BEEP:  The purpose of 
the multiplexing at to permit multiple data streams without one blocking 
the other, and with constrained buffering requirements at the receiver.

That is a dynamic requirement that depends upon the detail of the transport 
and the receiver.

That's the job of a protocol, not a format.
