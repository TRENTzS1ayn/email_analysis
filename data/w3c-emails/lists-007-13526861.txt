I agree (as I did in person in Minneapolis) with Ned that the 
fundamental problem is that of just-in-time delivery, and the sender 
cannot know what that means.  For example, in looking at our server 
logs, we do not find that browsers all request the images for a 
given HTML document in the same order.

These drafts were motivated by the buffering problems of an IPP 
printer, but similar problems would be faced by any device that must 
combine mulitple components to produce a whole (wireless PDA 
displaying an alert with a specific font and a graphic).  Far better 
is to provide a means of doing bidirectional requests.

IPP already incorporates print-by-reference, so having the sender 
incorporate references to objects it is prepared to provide through 
a special-purpose HTTP server is not much of a stretch - putting the 
sequencing control of them into the renderer where it belongs.

The HTTP Upgrade mechanism could be used to switch the HTTP/IPP 
connection to BEEP/xxx for any value of xxx (including HTTP, even if 
that would give people alergic reactions).
