All:

Just as a bit of background, the purpose, especially of mulitpart/interleaved,
was for environments (not IPP) where the client CANNOT/DOES NOT have the
resources necessary to support a server (e.g. Cell Phone) and this therefore
does a BETTER (but not foolproof) job of putting the resources in  "proximity"
to where it is reference (think printing something like XHTML with images.)
Also, some of these environments are NOT tcp.  Don't argue with me about whether
or not the Cell Phone can afford to include a server so the printer can get the
image as it needs it.  This is one of the underlying requirements based upon
what functions can afford to be included by the manufacturer of these devices.
The printer guys didn't make up the rules.... we just have to live with them and
solve the problems based on them.

Oh and by the way, we also didn't decide the base protocols either so when the
protocols chosen don't do what is necessary, we have to solve the problem with
packaging.  Because of bandwidth issues (again, think non-TCP, non-internet,
non-megabit pipes), the 33% inefficiency of base64 encoding with the XHTML/SOAP
is also not acceptable.

I agree (as I did in person in Minneapolis) with Ned that the
fundamental problem is that of just-in-time delivery, and the sender
cannot know what that means.  For example, in looking at our server
logs, we do not find that browsers all request the images for a
given HTML document in the same order.

These drafts were motivated by the buffering problems of an IPP
printer, but similar problems would be faced by any device that must
combine mulitple components to produce a whole (wireless PDA
displaying an alert with a specific font and a graphic).  Far better
is to provide a means of doing bidirectional requests.

IPP already incorporates print-by-reference, so having the sender
incorporate references to objects it is prepared to provide through
a special-purpose HTTP server is not much of a stretch - putting the
sequencing control of them into the renderer where it belongs.

The HTTP Upgrade mechanism could be used to switch the HTTP/IPP
connection to BEEP/xxx for any value of xxx (including HTTP, even if
that would give people alergic reactions).
