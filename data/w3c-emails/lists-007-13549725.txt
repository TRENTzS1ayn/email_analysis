I don't see how this packaging issue saves resources in the IPP 
client - it has to muster all the components anyway to send them, 
regardless of what order they are sent in.  Indeed, it would be 
easier for the sender if they were all just sent sequentially 
without the interleaving.  The only motivation I could see for the 
interleaving was solving the problem of not having buffer space in 
the receiver to buffer the entire composite object.  Perhaps I 
misunderstood...
