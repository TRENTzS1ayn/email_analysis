Yes, in RFC3253, "at most one x, y, or z" is (x | y | z).
If you were allowed to have an x and a y and a z, it uses
and "and", e.g.: "at most one x, at most one y, and at most
one z".  So you can do an add, a set, or a remove, but not
more than one in the same request.  The "sequence of elements"
is just there for extensibility.

RFC-3253 has no restrictive DTD statements such as:
 <!ELEMENT label (add | set | remove)>
since if this DTD was used by a validating parser,
it would violate WebDAV semantics, which requires that
unknown element types be ignored, and not cause a parse
error.

Cheers,
Geoff

That's a great point, but it makes me realize I may be reading the
definition wrong.  I had assumed it to be possible to add one label, remove
a second and set a third, all in the same request. This assumption was based
on the following language:

     The request body MUST be a DAV:label element.

      <!ELEMENT label ANY>
      ANY value: A sequence of elements with at most one DAV:add,
      DAV:set, or DAV:remove element.

Perhaps this is supposed to mean that only one child element can be inside
label, but "a sequence" does imply more than one.  If you mean to restrict
it to one only, then the definition should be:

<!ELEMENT label (add | set | remove)>
