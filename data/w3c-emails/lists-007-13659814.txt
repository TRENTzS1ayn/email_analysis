I made a test, where I encoded the same information using ASN.1,
ABNF (RFC822 style) and XML.

You can find it at
http://www.dsv.su.se/jpalme/abook/asn-1-xml-compare.pdf

I compared how many octets had to be sent to transmit the
same information in some different formats:

Relative
Size       Encoding

100        ASN.1-PER
175        ASN.1-BER
550        ABNF, RFC822 style
830        XML

When shown such results, people often say "but XML can be packed".
So I tried packing the XML using the ZIP format. Small blocks of data
became longer, not shorter, when packed. So packing, at least
using ZIP, will not make XML more efficient except for rather
large files.
