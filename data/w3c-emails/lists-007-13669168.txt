I made a test, where I encoded the same information using ASN.1,
ABNF (RFC822 style) and XML.

You can find it at
http://www.dsv.su.se/jpalme/abook/asn-1-xml-compare.pdf

I compared how many octets had to be sent to transmit the
same information in some different formats:

Relative
Size       Encoding

100        ASN.1-PER
175        ASN.1-BER
550        ABNF, RFC822 style
830        XML

I tried packing the XML using the ZIP format. Small blocks of data
became **longer**, not shorter, when packed. So packing, at least
using ZIP, will not make XML more efficient except for rather
large files.
