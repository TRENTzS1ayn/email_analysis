Yes, you are correct for a small piece of XML: it is hideously expensive.

Things don't do so badly when you get to longer documents.

Of course, the same people only look at long documents, and ignore
human latency (one of the reasons why I find HTTP ugly is that the
verbosity even of RFC822 headers is adding large latency over low bandwidth
lines).
