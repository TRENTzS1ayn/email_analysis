By implicit typing in ASN.1-BER is meant that a single tag is used to
indicate both the type in the actual application and the base type it
is based on. With explicit typing, two tags are used. But the ABNF
examples do not use explicit typing. Explicit typing in ABNF would be
for something like:

   Birthyear (INTEGER): 1958
   Name (ISO-8859-1): Mary Smith

which is not done in neither my ABNF nor my XML encoding.

Anyway, explicit typing would only perhaps increase the size of the
ASN.1-BER encoding by about 10 %, that would not change the main
result of my comparison.
