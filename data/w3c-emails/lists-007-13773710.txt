actually, I think it has more to do with the way you use ASN.1
(i.e. the actual ASN.1 specification for your protocol)
than any of the ways of encoding ASN.1

in other words, if you decide that your protocol will implicitly
determine field tags by position then you use ASN.1 SEQUENCE
but if you decide that field tags should be explicit then you'll
use some sort of OPTIONAL structure that contains the tag and
the value [*]  and if you decide that your protocol will expose
(say) the entire structure of an email address in the ASN.1 layer
then it will naturally take up more space than if you just encode
the entire email address as a single IA5STRING.

[*] if memory serves... but I have done my best to forget how ASN.1
works.  so if you claim I've made errors I'll only congratulate
myself on how much I've forgotten.

let's stamp out gratuitous use of *both* ASN.1 and XML in our lifetime!
