RFC2518 already established that validating parsers cannot strictly use the
DTD in the specification but must allow unknown elements in any element.

If RFC3253 consistently followed what you suggest, then auto-version would
also take a value "ANY" rather than being defined properly.

  <!ELEMENT auto-version (checkout-checkin | checkout-unlocked-checkin
     | checkout | locked-checkout)? >

RFC3253 has many such "restrictive" DTDs.
