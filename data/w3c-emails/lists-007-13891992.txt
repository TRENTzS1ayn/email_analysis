All,

The new practice of using the word "crazies" to describe contributors who
are working on utf8 as an IDN mechanism can't be helpful.  I didn't feel
comfortable with this, so I left this morning's Open Apps meeting.

In the interests of full disclosure, I am working on utf8 as an IDN mechanism.

Eric
