Hmmm....I only use the wording "the web" is only used for the subset of
what is transported over the http protocol, can be named with a http URI,
and accessed with a "web browser" -- PLUS "embedded content" in the
webpages which the user is accessing -- PLUS accompanying things like
WEBDAV abilities to edit that data documents.

I.e. "the web" is for me a subset of what you think is the web.

Interesting...
