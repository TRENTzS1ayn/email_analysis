RE: In addition: IDSs and Intranet servers.

Interesting discussion. And to add to the insecurity many "high-security"
organizations are using intrusion detection systems (IDS) without any
pattern matching on port 80 - they're just set the IDS to allow almost
anything to happen through port 80 - no alarm will ever ring. To add further
to that - all the ill-constructed intranet servers with global read as
default for all databases...makes the world less secure. Just as examples:
1) Lotus Notes Domino Web Server (many versions) with global read for all
new created databases and even write in some cases (yes, via a browser) to
setup and
configuration areas.(setup.nsf and domcfg.nsf). 2) Centrinity First Class
Intranet Server with global read to lists of all conferences and users.
And global write to all intranet conferences via other routes (such as
writing an email over port25 to the conference.name@server). The list goes
on and on... It just surprises me that very few organizations seem to
acknowledge the problem. Maybe now in these times of slow economic growth,
there's more time to think it over.
