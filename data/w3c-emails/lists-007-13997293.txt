The Web is an information space, not limited to any protocol or
format (so, URI is closer to the definition than HTTP). As I
understand it, this is more or less the W3C definition.


I know that wiser heads than mine will consider this incorrect, but
my belief is that a port allocation's semantics are limited to a
reasonable expectation that a particular wire protocol will be
spoken.

It may be operationally convenient to make assumptions about what
services are used over a particular protocol, but imposing policy,
applying heuristics or inferring security based on port is unwise at
best, as has been noted.

This, IMHO, is especially true for generalised transfer protocols
(*TPs). Do we consider valid users of the FTP ports to only be
human-driven FTP clients? May only MUAs or MTAs acting on their
behalf use port 25?

It's certainly true that people do impose policy, apply heuristics
and infer security from port 80, but I don't think this should be
encouraged or codified. If we went down that path, it would restrict
the 'valid' uses of HTTP, somewhat paradoxically (based on the
definition above) limiting the uses of the Web as well.

(Note the fine line being walked - I agree with Kieth's motivation to
warn people about the possibility of these things when they use HTTP
as a substrate).

Now to catch up on the jetlag...
