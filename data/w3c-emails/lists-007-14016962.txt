Jacob,

I don't plan on following this thread in discuss@apps.ietf.org.

It was the subject of discussion at the Apps Area Open at IETF-44,
at least in its transport aspect.

The business of filtering based on port numbers is rapidly getting
insane: blocking incoming 80, "transparent proxy" of outgoing 80,
blocking 25... I think we should rewrite the browsers and SMTP agents to
use alternate ports, picked more or less at random. In fact, we already
have the tools to do that with the SRV records. I can think of a
filter-breaker that will first try to access www.example.com:80, and if
that breaks for any reason, try to resolve "_http._tcp.www.example.com
IN SRV" -- et voila, alternate port number, filtering is defeated...
Same could work for mail, etc.
