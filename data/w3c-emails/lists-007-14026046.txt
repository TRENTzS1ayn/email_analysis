If we used SRV records to pick ports then the firewalls would just
intercept DNS queries to know which ports to intercept, and this
would just create a bigger mess.  Especially given that NATs do 
something like this already.

end-to-end IPsec would help, but it's really difficult to deploy.

it would also help if software vendors stopped shipping apps 
that were vulnerable to network-borne viruses.

IMHO, standards should say that an app MUST NOT present downloaded
content unless the security considerations for that content-type
and application had been studied and any known threats ameilorated.
