no.  the last thing we need is to legitimize things that put brittle 
per-flow state inside the network, intercept traffic for third parties,
increase the dependence on DNS reliability (making the network less reliable),
break existing applications, and reduce the flexibility of new applications.

you can't fix the NAT problem with hacks like this.  it only makes it worse.
