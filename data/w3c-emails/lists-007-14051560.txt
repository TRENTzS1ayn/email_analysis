I was not talking about NAT's, but things that block traffic on certain
ports, like normal firewalls, but you are completely right that this can be
used for NAT purposes aswell.

But, I get your point. Doing DHCP request, pppoe authentication etc when a
host "wakes up" and get's an IP address is one thing. Doing the same or
similar things when it for example starts it's "SIP telephony listener" or
initiates some other flow is not good.

That is what I read in your message.
