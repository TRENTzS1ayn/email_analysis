Hi all,
  Graham mentioned these documents during his discussion at the apps open
area meeting in London. They have been updated based on comments heard
after that discussion and some discussions with the IANA. The two documents
are:

An IETF URN Sub-namespace for Registered Protocol Parameters
draft-mealling-iana-urn-01.txt

The IETF XML Registry
draft-mealling-iana-xmlns-registry-02.txt

If you haven't already reviewed these please do so. I intend on asking
the RFC Editor to publish these sometime next week. One question I have
is what status should they be. BCP? 

-MM
