Keith,
The customers that have requested reliability are the large scale users of
our proprietary messaging middleware MQSeries. They rely on the product for
moving high value transactions (milions of USD) in the financial and other
areas. For the reasons of opening firewall ports (amongst others), they'd
like to see a more general purpose and standardised way of achieving the
same degree of reliability on the internet. Hence the comment on customer
requirements.

that's fine.  but simply citing 'customer feedback' as the justification
for HTTP doesn't illuminate the underlying requirements that caused
customers to request that.
