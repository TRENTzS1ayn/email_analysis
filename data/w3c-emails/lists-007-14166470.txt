Agree, HTTP won't go away in the near (or not so near) future. I believe
there is the opportunity for the IETF to develop the kind of reliable
protocol our requirements draft addresses. However, we can't ignore HTTP in
the near term and adding reliability to it with relatively few changes
would be a pragmatic solution - certainly labeling users of HTTP as
ignorant is probably not the way to go :-)

But that's a solution, and we have to look for the requirements that
have generated that solution, so that we can create a better solution.
That's how I understand the draft.
