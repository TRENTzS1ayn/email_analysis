guys - help me out with something. after reading your I-D, i can't help but
think that you can meet your requirements by:

1. shifting more responsibility (e.g., loss detection) to the endpoints.
<JBI> Absolutely. From a reliability point of view, the responsibility is
not to lose the message at
<JBI> the endponts. In this case, the sending endpoint must have a stored
copy available until it knows
<JBI> unambiguously that the receiving endpoint has successfully stored the
received message persistently.
<JBI> It can then delete its copy. In cases of failure, it can retry and
synchronise with the receiving
<JBI> endpoint.
2. using an application-layer relaying service with deterministic delivery
semantics (e.g., apex with some of the party pack options).
<JBI> I need to read more on APEX before commenting authoritatively on this
:-) But having seen your
<JBI> presentation to the XML Protocol WG in Boston I think APEX could
provide the basis for a reliable
<JBI> protocol. There is still the question as to what is to be done in the
short term and the feedback we get <JBI> from our customers is that HTTP
will be around for a long time and they'd like to make that reliable -
<JBI> warts and all !
what am i missing here?
