I can't see any basic reason why a thermostat should be accessed as if
it was a hypertext document. I would expect building-services control
messages to get layered directly over a transport protocol in due 
course. I certainly want thermostats to be accessed by a highly reliable
mechanism that survives disconnected operation, which is where this
thread started.
