   From: B H, Girish [mailto:g.b.h@sap.com]

   When we CHECKOUT "coll", we get the working-collection "/wr/wr123". 
   What should the PROPFIND on /wr/wr123 return?
   a) /wr/wr123/vh20 (binding-name is the 'name' of the version-history),
   /wr/wr123/vh21 and /wr/wr123/vh22
   OR
   b) /wr/wr123/a (binding-name is still the same as the binding-name in the
   version-controlled-collection), /wr/wr123/b and /wr/wr123/c

The latter, (b).

   Certainly the latter is more convenient. However, is this specifically
   mentioned in the spec?

Good point!  This is not stated explicitly in the spec, and should be.
I'll add this to the errata list.

Cheers,
Geoff
