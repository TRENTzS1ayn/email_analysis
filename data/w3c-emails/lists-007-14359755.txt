If you mean that an HTTP operation needs to occur within the context of
a larger transaction, HTTP can do that so long as the interaction
remains stateless (see [1]).

But I question whether this is needed in the use case I provided.
Perhaps if you're controlling a thermostat used in some chemical
engineering plant you'd need it, but not in a house.
