I don't disagree, but there's a world of difference (literally) 
between "not just a browser" and "everything that could conceivably be 
addressed via some URI scheme or other".

Given the RFC 2396 definition,

  A resource can be anything that has identity.  Familiar examples 
  include an electronic document, an image, a service (e.g., "today's 
  weather report for Los Angeles"), and a collection of other 
  resources.  Not all resources are network "retrievable"; e.g., human 
  beings, corporations, and bound books in a library can also be 
  considered resources.

that's potentially everything, period, at which point the term
becomes useless.

Since when did the definition of the web stretch so wide that things 
which aren't even network retrievable are considered to be part of it?

Cheers,


Miles
