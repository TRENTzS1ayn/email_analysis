Consider the following scenario:

versioned collection "/a" with versioned plain resource "/a/b".

"/a" gets checked out and it's DAV:checked-out property points to
"/versions/120".

DAV:version-history of "/a/b" points to "/vhr/123".

DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of "/versions/120" maps the internal
member name "a" to "/vhr/123".

Now, "/vhr/123" gets deleted (server decides that it allows deletion of
VHRs, un-version-controls "/a/b" and removes versions).

Does this change the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of "/versions/120"?

If it doesn't (which I assume), the user has lost the ability to access the
version history. So, to find and retrieve an old version of "/a/b", it will
have to revive the version history using UNCHECKOUT or UPDATE, or to create
a working collection. Right?
