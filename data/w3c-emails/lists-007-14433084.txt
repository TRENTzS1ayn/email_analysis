Actually no it isn't. RDF uses that basic notion plus an assertion
framework together to build a very robust knowlege description framework.
URIs are to the Web what IP is to the Internet. You could just as

the point that it does is useless...

Since 1991 when Tim brought the entire lot to the IETF. At the time
there wasn't an HTTP protocol and the major consumer of URIs was gopher...
