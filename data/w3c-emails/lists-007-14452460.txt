though you might like them for your thermostat, you're making a false 
assumption that such things are desirable for thermostats, or any
other application, in general .

given the complexity and weaknesses of HTTP and the wide variety of
behavior in the deployed HTTP infrastructure, it's often more work 
to figure out and specify how to use HTTP to do something, than it 
is to design your own protocol.

HTTP often works okay on a small scale.  But I have yet to see someone 
suggest using HTTP for a widely-used protocol who truly understood 
the implications of that design choice.
