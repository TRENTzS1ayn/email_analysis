Dear Friends,

I'm a novice who is trying hands on apache web server.
Recently, I 
tried fortifying my web server using the .htacess
feature... I 
created the .htaccess and the .htpasswd files as per
the instructions 
and the syntax is error free. Unfortunately this is
not working. Do i 
need to change any other settings? Surprisingly the
same feature 
worked on another apache server. I donno what to do.
Can any of you 
folks help me? 

please reply to no1kole@yahoo.com or
bapubalu@utdallas.edu

Regards,

Balaji
