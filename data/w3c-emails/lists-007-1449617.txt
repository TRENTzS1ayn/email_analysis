Hi,

given a resource with the distinct URLs "/a1" and "/a2" (so both URLs
identify the same resource).

1) Is it allowed to VERSION-CONTROL this resource?

2) If yes and assuming that the VCR is checked out, what is the
DAV:checkout-set of the "current" version (the version identified by the
VCR's checked-out property)? Does it contain DAV:href elements for both
URLs?

Julian
