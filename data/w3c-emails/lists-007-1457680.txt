   From: Julian Reschke [mailto:julian.reschke@greenbytes.de]

   given a resource with the distinct URLs "/a1" and "/a2" (so both URLs
   identify the same resource).

   1) Is it allowed to VERSION-CONTROL this resource?

Yes.

   2) If yes and assuming that the VCR is checked out, what is the
   DAV:checkout-set of the "current" version (the version identified by the
   VCR's checked-out property)? Does it contain DAV:href elements for both
   URLs?

That's up to your server.  It must at least have the request-URL
of the CHECKOUT request.  A client cannot count on having both URLs
in the DAV:checkout-set, because that is not required by the protocol.
Note that in general, there will not be a list of all URLs, because
there can be an infinite number of URLs that identify a resource when
a collection that contains the resource also contains a binding to
itself.

Cheers,
Geoff
