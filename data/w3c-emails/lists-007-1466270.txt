   From: Julian Reschke [mailto:julian.reschke@greenbytes.de]

   Consider the following scenario:

   versioned collection "/a" with versioned plain resource "/a/b".

   "/a" gets checked out and it's DAV:checked-out property points to
   "/versions/120".

   DAV:version-history of "/a/b" points to "/vhr/123".

   DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of "/versions/120" maps the internal
   member name "a" to "/vhr/123".

   Now, "/vhr/123" gets deleted (server decides that it allows deletion of
   VHRs, un-version-controls "/a/b" and removes versions).

   Does this change the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of
"/versions/120"?

That's up to the server.  There's nothing in the protocol that
requires this to be done, but I'm sure there will be implementations
that do update the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set in this case.

   If it doesn't (which I assume), the user has lost the ability to access
the
   version history.

It doesn't matter what the server does with the
version-controlled-binding-set.  If the version history has been
deleted, the user has lost the ability to access the version history.
Or maybe I've misunderstood you here.

   So, to find and retrieve an old version of "/a/b", it will
   have to revive the version history using UNCHECKOUT or UPDATE, or to
create
   a working collection. Right?

You can't use UNCHECKOUT or UPDATE to retrieve versions from a 
deleted version history.  Or maybe again I've misunderstood you here.

Cheers,
Geoff
