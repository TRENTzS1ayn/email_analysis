We have in Apps Area a number of groups which want to have working 
groups. The line is getting longer and longer, and that is NOT FUN.

Reason for not "just" creating new wg's is that we have limited 
resources in various places, and resources are held up by old wg's 
which move forward very slowly -- if moving at all, and not always in 
the correct direction maybe?

I will as Area Director start forcing wg's to decide to be closed, 
and documents moved to personal contributions.

Note that this doesn't prohibit the documents to be published as an 
RFC in the future, but as individual contributions.

If people have any problem with this, or other ideas on how to free 
resources, let me and Ned know.
