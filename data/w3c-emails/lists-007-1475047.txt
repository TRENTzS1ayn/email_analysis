If a server supports "real" bindings, it would be hard to guarantee this.

In particular, what about if "/a1" is checked out, then deleted. What would
be the DAV:checkout-set of the checked out version?

That's right. I think the only thing that the protocol requires is that for
each checked out resource, one (of possibly many) resource URIs is reported.

Right -- that would be the case discussed in [1]. This is a problem
everytime a method needs to generate "a" URI for a given resource (same for
many REPORTs...).
