patrik - thanks for the thoughtful note.

may i ask that you and ned send email to each of the WGs in question,
comparing their progress to their charter, and giving them a short amount of
time to show progress or be nuke'd.

a charter represents a contract between the ADs and a WG. the reasons that
charters have milestones with dates is so that everyone can understand the
timeliness and metabolism of the project and principals.

in research, you can't schedule innovation; but, the ietf isn't a research
organization, it's an engineering organization. in engineering, scheduling
is one of the most important things to get right.

when WGs go stale but don't die, they prevent other WGs from being formed.
this is plainly unfair...
