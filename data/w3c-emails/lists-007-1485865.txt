   If a server supports "real" bindings, it would be hard to guarantee
   this.  In particular, what about if "/a1" is checked out, then
   deleted. What would be the DAV:checkout-set of the checked out
   version?

Actually, I retract my comment above (i.e. "It must at least have the
request-URL of the CHECKOUT request").  The protocol only requires
that the DAV:checkout-set "identifies each checked-out resource whose
DAV:checked-out property identifies this version", and says nothing
about which URL should be used to do so.

   That's right. I think the only thing that the protocol requires is
   that for each checked out resource, one (of possibly many) resource
   URIs is reported.

I agree.

Cheers,
Geoff
