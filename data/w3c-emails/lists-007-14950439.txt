Hello Patrik.  I know you typically have a meeting on Thursday for the WG 
chairs.  Do you know what time that will be yet?  I will be attending this 
one (finally) and then taking a train out afterwards.  Since I'm checking 
train schedules, I thought I would find out what time you thought you 
might hold the meeting.  Thanks.
