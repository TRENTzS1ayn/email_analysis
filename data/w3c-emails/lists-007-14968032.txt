To the audience: This is about a closed meeting for BOF and WG chairs in
the applications area.

Last year we had a meeting 7-8PM if I remember correctly. I don't mind
having it earlier, but that will mean that dinner will be delayed.

I am happy to hear what you think. I am happy to have the meeting directly
after the sessions end. One hour should be enough, and we do have things to
talk about this time.
