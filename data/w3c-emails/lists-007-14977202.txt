Would anyone be interested in getting together during London to talk
informally about the status and progress of SOAP? (I am a member of
the W3C XML Protocol WG)

Despite the perceptions of some, the WG is very interested in IETF
input and feedback on SOAP issues. Current discussions are revolving
around defining the nature of bindings and general, and in specific
the binding to HTTP, so it's an excellent time to discuss this.
