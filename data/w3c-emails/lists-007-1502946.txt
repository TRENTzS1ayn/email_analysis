Yes, I agree that this would make sense.

Cheers,

Subject: activity-set and new members of a working collection



Hi,
A working-collection can have non-versioned-resources as its members. And
when the working-collection is checked in, these non-versioned-members are
automatically version-controlled.

If the working-collection has a non-empty DAV:activity-set, then would it
not make sense to copy this activity-set to each of the
non-versioned-members which have been automatically version-controlled? This
is especially meaningful when we consider the activity as a 'change set'.
Surely the newly added resources are part of the same 'logical change' as
their parent collection.

Regards,
Girish
