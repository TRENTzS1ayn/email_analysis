For my WGs: This is pretty much true of BEEP; some cleanup and we're 
on our way. APEX is not meeting, but that's only because work is 
progressing and the document editors don't feel like they need 
face-to-face time at the moment. IMAPEXT will probably meet and I 
will get the request in before the 7/16 deadline if so, but the group 
is not being very motivated at the moment. I am attempting motivation 
now, which will be followed by threat, and then followed by the 
specter of IESG threat.
