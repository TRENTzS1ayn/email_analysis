(patrik's confirmation is happily noted, however...)

Given that we have had two false starts on this topic, already, I'd like to 
raise the concern that the previous false start seemed -- to me, at least 
-- pretty clearly to be focused ONLY on creation of a data structure 
standard for :43 responses.

However the discussion got sidetracked with other, larger and more 
difficult issues.

Perhaps the agenda was not as clear as I thought it was.  Hence, being more 
clear this time will suffice (he said, optimistically.)

Perhaps something deeper is at issue.  If so, can we try to surface it and 
dispatch it?
