ahhh.  yes.  Thanks, Scott.

NOW I remember why things got bogged down:

         The problem is with needing to distinguish mechanism from policy.

The constrained IETF efforts needs to specify mechanism only.  If possible, 
it should "require" no specific data in a response.  Any that it DOES 
require should be very minimal and utterly essential to operational 
requirements.

The real policy work, for deciding what to put in a response, can be 
debated elsewhere.
