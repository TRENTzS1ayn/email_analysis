    The real policy work, for deciding what to put in a response, can be 
    debated elsewhere.

I believe that the DNSO is trying to so, see: DNSO Names Council
Whois Survey, http://www.icann.org/dnso/whois-survey-en-10jun01.htm
for details.

Policy is starting to be the big thing. The Dutch registration
chamber (a kinf of privacy in database protection agency) planning
to look into what a whois service might provide and what not. And
this is of course not only for domain related data, but also for
the adress people, such as the RIPE NCC whois service.
