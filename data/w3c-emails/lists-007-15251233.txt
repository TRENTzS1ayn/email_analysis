Hello,

I'm researching an issue regarding whether international characters are
allowed in email addresses. Through the research that I've conducted thus
far I've seen contradictory information.

In looking at RFC-822 it only specifies ASCII characters being allowed,
however I have actually seen a few email addresses that do in fact have
international characters in them. For example, jos?.berm?dez@xxxxxx.com --
note the accented 'e' and 'u'.

If anyone has any more definitive information regarding what is and what is
not supported in respect to international characters in email addresses, I
would be greatly appreciative.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
John
