Thanks, Keith.

So if I received an email address with the following:

david.garc?a.arregui@xxxx.com

it would be incorrect?

The accented ? is in fact an ASCII character, it is included in ASCII 8 I
believe and definitely ISO Latin 1 (ISO-8859-1), not ASCII 7. The example
above is a real email address that I received from someone -- thus my state
of confusion.

Thanks for your assistance.

-John

no, they're not.  in all current mail standards email addresses must
be entirely in ASCII.
