well, we can be a bit friendlier to the topic, I think.  Only ASCII 
"characters" are permitted, however there is a standard that permits 
encoding international characters into an ASCII form.

So the pure negative is:  raw (binary) international characters are not 
permitted.
The positive is:  Encoded international characters are permitted.
