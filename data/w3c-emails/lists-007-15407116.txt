As far as I can tell, the most recent document defining the 
Content-language header is RFC1766.  But, according to the RFC index:

1766 Tags for the Identification of Languages. H. Alvestrand. March
      1995. (Format: TXT=16966 bytes) (Obsoleted by RFC3066) (Status:
      PROPOSED STANDARD)

But RFC3066 says nothing about Content-language, other than it being moved 
to another document.  I have failed to discover what other document.
