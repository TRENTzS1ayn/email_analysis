Well thanks for the boost Keith, I can put that next to my James Seng
(idn@ops.ietf.org) note comparing me to Jeff Williams and depositing my
address in his killfile, or my Gordon Cook (nanog@merit.edu) note also
depositing my address in his killfile after discoursing on my ancestry
or ...

Do you have anything other than attitude to share concerning the
requirements for header processing? Concerning an implementation
of (sendmail) the requirements for header processing? Concering MTAs
generally and 8-bit processing?

Do you have anything other than attitude to share concerning the
process for making progress upon a set of problems Leslie suggested
in rfc2825?

There really has to be more to list interaction than pissing distance
contests, and so much, much more to seniority and experience than
shallow curmudgeonery.

In November of 1981, five years before I got to the point of reading
the work-product of the IETF, Jon wrote during an earlier moment of
profound change that:

   As with all new systems, there will be some aspects which are not as 
   robust and efficient as we would like (just as with the initial
   ARPANET).  But with your help, these problems can be solved and we  
   can move into an environment with significantly broader communication
   services.

I _know_ who Jon was addressing, who he expected to help, it was who we
were then, and now.

Put the "you are an idiot" in all of its vitriolic variations in private
mail, or in discuss@apps.ietf.org, but _please_ put technical content in
discuss@apps.ietf.org -- the subject might be more important than anyone's
ego or claim-2-clue.

Cheers,
Eric
