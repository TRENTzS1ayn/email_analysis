yes.  but there's lots of material about it, I'm tired of writing
such things over and over, mail experts will already be aware of 
the issues (or if not, can figure it out with a moment's thought), 
and you've been in the IDN discussion so you should also be familiar 
with those issues.

so I'm not going to waste my time trying to re-familiarize you with
them.
