Or use unknown-8bit (RFC 1428 section 3).

I honestly don't know how to compare anything useful with "current IDN
discussions", the list is all over the place, anything other than ACE
is as popular as djb-advocacy on namedroppers, with my-dog-is-bigger
behavior the norm, and periodically a "technical advisor" blows by with
helpful notes of the form "it-can't-be-solved-use-ldap".

Thank heavens we didn't decide we simply had to add "+" to the set of
characters we use for names, or authoritative root would be divided into
monotheists (of the negative, or "hypenated" form) and +/- dualists by
sundown.

I don't get the point of your final sentence.
