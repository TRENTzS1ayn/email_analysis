Was that claim ever offered by anyone? As rhetoric it may suffice to
preclude work clearly identified in rfc2825 and elsewhere, but rhetoric
isn't a substitute for a restatement of the problem as infrastructural.

As Fred Baker remarked when opening his for-and-against discussion
(unique dns root) with Karl Auerbach at the ISOC-MINC Workshop in
Stockholm earlier this month, unfortunate rhetoric drives discourse to
less than productive ends.

I do make the claim that there are several places where sub-8-bit
processing takes place, e.g., sendmail header processing, and each
can be fixed, e.g., 8-bit clean plus a transition mechanism (EHLO) for
8-to-7 down-conversion, as well as dns label processing. These can
be viewed as "infrastructure" or as "applications".

Can you suggest how these two statements can be reconcilled?
1. the IDN requirements memo is irrelevant.
and
2. the issues ... will be revisited in due time ... but that time is after the
IDN group has finished its work.

Requirements Considered Optional is not something I look forward to.
