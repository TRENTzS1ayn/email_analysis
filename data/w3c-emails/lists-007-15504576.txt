Quite a number of charsets (including UTF-8) use more than 8 bit per
character. Because of that, the protocol and the applications which use a
textual based protocol need to operate on characters, and not 8-bit blocks,
and because of this understand the (variable?) size of a character.

This is one of the reasons why the encoding MIME uses works well for
"comments" but very badly for other data in headers in email messages.
