Keith, I could not agree more. Mail experts are already well aware of the
issues and have discussed them over and over and over. Now is not the time to
repeat all that.

Additionally, internationalization of message headers started with RFC 1342/RFC
1522/RFC 2047 and continues with internationalization of domains, and
internationalization of domains is being done by the IDN WG. Any issues you
have with the work that's underway need to be discussed on the IDN mailing
list, not on the apps area list or the ietf-822 list.

It is vital that people interested in the internationalization of message
headers focus first on domains so we get the right solution in that space,
since any more general solution has to take the work done for domains into
account. And as I've said before, while I think some of the more radical IDN
proposals aren't likely to be adopted, if they are they will change the
character of the message header problem completely, so until it is clear which
way the wind is blowing it is very foolish to start in on message headers.

And if anyone is just getting started on this whole topic, you really need to
read the IDN requirements draft and review the list traffic before jumping in
with a topic that more likely than not has already been discussed past the
point of exhaustion in that forum.
