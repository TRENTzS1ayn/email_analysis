Ned,

Going back to Mr. Harrison's original question, could you offer him a
sensible answer that made a contrary assertion to the one I made, and
Keith took exception to, and explain that no header processing issues
are involved, only "domain" and "address" issues?

Since I have been participating in the IDN list most of this year, your
closing para(s) were for someone else's benefit, right? You did read
Keith's comment that the IDN requirements draft is irrelevant, so as
you both agree with Keith completely _and_ recommend people read
the requirements draft, your point is ... what?

This is heading towards interesting territory -- don't use apps, don't
use 822, don't use ... and don't complain about IDN.

Not what I expected.

Eric
