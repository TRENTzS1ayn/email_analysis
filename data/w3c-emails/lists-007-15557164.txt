In other words, you want me to argue Keith's points for him. Thanks but no
thanks.

For my part I never said that "no header processing issues are involved". What
I did say is that until it is clear what direction IDN is going we cannot work
usefully on things like "header processing issues". For all we know at this
point we'll end up with some directory solution layred on top of existing
services that argues strongly for something akin to X.400's
ORAddressAndDirectoryName construct. (And no, I'm not saying that I think such
an outcome is likely or that it appeals to me. All I'm saying is that anything
is possible at this point.)

Eric, this is flummery and you know it. Shame on you. I responded to one
message of Keith's by saying I agreed with everything he said in it. Then Keith
said in a separate, subsequent message that he believes the IDN requirements
draft is irrelevant. Agreeing with what Keith said in one message doesn't mean
that I agree with everything he says in subsequent messages. The very notion
that this would be so is absurd.

I have no idea what your expectations are, and after what you said in this
message, I frankly don't care.

Even if I were interested in discussing header processing issues at this
point (I'm not), it is now clear that you have no intention in engaging in
a sensible or reasonable discussion. So as far as I'm concerned this
discussion is now terminated.
