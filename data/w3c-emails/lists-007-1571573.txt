Yes, the spec should explicitly state that the DAV:resourcetype
of a working-resource and working-collection is that of the
version being checked out.  I'll add this to the Errata document.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,
The specification does not give clarity on the resource type for
working-resources and working-collections. My guess is that it does not
introduce any new resource types (just as it does not for VCRs and
versions). If this is so, then I think this should be explicitly mentioned.

Thanx,
Girish
