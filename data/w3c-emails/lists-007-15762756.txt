Rob,
My answers below

Unfortunately that is not me. This is because I keep myself deliberately
unaware of "what is happening in smoke filled rooms where a bunch of people
are talking about what the licensing terms are".
The reason why I brought the MP3 and MPEG-2 examples was to show that it is
possible to implement a virtuous circle in standards that require IPR.
Therefore the people who own the IPR that makes MPEG-4 possible have an
incentive to agree on "good" licensing terms, if they do not want to lose
revenues and "fast" if they do not want to lose the opportunity all
together.

I do not see why they should. RealNetworks is a quoted company that responds
to its shareholders. If the current management of RealNetworks think that
they serve the company shareholders' interests better by not adopting
MPEG-4, one of the two things can happen
1. RealNetworks thrives. The policy is shown to be sound. Shareholders are
happy. The management is confirmed
2. RealNetworks sinks. The policy is shown not to be sound. Shareholders are
unhappy. The management is fired.
People who "hound RealNetworks publicly about not yet supporting MPEG-4" can
go to a supplier of MPEG-4 solution. This is the good side of competition,
particularly when the alternative is a standard solution with many competing
suppliers.

The alternative to studying the past is divination. This does not seem to
work so weel these days in the stock market :-)

Is RealNetworks technology licensable or openly available?

No, it does not. It just means that these people were contented with a
single MPEG-4 "tool" - something that is perfectly legitimate with MPEG
standards - and thought that another, non-MPEG, technology suited their
needs better.

Stated by whom?

Leonardo,

Thank you for your reply.  I would like to respond to some of your points:

My apologies.  I didn't realize that there was any reflector other than the 
two IETF lists (rem-conf@es.net and discuss@apps.ietf.org)  I'm assuming 
gen-sys@advent.ee.columbia.edu is the ISO reflector?  It's no longer listed 
as a recipient in my reply.

Hey, if you can find someone who's willing to make a non-murky public 
statement on this issue, I'm all ears.  It may seem to you like I'm being 
disingenuous and that I really don't want the answer, but nothing could be 
further from the truth.  I'd like to hear what the straight answer is from 
someone who's willing to state it publicly.  Since there's no shortage of 
people who will hound RealNetworks publicly about not yet supporting 
MPEG-4, I'm sure there's someone who can give a good answer to this.  :)

Yes, but over the years, as MP3 has gotten more popular, Thomson has 
changed the terms on MP3 to be more restrictive (from what I 
understand).  This is very reminiscent of what happened with GIF...which 
would lead one to think that maybe a PNG effort is in order.  For example, 
the Vorbis project has a good start on an audio codec:

http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,37538,00.html

...but alas, there's a lot more to doing full-blown multimedia than 
audio.  That's not a slam on the Vorbis people; they recognize it too and 
have a very nascent video format and other elements of a complete 
system.  But I guess I'm tired of hearing that MPEG-4 is the undisputed 
standard here, and I'm frustrated that I encounter so many people who 
aren't even aware that there are licensing issues at all with MPEG-4.

As they say in the stock market:  "Past results are no indication of future 
performance"   :)

MPEG-4 is a very different technology than MPEG-2, and "licensable" is very 
different than openly available.

I'd also note that DivX files are not .mp4, but are .avi, right?  I think 
that speaks to the heart of the issue.

I'm not arguing against standards (that'd be pretty stupid in general, and 
*really* stupid given this audience).  I'm saying that there doesn't 
exist  multimedia standard with the stated goal of being royalty-free.

I guess it would be nice to redirect the efforts of the IETF toward truly 
open formats, since most of the effort thus far has been toward things like 
documenting the .wav file format (as VPIM has been doing), or defining the 
packetization formats for MPEG-4 (as AVT is doing).
