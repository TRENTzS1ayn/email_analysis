May be. We'll see.

For whom? For owners of proprietary technologies who do not have the least
intention of making _their_ IPR available?

As far as I'm concerned, if MPEG-4 requires ANY IPR licensing then
it is a non-starter.  Those four letters don't mean jack - what matters
is whether people can use the technology without strings.  And if the 
MPEG developer community isn't committed to producing a standard
that is free of IPR - then the sooner the rest of the world abandons
them, the better.
