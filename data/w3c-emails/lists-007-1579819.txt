So far, everyone has either agreed or remained silent on this topic,
so as a motivator for anyone objecting to speak up (:-), I will mark this
issue
as resolved in the errata, with the resolution being that the Label
header will be deprecated, and the DAV:labeled-version REPORT inserted
in its place.  In particular, I propose the following definition for
the DAV:labeled-version REPORT:

-------------------

8.3DAV:labeled-version Report
The DAV:labeled-version report describes the requested properties
of the version with that label in a specified version history.
If the DAV:labeled-version report is applied to a version-controlled
resource, it is applied to the DAV:version-history of that
version-controlled resource.

Marshalling:

The request body MUST be a DAV:labeled-version XML element.

<!ELEMENT labeled-version ANY>

ANY value: a sequence of zero or more elements, with
at most one DAV:prop element and with exactly one
DAV:label-name element.

prop: see RFC 2518, Section 12.11

The response body for a successful request MUST be a DAV:multistatus
XML element.

multistatus: see RFC 2518, Section 12.9

The response body for a successful DAV:labeled-version REPORT
request MUST contain a DAV:response element for each resource
that satisfies the Depth header of the request.

Since this is a fairly significant change, I'd like to
hear from a few more folks before adding this to the 3253 Errata.

Thanks,
Geoff

Yes. But I think it's Tim's turn to say whether this would work for him or
not...

As stated before, I think that's not the single problem. Having GET return a
(representation of a) version rather than (a representation of) the VCR
makes the version *by definition* a variant (representation) of the VCR --
and it seems that most of us want to avoid that interpretation.

...and also use DAV:supported-live-property-set to discover the
DAV:label-name-set property.
