Hi Leonardo,

Absolutely.  You've opened up a huge door for me to give a long sales
pitch, but out of courtesy to the people on this list, I'll try to keep it
brief.  We give away versions of RealPlayer, RealServer and RealProducer,
and license our technology to many companies.  It's also an open,
extensible architecture which anyone can write new datatypes
(standards-based or otherwise):

About our ubiquity (and hence availability):
http://www.realnetworks.com/company/pressroom/pr/2001/metrics.html
About our extensibility:
http://www.realnetworks.com/company/pressroom/pr/2001/autoupdate.html

As to the standards we support, there's RTP, RTSP, SDP, SMIL, H.261,
G.711, PNG, and countless others I'm forgetting, all of which have
specifications available for interoperability with our system -- and all
of which are available for royalty-free implementation to the best of my
knowledge.  Additionally, we support many of the MPEG family of standards
(MP3 audio natively, and MPEG-1/MPEG-2 video via third party support
through our plugin architecture).  We even have partners working on MPEG-4
support.

Stated by the people working on it.  When the chair of the working group
working on a standard says that he doesn't know the IPR situation with the
spec he's working on, that should raise big red flags in the minds of
those who are actually concerned with licensability.
