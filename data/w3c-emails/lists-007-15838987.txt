Hi Dave,

My parting shot wasn't intended for strictly the file format as you 
probably think of it, but in terms of a general interoperable blob of a/v 
data that includes audio, video, and the structure of the file format.  If 
.foo is an interoperable multimedia file format, and there are two .foo 
players, they should have all of the necessary components to interoperate.

For those of you not familiar with the distinction, in the multimedia world 
there's a pretty distinct separation between the codec used (such as H.261 
video, or G.711 audio), and the container its put in (such as Quicktime's 
.mov format, Microsoft's .asf, .avi, and .wav formats, RealNetworks .rm 
format, or the .mp4 format in the MPEG-4 v2 spec).  A minor additional 
complexity is that the codecs have to be inserted into the container file 
using the same conventions (same codec identifier, interoperable codec 
parameters, etc).  What Dave is referring to is the container itself.

Now Dave, since you are practically begging me to respond to your earlier 
mail....  :)

For the benefit of those not on the full thread, I've included the full 
email from Dave at the bottom of this message.  Here's the snippit I want 
to respond to, though:

Are you really willing to stand up and disclose the terms of the 
Apple/RealNetworks agreement?  I think it's entirely inappropriate to cite 
the Apple/RealNetworks agreement as an example of an MPEG-4 file format 
licensing success story, and entirely inappropriate to discuss the terms of 
any deal that go beyond the joint press release:

http://www.realnetworks.com/company/pressroom/pr/2000/apple.html

Besides that, I don't think it's at all reasonable that if RealNetworks and 
some other company/project want to interoperate, that that other 
company/project should have to go to Apple to get permission.  Do you?

Rob
