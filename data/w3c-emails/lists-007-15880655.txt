Your comments on the following I-D are solicited.

Title: Authentication Mechanisms Levels
Filename: draft-zeilenga-auth-lvl-01.txt

  Numerous authentication mechanisms are in use today on the Internet.
  It is desirable to give administrators the choice of which mechanisms
  to support in their deployments and to give users the choice which
  mechanisms to use.  This document offers terminology designed to be
  easily understandable by users and administrators of Internet
  services, while being meaningful to designers and developers of these
  services and associated Internet protocols.

Thanks, Kurt
