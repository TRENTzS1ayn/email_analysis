for most purposes these entities do not need to be separated any more
than the individual letters.  and it's arguably better if certain
fields of an address aren't identified separately to every thing that 
handles an email message - for instance, only the primary mail exchanger
for the domain of an address should be treating the local-part of that
address separately.

as well as to be friendly to humans.  
putting XML inside an email address would be a disaster.
