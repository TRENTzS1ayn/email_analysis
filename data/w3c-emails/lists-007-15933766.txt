Jacob,

Thanks for the lesson in parsing.

I never said that the extended example was an excellent design choice.  It 
was provided to demonstrate that there is considerable choice available to 
the person doing the specification.

In fact, you ignored the end of my note, citing a real-world specification 
that is substantially different from the XML example that you 
chose.  Although it takes more characters than a pure RFC822 address, it is 
not as onerous as yours.
