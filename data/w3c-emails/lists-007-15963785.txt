right.  but this is a problem inherent in any new feature - you can
hardly expect existing user agents to do something reasonable with
a construct that has never been tried before.

defining a new content-type doesn't help this problem much, if at
all - either the recipient's mailer *still* refuses to show the
text, or the mailer treats as multipart/mixed and displays all of the
parts (which can be quite annoying).  neither is satisfactory.

there's nothing stopping new software from using multipart/alternative
to distinguish between text in different languages and display the
text in the user's preferred language.  your complaint appears to be 
that old software will not do this.

nor is there anything stopping you from writing a filter that will
recognize French mail and translate it to English.  you don't need
multipart/choices to do this.

Even if you wanted this filter to act at message presentation time
rather than at say delivery time, having multipart/choices wouldn't
help you create a hook for converting French mail to English.
