Exactly. We defined something in a standard that hasn't been implemented by
user agents to your satisfaction, and now you hope to solve this problem by
defining something that's essentially the same but labelled differently. I'm
sorry, but I fail to see any reason why multipart/choices will work out any
better in this regard. Standards can only do so much.
