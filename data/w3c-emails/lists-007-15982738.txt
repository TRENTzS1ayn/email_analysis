I disagree with all three of the proposed rules.

"be liberal in what you accept" leads to non-interoperability when 
interpreted too broadly.

Munging can be a good idea when changing data in a way that improves the 
receiver's ability to render it.  Munging ill-formed data can improve 
interoperability if done appropriately.

Necessary intelligence is important in software.  NTP has to be rather 
intelligent to work correctly.  And it works quite well.

The multipart/alternative spec probably just failed to provide enough UI 
advice.  But Mulberry implemented it correctly.
