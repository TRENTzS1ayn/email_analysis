You can disagree all you want and I might even agree with your position
somewhat. However, this sort of thing is up to the IESG as a whole, and at the
time when I did the revision there was substantial pushback on even including
things that were widely, but not universally, implemented in the document. I
actually don't recall whether or not I proposed including an appropriately
worded reference to RFC 1766 at the time, but had I done so I don't think there
was any chance it would have made it. And to be frank, given the scope of the
revisions done in RFC 2045-2049 I had a lot other stuff to worry about at this
point.

Actually, I doubt that it did. If memory serves, it was something of a last
minute addition to RFC 1766.

I understand you intend this to be humorous, but I think this actually deserves
a serious response. When I present one of my own documents to the IESG for
approval I am automatically disqualified from acting as a reviewer.
Additionally, anything I or any other IESG member presents tends to be reviwed
much more carefully than stuff coming in from other sources. RIghtly or
wrongly, the IESG is quite sensitive to charges of favoritism, and if anything
tends to err in the other direction.

I only wish I didn't speak from experience on this particular point.
