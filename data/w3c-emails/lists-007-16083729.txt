I concur.  However, I think the text in RFC 2046 could be clarified to 
reflect field experience with multipart/alternative better.  It's certainly 
helpful in practice for a multipart/alternative viewer to give the user the 
option to view the different alternatives.  Indeed, I frequently prefer the 
plain text 1st part to ransom-letter HTML in the 2nd part.

The bottom line is that a user's preference doesn't necessarily align with 
the order selected by the originating software.
