Greetings. The IPsec WG mailing list now has a discussion about the 
usefulness and feasibility of an application-layer API to IPsec. This 
would allow an application to see if it is running over IPsec and, if 
so, what kind of authentication was used (possibly to allow 
authorization in the application). The discussion just started; 
applications folks might want to join in.
