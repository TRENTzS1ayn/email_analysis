given the vehemence of this debate, would there be interest in pursuing an 
idea of making a more complete multipart/alternative specification 
(including the RFC 1766 stuff, discussion of various scenarios including 
our by-now long experience with Outlook's use of the feature) and pushing 
it onto the standards track as an update to MIME?
