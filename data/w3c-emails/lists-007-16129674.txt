Sounds like a good idea. However, I think the type should be given
a new name, for example multipart/choices, because so many existing
mailers treat multipart/alternative so badly that no one will ever
dare using it except in accordance with its original spec in
the first MIME version.

In general, if an existing feature is implemented badly, IETF
prefers to use a new name for the new feature, in order to
avoid clashes with old implementations. Examples of this is
Errors-To:,
Return-Receipt-To:,
Read-Receipt-To:,
X-Confirm-reading-to:,
Return-Receipt-Requested,
Register-Mail-Reply-Requested-By:

or Encoding: specified in RFC 1154 and RFC 1505, which was
replaced by Content-Transfer-Encoding in MIME.
