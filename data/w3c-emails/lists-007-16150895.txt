I did not mean "badly" from the implementors view. However, if
a message is sent in English, German and French, and shown
to a person who cannot read French only in the French version,
then that implementation is obviously bad from the user's
viewpoint.

Its is not reasonable to expect that a new definition of this
will be rapidly implemented. It is reasonable to expect that
many mailers will for a long time follow the original MIME
specification of multipart/alternative. Note that there are
still many implementations which treat multipart/alternative
as multipart/mixed (which actually happens to be better
than the most common present implementation of
multipart/alternative in the case of multiple languages).

Is there an established base of support for alternative,
which is better than multipart/mixed for multi-language
messages? None of the systems I tested did better than
multipart/mixed. And none of the systems seemed to
recognize the "differences" attribute to
multipart/alternative.
