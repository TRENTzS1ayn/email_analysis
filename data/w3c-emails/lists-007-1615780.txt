   From: Julian Reschke [mailto:julian.reschke@greenbytes.de]

   one concern, almost the same as with the old approach (PROPFIND
   with label header):

   Which hrefs should be reported? I think the href property should be
   the URI of the version, not the one of the VCR or the VHR.

As indicated in the DAV:labeled-version example, the URI is the
one of the VCR (just like a Depth PROPFIND).  But see the answer
to your next question.

   Also: what is the DAV:version property that appears in the example?

I should have mentioned that I resurrected the old DAV:version
property to make the DAV:labeled-version report work cleanly.
The DAV:version property only appears on version resources,
and contains the server-defined URL for that version.

So the DAV:labeled-version report always reports the VCR URL,
but can also report the version URL (and/or the version history URL)
if requested to do so by the client (i.e. specifies
DAV:version and/or DAV:version-history in the DAV:prop request
element.

Does this address your concern?

Cheers,
Geoff
