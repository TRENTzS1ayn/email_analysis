Jacob,

please explain to me how an existing UA will fare any better when
presented with multipart/choices than it fares when presented
with multipart/alternative.

in either case the UA has to be upgraded before displaying the content
ideally for the recipient.

we know that there are at least a few UAs that currently allow
the recipient to choose which of a multipart/alternative to 
display.  they will not do this with multipart/choices.

Keith
