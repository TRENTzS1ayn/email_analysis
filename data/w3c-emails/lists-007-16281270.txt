With multipart/choices there is still potential for information loss, 
because some clients fail to follow the specs regarding treatment
of multipart/unknown.

Even with multipart/mixed, if the desired content is presented as an 
attachment, this can effectively cause information loss if the recipient
doesn't understand that the version he/she understands is in that 
attachment, and/or he/she doesn't know how to read that attachment.
