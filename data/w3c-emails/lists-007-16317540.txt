I've seen such implementations, but not any time recently. A couple of
them appeared right after MIME first came out. For some reason people
just couldn't get their head around the generic nature of multipart and
the notion of falling back to multipart/mixed.

The implementions I remember that did this were mostly gateway sorts of things,
and given how the landscape has changed I suspect they are extinct. But
it is always impossible to be sure about stuff like this.
