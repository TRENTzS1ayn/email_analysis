granted.  perhaps I should have said "nearly useless to applications".
(of course, just because something has a large market doesn't necessarily
mean it's useful)

granted that it will be much harder to design, but the idea that the
end hosts can decide how to set up an SA suitable to authenticate to
applications, without the applications being involved, strikes me as
extremely dubious.  which is why I've never felt like IPsec was very
valuable without an application-layer API.
