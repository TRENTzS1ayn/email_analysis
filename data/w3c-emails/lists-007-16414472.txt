The main problem with application use of IPSec is that it crosses the
application/OS boundary. Crossing such boundaries is tricky -- it places
additional constraints on vendors, release schedules, and so on.

Remember, applications already have TLS/SSL. And while TLS/SSL has many
disadvantages in terms of performance, applicability to UDP, and so on, it has
one truly overwhelming advantage: It is entirely within the application's
control. Application developers spend a lot of their time working around OS
differences, bugs, and other issues, and are underwhelmed by the prospect of
additional issues in this area.

Unless IPSec has a really good story to tell appliccations about the advantages
that will accrue from its use as well as some indication that it will actually
deploy in a fashion that's usable by applications, I despair of getting
applications people fired up about it.
