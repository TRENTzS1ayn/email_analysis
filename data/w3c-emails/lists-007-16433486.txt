Network Computing has an article in the current issue about 
Applications Performance Measurement, with lots of talk about the 
IETF work on it. <http://www.networkcomputing.com/1210/1210f4.html> 
The article is written by the author of the following draft, which is 
being discussed in the RMONMIB WG:

   "Application Performance Measurement MIB", Steven Waldbusser, 03/07/2001,
   <draft-ietf-rmonmib-apm-mib-03.txt>

     This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
     (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-
     based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for
     measuring the application performance as experienced by end-
     users.

Applications folks may want to follow this.
