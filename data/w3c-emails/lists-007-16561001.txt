I just know I'm going to feel dumb when you point out the obvious but
frankly I don't get your point at all.

I've just finished processing the "preceding" header so I've got the
boundary marker and now I'm moving through the content.  I simply
substitute some standard string for digest purposes for every boundary
marker as I come across it.

What am I missing?

Jim

    The problem is that the separator is buried in the preceeding header.
    Handling that correctly ups the complexity considerability. IMO the
    added complexity isn't worth it.
