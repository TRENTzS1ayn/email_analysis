some translators change multipart boundary markers.

while Ned is correct that there's no need to do this when downgrading
from 8bit/binary/q-p to base64 because multipart boundaries inherently
cannot be confused with base64, there are re-encoders that can "upgrade"
as well as "downgrade", and which use the same code path to convert from 
one encoding to another regardless of whether the destination is base64.  
for those re-encoders it's easier to always rewrite boundary markers.
