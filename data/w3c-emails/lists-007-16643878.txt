Yes, it certainly would.  This would make the message insensitive to 
encoding modification in transit.   This is a highly desirable feature, 
particularly for large volume contents that would ideally be transferred 
end-to-end with BINARY encodings (audio, video, images).   Very useful.

Yes ... I should have read on before typing above ... but I agree.

Which is highly beneficial in high volume composition and delivery 
situations like document (bills, statements, forms etc.) production 
engines.
