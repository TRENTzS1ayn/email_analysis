Hello all.

This message is a request for comments on draft
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-singh-eaddr-00.txt. This memo
simply extends the ENUM idea in RFC 2916 to get various contact URIs
using an email address, instead of a telephone address, as the starting
point. The question to this group is if this is a useful idea to pursue.

Abstract:

"ENUM uses NAPTR DNS Resource Records (RRs) to map an E.164 telephone
 number to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) of other ways of
 contacting (for example, by email) a specific resource. This memo
 proposes an ENUM-like service called EADDR where an email address,
 instead of a telephone number, is used as the key to fetch other
 contact URIs. At human level, EADDR seems more useful than ENUM
 because it is easier to remember an email address than a telephone
 number as the key. At machine level, both services are equally
 useful."
