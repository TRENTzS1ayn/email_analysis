Hallo,

thanks to all who already sent in their commments, I already included in 
the "01" version in preparation the following changes:

Section 3.2

      local-phone =  [ exit-code ] dial-number

      local-phone =/ exit-code [ dial-number ]

(...)

   Notes:
      the "+" character is reserved for use in global-phone and MUST NOT
      be used in a local-phone string;

      please note that a local-phone string MUST NOT be a null string,
      i.e. at least an exit-code, or a dial-number or both MUST be
      present.
                                              
*** in fact the local-phone string cannot be a null string!

Section 6

   A Dial Sequence using exit-code "0", a wait for dial tone,
   local-phone for an International "800" toll-free number dialled
   from Beglium (international prefix "00"), and a post-dial sequence
   to access a voice mailbox with userID "334422" and Personal
   Identification Number (PIN) code "1234":

      0w00800-39380023pp334422p1234

*** the previous example was WRONG !

Section 7

   This proposal creates a full standard text encoding for Dial
   Sequences, including GSTN / E.164 addresses, and thus provides a
   unique common representation method both for standard protocols
   and applications.

   Some definitions, like these corresponding to an alias of the generic
   phone-string element, are somewhat a theoretical distinction; however
   they are useful to provide a more subtle distinction, allowing other
   specifications to be more exact in a consistent way, too.

   The proposal is consistent with existing standard specifications.

*** it seems that expliciting the reason why exit-code, phone-dial, 
post-dial etc... exists is a good idea.

Section 9

      global-phone = "+" 1*( DIGIT / written-sep )

      local-phone =  [ exit-code ] dial-number

      local-phone =/ exit-code [ dial-number ]
       

*** consequently also the local-phone definition here has been updated, 
and an ABNF syntax error was corrected, too

Ok, all these changes will be included in version "01", and anything else 
needed after your comments, too.

Regards,
