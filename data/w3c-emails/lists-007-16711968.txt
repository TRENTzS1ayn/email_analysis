Not sure whether to agree or disagree. :)

Exactly. The choice will have various trade-offs for this and similar
problems.

- Loosely-coupled query framework - Result based on queries to DNS, Metadata
server, and Data server, or a tighter coupling in terms of role of a
particular protocol server (for example, ENUM (and EADDR) using DNS for
functionality beyond SRV and A queries).

- Access control in terms of who can ask and/or update what.

- (Ab)using an existing, deployed protocol or defining one anew? What criteria
define an abuse and are they reasonable in contrast with other factors in
favor of using something extant? What criteria justify creating a new
protocol? The dreadful question IMHO seems to be where do you stop touching
DNS? Also, where to start and stop using directory services like LDAP?

I don't know.
