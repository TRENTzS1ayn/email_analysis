A VCCl is a VCR, so it also has a DAV:auto-version property,
which does what you expect.  In particular, look at the
DAV:modify-configuration postconditions of 12.12, 12.13, and 12.14.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

is there a simalar thing like the auto-version property of a VCR (or is it a
property of a version of the VCR? anyway) for a VCC/Baseline?

Well the other way around: Is there a mechanism to automatically perform a
checkin on a checked out VCC while a VCR (member of the very VCC) is checked
in?

Regards,
Daniel
