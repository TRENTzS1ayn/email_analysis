Definitely yes.

I expect it to be common for servers to constrain where baselined
collections can occur (e.g. the entire workspace, or the immediate
members of the workspace).  That was one of the motivations for the
DAV:baselined-collection-set property for a workspace, so that a
client can discover where the baselined collections are in a workspace.

Cheers,
Geoff

HI,

happy new year to everyone!

And now my question: Is a DeltaV server allowed to automatically put a
workspace under baseline control at creation time (MKWORKSPACE)? This would
be similar to automatically put a resource under version control at creation
time via PUT.

Regards,
Daniel
