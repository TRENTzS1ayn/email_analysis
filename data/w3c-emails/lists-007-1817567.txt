Yes, the DAV:checkout-set is defined to be the "checked-out resources"
which includes both checked-out VCR's and working resources.

Hi,

a version does have a checkout set property containing all the uri's of the
VCR's the very version is the value of the checked-out version property.
Does this set also contain the WR's this version was checked out with?

Regards,
Daniel
