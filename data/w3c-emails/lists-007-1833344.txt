The version URL must be accessed by DAV:checked-in because you may need to 
get it sometime later, after the version was created. It certainly could 
be returned in the location header of the VERSION-CONTROL method too in 
order to prevent the extra round trip.

        Subject:        Localisation header on creating a new version

 

Hi,
if I read the spec correctly on creation of a new (initial) version by 
VERSION-CONTROL
the version URL must be accessed by DAV:checked-in of the new VCR.
Using CHECKIN to create an additional version returns the version URL in a 
Location
header. BTW, I guess that a CHECKIN on a baseline also returns the 
baseline URL.
So why don't we return a Location header with VERSION-CONTROL and 
BASELINE-CONTROL
if a new version/baseline was created ?

Cheers, Edgar
