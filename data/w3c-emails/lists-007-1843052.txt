The rationale for having CHECKIN return a Location header was that
the "primary purpose" of the CHECKIN request is to create a new 
resource (i.e. a new version resource), while the "primary purpose" of
a VERSION-CONTROL request is to put an existing resource under
version control (and the creation of a version and a
version history was merely a side effect).

But this rationale is not nearly as compelling as something like
CHECKOUT returning the location of a new working resource in the
Location header, in which case unlike CHECKIN, you don't have
any other good way to find the URL of the resource you just created.

So the use of the Location header in CHECKIN is probably best thought
of as a historical quirk.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,
if I read the spec correctly on creation of a new (initial) version by
VERSION-CONTROL
the version URL must be accessed by DAV:checked-in of the new VCR.
Using CHECKIN to create an additional version returns the version URL in a
Location
header. BTW, I guess that a CHECKIN on a baseline also returns the baseline
URL.
So why don't we return a Location header with VERSION-CONTROL and
BASELINE-CONTROL
if a new version/baseline was created ?
