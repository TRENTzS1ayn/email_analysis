Hi,

I'd like to know whether I well understood : the mechanism of checkout-put-checkin cretes a new version of a resource, while the lock-unlock mechanism allows to modify a resource without creating a new version, is that right ?
Can someone explain me the exact difference between this two mechanisms ?

Thanx
