Hi,

a question dealing with activities:

Suppose two  workspaces A and B. Both of them are under baseline control on
its own. Now suppose an activity C. Is there a server side mechanism defined
in DeltaV that could prevent a client from checking out resources of WS A
and B and including them by the way into activity C. Instead a client should
be forced to checkout a resource of WS B into a different activity if
activity C allready contains a checked out resource of workspace A.

From reading the DeltaV I got no idea how to do this, propably it's not even
there ...

Thanks,
Daniel
