Elodie,

correct -- indeed the version is a resource, so checking-in creates a new 
version resource.

this is also correct.  Locking a resource just causes a state change in 
the locked resource; it does not create any other resources.

Locking is typically used in a multi-user environment.  Obtaining a lock 
permits you to modify a resource and prevents others from modifying the 
resource.  This allows you to ensure others' contents are not overwritten, 
and you can set consistent content and dead properties for example.
Checking out and in are used to capture a meaningful state of a resource 
as a version.  It is meaningful to do this in single or multi-user 
environments.  The captured states can be 'viewed' or restored at some 
later time.

Locking and versioning are separate concepts.
