Daniel,

You are right that there is no way to restrict an activity resource only 
to select versions of a single workspace.  Given that all checked-out 
resources (i.e. working-resources as well as checked-out 
version-controlled resources) have an unprotected DAV:activity-set, this 
would be potentially very expensive to enforce -- it would have to be done 
on the proppatch.  DeltaV does not preclude servers from enforcing such a 
rule if you choose to do so. but it is not required by the protocol 
definition.

Regards,
Tim

Hi,

a question dealing with activities:

Suppose two  workspaces A and B. Both of them are under baseline control 
on
its own. Now suppose an activity C. Is there a server side mechanism 
defined
in DeltaV that could prevent a client from checking out resources of WS A
and B and including them by the way into activity C. Instead a client 
should
be forced to checkout a resource of WS B into a different activity if
activity C allready contains a checked out resource of workspace A.

From reading the DeltaV I got no idea how to do this, propably it's not 
even
there ...

Thanks,
Daniel
