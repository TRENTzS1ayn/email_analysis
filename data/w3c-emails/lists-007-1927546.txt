Hi,

just for clarification and reassurance:

Suppose a workspace WS with uri /ws that is under baseline-control and the
auto-version property of the version controlled collection representing the
baseline controlled workspace WS is set to checkout-checkin.

Now suppose a MKCOL request on uri /ws/folder. With that "directory" folder
is created within the workspace WS. Does the creation of this folder cause a
new baseline to be created within the baseline-history of the vcc
representing WS?

I assume it would do, if so is it a MUST or a SHOULD? From my reading I
assume MUST.


Thanks,
Daniel
