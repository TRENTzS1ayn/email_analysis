When you say "the version controlled collection representing the baseline 
controlled workspace" do you mean the _version-controlled configuration_ 
of the workspace or the workspace itself?  I'll assume you mean the 
configuration.

No.  Modifications to the resources making up the configuration are not 
considered modifications to the version-controlled configuration resource 
itself.  If they were, you would be able to lock an entire configuration 
etc. by locking this one resource.

I assume it would not.  Which part of the spec. are you referring to?
