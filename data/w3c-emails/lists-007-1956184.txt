   From: Kirmse, Daniel [mailto:daniel.kirmse@sap.com]

   Suppose a workspace WS with uri /ws that is under baseline-control
   and the auto-version property of the version controlled collection
   representing the baseline controlled workspace WS is set to
   checkout-checkin.

I think you mean the "version-controlled configuration" here, not
the "version-controlled collection".

   Now suppose a MKCOL request on uri /ws/folder. With that "directory"
folder
   is created within the workspace WS. Does the creation of this folder
cause a
   new baseline to be created within the baseline-history of the vcc
   representing WS?

   I assume it would do, if so is it a MUST or a SHOULD? From my reading I
   assume MUST.

The creation of a folder does not trigger the creation of a
new baseline (baselines track the state of version-controlled resources).
So you would have to change the version-controlled state of the
workspace to see the creation of a new baseline (e.g. CHECKIN, 
VERSION-CONTROL, UPDATE, or MERGE to the workspace)

But if your server automatically puts resources under version control
when they are created (including collections), and if DAV:auto-version
is appropriately set on /ws, then the MKCOL would result in the creation
of a new version of /ws, and the placing of /ws/folder under version
control, which would result in a new baseline (containing the new
version-controlled collection, /ws/folder).

Cheers,
Geoff
