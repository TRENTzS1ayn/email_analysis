Ok, that is clear.  Apologies to Daniel for my misleading response. That 
is not how I remembered it.

I'm left wondering why this is so.  On the face of it, these 
postconditions mean that where a baseline-controlled collection has a 
checked-in version-controlled configuration there is a guarantee that the 
membership of the configuration (rooted at the baseline-controlled 
collection) is the same as that represented by the checked-in 
version-controlled configuration -- however, that only covers the 
checked-in version-controlled members of the configuration ... there can 
be variance by non-version-controlled members and/or checked-out 
version-controlled members.  So what is the value of this postcondition?

Regards,
Tim
