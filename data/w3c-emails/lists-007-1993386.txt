   I'm left wondering why this is so.  On the face of it, these
   postconditions mean that where a baseline-controlled collection has
   a checked-in version-controlled configuration there is a guarantee
   that the membership of the configuration (rooted at the
   baseline-controlled collection) is the same as that represented by
   the checked-in version-controlled configuration -- however, that
   only covers the checked-in version-controlled members of the
   configuration ... there can be variance by non-version-controlled
   members and/or checked-out version-controlled members.  So what is
   the value of this postcondition?

The purpose of these postconditions is so that you can get some
default baselining behavior for a baselining-unaware client,
just as DAV:auto-version on a VCR gives you default versioning
behavior for a versioning-unaware client.  In particular,
the reasonable time to automatically create a new baseline would
be when it would capture a different value than the current baseline,
(i.e. when the DAV:checked-in version of one of the version-controlled
members has changed).

Cheers,
Geoff
