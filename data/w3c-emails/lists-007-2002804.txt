I'm not quite sure what you are asking here.
Perhaps if you made the question more concrete, it would be more
understandable,
e.g. "if I do a Depth:xxx PROPFIND on a collection like yyy, would the
result
be aaa or bbb".

Cheers,
Geoff

Subject: depth header


In WebDAV methods where there can be a Depth header, the rule is :
"0" : the method applies only to the resource
"1" : to the resource and its immediate children
"infinity" : to the resource and all its progeny

Ok, but what does it mean for a collection, that contains usually many
resources : does the  1 or infinity give informations about the
resources/files in the collection/directory ?
It's not clear for me...
