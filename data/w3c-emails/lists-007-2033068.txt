I think it would be simpler to create a new activity, let's say 
/foo/unique, then do all the subsequent check-outs with a request body 
including an activity set, but not including unreserved, i.e., 
<DAV:checkout> <DAV:activity-set> 
<DAV:href>http://bar/foo/unique</DAV:href> </DAV:activity-set> 
</DAV:checkout>. The DAV:one-checkout-per-activity-per-history 
precondition (Sec.13.10) should do it.
