Yup, you can do that.  The DAV:current-workspace-set is a computed 
property; i.e., it's value is defined as a function of another property. 
In this case the other property is a workspace's DAV:current-activity-set, 
the definition of which states 'The DAV:current-activity-set MAY be 
restricted to identify at most one activity.' (13.4.1)
