Yes, that is acceptable behavior.  It probably will in fact be very
common for the DAV:current-workspace-set property to be limited to
at most one workspace.

Note though that this only limits *concurrent* additions to the same
activity to be from the same workspace.  If a user in one workspace is
done with the activity, and removes it from the DAV:current-activity-set
of that workspace, the activity can now be worked on in another workspace.

Cheers,
Geoff

Would it be acceptable to have server with the following behavior:

A client performs a checkout to a VCR located within a certain workspace WS
to some activity not containing any versions yet. Regarding to this the
DAV:current-workspace-set property must be empty. 
After the checkout the DAV:current-workspace-set property contains a href of
WS. 
Now the server is implemented that way that DAV:current-workspace-set does
contain one workspace at most.
Given that a checkout to a VCR located within a different workspace WS' to
the very same activity must fail.
With that an activity is only able to contain versions of resources of one
workspace only.

Regards,
Daniel
