Hi,

suppose I have a repository landscape with a workspace under
baseline-control. The workspace contains my VCR's. Checkout is done with
DAV:apply-to-version and DAV:activity-set (href or new). So Work in process
is represented by working-resources collected in activities.

Well what if a client wants to add a file to the repository using a given
activity (or a newly created one). The file should be placed under version
control automatically. Do it have to directly add the file/resource to the
workspace where all the VCR's are stored? Or is there a way to have a
working resource connected to the activity and creating the VCR of that file
at checkin?

May I perform a checkout to a not existing VCR (like locking a not existing
resource in WebDAV to reserve the name) with apply-to-version and
activoity-set to get an working-resource in my activity? What happens when I
checkin this (creation of VCR, version-history etc.)? What happens when I
want to revert this (uncheckout? is this defined for working-resources to -
I suppose it is)

Regards,
Daniel
