If the working resources were created by checking out VCR's
with DAV:apply-to-versoin, then there is no difference between
checking in the activity and MERGEing the activity with
DAV:checkin-activity set.

The only reason DAV:checkin-activity is provided as a parameter
to MERGE is to support clients that create working resources by
checking out versions (in which case checking in the activity just
creates new versions, while MERGE both creates the versions and
merges them to the specified collection.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

suppose I have a repository landscape with a workspace under
baseline-control. The workspace contains my VCR's. Checkout is done with
DAV:apply-to-version and DAV:activity-set (href or new). So Work in process
is represented by working-resources collected in activities.


What is the difference of performing a checkin on the activity or do a merge
of that activity to the workspace the VCR's are located in with
DAV:checkin-activity?

Regards,
Daniel
