Subject: Version-controlled collection CHECKOUT


Hi,

does the checkout behavior of a version-controlled collection be the same as
the checkout behavior of a version-controlled resource with
DAV:apply-to-version flag? (Because of working-collection sounds similar to
working-resource) 
Is there the same behavior for parallel development (parallel checkouts,
checkin behavior) as for working-resources?

Regards,
Daniel
