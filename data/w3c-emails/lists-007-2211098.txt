Hi,

suppose this:

/foo
        |
        +- /bar
             |
             +- foobar.c

all the resources are under version-control. Now suppose this sequence of
requests:

CHECKOUT /foo/bar
  DAV:apply-to-version

(working-collection: /wc/wc1  auto-update: /foo/bar)

CHECKOUT /foo
  DAV:apply-to-version

(working-collection: /wc/wc2, auto-update: /foo)

delete folder /foo/bar:
DELETE /wc/wc2/bar   
or is it done via the real VCR? I hope not! The DELETE should be hidden
until checkin!

CHECKIN /wc/wc2
(applied to /foo -> the folder /bar and all its content is gone)

CHECKIN /wc/wc1
(must fail because the VCR the auto-update should go to is gone)


Questions:
1. Is this right?
2. If yes: Shouldn't the deletion be prevented or fail because a subfolder
is checked out and therefore some kind of "locked"?


Regards,
Daniel
