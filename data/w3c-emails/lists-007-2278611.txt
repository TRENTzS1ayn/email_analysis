Yes, a scenarios document is badly needed.  Anyone who is willing to start
such a document will be doing a valuable service.

Currently, most of the time available to the designers of the DeltaV
protocol for standards-related work is focused on getting the Java
binding to DeltaV defined (WVCM: JSR-147),
but when we get that done, I hope to have some subset of us focused on
the scenarios document.  It would be great if we could do both,
but realistically, we all have "real jobs" that we need to spend at
least some of our time doing (:-).

Until then, please keep those scenario questions coming to the mailing
list, since that makes the email archive a significant source of
information,
and is likely to find its way into both the FAQ and the scenarios document.

Cheers,
Geoff

By the way: My experience with the DeltaV Spec is that many people have
problems to actually understand what can be done using DeltaV. In my
oppinion it is mainly a misunderstanding. Most people I talked to to "sell"
DeltaV expect the spec to describe how the can use DeltaV to have some
versioning done. They wish to have more examples, even the not so simple
ones, provided with the spec. (I for myself did to!) Sure it is not the task
of a spec to explain use cases. It would puff up the whole thing. But what
about the Szenarios document that is on the DeltaV Homepage? This would be
the right place for such use cases or best practices. Why isn't this pursued
anymore?


P.P.S:
An answer to Tim: I will eventually put all my "a ha"'s on the FAQ (so I
have an archive for my questions ;o) ). But it will take some time (I have
to find a time slot to do this reasonably).
