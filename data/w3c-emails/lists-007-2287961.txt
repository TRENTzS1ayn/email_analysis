   although the new collection will not be version-controlled, the
   parent of the new collection will have been modified to add the new
   internal member name, so it much be checked-out (automatically or
   otherwise).  Inthis respect, there is no difference between a MKCOL
   and a PUT, DELETE, etc.

No, only the addition/removal of a version-controlled internal
member requires the version-controlled collection to be checked out.
In particular, quoting from section 14:

 "Non-version-controlled bindings are not under version control, and
 therefore can be added or deleted without checking out the
 version-controlled collection."

So you do not need to checkout a version-controlled collection in
order to use PUT and MKCOL to create new non-version-controlled
resources in that collection, or use DELETE to delete
non-version-controlled resources from that collection.

Cheers,
Geoff
