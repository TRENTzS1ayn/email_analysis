For a workspace's DAV:baseline-controlled-collection-set,
for their DAV:version-controlled-configurations, 
is their DAV:workspace property value required to be 
the same as the workspace?

I am thinking it is not required, because 6.2.1 says

  The DAV:workspace property of a workspace resource MUST identify
  itself.  The DAV:workspace property of any other type of resource
  MUST be the same as the DAV:workspace of its parent collection.

and I can't find a requirement that a VCCn must be a member 
of its associated workspace.

Is my understanding correct?

Thanks,
Roy
