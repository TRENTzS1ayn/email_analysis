   For a workspace's DAV:baseline-controlled-collection-set,
   for their DAV:version-controlled-configurations, 
   is their DAV:workspace property value required to be 
   the same as the workspace?

   I am thinking it is not required, because 6.2.1 says

     The DAV:workspace property of a workspace resource MUST identify
     itself.  The DAV:workspace property of any other type of resource
     MUST be the same as the DAV:workspace of its parent collection.

   and I can't find a requirement that a VCCn must be a member 
   of its associated workspace.

   Is my understanding correct?

Yes, that is correct.  Commonly, a VCCn will not be a member of
its associated workspace.

Cheers,
Geoff
