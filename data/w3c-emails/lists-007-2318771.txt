No, not "400:Conflict.

Either "409: Conflict" if the resource could be put under version control,
or "403: Forbidden" if the resource cannot be put under version control.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

what would be the expected response code for a DAV:version-tree report on a
resource which is not version controlled? Bad Request?

Julian
