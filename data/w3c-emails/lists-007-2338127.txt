The meaning of these error codes is defined by 2616,
and the DeltaV spec makes a point of not repeating information from
the base spec (so that we automatically inherit any
later revision of 2616, rather than conflict with it).

Cheers,
Geoff

this make sense.

The spec could be a bit clearer, though :-)
