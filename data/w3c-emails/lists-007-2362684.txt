No offense taken!
(Sorry if I sounded offended ... I didn't feel offended :-).

But I'm glad that you followed up, because that saves me from
having to follow up my own post (which I hate to do :-).

In particular, I was going to add that in addition to the 403/409,
you should have 
  <DAV:error> <DAV:supported-report/> </DAV:error>
in the response body or DAV:responsedescription.  (See section 3.6).

We didn't want to have "must be version or VCR" in the precondition
for the DAV:version-tree report, to allow future extensions to allow
this report on other kinds of resources.

Cheers,
Geoff

Geoff,

no offense intended.

I think it would be clearer if the status (being a VCR or a version) would
explicitly be listed as precondition.
