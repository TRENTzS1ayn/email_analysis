The example is right, it should be DAV:merge-preview-report.
I'll fix that in the final editing pass.

Thanks for noticing and reporting this!

Cheers,

The marshalling for the DAV:merge-preview report in 11.3 says the response
body must be a DAV:merge-preview-response XML element. But the example in
11.3.1 has a DAV:merge-preview-report XML element instead. Which is correct?

Thanks,
Roy
