How should the response for an activity checkin (as defined by 13.11) be marshalled? 

Should the response code be 201 or 207? Should there be a Location header containing the URL for each new version resource created? Should the response body be a DAV:multistatus element with a DAV:href for each new version resource created?

Thanks,
Roy
