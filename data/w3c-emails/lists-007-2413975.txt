Hi !

I read that in the DeltaV specifications : 
"A common problem that motivates the use of activities is that it is often desirable to perform several different logical changes in a single workspace, and then selectively merge a subset of those logical changes to other workspaces. "



Maybe because I'm french, but I don't understand what "logical change" means : it has no sens to translate literally this expression.

Can someone explain me it ?

Thanx
