Hi,

I will try to give a explanation.....

A "logical change" is one where several files are modified to implement a
single fix or 
enhancement request.

So let's imagine a developer has been asked to change the color scheme of a
web page.  
He has to change the HTML and modify the colors but also has to modify some
GIF images 
used on the page to change their colors.  He is modifying many files but is
making one 
"logical change".

In the same DeltaV workspace another developer has been asked to change a
price for an 
item that is being advertised for sale on the website.  He needs to change
several pieces 
of HTML in different frames to update the price.  This is another "logical
change".

A project manager may decide to start a new workspace for some further
updates to the web 
site, he wants to include the price update but does not want to include the
color change.  
If activities are used to track the above two changes he can use the
activity to merge 
only the desired change into his new workspace.

Hope this helps.

Regards,
