Hi,

I wonder what happens when I copy or move a VCR? 
For COPY I'd expect to got a new VCR at the destination with an exact copy
of properties. This implies that the new created VCR must share the
version-history with the source VCR. Is this correct? Is this desireable?
Defining this behavior as not expected by the user, I'd say COPY means
creation of a new version-history and copy of the checked-in version to that
new VH. With that the checked-in property of the copied VCR must change.
Same for MOVE except for the deletion of the source. 

Regards,
Daniel
