Hi,

I think this is desirable and correct but with one caveat...

Both in section 1.3 (where the workspace term is defined) and in section 6
the DeltaV specification says that you can only have one VCR for a given
version history in a workspace.  If copy created a new VCR but pointed to
the original VHR then this rule could be violated if the destination is in
the same workspace as the source of the copy.
If the copy does not break this rule then it would be fine to have two VCRs
pointing to the same version history.

I certainly wouldn't have thought that moving a VCR would create a new
history resource.

Hi,

I wonder what happens when I copy or move a VCR? 
Defining this behavior as not expected by the user, I'd say COPY means
creation of a new version-history and copy of the checked-in version to that
new VH. With that the checked-in property of the copied VCR must change.
Same for MOVE except for the deletion of the source. 

Regards,
Daniel
