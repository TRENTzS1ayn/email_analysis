So my first assumption was right - except for workspaces
Thanks for clarification

Hi,

I think this is desirable and correct but with one caveat... 

Both in section 1.3 (where the workspace term is defined) and in section 6 
the DeltaV specification says that you can only have one VCR for a given 
version history in a workspace.  If copy created a new VCR but pointed to 
the original VHR then this rule could be violated if the destination is in 
the same workspace as the source of the copy. 
If the copy does not break this rule then it would be fine to have two VCRs 
pointing to the same version history. 

I certainly wouldn't have thought that moving a VCR would create a new 
history resource.

Hi, 

I wonder what happens when I copy or move a VCR? 
Defining this behavior as not expected by the user, I'd say COPY means 
creation of a new version-history and copy of the checked-in version to that

new VH. With that the checked-in property of the copied VCR must change. 
Same for MOVE except for the deletion of the source. 

Regards, 
Daniel
