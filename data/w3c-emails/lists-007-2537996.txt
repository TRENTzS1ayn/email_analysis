Hi,

The ACL specification defines a "pseudo-principal" called DAV:all this
represents
all users.  So you could set an ACL on all resources denying write to
DAV:all.
Something that contains an ACE like....

  <D:ace> 
    <D:principal> 
      <D:all/> 
    </D:principal> 
    <D:deny> 
    <D:privilege> <D:write/> </D:privilege>  
    </D:deny> 
  </D:ace> 

Regards,

Subject: Preventing a resource from being written


Hi,

Suppose that I want to prevent a resource from being modified, just read.
And I use only what Webdav or ACL offers, not DeltaV.
What can I do ?
I can't set a infinite lock on that resource : it's "dangerous" and not nice
;o)
I could use the access control protocol, maybe, but I don't know how to
proceed : must I create juste one principal, that represent anyone, and has
a "read-only" right ?
What would be a good solution ?

thanx
