Just to make sure there is no confusion on this point,
the behavior of COPY is independent of whether or not
the destination is in a workspace.  In either case, a new
resource is created at the destination, which has no
relationship to the source resource, other than having the
same content and dead properties.

The behavior of MOVE is also independent of whether or not
the destination is a workspace, except that a MOVE from one
workspace to another will fail if there already is a VCR
for that version history in the target workspace.

Note: This means that Daniels first assumption was incorrect,
but instead the defined behavior is closer to the behavior
that he wished was the case.

Cheers,
Geoff

So my first assumption was right - except for workspaces
Thanks for clarification

Hi,

>of properties. This implies that the new created VCR must share the

I think this is desirable and correct but with one caveat... 
Both in section 1.3 (where the workspace term is defined) and in section 6 
the DeltaV specification says that you can only have one VCR for a given 
version history in a workspace.  If copy created a new VCR but pointed to 
the original VHR then this rule could be violated if the destination is in 
the same workspace as the source of the copy. 
If the copy does not break this rule then it would be fine to have two VCRs 
pointing to the same version history. 
I certainly wouldn't have thought that moving a VCR would create a new 
history resource.

Hi, 
I wonder what happens when I copy or move a VCR? 
Defining this behavior as not expected by the user, I'd say COPY means 
creation of a new version-history and copy of the checked-in version to that

new VH. With that the checked-in property of the copied VCR must change. 
Same for MOVE except for the deletion of the source. 
Regards, 
Daniel
