I've just posted a copy of the "final edited" draft of deltav-20
to the web site.  I left "change bars" on, so that you can more
easily see/find the changes.  Note: this is not an internet draft,
since deltav-20 is the final draft, but rather a document summarizing
the changes I will be making in the "author's 48 hour final review".

Also, I updated the changes-and-issues file to identify these changes.
Please let me know if you think I missed any that we agreed to make.

As for where we are in the queue ... we appear to be at the "top" of
the queue, in that there are no other documents ahead of us that are
in "EDIT" (i.e. pending RFC editor processing) state, and there
is one document submitted a couple of weeks later than us that is
already in AUTH48 (author's 48 hour review) state.

Cheers,
Geoff

Geoff,

two questions:

1) AFAIK the draft that actually was submitted to the IETF differs from the
last public draft in some minor changes in the marshalling for
supported-method-set and supported-report-set. Would it be possible to
update the deltaV home page with the "right" text?

2) What's the status anyway? I haven't been following these things before,
but 3 months seem to be quite a long time...

Regards, Julian
