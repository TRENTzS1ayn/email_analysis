Hi,
in 12.7.1 there is a nice example of a compare-baseline report.
But how does it look with subbaselines ?
Added or deleted subbaselines won't be a problem.
But how do we describe changed subbaselines ? Here some recursion
seems to be necessary (Depth infinity).
Another remark (not wanting to change that in the current draft):
In 12.12 (one-version-per-history-per-baseline) we extend this
to the subbaselines. I remember this restriction coming from merging problems.
I feel this isn't necessary if merging has a configuration scope (excluding
subconfigurations). 

Cheers, Edgar
