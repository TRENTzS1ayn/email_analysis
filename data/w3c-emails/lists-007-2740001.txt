Hi,

suppose I have two workspaces A and B. Both of them are under
baseline-control. Furthermore I work with working resources and activities
and version-controlled collections (to track namespace operations).
Further Suppose workspace A contains my current development and workspace B
is a consolidation place. Workspace B was created with reference to a
baseline of A. 
The development was going on. Changes were made. Files were added and
deleted.

Now I want to do an update of the consolidation refering to a newer baseline
of A.

How could this be done?

First I would use the compare-baseline report to get a diff of the baseline
A used for creation of B and the newer baseline of A. (Could I compare a
baseline of workspace B with a baseline of A [well, of course comparing
baselines of the version-controlled configurations of B and A]).
But how do I get the changes "merged" into workspace B?
Is this in scope of DeltaV?

Regards,
Daniel
