Hi,

   common base:
   ------------
   suppose I have two workspaces A and B. Both of them are under
   baseline-control (with auto-version).  Furthermore I work with
   working resources and activities and version-controlled collections
   (to track namespace operations).  Further Suppose workspace A
   contains my current development and workspace B is a consolidation
   place. Workspace B was created with reference to a baseline of A.
   I have a VCR a located at workspace A and a VCR b located at
   workspace B both sharing a version history VH-AB.  At time of
   creation of workspace B from a baseline of workspace A. VCR a and
   VCR b had checked-in version V1 of VH-AB.

Now VCR a was changed and a new version V-A2 appeared. Even so VCR b was
changed and a new version V-B2 appeard.

Now some time later I want to discard version V-B2 cause it was kind of a
blind alley.

I use UPDATE to set the checked-in property of VCR b to V-A2.
What puzzles me is that there is no predecessor/successor relation in the
version-history expressing this UPDATE (at least this my understandig of the
UPDATE chapter).

The use of MERGE (with DAV:no-checkout) would fail, because V-A2 and V-B2
are sibblings.

So the question is: How can this discard be done WITH keeping the
information, that the predecessor of V-A2 in the context of VCR b is V-B2?

By the way: Is the version-history report kind of context dependend? The
question arises due to the update problem. I want to know the
version-history  of a vcr (respectively the line of descent of the currently
checked-in version of that VCR).

This Information is needed to revert the UPDATE of VCR b. This must end with
V-B2 beeing the checked-in version of VCR b again.

Regards,
Daniel
