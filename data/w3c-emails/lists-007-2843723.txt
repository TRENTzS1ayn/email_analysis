Reverting to a previous state of the workspace will often involve 
reverting to earlier states of several resources.  In the particular
case described below, you need to remember the state of two resources:
that of /src (so that you revert back to when it had a member called "a"),
and that of /src/a (so that you revert to a particular state of /src/a.

If you want to capture the state of several resources in a workspace,
you can use a "baseline", which would have remembered both the state
of /src, and the state of /src/a.  If you only wanted to revert back to
part of the state captured by a baseline, you can use the
DAV:baseline-collection of that baseline to identify what versions were
selected by that baseline, and then use UPDATE requests to bring back
the parts of the baseline you are interested in.

Cheers,
Geoff

Subject: Revert a Deletion of a VCR using version-controlled Collections


Hi,

what about this one here:

   /src/a

/src is a version-controlled collection (VCC). a is a VCR. By now there is a
version V1 of VCC /src that contains the binding (a) and a "pointer" to the
version-history of a.

Now I delete VCR a. Doing this I get a new version V2 of VCC /src that does
not contain the binding for a anymore.

So far so good. Sometime later I want to revert the deletion of VCR a. So I
do an update of VCC /src so that V1 becomes the checked-in version of VCC
/src again. VCR a will be created again. It points to the right
version-history. But what is the checked-in version of VCR a by now? This
property was gone to the dump earlier at deletion time. The only guess would
be, the checked-in version of VCR a is the root version of the
version-history. Well I my eyes this would be no real revert of the
deletion, cause the state before the deletion and the state after the revert
are not equal.



Regards,
Daniel
