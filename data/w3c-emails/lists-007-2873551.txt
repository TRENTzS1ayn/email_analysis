Hi,

The DTD for DAV:responsedescription is:

<!ELEMENT responsedescription (#PCDATA) >

If you want to put the DAV:error element beneath DAV:responsedescription
then the DTD should be modified to something like:

<!ELEMENT responsedescription (#PCDATA | error)* >

This would allow a mix of character data and the DAV:error element.
As the DTD stands today it only allows character data.

The rationale
for putting it in the DAV:responsedescription node
is that the DAV:responsedescription corresponds to
the "body" of a non-multi-status response, and
that is where the DAV:error node appears in a
non-multi-status response.

This does not violate the DTD for DAV:responsedescription,
because a client is required to ignore any node that it
doesn't understand, so it doesn't matter where you put it.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi, 
Section 1.6 of the DeltaV specification defines how the pre and post
condition XML 
elements should be returned.  It says: 
"the appropriate XML element MUST be returned as the child of a top-level
DAV:error 
element in the response body, unless otherwise negotiated by the request.
In a 207 
Multi-Status response, the DAV:error element would appear in the appropriate

DAV:responsedescription element." 
This is the only definiton of DAV:error, there is no DTD for this element as
far 
as I can tell and no examples of it's use within a multistatus response. 
It would seem to violate the DTD defined in RFC2518 for
DAV:responsedescription. 
Am I correct in thinking that the syntax should be: 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> 
  <D:multistatus xmlns:D="DAV:"> 
    <D:response> 
      <D:href>http://www.merant.com/webdav/ws1/test.html</D:href> 
      <D:status>HTTP/1.1 409 CONFLICT</D:status> 
      <D:responsedescription> 
        <D:error> 
          <D:label-must-exist/> 
        </D:error> 
        Label specified does not exist 
      </D:responsedescription> 
    </D:response> 
  </D:multistatus> 
The human readable text describing the error and the DAV:error element are
children 
of the DAV:responsedescription element.  This seems very odd.  Why not have
the 
DAV:error element as a child of the DAV:response element?
