RE: Definition of DAV:error and it's use in multistatus...Peter,

the DTD isn't normative. It can't be. I think this was discussed to great
length on the ACL mailing list in December, but for some odd reason, the
archive for this particular month is missing...

  Hi,

  The DTD for DAV:responsedescription is:

  <!ELEMENT responsedescription (#PCDATA) >

  If you want to put the DAV:error element beneath DAV:responsedescription
  then the DTD should be modified to something like:

  <!ELEMENT responsedescription (#PCDATA | error)* >

  This would allow a mix of character data and the DAV:error element.
  As the DTD stands today it only allows character data.

  The rationale
  for putting it in the DAV:responsedescription node
  is that the DAV:responsedescription corresponds to
  the "body" of a non-multi-status response, and
  that is where the DAV:error node appears in a
  non-multi-status response.

  This does not violate the DTD for DAV:responsedescription,
  because a client is required to ignore any node that it
  doesn't understand, so it doesn't matter where you put it.

  Cheers,
  Geoff

  Hi,
  Section 1.6 of the DeltaV specification defines how the pre and post
  condition XML
  elements should be returned.  It says:
  "the appropriate XML element MUST be returned as the child of a top-level
  DAV:error
  element in the response body, unless otherwise negotiated by the request.
  In a 207
  Multi-Status response, the DAV:error element would appear in the
appropriate

  DAV:responsedescription element."
  This is the only definiton of DAV:error, there is no DTD for this element
as
  far
  as I can tell and no examples of it's use within a multistatus response.
  It would seem to violate the DTD defined in RFC2518 for
  DAV:responsedescription.
  Am I correct in thinking that the syntax should be:
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <D:multistatus xmlns:D="DAV:">
      <D:response>
        <D:href>http://www.merant.com/webdav/ws1/test.html</D:href>
        <D:status>HTTP/1.1 409 CONFLICT</D:status>
        <D:responsedescription>
          <D:error>
            <D:label-must-exist/>
          </D:error>
          Label specified does not exist
        </D:responsedescription>
      </D:response>
    </D:multistatus>
  The human readable text describing the error and the DAV:error element are
  children
  of the DAV:responsedescription element.  This seems very odd.  Why not
have
  the
  DAV:error element as a child of the DAV:response element?
