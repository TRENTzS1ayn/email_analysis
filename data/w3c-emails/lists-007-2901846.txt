I agree that if DeltaV had a DTD for DAV:responsedescription,
then it should take the form that you describe below,
but my point was that this does not violate the 2518 DTD for
DAV:responsedescription, because you would first strip out
all "unknown" element types (such as DAV:error) before checking
it against the 2518 DTD.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi, 
The DTD for DAV:responsedescription is: 
<!ELEMENT responsedescription (#PCDATA) > 
If you want to put the DAV:error element beneath DAV:responsedescription 
then the DTD should be modified to something like: 
<!ELEMENT responsedescription (#PCDATA | error)* > 
This would allow a mix of character data and the DAV:error element. 
As the DTD stands today it only allows character data.

The rationale 
for putting it in the DAV:responsedescription node 
is that the DAV:responsedescription corresponds to 
the "body" of a non-multi-status response, and 
that is where the DAV:error node appears in a 
non-multi-status response. 
This does not violate the DTD for DAV:responsedescription, 
because a client is required to ignore any node that it 
doesn't understand, so it doesn't matter where you put it. 
Cheers, 
Geoff

Hi, 
Section 1.6 of the DeltaV specification defines how the pre and post 
condition XML 
elements should be returned.  It says: 
"the appropriate XML element MUST be returned as the child of a top-level 
DAV:error 
element in the response body, unless otherwise negotiated by the request. 
In a 207 
Multi-Status response, the DAV:error element would appear in the appropriate

DAV:responsedescription element." 
This is the only definiton of DAV:error, there is no DTD for this element as

far 
as I can tell and no examples of it's use within a multistatus response. 
It would seem to violate the DTD defined in RFC2518 for 
DAV:responsedescription. 
Am I correct in thinking that the syntax should be: 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> 
  <D:multistatus xmlns:D="DAV:"> 
    <D:response> 
      <D:href>http://www.merant.com/webdav/ws1/test.html</D:href> 
      <D:status>HTTP/1.1 409 CONFLICT</D:status> 
      <D:responsedescription> 
        <D:error> 
          <D:label-must-exist/> 
        </D:error> 
        Label specified does not exist 
      </D:responsedescription> 
    </D:response> 
  </D:multistatus> 
The human readable text describing the error and the DAV:error element are 
children 
of the DAV:responsedescription element.  This seems very odd.  Why not have 
the 
DAV:error element as a child of the DAV:response element?
