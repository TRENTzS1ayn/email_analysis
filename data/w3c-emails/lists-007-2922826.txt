1) Yes, COPY choses the name of the destination resource.

2) The former, i.e. you will have a new collection called
"othercontainer" with a single internal member named index.html.

Cheers,

Subject: COPY method


Hi !
 
I've two questions about the copy method :
 
1) first, I've seen such an exemple :
 
COPY /~fielding/index.html HTTP/1.1
Host : www.foo.bar
Destination : http://www.foo.bar/users/f/fielding/index.html
 
Does that mean that I could, by copiyng the file index.html, rename it ?
For example, could I write :
 
COPY /~fielding/index.html HTTP/1.1
Host : www.ics.uci.edu
Destination : http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/summary.html


2) then, it's about copy of collections.

Imagine we have a collection named 'container', with one internal member :
index.html.
If I call this method :

COPY /container/ HTTP/1.1
Host : www.foo.bar
Destination : http://www.foo.bar/othercontainer/
Depth : infinity
...

What will be the result ?
I will have a new collection named 'othercontainer', with the member
'index.html', or the new collection 'othercontainer', containing itself the
collection 'container' ?


Thanx
