Hi,

to track namespace operations I use version-controlled collections (vcc). I
want to track them additionally with activities. The obvious way to achieve
this is to checkout the collection(s) effected by this operation with an
activity, perform the operation and checkin the activity.

Question:Is it allowed to give a DAV:activity-set in the body of the MOVE to
automatically checkout the collection with the given activity? Advantage:
Performing a MOVE it is ensured to have source and destination collection
cehecked out into the same activity.


Regards,
Daniel
