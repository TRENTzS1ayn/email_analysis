Good catch, Daniel!

This is an error.  The DAV:workspace and
DAV:version-controlled-configuration
properties should be defined on version-controlled and version-controllable
resources, not on any resource.

I propose that sections 22.2, 22.4, and 22.5 be updated to reflect this.
Anyone object?

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

as the DeltaV draft 20 states in the property sections 22.xx a version owns,
besides others, all properties of a DeltaV compoliant resource. Such a
resource does have a DAV:workspace property. 
What happens to this property if there are two vcr's in differet workspaces
having the same checked in version? Which value must be stored in
DAV.workspace???


Regards, 
Daniel
