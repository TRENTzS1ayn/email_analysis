No, that is not functionality defined in the current protocol.

The closest you can come is to set the DAV:current-activity-set
of the workspace, which means that all checkouts against VCR's
in that workspace will be in those activities.

One reason this approach was taken is that it allows you to 
set the DAV:current-activity-set in an activity aware client,
and then use activity unaware clients for all the other operations.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

to track namespace operations I use version-controlled collections (vcc). I
want to track them additionally with activities. The obvious way to achieve
this is to checkout the collection(s) effected by this operation with an
activity, perform the operation and checkin the activity.

Question:Is it allowed to give a DAV:activity-set in the body of the MOVE to
automatically checkout the collection with the given activity? Advantage:
Performing a MOVE it is ensured to have source and destination collection
cehecked out into the same activity.


Regards,
Daniel
