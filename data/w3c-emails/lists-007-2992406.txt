Good question.  The protocol does not explicitly require this,
but it sounds like a sensible thing for a server to do.

Cheers,

Some more detail:

I've checked out a collection. So I get a working collection. Now I put a
file to the working collection (adding a file to the repository). At checkin
a vcr for the newly added file is created (with all its dependend resources)
the checked in version of the collection is written to the
activity-version-set. What about the checked in version of the added file?
Is it written to the DAV:activity-version-set property too?

Regards,
Daniel

Hi,

does the checkout behavior of a version-controlled collection be the same as
the checkout behavior of a version-controlled resource with
DAV:apply-to-version flag? (Because of working-collection sounds similar to
working-resource) 
Is there the same behavior for parallel development (parallel checkouts,
checkin behavior) as for working-resources?

Regards,
Daniel
