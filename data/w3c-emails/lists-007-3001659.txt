Hi,

one way to create a workspace in reference to an existing one is to use
MKWORKSPACE with referencing a baseline of the baseline-controlled source
workspace.

If I don't support baselines at all. How is this done then? (Given that a
workspace (collection) is under version-controll as well as all subordinate
collections.)
Is it allowed that a workspace as collection (it is per definitionem) is
under version-control in terms of version-controlled collection? Would COPY
provide me the result I'm loking for?


Regards,
Daniel
