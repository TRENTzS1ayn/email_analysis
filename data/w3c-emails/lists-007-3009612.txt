If you don't support baselines, the only way to create a workspace
that has VCR's that select versions from existing VHR's is to issue
a separate VERSION-CONTROL request (identifying the desired version)
to create each VCR.

(And if you think, "isn't that a fairly costly way of creating such
a workspace", the answer is yes, and to avoid the cost, your server
can support baselines :-).

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

one way to create a workspace in reference to an existing one is to use
MKWORKSPACE with referencing a baseline of the baseline-controlled source
workspace.

If I don't support baselines at all. How is this done then? (Given that a
workspace (collection) is under version-controll as well as all subordinate
collections.)
Is it allowed that a workspace as collection (it is per definitionem) is
under version-control in terms of version-controlled collection? Would COPY
provide me the result I'm loking for?


Regards,
Daniel
