Hi,

suppose this (strange) case:

1. A file F was added to the repository.
With checking out the version-controlled collection  C with an activity A1
with apply-to-version, putting the file to the working collection, checking
in the activity (new version CV2 of the collection  and first version FV1 of
the added file going to activity-version-set property)

2. Change a property of the collection C 
With checking out C with activity A2 with apply-to-version, proppatch and
checkin of A2. Version CV3 goes to the activity-version-set.

3. Now MERGE activity A2 to a collection C' in a different workspace. C'
does not contain the file F yet, because activity A1 was not merged to C'.
What happens here? Well the merge of CV3 into C' would succeed. But what
about the binding to F? Will there be a new VCR for F pointing to the
version-history of F with checked in version of that vcr is undefined?


Regards,
Daniel
