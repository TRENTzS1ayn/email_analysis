   Good question. Maybe this needs to be clarified in DeltaV
   (Geoff?). As I said, we are using the presence of this property to
   detect that something is a version resource.

A VCR should have a copy of all the version's *dead* properties,
but definitely should not have a copy of the version's live
properties (since, as in Julian's case, clients will use the
presence and absence of these live properties to determine
what kind of resource is there).

In particular, you will note in 22.5 that a VCR does not have
a DAV:version-name, while in 22.6, it states that a version does.

Cheers,
Geoff
