   suppose this (strange) case:

   1. A file F was added to the repository.  With checking out the
   version-controlled collection C with an activity A1 with
   apply-to-version, putting the file to the working collection,
   checking in the activity (new version CV2 of the collection and
   first version FV1 of the added file going to activity-version-set
   property)

   2. Change a property of the collection C 
   With checking out C with activity A2 with apply-to-version, proppatch and
   checkin of A2. Version CV3 goes to the activity-version-set.

   3. Now MERGE activity A2 to a collection C' in a different workspace. C'
   does not contain the file F yet, because activity A1 was not merged to
C'.
   What happens here? Well the merge of CV3 into C' would succeed. But what
   about the binding to F? Will there be a new VCR for F pointing to the
   version-history of F with checked in version of that vcr is undefined?

Yes.

Note that some CM systems will say "CV3 depends on CV2, and CV2
is produced by A1, so you can't MERGE A2 unless you also MERGE A1",
but that is not required by DeltaV.

Cheers,
Geoff
