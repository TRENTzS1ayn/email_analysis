Hi,

suppose in workspace WS1 there is a collection C containing two Files F1,
F2. F1 was created with activity A1 and F2 was created with activity A2.
Subsequent changes to F1 were made with activity A3 and for F2 activity A4
was used for this purpose.

further suppose in WS2 there allready is a collection C w/o any members
(created with earlier MERGES).

For some reasons I only want to propagate F2 (cause F1 is not ready yet or
secret or ...). The MERGE of A4 into WS2 would fail cause F2 does not exist.
So first I have to MERGE activity A2. Doing this I MERGE a version of /WS1/C
into WS2 that contains a binding to F1. Due to that a vcr for F1 has to be
created. Thats definitely not what I want to have. 

So merging the Activity A2 is not an good idea. Only with activity A2 there
was just the creation of F2. And I just want to propagate this creation. But
I get other stuff as well. Is this a) right b) "sensible"


Regards,
Daniel
