The DAV:version-controlled-binding-set is a readonly property
on a collection version.

To merge a collection version:

To merge members of the collection version CV1
into working collection WC2, you
would checkout CV1 (to get WC1), MOVE the members of
WC1 that you want into WC2, and then DELETE WC1.

This method applies if the server supports working resources / working
collections, right?

To merge members of the collection version CV1
into checked-out version-controlled collection, VC2,
you would need to select particular versions of
the version histories identified by the 
DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of CV1,
and then use VERSION-CONTROL requests to create
version-controlled resources for those versions
in VC2.  Or if you are lucky, your server supports
"auto-merge" for collections, and the server does this
all for you.

And this if it does not support this, right?

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

simple question: How is a MERGE of collection versions done? Is it
just a
proppatch to DAV:version-controlled-binding-set?
Regards,
Daniel
