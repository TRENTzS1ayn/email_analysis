That sounds good. Only it would be propriatry for the server that invents
this. What do you think, is this a feature that is worth of being part of
the DeltaV? Was this in discussion yet and skip due to some reason?
I don't like the propriatry thing that much. But if its not worth of being
part of the standard, so it is and then its proprietary.
