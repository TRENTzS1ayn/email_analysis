I think it is worth making part of the standard.

But since only a few servers support this kind of DELTA
capability (but there definitely are some),
so it was lower priority than the MERGE functionality,
and didn't make it into the final "what we include in the
first version" cut.  There are other things, like "variants",
that are in the same category.

If anyone has the time to write up the DELTA proposal,
that would be great (we would post it to the "proposed extensions"
section of the DeltaV site).

Cheers,
Geoff

That sounds good. Only it would be propriatry for the server that invents
this. What do you think, is this a feature that is worth of being part of
the DeltaV? Was this in discussion yet and skip due to some reason?
I don't like the propriatry thing that much. But if its not worth of being
part of the standard, so it is and then its proprietary.
