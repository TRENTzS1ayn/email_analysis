Hi,

this is very basic question compared to what is currently beeing discussed
on this list - (ashamed ;-)

Comparing 3.1.3, 3.1.4 and 3.1.5 of the spec, I wonder why "name" is an
*attribute* of element "supported-method-set" while it is a *child* element
in the cases of "supported-live-property-set" and "supported-report-set".
Why is that so?

Regards,
- Peter
