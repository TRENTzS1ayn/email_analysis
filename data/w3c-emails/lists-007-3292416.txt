But 3.14 states
 (DAV:copy-creates-new-resource): If the source of a COPY is a
version-controlled resource or version, and if there is no resource at the
destination of the COPY, then the COPY creates a new non-version-controlled
resource at the destination of the COPY.  The new resource MAY automatically
be put under version control, but the resulting version-controlled resource
MUST be associated with a new version history created for that new
version-controlled resource, and all postconditions for VERSION-CONTROL
apply to the request.

so there would be a new version-history for the copy-target. What is right
here???
I certainly wouldn't have thought that moving a VCR would create a new
history resource. 
  
Regards,
Daniel

Hi, 
I wonder what happens when I copy or move a VCR? 
Defining this behavior as not expected by the user, I'd say COPY means 
creation of a new version-history and copy of the checked-in version to that

new VH. With that the checked-in property of the copied VCR must change. 
Same for MOVE except for the deletion of the source. 
Regards, 
Daniel
