What should happen if an UPDATE request is made for a version-controlled
collection which has a version-controlled internal member that is a
checked-out resource, and the DAV:version in the UPDATE request does not
identify the checked-out resource version-history in it's
DAV:version-controlled-binding-set? Should the UPDATE request fail, or
should the checked-out resource be deleted (by post condition
DAV:update-version-controlled-collection-members)?

Similarly, what should happen if the checked-out resource is a member
(but not an internal member) of the collection,  and the UPDATE request
attempts to remove the collection resource that it is an internal member
of?

Thanks,
Alison.
