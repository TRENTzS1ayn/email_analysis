It is server-defined.  Some servers will disallow the DELETE in
those cases, while others want to leave them dangling.  We couldn't
get consensus on either behavior so, it is left as server-defined.

Is it allowed to DELETE a version resource which appears in the checkout or
checkin property of a VCR?

If so, what happens to the checkin/checkout property?
