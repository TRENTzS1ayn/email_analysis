It's up to the server, but I'd probably go with (3), as it probably
provides the most value.

Cheers,
Geoff

Subject: DAV:comment vs auto-versioning


Hi,

what's the best treatment for DAV:comment when a resource get's checked in
due to auto-versioning?

1) no special treatment (old value),

2) remote it (set it to empty string),

3) generate a server-specific comment ("checked in due to auto versioning
on...")?

Julian
