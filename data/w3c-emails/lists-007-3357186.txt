The result of applying an UPDATE to 
If the UPDATE succeeds, the server must delete the
checked-out version-controlled member,
but a server could very reasonably fail the request, in which case it
should return a DAV:update-version-controlled-collection-members element
in the DAV:error element.  Note that it could return additional information
to identify the checked-out resources that blocked the UPDATE, but we have
not defined any interoperable mechanism for doing so.

Cheers,
Geoff

What should happen if an UPDATE request is made for a version-controlled
collection which has a version-controlled internal member that is a
checked-out resource, and the DAV:version in the UPDATE request does not
identify the checked-out resource version-history in it's
DAV:version-controlled-binding-set? Should the UPDATE request fail, or
should the checked-out resource be deleted (by post condition
DAV:update-version-controlled-collection-members)?

Similarly, what should happen if the checked-out resource is a member
(but not an internal member) of the collection,  and the UPDATE request
attempts to remove the collection resource that it is an internal member
of?

Thanks,
Alison.
