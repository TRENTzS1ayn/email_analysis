Suppose I wanted to capture that adding a resource to version control was part of an activity. 

It seems to me that this could be reflected by making the VERSION-CONTROL method create a VCR whose DAV:checked-in version included that activity in its DAV:activity-set property value. It looks like the spec allows but does not require servers to do this (for example) if the VERSION-CONTROL request includes a DAV:activity-set element, or if the request-URL for VERSION-CONTROL is the member of a workspace with a nonempty DAV:current-activity-set property value.

Is this interpretation correct?

Thanks,
Roy
