version-history feature

5.9 Additional VERSION-CONTROL Semantics

     Additional Postconditions:

       (DAV:new-version-history): If the request created a new version
       history, the request MUST have allocated a new server-defined URL
       for that version history that MUST NOT have previously identified
       any other resource, and MUST NOT ever identify a resource other
       than this version history.
 
does this means copying a version history resource (of course with a new
server created unique URL)? copy method directly is not allowed.
has the new version history the same version controlled resource the the
older one?

thanx
jens
