Actually, the report clearly makes the most sense for depth=0 (perhaps
that's what you
meant to type?).

One instance where a non-zero depth parameter would make sense for this
report was if
you had a collection of workspaces (i.e. each internal member of the
collection is a
workspace).  You could do a Depth:1 locate-by-history report, in order to
find out where
a given version history is in each of those workspaces.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

section 5.4 currently doesn't say anything about the relation between the
locate-by-history report and the Depth header (which defaults to "0" as per
definition of REPORT method).

Clearly, the report only makes sense for depth = 1. So what would we expect
for other values?

0: empty multistatus response?
infinity: forbidden?

Regards, Julian
