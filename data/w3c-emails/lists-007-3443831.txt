   version-history feature

   5.9 Additional VERSION-CONTROL Semantics

Additional Postconditions:

  (DAV:new-version-history): If the request created a new version
  history, the request MUST have allocated a new server-defined URL
  for that version history that MUST NOT have previously identified
  any other resource, and MUST NOT ever identify a resource other
  than this version history.

   does this means copying a version history resource (of course
   with a new server created unique URL)? copy method directly is
   not allowed.

No, this Postcondition would apply to a VERSION-CONTROL request
(when the section is "Additional XXX Semantics", it means additional
semantics for an XXX request.

   has the new version history the same version controlled resource
   the the older one?

A version history does not really "have" a version-controlled
resource, i.e. it is the other way round: a version-controlled
resource has a version history.  Since a version-controlled resource
can only refer to a single version history, a given version-controlled
resource could not refer to both an old and a newer version history.

Cheers,
Geoff
