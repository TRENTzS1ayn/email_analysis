   From: Julian Reschke [mailto:julian.reschke@greenbytes.de]

   two questions regarding the DAV:expand-property REPORT [1]:

   1) Scoping (depth header)
   According to section 3.6 (definition of REPORT method), the depth
   header will work just as for PROPFIND (depth 0: only request-URI,
   depth 1: request-URI + internal members, depth infinity:
   request-URI + all children)?

Yes, the report will be run (separately) on each of the resources
that satisfy the Depth header, and the results will be returned
in a multistatus response.

   2) expanding properties that do not contain DAV:href elements

   Is this an error condition, or should the REPORT just return the
   non-expanded property value?

Just return the non-expanded property value.

   3) expanding non-live properties

   Is the server required to expand dead properties which contain
   DAV:href child elements as well?

The report makes no distinction between live and dead properties,
so yes, it needs to expand those as well.

Cheers,
Geoff
