No, the VHR is not required to support the DAV:version-tree report.
A server could allow it, but this would be a non-standard extension.
(Note that the DAV:version-tree report is just a restricted form of
the DAV:expand-property report, and is redundant if a server supports
version history resources).

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

is a VHR supposed to support the DAV:version-tree report? Section 3.7 is
silent on this...
