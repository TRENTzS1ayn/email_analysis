Hi,

a (probably stupid) question about preconditions for modification of any
property (live or dead) by the client:

are there any properties of the following resources
*version resource
*VCR
*version controlled configuration
which can be modified by the client without checking out the resource ? 

I expect this is not possible but I didn't find this explicitly in the spec.

regards
Matthias
