The only constraint is that a server must not allow modifications to
dead properties on a version or a checked-in VCR (a version-controlled
configuration is just a special kind of VCR, so the VCR constraints apply).

On the other hand, a server is free to decide how it is going to control
the behavior of live properties.  There are some live properties that
inherently are mutable (such as the DAV:successor-set of a version).

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

a (probably stupid) question about preconditions for modification of any
property (live or dead) by the client:

are there any properties of the following resources
*version resource
*VCR
*version controlled configuration
which can be modified by the client without checking out the resource ? 

I expect this is not possible but I didn't find this explicitly in the spec.

regards
Matthias
