Hi,

how can undelete of a versioned resource (residing in a versioned
collection) 
which has been deleted somewhen in the past be done using DeltaV ?

There are two things which have to be solved here:
*find the deleted resource(s) under a given path  
*undelete resource(s)
I would like to do it with using an activity and working resources so that
the undeletion is tracked in the activity.

How can the browsing for deleted resources (or collections) be done in an
efficient way, i.e. how can the client
find out which resources have been deleted let's say recursively under
/a/b/c/... ?

regards
Matthias
