Hi

I think when the resource version to be revived in order to undelete the 
resource has been found the undelete operation can be done in the following
way :

- check out the collection which shall contain the resource to be undeleted,

  this yields a working collection which is bound to an activity (since I
want to 
  track all changes in activities)
- issue VERSION-CONTROL on the resource version contained in the old
collection 
  version before the deletion of the resource took place like specified in 
  the DeltaV spec : 

>>> citation from DeltaV spec <<<

6.7.1Example - VERSION-CONTROL (using an existing version
history)
>>REQUEST

  VERSION-CONTROL /ws/public/bar.html HTTP/1.1 
  Host: www.webdav.org
  Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
  Content-Length: xxxx

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
  <D:version-control xmlns:D="DAV:">
    <D:version>
      <D:href>http://repo.webdav.org/his/12/ver/V3</D:href>
    </D:version>
  </D:version-control>
   
>>RESPONSE

  HTTP/1.1 201 Created
  Cache-Control: no-cache

>>> end citation from DeltaV spec <<<

  In this request specify the URL under which the VCR for the resource to be

  undeleted shall reappear.

- check in the activity containing the working collection which now has a 
  binding pointing to the newly created VCR for the undeleted resource.
- if since the resource has been deleted another resource has been created 
  with the same URL the VERSION-CONTROL request given above will fail. 
  In this case the client has to reissue VERSION-CONTROL specifying 
  another request URL which uniquely identifies the URL of the resource 
  to be undeleted.

Is this approach compliant to the DeltaV spec ?

Still it is an open question (for me) how to find deleted resources in a
given 
collection in an efficient way using DeltaV protocol.

Matthias

Betreff: how to perform undeletion


Hi,

how can undelete of a versioned resource (residing in a versioned
collection) 
which has been deleted somewhen in the past be done using DeltaV ?

There are two things which have to be solved here:
*find the deleted resource(s) under a given path  
*undelete resource(s)
I would like to do it with using an activity and working resources so that
the undeletion is tracked in the activity.

How can the browsing for deleted resources (or collections) be done in an
efficient way, i.e. how can the client
find out which resources have been deleted let's say recursively under
/a/b/c/... ?

regards
Matthias
