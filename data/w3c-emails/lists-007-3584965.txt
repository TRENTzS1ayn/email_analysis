   From: Sohn, Matthias [mailto:matthias.sohn@sap.com]

   I think when the resource version to be revived in order to
   undelete the resource has been found the undelete operation can be
   done in the following way :

   - check out the collection which shall contain the resource to be
     undeleted,

Yes.

   this yields a working collection which is bound to an activity
   (since I want to track all changes in activities)

Yes.

   - issue VERSION-CONTROL on the resource version contained in the
   old collection version before the deletion of the resource took
   place

A collection version does not contain resource versions, it contains
a DAV:version-controlled-binding-set property that contains a set of
name/version-history pairs.

Also, you don't issue VERSION-CONTROL requests to members of a working
collection, because a working collection does not contain
version-controlled resources (and VERSION-CONTROL creates a
version-controlled resource).  The VERSION-CONTROL request is used to
restore resources to checked-out collections (i.e. to collections that
can be checked-out in place), not to working collections.

     In this request specify the URL under which the VCR for the resource to
be
     undeleted shall reappear.

   - check in the activity containing the working collection which now has a

     binding pointing to the newly created VCR for the undeleted resource.

Working collections cannot contain a VCR.

   - if since the resource has been deleted another resource has been
created 
     with the same URL the VERSION-CONTROL request given above will fail. 
     In this case the client has to reissue VERSION-CONTROL specifying 
     another request URL which uniquely identifies the URL of the resource 
     to be undeleted.

   Is this approach compliant to the DeltaV spec ?

No, with working resources, you have to CHECKOUT a collection version
that identifies the version history of the desired version in its
DAV:version-controlled-binding-set.  Then you can MOVE that version
history from that working collection into the destination working
collection, DELETE the source working collection, and then CHECKIN
the destination working collection.

Cheers,
Geoff
