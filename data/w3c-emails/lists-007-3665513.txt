Because OPTIONS headers don't have a concept of namespaces -- it's just a
flat namespace. WebDAV properties are identified by (namespace, name), so by
definition there won't be any confusion. Finally, the PROPFIND semantics
defined in RFC3253 allow you not to report your extension property unless
somebody (your client) is specifically asking for it.
