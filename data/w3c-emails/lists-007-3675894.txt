hi,

in 22.11 is the classification of version history.

imagine i have

/files/test.xml

under version control and the belonging history

/his/9

maybe with one version

/his/9/1.0

in 22.11 stands, that the DeltaV compliant resource props and methods also
belong to version history. does version history means version history resource
( in my case /his/9 )and is it possible to have a property like
supported-method-set for it? or is it only version-set and root-version? or am i somehow
totally wrong?

thanx
jens
