If you hope other servers will
start supporting some aspects of your proprietary extensions, you might
want to consider using DAV:supported-method-set,
DAV:supported-live-property-set,
and DAV:supported-report-set.  This allows a client to determine whether
or not a given server supports the features it needs, as opposed to looking
for a particular bundle of functionality that one server chose to implement.

Cheers,
Geoff

I would object to this for the same reasons why I think RFC3253 should not
have touched OPTIONS request / response bodies.

There's no technical reason why you would need to extend OPTIONs to do
something a live property can do as well.
