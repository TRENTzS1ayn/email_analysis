Yes, "version history" means "version history resource".

See the definition of "version history resource":
   A "version history resource", or simply "version history", is a resource
   that contains all the versions of a particular version-controlled
resource.

So, yes, a version history resource has all DeltaV-compliant resource
properties, including DAV:supported-method-set, DAV:supported-report-set,
and DAV:supported-live-property-set.

Cheers,
Geoff

hi,

in 22.11 is the classification of version history.

imagine i have

/files/test.xml

under version control and the belonging history

/his/9

maybe with one version

/his/9/1.0

in 22.11 stands, that the DeltaV compliant resource props and methods also
belong to version history. does version history means version history
resource
( in my case /his/9 )and is it possible to have a property like
supported-method-set for it? or is it only version-set and root-version? or
am i somehow
totally wrong?

thanx
jens
