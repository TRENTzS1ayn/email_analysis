Section 12.14, which defines the extended baseline semantics of MERGE, includes the statement

   If the merge source is a baseline, the merge target is a version-
   controlled configuration for the baseline history of that baseline,
   where the baseline-controlled collection of that version-controlled
   configuration is a member of the collection identified by the
   request-URL.

Section 12.13, which defines the extended baseline semantics of UPDATE, does not include a similar statement, but I think it should. 

Is this the working group's intention? Would this be a reasonable edit to make in the next rev of the spec?
