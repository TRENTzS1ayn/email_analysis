The UPDATE method explicitly identifies the "update target"
for the "update source", so there is no need for such a rule
(i.e. you can only update a version-controlled-configuration
with a baseline from the baseline history of that 
version-controlled configiguration).

So this statement (which is about how to find the merge target
for a baseline MERGE request) is not needed for UPDATE.

Cheers,
Geoff

Section 12.14, which defines the extended baseline semantics of MERGE,
includes the statement

   If the merge source is a baseline, the merge target is a version-
   controlled configuration for the baseline history of that baseline,
   where the baseline-controlled collection of that version-controlled
   configuration is a member of the collection identified by the
   request-URL.

Section 12.13, which defines the extended baseline semantics of UPDATE, does
not include a similar statement, but I think it should. 

Is this the working group's intention? Would this be a reasonable edit to
make in the next rev of the spec?
