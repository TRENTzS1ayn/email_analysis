Hi,

suppose we want to implement a distributed DeltaV server which allows
propagation 
between workspaces residing on different servers. In order to ensure unique
activity names
(needed to ensure activity URL uniqueness if activities are also
distributed) in this scenario 
we would like to have server defined activity URLs.

Would it be DeltaV compliant to achieve that by using the response defined 
in section "10.3.2 301 Moved Permanently" of the HTTP 1.1 spec (rfc2616) ?

   >>REQUEST

     MKACTIVITY /act/test-23 HTTP/1.1
     Host: repo.webdav.org
     Content-Length: 0

instead of

   >>RESPONSE

     HTTP/1.1 201 Created
     Cache-Control: no-cache

we would like to use

   >>RESPONSE

     HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
     Location: /act/test-23-9C0BC5DA776811D5B3490001021DCD13
     Cache-Control: no-cache

     <HTML body containing href to new URL>

regards
Matthias
