   From: B H, Girish [mailto:g.b.h@sap.com]

   Lets say I have a working collection wcoll.  Now, I need to place a
   file, file1, into this working collection. And to update the
   content in the next call. I am assuming that NO auto-version
   policies are used. The sequence of operations would typically be:

   1.  PUT /wcoll/file1     //created the file here.
   2.  PUT /wcoll/file1     //updated the content here.

   My doubt is whether a first version (and version history and
   version-controlled resources) are created in step (1).

That is correct, no new version-controlled resources (or version
histories) are created until /wcoll is checked in.  Note that a more
realistic working collection URL would be something like
/repo/wcoll/16734.

   If so, then the
   sequence of operations required would be:

   1.  PUT /wcoll/file1     //created the file here - and placed it into
   version control

No, the PUT does not put it under version control.  A CHECKIN of
/wcoll is required.

   2.  CHECKOUT /wcoll/file1 //create a working resource of the file

Since /wcoll/file1 is not under version control, the CHECKOUT would fail.

   3.  PUT /wcoll/file1     //updated the content here.

   Is this what RFC3253 specifies? If so, can somebody point out to me
   where in the spec this is specified.

It doesn't, so nobody can (:-).

   Section 14.10 of RFC3253 says that at the time of checkin of a working
   collection, all non-version-controlled members of the working collection
   have to be placed under version control.  If this is understood, then at
   step (1) above, the server need not place the file under version control
and
   can wait until the time of checkin of wcoll1.  So the checkout in step
(2)
   above would not be required.
   Am I getting the specifications correctly here?

Yes, that is right.  In particular, section 14.0 states: "a working
collection contains bindings to version history resources and
non-version-controlled resources".  So a server is not even allowed to
place a member of a working collection under version control
(until that working collection is checked in, at which time the
working collection is deleted, so the working collection never 
actually contains a version-controlled resource).

   If I am getting it right, then if I want to add a new collection
   coll2 under wcoll, and a file file1 under coll2, then the sequence
   of operations would be:

   1.  MKCOL /wcoll/coll2     //created the collection here.
   2.  PUT /wcoll/coll2/file1     //created a file under coll1. No checkout
of
   coll1 is required.

   So, when wcoll is checkedin, coll2 and its members are placed under
version
   control. Is this right?

Yes, that is right.

Cheers,
Geoff
