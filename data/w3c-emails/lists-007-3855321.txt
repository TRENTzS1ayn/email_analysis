From the abstract:

"In many cases, a versioning-aware client might want to display/include the
URI of the version it's editing while it's being edited. For instance, an
editor might include this as meta information, or the author of a document
might want to know the URI of the version before it's checked in. A
well-known example is the W3C way of referring to document versions in
recommendations: it contains references to "the current version", to "this
version" and to the "previous version". Something like this is currently
impossible with WebDAV deltaV [RFC3253], as the version URI is determined at
the time of CHECKIN."

From the change log:

Made the document element for responses upon failed CHECKIN DAV:error rather
than DAV:checkin-response.
Updated reference to [RFC3253].
Moved extension elements out of DAV: namespace.
Changed examples to explicitly use utf-8 encoding for HTTP content type and
XML encoding.
Globally replaced the term "CHECKIN URI" by "version URI"
Added note about how to discover whether the server actually applied the
expected version URI.
Made sure artwork (figures) fits into 72 columns.
