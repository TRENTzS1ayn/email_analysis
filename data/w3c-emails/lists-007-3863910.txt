Hi,

From the spec:

  When a server supports the working-resource feature, a client can check
out a
  collection version to create a working collection.  Unlike a
version-controlled
  collection, which contains bindings to version-controlled resources and
  non-version-controlled resources, a working collection contains bindings
to
  version history resources and non-version-controlled resources.  ...

So, version controlled collection contains bindings to version controlled
resources ?
Which property of a version controlled collection contains these bindings ?
Further, if a binding points to a version controlled resource does that mean
that every version controlled resource is stored under some unique URL ?
