Hi,

I vote for (c)

I am not sure on which resources these live properties 
specifying server wide properties (which in general are not a property of 
a specific resource) should be exposed, I would appreciate some standardized
way to define these server wide features.

In addition I would like to see that the same mechanism can be used to
advertise 
server specific extension features preventing name clashes by the namespace 
of the respective live property

regards
Matthias

Since I was not able to convince the ACL working group to marshall
this kind of information as an OPTIONS request, we should probably
consider changing the versioning protocol to also marshall this
kind of information (i.e. DAV:workspace-collection-set,
DAV:activity-collection-set, and DAV:version-history-collection-set)
as live properties, and not as OPTIONS requests.

So I'd like to poll the mailing list (especially DeltaV client and/or
server implementors:

Do you prefer to:
(a) leave xxx-collection-set as it is (marshalled only as OPTIONS)
(b) support marshalling both as OPTIONS and as live properties
(c) marshal only as live properties and deprecate the OPTIONS marshalling

I vote for (c), as it simplifies the spec, and makes it consistent
with the ACL protocol.

Cheers,
Geoff
