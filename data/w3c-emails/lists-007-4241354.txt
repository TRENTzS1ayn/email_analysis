In principle, yes.  For example, if a site wanted to allow anonymous users
to see the current state of the website, by browsing the version-controlled
resources; but not allow them to view the history or checked-in,
checked-out states.  The server may still ensure that the semantics are
maintained.

I just wondered what you meant by the properties being 'broken'.  If you
envisage that to mean the references cannot be 'de-referenced' then there
are multiple reasons why that may be the case.  I see DELETE to be the
inverse of BIND (and agree with your descriptions earlier in the thread),
plus whatever further semantics we choose to apply to DELETE for
convenience.
