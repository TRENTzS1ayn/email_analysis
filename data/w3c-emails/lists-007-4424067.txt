Hi,

Let's have VCR X, whose DAV:checked-in property identifies version V10,
checked-out with apply-to-version option.
As a result of that a working resource WR1 was created.

Clearly, WR1 identifies V10 in its DAV:predecessor-set.
Does V10 also identify WR1 in its DAV:successor-set ?

Regards
Sasha Zivkov
