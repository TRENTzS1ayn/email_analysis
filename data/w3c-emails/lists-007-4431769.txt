   Let's have VCR X, whose DAV:checked-in property identifies version
   V10, checked-out with apply-to-version option.  As a result of that
   a working resource WR1 was created.

   Clearly, WR1 identifies V10 in its DAV:predecessor-set.
   Does V10 also identify WR1 in its DAV:successor-set ?

No, the DAV:successor-set identifies versions, not checked-out
resources such as a working resource.  But V10 does identify
WR1 in its DAV:checkout-set property.

Cheers,
Geoff
