Hello!

As far as I understood, WebDAV/Delta V is only concerned with
*version?control* of static components.

Many web pages are however dynamically generated.
One could even argue that there is a fundamental granularity problem:
the grain suitable for maintenance (and for sharing) is finer than
this suitable for navigation.

Is there a provision to cope with this issue?

Best Regards!
Marc
