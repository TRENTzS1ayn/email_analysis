Neither 2518 nor 3253 specify this, but if I were to pick, I'd pick "b",
since that is the context that is most likely to consistently appear
with that reference, and therefore most likely to produce a consistent
value.

Cheers,
Geoff

Another question:

When a Depth > 0 response body contains nested multistatus elements,
relative to which URI are nested href elements resolved?

a) relative to the request URI?

b) relative to the URI of the resource described by containing response
element?
