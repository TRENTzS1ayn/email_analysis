Hi,

The rfc3253 says:

   Many property values are defined as a DAV:href, or a set of DAV:href
   elements.  The DAV:expand-property report provides a mechanism for
   retrieving in one request the properties from the resources
   identified by those DAV:href elements.  ...

Since DAV:version-controlled-binding-set is list of (binding-name, version-history)
elements and not list of hrefs it seems to me that it is not possible to
further expand this property.  For example the next request tries to expand
version-controlled-binding-set:

     REPORT /foo.html HTTP/1.1
     Host: www.webdav.org
     Content-Type: text/xml; charset="utf-8"
     Content-Length: xxxx

     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
     <D:expand-property xmlns:D="DAV:">
       <D:property name="version-controlled-binding-set">
         <D:property name="version-history">
           <D:property name="creator-displayname"/>
         </D:property>
       </D:property>
     </D:expand-property>

But, since members of version-controlled-binding-set are not href's (and they
are not resources) we can not further expand this property.

Is this correct ?

Regards
Sasha
