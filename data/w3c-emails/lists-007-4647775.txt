As you said, version-controlled-bindings consists of binding-name
version-history. version-history has href format, so you *can* expand that
if you want to.

None. It depends on whose property you want. You can't get the properties of
the binding name (it's not a resource), but you *can* get the properties of
the version history.

Both.
