An example:
<version-controlled-binding-set>

   <version-controlled-binding>
      <binding-name>abc</binding-name>
      <version-history><href>/vh11</href></version-history>
   </version-controlled-binding>

   <version-controlled-binding>
      <binding-name>def</binding-name>
      <version-history><href>/vh12</href></version-history>
   </version-controlled-binding>
   ...
</version-controlled-binding-set>

So the version-history is at the second level after version-controlled-binding-set.
And the members of version-controlled-binding-set are not DAV:href's but elements
that contain href's.
Again from rfc3253:
   Many property values are defined as a DAV:href, or a set of DAV:href
   elements.  The DAV:expand-property report provides a mechanism for
   retrieving in one request the properties from the resources
   identified by those DAV:href elements.  ...
