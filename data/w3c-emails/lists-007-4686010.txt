Just wanted to confirm that I agree with Julian on this thread, i.e.
you can use the DAV:expand-property report to expand DAV:href
elements that are nested arbitarily deeply in the property value,
in particular, to expand the version history DAV:href elements
in the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set.

Cheers,
Geoff

And it goes on saying:

"... If there are DAV:property elements nested within a DAV:property
element, then every DAV:href in the value of the corresponding property is
replaced by a DAV:response element whose DAV:prop elements report the values
of the properties identified by the nested DAV:property elements. The nested
DAV:property elements can in turn contain DAV:property elements, so that
multiple levels of DAV:href expansion can be requested."

When I implemented the expand-property report I asked this question here
([1]), and the answer was: all href elements must be expanded, independant
of the nesting, including dead properties.
