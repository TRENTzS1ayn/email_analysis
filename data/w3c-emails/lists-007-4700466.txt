   From: Nevermann, Dr., Peter [mailto:Peter.Nevermann@softwareag.com]

   assume
   1) a non-collection *non-VCR* resource at /foo.xml which is *locked*
   2) an ordinary collection resource at /bar which is *locked*.

   We are wondering what the response status code should be in these
particular
   cases (403, 409, 423, ???):

   CHECKOUT /foo.xml

405

   CHECKIN /foo.xml

405

   LABEL /foo.xml

405

   REPORT /foo.xml

Depends on the report request.  Since a report is a read-only
operation, it doesn't matter that it is write-locked.

   UPDATE /foo.xml

405

   VERSION-CONTROL /foo.xml

423

   MKWORKSPACE /bar

403, with DAV:resource-must-be-null in the DAV:error node.

Cheers,
Geoff
