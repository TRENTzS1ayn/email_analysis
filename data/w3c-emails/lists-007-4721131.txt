I'd say that this is higly implementation dependant, and I don't think that
RFC3253 mandates a specific oder in checking these conditions.

HTTP says about 409:

"The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state
of the resource."

So I think I agree with you.

But that would be a different request, right? So you didn't "fix" the state
of the resource, but the nature of your request...

I think so.
