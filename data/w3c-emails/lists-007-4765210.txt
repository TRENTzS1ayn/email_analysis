I would have expected that in some cases, many things can be wrong with
a request. The server is not required to check all the cases in a
particular order, or at least I am not aware of any requirements. 

So if a resource can't be checked out because it's not a VCR, and
furthermore it's locked, and furthermore the user wouldn't have
permission to edit the resource anyway... then whatever problem the
server encounters first could result in a response of 403, 409 or 423.
