Hi,

suppose you have a collection W that is not version-controlled. Within this collection there is a member collection M that is both version controlled and the root of a tree containing version controlled objects only (collections and files). Now I want to delete M.

My understanding is that because W is not version controlled I haven't to check it out, but just DELETE M. With that everything below M and M itself is gone with the wind. Right?

Thanks,
Daniel
