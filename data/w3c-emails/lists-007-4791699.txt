   suppose you have a collection W that is not
   version-controlled. Within this collection there is a member
   collection M that is both version controlled and the root of a tree
   containing version controlled objects only (collections and
   files). Now I want to delete M.

   My understanding is that because W is not version controlled I
   haven't to check it out, but just DELETE M. With that everything
   below M and M itself is gone with the wind. Right?

Well, it depends on what you have in mind with "gone with the wind".
All the VCRs are deleted, which means that the modified state of
any checked-out VCR is lost, but all checked-in state is available
as versions in the version history resources.  Similarly, if you
have any baseline-controlled collections at or above M, then the
checked-in state would be available as baselines of those collections.

Cheers,
Geoff
