Currently, the server can either silently ignore the properties
it cannot retrieve, or it can fail the entire report.

If you think it is important to allow a more fine-grained error
handling in this case, we could change the marshalling to be:

 <!ELEMENT labeled-version-report (response*)>

Cheers,
Geoff

Geoff,

with the currently proposed format, how does a server marshall information
about failures in retrieving the properties of the selected version (? la
DAV:propstat/DSAV:status in DAV:response)?
