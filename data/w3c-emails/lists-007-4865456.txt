Sorry for the missing subject in my previous posting :-)

On behalf of Martin Wallmer:
-----

Hi,

should a DAV:allprop SEARCH on a Delta-V enabled resource return all Delta-V
properties as well? According to 

---
RFC 3253

3.11 Additional PROPFIND Semantics

   A DAV:allprop PROPFIND request SHOULD NOT return any of the
   properties defined by this document.  This allows a versioning server
   to perform efficiently when a naive client, which does not understand
   the cost of asking a server to compute all possible live properties,
   issues a DAV:allprop PROPFIND request.
---

PROPFIND should not return them. Is this true for SEARCH as well? Is there a
need to define the behaviour for SEARCH as well?
