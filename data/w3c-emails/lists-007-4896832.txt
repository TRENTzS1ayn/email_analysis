I was assuming that you were referring to a DAV:allprop in the
"WHERE" clause (i.e. find this string in all properties).
Thus my statement that "DAV:allprop SEARCH should not search
RFC-3253 properties".

If you were referring to the use of DAV:allprop in the "SELECT" clause,
then as Julian points out, it should not report RFC-3253 properties
(but should search whatever is specified in the WHERE clause).

And Julian's sed statement is of course correct (thanks, Julian!).

Cheers,
Geoff

Yes, it should SEARCH them (if used in the where clause). No, it shouldn't
report them (when select uses allprop).
