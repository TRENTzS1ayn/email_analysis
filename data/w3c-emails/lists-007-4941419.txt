Well.

It does make a lot of sense if you don't know which collection the VCR is
in -- this is why we need it.

So the use case is:

- I have a VHR
- I need to lookup VCRs on a server for which the DAV:version-history points
to my VHR

How am I supposed to do that if not using depth infinity?

Which basically renders all REPORTs that apply to collections (are there
others?) useless if you depth = 0 or depth = 1 isn't enough.
