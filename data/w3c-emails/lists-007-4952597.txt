The DAV:locate-by-history report finds any collection member
for that history, not just internal members.  In particular,
the example in 5.4.1 shows a Depth:0 (the default) request which
finds the /ws/public/x/test.html member of the /ws/public collection.

So a DAV:locate-by-history report only makes sense with the 
default Depth header value of "0".

What report are you thinking of that makes sense with a non-zero
depth, but which can only be applied to collections?

Cheers,
Geoff

Well.

It does make a lot of sense if you don't know which collection the VCR is
in -- this is why we need it.

So the use case is:

- I have a VHR
- I need to lookup VCRs on a server for which the DAV:version-history points
to my VHR

How am I supposed to do that if not using depth infinity?

Which basically renders all REPORTs that apply to collections (are there
others?) useless if you depth = 0 or depth = 1 isn't enough.
