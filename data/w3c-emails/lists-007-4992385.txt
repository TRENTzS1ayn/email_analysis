Yes, it should say "or the collection itself".  I'll add that to the errata
sheet.
Thanks for noticing that!

Cheers,

Assume that the collection at the root of my WebDAV namespace happens to be
versioned. How do I use locate-by-history to find it?

Shouldn't this

"The response body for a successful request MUST be a DAV:multistatus XML
element containing every version-controlled resource that is a member of the
collection identified by the request-URL,..."

be

"The response body for a successful request MUST be a DAV:multistatus XML
element containing every version-controlled resource that is  a member of
the collection identified by the request-URL or the collection itself,...."

instead?
