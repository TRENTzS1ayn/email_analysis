   Well, it seems that I'm the only one who feels strongly about this --
   so probably RFC3253 should stay as it is (with clarifications, not
   changes).

OK, I'll mark it resolved, with that as the resolution.  The issue
will remain in the issues list though, so if anyone would like to
reopen it, just let me know.

Cheers,
Geoff
