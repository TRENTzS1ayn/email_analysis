Hi.

Given a VCR a and it's VHR b. The VCR is deleted. The workspace feature
(section 6) seems to provide a way to create a new VCR whose
DAV:version-history property points to b.

Now this seems like an extremely important feature in versioning, no matter
wether the server supports the workspace feature or not. So would it be
permissible to use VERSION-CONTROL to resurrect the VCR outside a workspace
(if no other VCR for that VHR exists on the server)?

Julian
