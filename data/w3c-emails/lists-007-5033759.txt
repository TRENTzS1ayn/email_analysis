It probably would have made sense to make it part of the
version-history feature instead of workspace feature, but
nobody asked for it at the time (probably because most of
the people that were planning on supporting the version 
history feature were also planning on supporting the workspace
feature, so they didn't care).

But to answer your specific question, it certainly is fine for
a server to support the VERSION-CONTROL extension without
supporting the workspace feature, but it isn't something that
an interoperable client would expect.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi.

Given a VCR a and it's VHR b. The VCR is deleted. The workspace feature
(section 6) seems to provide a way to create a new VCR whose
DAV:version-history property points to b.

Now this seems like an extremely important feature in versioning, no matter
wether the server supports the workspace feature or not. So would it be
permissible to use VERSION-CONTROL to resurrect the VCR outside a workspace
(if no other VCR for that VHR exists on the server)?

Julian
