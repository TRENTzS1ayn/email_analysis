Hi,

section 6.2.1 says:

"The DAV:workspace property of a workspace resource MUST identify itself.
The DAV:workspace property of any other type of resource MUST be the same as
the DAV:workspace of its parent collection."

It seems to be undefined however what the value is if a resource doesn't
*have* a (DAV-compliant) parent collection, for instance the root of my DAV
namespace.

So what should it be?

a) not present
b) empty (no href)

Julian (leaning to b)
