Yes, I came to the same conclusion, so I'm now inclined instead to
"a" (i.e. "not present") for compatibility with the defined behavior
of DAV:checked-in and DAV:checked-out.  For what it's worth, this
also makes the structure of the XML somewhat more regular (i.e. a
DAV:workspace node in a PROPFIND response always has a DAV:href child).

If nobody objects, I'll just add that to the Errata, and state that
section 6.2.1 is updated to define the the DAV:workspace property to
be present only if the resource is a workspace or the child of a
resource that has a DAV:workspace property.

If you notice any other property definitions that need language of
this kind, please let me know.

Cheers,
Geoff

   I think this case is a bit different.

   For DAV:checked-in and DAV:checked-out the spec is very clear that
   they aren't *present* for resources that don't happen to be
   checked-out / checked-in.

   In *this* case (DAV:workspace), the spec is just silent about the
   value for a resource that happens to be in no workspace.

   Furthermore, I don't think a) would work for DAV:checked-in --
   clients already check for the *presence* of this property to find
   out whether a resource is checked-in, and RFC3253 explicitly says
   this is ok...:

   "This property appears on a checked-in version-controlled resource,
   and identifies a version that has the same content and dead
   properties as the version-controlled resource. This property is
   removed when the resource is checked out, and then added back
   (identifying a new version) when the resource is checked back in."

   This is a good question, and it applies to any "required" property that 
   sometimes has "no value" (e.g. DAV:checked-in and DAV:checked-out). 

   So this question probably should be answered in 2518bis (I'll forward 
   this message to the WebDAV list), but we certainly could take a stab 
   at it in the DeltaV context first. 

   Like Julian, I'd probably be inclined to "b", but don't feel strongly 
   either way.  Anyone prefer "a", prefer to decide separately for each 
   property, or prefer that we leave it up to the server? 

   Cheers,

      section 6.2.1 [of rfc 3253] says: 

      "The DAV:workspace property of a workspace resource MUST identify 
      itself.  The DAV:workspace property of any other type of resource 
      MUST be the same as the DAV:workspace of its parent collection." 

      It seems to be undefined however what the value is if a resource
doesn't 
      *have* a (DAV-compliant) parent collection, for instance the root of
my DAV 
      namespace. 

      So what should it be? 

      a) not present 
      b) empty (no href) 

      Julian (leaning to b)
