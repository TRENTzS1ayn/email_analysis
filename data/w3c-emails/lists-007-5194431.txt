I agree with your conclusion, but I believe this follows from
the DAV:no-overwrite-by-auto-update precondition for CHECKIN, i.e.:

 If the DAV:auto-update property for the checked-out resource
 identifies a version-controlled resource, at least one of the
 versions identified by the DAV:predecessor-set property of the
 checked-out resource MUST identify a version that is either the same
 as or a descendant of the version identified by the DAV:checked-in
 property of that version-controlled resource.

If the VCR is checked-out, there is no DAV:checked-in version,
which means this precondition would not be satisfied.

Cheers,
Geoff

While we're at this topic: we have a similar issue with auto-update of
version controlled collections.

- checkout a versioned collection with apply-to-version
- remove a member from the working collection
- checkout in-place the member of the versioned controlled collection
- checkin the working collection

-> the version controlled collection should be updated an remove
   the binding to the checked-out resource.

I think the checkin should fail in this case, as the removal of
a checked-out member might cannot be permitted.

Do you agree?
