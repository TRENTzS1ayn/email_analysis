RE: UPDATE semantics for checked-out resourcesThis is true, but it does not
apply to the more general case of an UPDATE
of a version.controlled collection containing a checked-out resource which
is not identified
by the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of the update source.

Cheers, Manfred

  Betreff: RE: UPDATE semantics for checked-out resources


  I agree with your conclusion, but I believe this follows from
  the DAV:no-overwrite-by-auto-update precondition for CHECKIN, i.e.:

   If the DAV:auto-update property for the checked-out resource
   identifies a version-controlled resource, at least one of the
   versions identified by the DAV:predecessor-set property of the
   checked-out resource MUST identify a version that is either the same
   as or a descendant of the version identified by the DAV:checked-in
   property of that version-controlled resource.

  If the VCR is checked-out, there is no DAV:checked-in version,
  which means this precondition would not be satisfied.

  Cheers,
  Geoff

  While we're at this topic: we have a similar issue with auto-update of
  version controlled collections.

  - checkout a versioned collection with apply-to-version
  - remove a member from the working collection
  - checkout in-place the member of the versioned controlled collection
  - checkin the working collection

  -> the version controlled collection should be updated an remove
     the binding to the checked-out resource.

  I think the checkin should fail in this case, as the removal of
  a checked-out member might cannot be permitted.

  Do you agree?
