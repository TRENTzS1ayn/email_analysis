I see where this is going...

I think DELETE on a checked-out VCR must be ok. However if I UPDATE
a collection and someone else checked out the contained VCR and
that VCR is silently deleted, all his/her changes are lost.

Which can happen anyway, unless she/he locks the VCR.

Therefore I change my mind and from now on to forver say that
explicit and implicit DELETE on checked-out resources are "OK".
