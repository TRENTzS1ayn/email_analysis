Proposed resolution:

1) Deprecate marshalling through OPTIONS.

2) Add three new live properties:

----------------------

(Version histories)

5.2        Additional Resource Properties

The version-history feature introduces the following REQUIRED property for
resources that reside in a part of a server's namespace that supports
version histories.

5.1.1           DAV:version-history-collection-set (protected)

The DAV:version-history-collection-set property identifies collections that
may contain version histories.  An identified collection MAY be the root
collection of a tree of collections, all of which may contain version
histories.  Since different servers can control different parts of the URL
namespace, different resources on the same host MAY have different
DAV:version-history-collection-set values.  The identified collections MAY
be located on different hosts from the resource.

<!ELEMENT version-history-collection-set (href+)>


----------------------

(Workspaces)

6.2.1           DAV:workspace-collection-set (protected)

The DAV:workspace-collection-set property  identifies collections that may
contain workspaces.  An identified collection MAY be the root collection of
a tree of collections, all of which may contain workspaces.  Since different
servers can control different parts of the URL namespace, different
resources on the same host MAY have different DAV:workspace-collection-set
values.  The identified collections MAY be located on different hosts from
the resource.

<!ELEMENT workspace-collection-set (href)>

----------------------

(Activities)


13.4    Additional Resource Properties

The activity feature introduces the following REQUIRED property for
resources that reside in a part of the server's namespace supporting
activities.

13.4.1       DAV:activity-collection-set (protected)

The DAV:activity-collection-set property  identifies collections that may
contain activities.  An identified collection MAY be the root collection of
a tree of collections, all of which may contain activities.  Since different
servers can control different parts of the URL namespace, different
resources on the same host MAY have different DAV:activity-collection-set
values.  The identified collections MAY be located on different hosts from
the resource.
