The "mutable version" stuff evolved into "variants", and
then got yanked a few months before we went to final call,
because of lack of interest in supporting it.

The Variant ID never did get posted (and would have expired
by now anyway :-), but I still have a copy, and will post it
to the WebDAV/DeltaV web site, and submit it as an ID.

Cheers,
Geoff

Where did the mutable stuff go? Did that get yanked out into a separate I-D
or something? We (svn) wanted to make a particular resource mutable, but
there are no longer guidelines...
