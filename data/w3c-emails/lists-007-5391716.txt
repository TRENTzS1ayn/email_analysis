Hi,

a very basic question...

The workspace feature introduces a live (protected) resource property which
seems to depend on the URI of the resource, not the resource itself:

" If the request-URL did not identify a workspace, the DAV:workspace of the
destination MUST have been updated to have the same value as the
DAV:workspace of the parent collection of the destination."

To me this seems to indicate that it's not really a property of the resource
itself, but that it only depends on how you access the resurce.

How does this property affect bindings to a resource in a workspace?

a) there may be no additional bindings

b) there may be additional bindings, but they must all reside in the same
workspace's namespace

c) there may be additional bindings, and the reported DAV:workspace property
just depends on the URI used in the request

(I currently lean towards c)
