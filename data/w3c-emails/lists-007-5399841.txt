I would expect the latter, i.e. just the fact that the
versioned collection had changed.  The client would then
look at the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of the
DAV:checked-in version of the collection to see how it
should update its local state (it needs to do that to
differentiate a delete/add from a move).

One benefit of this approach is that it doesn't cause 
a flood of responses if you move a folder with 1000
members (i.e. it would return just the source and destination
collections of the move, rather that 1000 added entries
and 1000 deleted entries).

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

the spec says about the UPDATE method [1]:

"The response to an UPDATE request identifies the resources modified by the
request, so that a client can efficiently update any cached state it is
maintaining. Extensions to the UPDATE method allow multiple resources to be
modified from a single UPDATE request (see Section 12.13). "

When a versioned collection is updated, this may affect the versioned
collections and all it's internal members. One possible state transition is
that a child is removed.

For instance, let "/a" be a versioned collection with a version controlled
member "/a/b". I update "/a" from a collection version which doesn't have
"b" in it's version-controlled-binding-set. "/a/b" gets removed. What
response do we expect?

 <D:multistatus xmlns:D="DAV:">
  <D:response>
    <D:href>/a/</D:href>
    <D:status>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</D:status>
  </D:response>
  <D:response>
    <D:href>/a/b</D:href>
    <D:status>HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found</D:status>
  </D:response>
</D:multistatus>

or

 <D:multistatus xmlns:D="DAV:">
  <D:response>
    <D:href>/a/</D:href>
    <D:status>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</D:status>
  </D:response>
</D:multistatus>

?
