No, the DAV:workspace is not affected by the request-URL that you
use to identify the URL (that would be bad for a variety of reasons).
The only way you can have two different URLs for the same resource is
if you have two bindings to either the resource or to a parent of the
resource.  In this case, some resource has multiple parents, and which
parent is picked for inheritance of the DAV:workspace property is up to
the server (but it has to pick one, and return it consistently).

So the answer was: (d) None of the above (:-).

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

a very basic question...

The workspace feature introduces a live (protected) resource property which
seems to depend on the URI of the resource, not the resource itself:

" If the request-URL did not identify a workspace, the DAV:workspace of the
destination MUST have been updated to have the same value as the
DAV:workspace of the parent collection of the destination."

To me this seems to indicate that it's not really a property of the resource
itself, but that it only depends on how you access the resurce.

How does this property affect bindings to a resource in a workspace?

a) there may be no additional bindings

b) there may be additional bindings, but they must all reside in the same
workspace's namespace

c) there may be additional bindings, and the reported DAV:workspace property
just depends on the URI used in the request

(I currently lean towards c)


Julian
