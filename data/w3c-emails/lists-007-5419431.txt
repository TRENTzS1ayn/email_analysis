Well,

in this case we would have an erratum for 7.1:

"The response for a successful request MUST be a 207 Multi-Status, where the
DAV:multistatus XML element in the response body identifies all resources
that have been modified by the request."

I also don't understand the second part of your reply -- we're talking about
response marshalling for UPDATE, not MOVE. What am I missing?

I would expect the latter, i.e. just the fact that the
versioned collection had changed.  The client would then
look at the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of the
DAV:checked-in version of the collection to see how it
should update its local state (it needs to do that to
differentiate a delete/add from a move).
One benefit of this approach is that it doesn't cause
a flood of responses if you move a folder with 1000
members (i.e. it would return just the source and destination
collections of the move, rather that 1000 added entries
and 1000 deleted entries).
Cheers,
Geoff
