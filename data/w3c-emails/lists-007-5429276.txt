RE: workspace propertyNot convinced yet :-)

The idea of a resource property which changes it's value upon MOVE isn't
really appealing -- the properties of a resource should be independant of
the access path.

Up to now, I was expecting a MOVE to have the same properties as a BIND
followed by a DELETE on the original URI -- this would be lost with your
interpretation.

Question: what is the use case for MOVEs between workspaces? Wouldn't it be
much simpler to just forbid that?

  No, the DAV:workspace is not affected by the request-URL that you
  use to identify the URL (that would be bad for a variety of reasons).
  The only way you can have two different URLs for the same resource is
  if you have two bindings to either the resource or to a parent of the
  resource.  In this case, some resource has multiple parents, and which
  parent is picked for inheritance of the DAV:workspace property is up to
  the server (but it has to pick one, and return it consistently).

  So the answer was: (d) None of the above (:-).

  Cheers,
  Geoff

  Hi,

  a very basic question...

  The workspace feature introduces a live (protected) resource property
which
  seems to depend on the URI of the resource, not the resource itself:

  " If the request-URL did not identify a workspace, the DAV:workspace of
the
  destination MUST have been updated to have the same value as the
  DAV:workspace of the parent collection of the destination."

  To me this seems to indicate that it's not really a property of the
resource
  itself, but that it only depends on how you access the resurce.

  How does this property affect bindings to a resource in a workspace?

  a) there may be no additional bindings

  b) there may be additional bindings, but they must all reside in the same
  workspace's namespace

  c) there may be additional bindings, and the reported DAV:workspace
property
  just depends on the URI used in the request

  (I currently lean towards c)



  Julian
