RE: UPDATE responses for versioned collectionsHmm.

Let's phrase it differently: in the absence of the baseline feature, is
there any case where an update for a version controlled collection would
affect the state of more than one resource (being the collection itself)?

  Why do we need an errata entry?  The question is whether removing a
  binding to a resource is considered a modification to the
  resource, or a modification to the collection containing the
  binding.  For the purposes of UPDATE, I believe it should be
  considered a modification to the collection containing the
  binding only.

  The "move" (lower case) I was referring to was a multi-resource
  update that would result from a labeled update, or a baseline update.
  Such a multi-resource update could result in a logical move of
  a subtree from one URL to another.

  Cheers,
  Geoff

  Well,

  in this case we would have an erratum for 7.1:

  "The response for a successful request MUST be a 207 Multi-Status, where
the
  DAV:multistatus XML element in the response body identifies all resources
  that have been modified by the request."

  I also don't understand the second part of your reply -- we're talking
about
  response marshalling for UPDATE, not MOVE. What am I missing?

  I would expect the latter, i.e. just the fact that the
  versioned collection had changed.  The client would then
  look at the DAV:version-controlled-binding-set of the
  DAV:checked-in version of the collection to see how it
  should update its local state (it needs to do that to
  differentiate a delete/add from a move).
  One benefit of this approach is that it doesn't cause
  a flood of responses if you move a folder with 1000
  members (i.e. it would return just the source and destination
  collections of the move, rather that 1000 added entries
  and 1000 deleted entries).
  Cheers,
  Geoff
