Since there have been no objections, I have taken Julian's
suggested text, marked these two issues as closed, and
posted a revised 3253 draft to the deltav web site.

These were the last two open issues on the RFC-3253 issues list,
so all current RFC-3253 issues are now resolved!
If any new issues arise, please notify the working group via the mailing
list.

I will submit the revised 3253 draft as an internet draft later this week.

Cheers,
Geoff

I agree with the proposed resolution. 
Unless someone disagrees, I will add this to the Errata sheet, 
and mark the issue as closed. 
Cheers,

Proposed resolution: 
1) Deprecate marshalling through OPTIONS. 
2) Add three new live properties: 
---------------------- 
(Version histories) 
5.2        Additional Resource Properties 
The version-history feature introduces the following REQUIRED property for 
resources that reside in a part of a server's namespace that supports 
version histories. 
5.1.1           DAV:version-history-collection-set (protected) 
The DAV:version-history-collection-set property identifies collections that 
may contain version histories.  An identified collection MAY be the root 
collection of a tree of collections, all of which may contain version 
histories.  Since different servers can control different parts of the URL 
namespace, different resources on the same host MAY have different 
DAV:version-history-collection-set values.  The identified collections MAY 
be located on different hosts from the resource. 
<!ELEMENT version-history-collection-set (href+)> 


---------------------- 
(Workspaces) 
6.2.1           DAV:workspace-collection-set (protected) 
The DAV:workspace-collection-set property  identifies collections that may 
contain workspaces.  An identified collection MAY be the root collection of 
a tree of collections, all of which may contain workspaces.  Since different

servers can control different parts of the URL namespace, different 
resources on the same host MAY have different DAV:workspace-collection-set 
values.  The identified collections MAY be located on different hosts from 
the resource. 
<!ELEMENT workspace-collection-set (href)> 
---------------------- 
(Activities) 


13.4    Additional Resource Properties 
The activity feature introduces the following REQUIRED property for 
resources that reside in a part of the server's namespace supporting 
activities. 
13.4.1       DAV:activity-collection-set (protected) 
The DAV:activity-collection-set property  identifies collections that may 
contain activities.  An identified collection MAY be the root collection of 
a tree of collections, all of which may contain activities.  Since different

servers can control different parts of the URL namespace, different 
resources on the same host MAY have different DAV:activity-collection-set 
values.  The identified collections MAY be located on different hosts from 
the resource. 
<!ELEMENT activity-collection-set (href*)>
