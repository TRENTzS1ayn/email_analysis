Sure.

1) Consistency with HTTP: requests that create new resources should return a
201.

2) Consistence with deltaV (defining DAV:version-control-response as
optional response body)

3) Performance: I've seen many cases where after a version-control, a client
would like to access either the checked-in version or the VHR -- in which
case it currently needs an additional PROPFIND.

It's still an additional request and doesn't come for free. In general, a
server will have to do another call to it's backend to get this information.
