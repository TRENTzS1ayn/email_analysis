To date, we've limited 3253 modifications to demonstrable
semantic problems with the protocol (e.g. the Label header)
or interoperability problems (the use of an OPTIONS body).

I personally would not want to modify/extend the protocol
simply for "consistency".  This makes the protocol too much of a
moving target for implementors.

For the same reason, I would not want to modify/extend the
protocol for optimizing certain requests, until it has been demonstrated
that these performance issues are common and severe.

But it certainly would be reasonable to define these extensions in a
separate draft, and add that draft to the list of proposed DeltaV 
extensions on the DeltaV web site.  That way implementors who encounter
these performance issues can work around them in a common way,
making that extension a likely candidate for inclusion in the next
draft.

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi.

The VERSION-CONTROL method -- when applied to a versionable but not yet
version-controlled resource, creates one or two new resources (being the
checked-in version and optionall the version history resource).

I'd like to see the definition in 3.5 extended to

- allow a 201 to be returned when new resources were created (see [1])

- define that in this case, the Location header should point to the version
being created

- define an optional response body (DAV:version-control-response) that
contains references to the resources being created, such as:

<version-control-response xmlns="DAV:">
  <checked-in>...</checked-in>
  <version-history>...</version-history>
</version-control-response>

(similar marshalling may also be needed for other methods that create new
resources)
