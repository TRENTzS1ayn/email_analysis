I agree with this. However, I'm not sure about how intrusive this change is.

- Right now the response code for VERSION-CONTROL conflicts with the
recommendations from RFC2616. With the current wording, client writers can
rely on  getting a 200 on success. I think we should relax that so that 201
is allowed as well (yes, I think this needs to be mentioned as an erratum).

- All the other changes then follow from standard RFC2616 semantics, and or
similar definitions in DeltaV.
