I wasn't saying that it should be a MUST.

Well, we can also make it a MAY or a SHOULD and put it into RFC3253bis.

Right now we have:

- the response codes aren't specified, one example (plain V-C) says 200, the
other (V-C in workspace) says 201.

- the document element for the optional response body in fact *is* defined.

So what's left?

1) clarifying that the plain V-C *may* return 201 and optionally may provide
the location of the checked-in version in the Location header

2) possibly allow marshalling of "both" locations (version and VHR) in the
response body.

I think 1) is an erratum, while 2) would be just a useful extension
(although recommended in HTTP).
