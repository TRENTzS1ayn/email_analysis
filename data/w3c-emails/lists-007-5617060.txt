Members of this list might find the SCM-11 workshop to be of interest.
Experience papers concerning work with DeltaV would be of interest to
attendees of this workshop. As well, since the workshop is being held in
Portland, Oregon, it would be relatively convenient for many on this list to
attend (it's practically in Merant's back yard :-)

Please contact me if you have any questions about submitting a paper to this
workshop.

IMPORTANT DATES

Technical papers due       December 20, 2002
Notification of acceptance February 7, 2003
Camera-ready papers due    February 28, 2003


GOALS AND SCOPE

The discipline of software configuration management (SCM) provides one
of the best success stories in the field of software engineering. With
the availability of over a hundred commercial SCM systems that
together form a billion dollar marketplace, and the explicit
recognition of SCM by such standards as the CMM and ISO-9000, the
discipline has established itself as one of the essential cornerstones
of software engineering.

While SCM is a well-established discipline, innovative software
engineering approaches constitute new challenges that require support
in new and in integrated engineering areas in form of new or improved
tools, techniques, and processes. These challenges emerge in
component-based development, distributed systems, dynamically bound
and reconfigured systems, embedded systems, software architecture,
web-based systems, XML, engineering/product data management, system
engineering, process suppport, concurrent and cooperative engineering,
etc. SCM-11 provides a forum for presenting and discussing innovative
approaches to SCM. The workshop addresses both researchers and
practitioners. Moreover, it has a strong interdisciplinary flavor and
specifically invites participants from related disciplines.


PARTICIPATION

SCM-11 will be open to all participants interested in SCM. The
workshop addresses participants from both universities and
industry. Registration for the workshop is not restricted, i.e., it
requires no invitation by the PC.


PAPER SUBMISSIONS

SCM-11 invites two categories of submissions.

1. Long papers (14-16 pages) describe technical contributions to SCM
in depth. This includes both research papers and experience reports.

2. Short papers (6-8 pages) concisely describe ongoing work, new
ideas, experiences, etc.

All submitted papers will be reviewed by the program committee. Papers
must not have been previously published or submitted elsewhere. The
proceedings will be published in the LNCS series
(Springer-Verlag). Submissions must conform to the LNCS style. See
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/index.html


All papers are invited which refer to SCM or related
disciplines. Papers may address e.g. the following topics (but are not
limited to these topics):

* Version and configuration control
* Process support
* Distributed and cooperative work
* Workspace management
* Software manufacture and software deployment
* SCM and software architecture (architectures for SCM systems, SCM
  support for software architecture)
* SCM for component-based, embedded, dynamically bound and reconfigured
systems
* SCM for web-based systems
* Industrial experiences gained from introducing and applying SCM systems
* Process improvement, maturity models, and metrics
* Related disciplines, e.g., engineering/product data management or
  document management
