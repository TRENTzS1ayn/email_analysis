I'll add the issues identified in (1) to the issues/errata list.

I think clarifying that VERSION-CONTROL can return 201 is
uncontroversial, so I'll just make that as an editorial change.

Does anyone object to having VERSION-CONTROL be required to
return a Location header with the newly created version, just
as CHECKIN does?  This does seem like a reasonable thing to require,
to make sure that the client can get a reliable handle to the
version it just created.

As for the extension (marshalling the version and vhr info in
the response body), since this is just an optimization of information
that can currently be obtained via PROPFIND or the DAV:version-tree
report, I'd prefer to see that written up in a draft
that is referenced in the "proposed extensions" section of the
deltav page, to keep the "issues and errata" document for errors and
ambiguities in 3253.

Cheers,
Geoff
