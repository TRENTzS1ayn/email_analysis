Geoff,

I have to say that I completely disagree, and I would have really hoped that
the arguments in my previous mail would actually be considered (I've seen no
reply -- does this mean nobody had anything to say about it???).

In particular:

> As for the other topic, i.e. which URL appears in property values,

No way! DeltaV has the concept of stable bindings, but if there's no
interoperable way to discover them, the whole concept is *completely*
useless. So if we wan't agree that live properties such as "DAV:checked-in"
*always* identify the stable binding, it makes no sense whatsoever to keep
this concept. So we *really* need to write that down. Does anybody have a
problem with this (just in case: silence means "no"!)?

And if we get *that* issue resolved, I'd really like to see a *discussion*
of the argument I made:

>> is still mapped (so a client can get a 404...), I hereby ask again to
>> consider the following alternate resolution to 14.4_CLARIFY_VH_DELETE_2:

>> through the stable URL anymore. This relaxes the "stable URL" requirement

>> This model is completely deterministic and avoids special-casing DELETE
and

simplification (a

Regards, Julian
