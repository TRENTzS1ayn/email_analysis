How can you not implement multiple bindings, if they appear as port of
working collections?

Anyway, I think this should be marked as resolved (the spec should state
that all version and VHR URIs that are reported in live properties must be
the stable URIs).

I'll answer the "other" issue in a separate mail (which will take time).
