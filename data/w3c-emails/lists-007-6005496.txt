Hi,

Is it possible in WebDAV versioning that the version resources of a version
history are distributed across mutliple servers? I guess this may sound a
little bit strange, though a server somehow implies among others autonomy
and responsibility for hosted resources, thus it seems that it might be
feasible (e.g., when multiple organizations are manipulating documents in
cooperation) to allocate version resources on the different servers.

For example, is it possible to allocate three versions V1, V2 (succeeding
V1), and V3 (succeeding V2) on servers S1, S2, and S3 respectively? Is this
achieveable with server workspaces (sort of workaround)? Or do server
workspaces only work on the same physical machine (server)?

Kind regards,
Martin
