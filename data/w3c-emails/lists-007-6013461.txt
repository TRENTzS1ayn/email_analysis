Hi Martin,

This is my definitely-non-expert opinion..

I've been looking at a similar scenario and realised that a solution
might be possible combining versioning and a build tool such as Ant
(ant.apache.org), which can query a repository for a particular version
and upload it via FTP.  The Ant project doesn't yet include WebDAV
support, but I'm sure it won't be far off.

Would take a wee bit of work, but there could be an exciting open
source project in it that I'm willing to give a go.

So, in summary, I (personally) think what you're asking steps into the
realm of other technologies assisting a WebDAV repository, but it wounds
like a project worth doing! I'd like to know if I'm wrong in this - it
may well be an area supported by WebDAV/Delta-V.

regards,
Shanan Holm

Hi,

Is it possible in WebDAV versioning that the version resources of a
version
history are distributed across mutliple servers? I guess this may sound
a
little bit strange, though a server somehow implies among others
autonomy
and responsibility for hosted resources, thus it seems that it might
be
feasible (e.g., when multiple organizations are manipulating documents
in
cooperation) to allocate version resources on the different servers.

For example, is it possible to allocate three versions V1, V2
(succeeding
V1), and V3 (succeeding V2) on servers S1, S2, and S3 respectively? Is
this
achieveable with server workspaces (sort of workaround)? Or do server
workspaces only work on the same physical machine (server)?

Kind regards,
Martin
