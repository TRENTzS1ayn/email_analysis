As far as I understood it, a VR is created automatically upon checkin. And
by Section 3.15 of the spec, I cannot move the VR by a move method.  So how
can it be possible then to store a VR of a VH on a different (WebDAV)
server?

Regards, Martin

There is nothing in the protocol that prevents a server from storing 
versions from a given version history on different servers.  What 
made you think that this was not allowed?
