There are two several questions here.

One is: Can the server store different versions on different servers?
The answer to this is: yes.
A server can do whatever it wants in this regard.

Another is: Does the protocol provide a way for a client to force the 
server to put a version on a particular server?
The answer to this is: no.
Different server implementations will have very different policies and 
capabilities wrt where and how versions are stored, and any attempt by a 
client to "control" this will inevitably result in poor interoperability.

Another is: Can a client hint at what server it would want a new version 
to be stored on?
The answer to this is: yes.
In particular, a client explicitly creates a version-controlled resource 
at a particular location.  A client can create (or at least try to create 
... depends on what the server supports) different version-controlled 
resources for a given version history on different servers.  When a user 
checks in a given version-controlled resource (or checks in a working 
resource checked-out from a given version-controlled resource), a server 
can take this as a hint that it would be reasonable to store the new 
version on the same server that stores that version-controlled resource.

Cheers,
Geoff
