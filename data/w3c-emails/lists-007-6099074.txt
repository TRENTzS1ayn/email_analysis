They can't.  Requiring that there be such a mechanism would severely 
constrain distributed
implementations, which want to allow you to create baselines without write 
access to the versions
or version histories being added to that baseline.  Without write access 
to the version or 
version history, there's no good way to answer this query.  A particular 
implementation could
add a custom report/property for such a purpose, but the use of that 
report/property would not
be interoperable.

Cheers,
Geoff
