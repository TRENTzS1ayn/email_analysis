On behalf of Eckehard Hermann:

Hi all,

we implemented the DeltaV and ACL extensions in our WebDAV server and now
clients are having problems in defining access rights on versioning
resources, i.e. VHR and VR resources (im particular, in view of
auto-versioning).
For example:
- how to protect /history/* without hindering auto-versioning?
- shouldn't access rights on a VCR imply access right on the associated
VR/VHR?

The DeltaV spec just touches the theme in section 16 and the ACL spec does
not mention versioning resources at all.

As VHRs and VRs are usually implicitly created while operating on VCRs
(VERSION-CONTROL, CHECKOUT, CHECKIN, auto-versioning) it should be specified
how access rights are initialized on these resources (e.g. is the DAV:acl
property to be copied to the newly created VR on CHECKIN?). 

In view of ACL inheritance over the namespace hierarchy, we believe that
integrating DeltaV and ACL is not a trivial theme and should be addressed in
either the ACL or the DeltaV spec.

Regards
Eckehard Hermann
