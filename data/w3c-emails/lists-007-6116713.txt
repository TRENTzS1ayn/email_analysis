Hi,
I'm looking for some DeltaV scenarios. Meaning I'm interested in logs
of request/response between a server and a client.
Does anybody have such information ?
The main problem isn't DeltaV itself. In RFC3253 there are many examples.
But what about the basics like an OPTIONS reply ?
RFC2518 and RFC2616 aren't that verbose.
When I e.g. tried to connect as a Windows Webfolder my server got an OPTIONS
request.
But what should I give as a reply ?

I tried to compile cadaver on my Mandrake 8.1 Linux but got an error :-(

Cheers, Edgar
