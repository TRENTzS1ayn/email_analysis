With my e-Mail client HTML emails are hard to answer (quite weird), thus my
answer are marked by ">" (so, the inverse from usual), sorry for that.

Subject: Re: Distributing versions across servers

There are two several questions here. 

One is: Can the server store different versions on different servers? 
The answer to this is: yes. 
A server can do whatever it wants in this regard.

Another is: Does the protocol provide a way for a client to force the server
to put a version on a particular server? 
The answer to this is: no. 
Different server implementations will have very different policies and
capabilities wrt where and how versions are stored, and any attempt by a
client to "control" this will inevitably result in poor interoperability.

Another is: Can a client hint at what server it would want a new version to
be stored on? 
The answer to this is: yes. 
In particular, a client explicitly creates a version-controlled resource at
a particular location.  A client can create (or at least try to create ...
depends on what the server supports) different version-controlled resources
for a given version history on different servers.  When a user checks in a
given version-controlled resource (or checks in a working resource
checked-out from a given version-controlled resource), a server can take
this as a hint that it would be reasonable to store the new version on the
same server that stores that version-controlled resource.
