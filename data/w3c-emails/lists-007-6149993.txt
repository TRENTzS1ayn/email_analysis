Hi,
my repository naturally is giving me a time when a version of a resource
was created.
Did we define a name for this property ? I didn't find anything in 3253.
Or should DAV:creationdate of a checked-in VCR be set to the
creation time of the version ?
Is this be possible for all operating systems ?

Cheers, Edgar
