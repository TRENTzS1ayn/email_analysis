Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

That's up to the server.  Once it has two parents, the server can pick 
which
one is its workspace.  A side effect of the BIND could be to reset the 
workspace
property back to be W1.

It is a property that can be modified as a side-effect of a request (e.g.
BIND or UNBIND), but I'm not sure I'd call it a "computed" property.
