This was deliberately left up to the server.  Since the results
of the auto-merge is up to the server, the exact result will be
server-dependent anyway.  Since commonly a client will want auto-merge
to be performed for collections, it didn't seem worth including a
parameter that most clients wouldn't use.

Cheers,
Geoff
