Now suppose a client wants a DAV:expand-property REPORT report but
my server doesn't implement it (yet).
Should I return:
- A plain 501 ?
- A 501 and some explanation in a body. How could this body look like ?
- Other response ?

I know that a client can find the supported-report-set. But perhaps not
all are doing it.
