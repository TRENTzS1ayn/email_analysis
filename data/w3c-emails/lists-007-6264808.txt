Hi,
     In the RFC , workspace is defined to be a collection , but isn't it actually a "scratch" pad on which first all changes are done and then later merged with the "main" branch/stream ? My question is , would this workspace be visible through a PROPFIND request or a 
normal directory listing ?

warm regards,
Vikram
