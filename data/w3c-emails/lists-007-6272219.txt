When the workspace feature is supported, a workspace
is the primary way that the contents of the repository
is accessed, so there will be a workspace for viewing
the "main branch", as well as "scratch" workspaces for
anyone that wants a separate stable environment.

Wrt to your particular question, yes, since
a workspace is a collection, it is visible through
a PROPFIND request (I'm not sure what you mean by a 
"normal directory listing", but the answer is probably
"yes" for that as well:-).
If it weren't, how would your client access the information 
in it?

Cheers,
Geoff

     In the RFC , workspace is defined to be a collection , but isn't it
actually a "scratch" pad on which first all changes are done and then later
merged with the "main" branch/stream ? My question is , would this workspace
be visible through a PROPFIND request or a 
normal directory listing ?

warm regards,
Vikram
