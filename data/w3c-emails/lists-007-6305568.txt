Hi ,
    so what you mean is that when I will create a collection and baseline it , all the member
vcr's in it will point to vr's (existing history lines) of there corresponding "source" lines (from the baselines) , instead of creating new ones ?


wamr regards,
Vikram

Hi,
I think the solution is what you wrote in you other post.

As it interpret "point's" the answer is yes.

No new history created.

Editing your example by adding "/workspace.."
> VERSION-CONTROL /workspace1/foo.html HTTP/1.1
> Host: ...

> <D:version-control ...>

> so is /workspace1/foo.html pointing to ver/3
Yes.

Use e.g.
> VERSION-CONTROL /workspace2/foo.html HTTP/1.1
> Host: ...
> 
> <?xml .....>
> <D:version-control ...>
> <D:version>
> <D:href> http://server/someotherhistory/12/ver/2 </D:href>
> </D:version>
> </D:version-control>
IIRC there is a restriction that you can't have multiple VCRs with the same VR
in a workspace to avoid merging problems (Which I still don't think necessary BTW,
but that's another matter not for today to discuss)

Cheers, Edgar
