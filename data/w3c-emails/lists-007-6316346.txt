VERSION-CONTROL with a specific version argument creates
a VCR that refers to the existing version and its version
history.  This is what lets multiple workspaces work on the
same version history concurrently.  See postcondition
DAV:new-version-controlled-resource:
"a new version-controlled resource exists at the request-URL whose
DAV:checked-in property identifies that version"

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,
   When it is said that a vcr is created in a workspace by VERSION-CONTROL
request and initialized with another version from some other version history
, does that mean that 
this vcr also "point's" to the same version (and thus is part of the same
tree ) or is altogether
new with it's own vr and history (of that vr). 

e.g:

VERSION-CONTROL /foo.html HTTP/1.1
Host: ...
.
.
.

<?xml .....>
<D:version-control ...>
<D:version>
<D:href> http://server/someotherhistory/12/ver/3 </D:href>
</D:version>
</D:version-control>

so is foo.html pointing to ver/3 or is totally new with it's vr having
history as v1 ?

I believe it is the latter , but I am quite confused at this moment to
reason.

Thanks a lot,
Vikram
