Baselining a collection never changes what versions are
selected by the members of that collection ... it just
records what versions are currently selected.

Hi ,
    so what you mean is that when I will create a collection and baseline it
, all the member
vcr's in it will point to vr's (existing history lines) of there
corresponding "source" lines (from the baselines) , instead of creating new
ones ?


wamr regards,
Vikram

Hi,
I think the solution is what you wrote in you other post.
 
"Vikram_Roopchand" <Vikram_Roopchand@infosys.com>:

does that

As it interpret "point's" the answer is yes.

No new history created.

Editing your example by adding "/workspace.."
> VERSION-CONTROL /workspace1/foo.html HTTP/1.1
> Host: ...
> 
> <?xml .....>
> <D:version-control ...>
> <D:version>
> <D:href> http://server/someotherhistory/12/ver/3 </D:href>
> </D:version>

> 
> so is /workspace1/foo.html pointing to ver/3
Yes.

VH ?

Use e.g.
> VERSION-CONTROL /workspace2/foo.html HTTP/1.1
> Host: ...
> 
> <?xml .....>
> <D:version-control ...>
> <D:version>
> <D:href> http://server/someotherhistory/12/ver/2 </D:href>
> </D:version>
> </D:version-control>
IIRC there is a restriction that you can't have multiple VCRs with the same
VR
in a workspace to avoid merging problems (Which I still don't think
necessary BTW,
but that's another matter not for today to discuss)

Cheers, Edgar
