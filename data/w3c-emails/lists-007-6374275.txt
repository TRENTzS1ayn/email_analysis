I don't see why this needs to be coupled. I do understand that there are
cases where servers do not support the concept of un-vcr-ing a resource, but
we have provably two independant implementations that both want/need to
support this feature and are looking for a interoperable way to do it
easily.

I think in this case it's best to just return 405 (not allowed), just as a
RFC3253-conforming server would do it anyway.
