Well, if there are multiple implementations that want it, it's certainly
nice if you can marshall it. That was the point of the proposal. Right now,
I really don't care which kind of activity this leads to (deltaV addendum,
private informational RFC, ...).

Regarding the what-is-the-need-question: it makes a difference whether you
are building a new system that accurately reflects the deltaV model, or if
you are busing deltaV to HTTP-marshall requests between systems that exist
independantly of WebDAV. In the latter case, you really can't choose --
you'll have to come up with a way to marshall that type of request (or
you'll have to live with an unhappy customer).

In general, I understand why a system would version everything, or a system
where the decision about what is version-controlled is made by the server.
What I don't really see is the use case for a system that has an explicit
"enable" but no "disable" call.
