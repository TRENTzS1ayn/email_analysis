Hi ,
    I could not understand the following part of defination of Configuration

" A configuration is a set of resources that consists of a root collection and all members (not just internal members) of that root collection that are not members of another configuration. "

Why should the member's not be part of another configuration ? Could anyone please give a relevant use case also ?

Thanksa a ton,
best regards,
Vikram
