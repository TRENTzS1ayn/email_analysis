In a recent thread on the ordering protocol, Julian suggested that a
500 response code is more appropriate than either a 403 or a 409 for a
postcondition failure.  I agree, and furthermore believe that RFC3253
should be updated to allow a DAV:error node to appear in the body of
any 4xx or 5xx response.  This allows the server to use the most
meaningful response code for clients that do not understand DAV:error
nodes.

Does anyone object to this extension?

Cheers,
Geoff
