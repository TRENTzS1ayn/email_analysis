Hi ,

       We are implementing a server for DeltaV , there are conflicts among couple of groups here about the design of the Server. 

One Group believes that since DeltaV is a versioning extension of WebDAV the relationship in terms of OOAD is "is Kind Of" (Inheritance) , hence the Implementation of DeltaV should extend from already implemented WebDAV server.

While the other group believes that the DeltaV is a "Component" (not to be taken literally) of WebDAV  i.e WebDAV can be made "versionable" using DeltaV or by simply "activating" DeltaV Implementation Code .... and hence DeltaV should be treated seperately.

I would like to know the relationship between DeltaV and WebDAV in terms of OOP/OOAD.

I would be highly grateful , if anyone could get back to me with his/her views as soon as possible.

Best Regards,         

Vikram
