Hi,

4.3 CHECKOUT Method (applied to a version-controlled resource)
defines the precondition :

(DAV:checkout-of-version-with-descendant-is-forbidden): If the
      DAV:checkout-fork property of the version being checked out is
      DAV:forbidden, the request MUST fail if a version identifies that
      version in its DAV:predecessor-set.

This means if I set checkout-fork to forbidden on the VCR this would
prohibit concurrent checkouts across all workspaces having a VCR for 
this version history. 

This is not exactly what we want to provide.
We want to prohibit concurrent checkouts in the same workspace only,
i.e. if a user exclusively checks out a VCR pointing to Version V7 in 
workspace A we want to prevent concurrent checkouts in the same workspace
only, but checkout of a VCR of a different workspace B currently 
pointing to the same version V7 shall be allowed.

Is there a way to specify this in DeltaV ?

regards
Matthias

Just set the DAV:checkout-fork property of the VCR to be DAV:forbidden.

Cheers,

Hi,

I am wondering how an exclusive checkout with apply-to-version of a 
VCR could be requested using DeltaV protocol. We want to be able
to prevent concurrent checkouts of the same VCR in the same workspace.

Matthias
