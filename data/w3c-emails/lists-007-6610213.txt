Having multiple version-controlled resources in a workspace
was not Matthias' issue.  He wanted to prevent multiple
concurrent DAV:apply-to-version CHECKOUT's on the same
version-controlled resource.  

Cheers,
Geoff

Hi,

in my opinion, the following precondition solves your problem

(DAV:one-version-controlled-resource-per-history-per-workspace): If the 
DAV:version-control request body specifies a version, and if the 
request-URL is a member of a workspace, then there MUST NOT already be a 
version-controlled member of that workspace whose DAV:checked-in or 
DAV:checked-out property identifies any version from the version history 
of the version specified in the request body.

regards, Manfred
