Hi,

ok, understand how to reject a concurrent checkout if an exclusive
checkout is already present. 

My question was how to request the exclusive checkout through
the protocol. We don't want to do exclusive checkouts implicitly
on all checkouts but we want to allow the client to specify if
the checkout is to be done exclusively or not in the sense
described below.

regards
Matthias

   We want to prohibit concurrent checkouts in the same workspace
   only, i.e. if a user exclusively checks out a VCR pointing to
   Version V7 in workspace A we want to prevent concurrent checkouts
   in the same workspace only, but checkout of a VCR of a different
   workspace B currently pointing to the same version V7 shall be
   allowed.

   Is there a way to specify this in DeltaV ?

There's no standard way for you to expose that restriction, so I'd
suggest just returning DAV:checkin-fork-forbidden with some custom
error string indicating that it is a checkout in this workspace
that is blocking the CHECKOUT.

Cheers,
Geoff
