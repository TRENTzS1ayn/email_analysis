Hi,

but this would mean that all checkouts are automatically excluding 
concurrent checkout with respect to a workspace. But we want that 
the client can decide if it wants an exclusive or non-exclusive checkout.

regards
Matthias

   From: Sohn, Matthias [mailto:matthias.sohn@sap.com]

   My question was how to request the exclusive checkout through
   the protocol. We don't want to do exclusive checkouts implicitly
   on all checkouts but we want to allow the client to specify if
   the checkout is to be done exclusively or not in the sense
   described below.

With RFC-3253, the mechanism to allow you to constrain a checkout
in this fashion is an activity.  In particular, the
activity is used to specify the "line of descent" that you are
checking out against, and the system ensures that no more than
one checkout can occur on a given line of descent.

So if you are already exposing activities to your users,
automatically create a "workspace activity", and automatically
make every activity that a user wants to work on in the workspace
a subactivity of that workspace activity.  The
DAV:one-checkout-per-activity-per-history precondition will
ensure there is at most one checkout per VCR in your workspace.

If you are not exposing activities to your users,
you still automatically create a "workspace activity", and
set the DAV:current-activity property of the workspace to
be that activity.  This will ensure there is at most one
checkout per VCR in the workspace.

Cheers,
Geoff
