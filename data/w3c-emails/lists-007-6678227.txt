Vikram,
 
In protocol design, generally we attempt to avoid specific OOP or OOAD
models.  It's up to the server implementor to decide how to implement a
protocol, and they may not even be using an object-oriented programming
language.
 
Good luck resolving your conflicts!
 
Lisa

Subject: URGENT: Please Help ...... DeltaV and WebDAV Relationship



Hi ,

       We are implementing a server for DeltaV , there are conflicts
among couple of groups here about the design of the Server. 

One Group believes that since DeltaV is a versioning extension of WebDAV
the relationship in terms of OOAD is "is Kind Of" (Inheritance) , hence
the Implementation of DeltaV should extend from already implemented
WebDAV server.

While the other group believes that the DeltaV is a "Component" (not to
be taken literally) of WebDAV  i.e WebDAV can be made "versionable"
using DeltaV or by simply "activating" DeltaV Implementation Code ....
and hence DeltaV should be treated seperately.

I would like to know the relationship between DeltaV and WebDAV in terms
of OOP/OOAD.

I would be highly grateful , if anyone could get back to me with his/her
views as soon as possible.

Best Regards,         

Vikram
