I have a question regarding the Tamino WebDAV Server's
implementation of the PUT method.

It appears that when PUTing an XML document, Tamino stores it 
preserving the XML infoset but not the actual byte-for-byte 
layout of the document, so for example, PUTing:

  <hello></hello> 

will be retrieved using GET as:

  <hello/>

I've seen some discussion stating that the server must 
maintain octet-for-octet fidelity of the entity enclosed 
in the PUT request.

Is Tamino's implementation wrong or is my description of 
PUT too strict?  

Thanks.
