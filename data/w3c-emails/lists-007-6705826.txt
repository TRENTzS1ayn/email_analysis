Hi.

First of all, this isn't really about WebDAV or DeltaV -- it's a generic
HTTP question.

I'd say that yes, a server may use "lossy" ways to persist entities. After
all, all HTTP is giving you are methods that get/set certain
*representations* of resources.

Now of course this will fail if your client assumes that it can round-trip
octet-by-octet. In which case I'd recommend just to use a different server
(or backend within that server). It's a backend optimized for a specific use
case (storing XML infosets). If this doesn't fit into your requirements, use
something else.

  Subject: Tamino WebDAV Server's PUT implementation


  I have a question regarding the Tamino WebDAV Server's
  implementation of the PUT method.

  It appears that when PUTing an XML document, Tamino stores it
  preserving the XML infoset but not the actual byte-for-byte
  layout of the document, so for example, PUTing:

    <hello></hello>

  will be retrieved using GET as:

    <hello/>

  I've seen some discussion stating that the server must
  maintain octet-for-octet fidelity of the entity enclosed
  in the PUT request.

  Is Tamino's implementation wrong or is my description of
  PUT too strict?

  Thanks.
