Hello Jeffrey,

 

Tamino XML Server (as the back end store of Tamino WebDAV Server)
"optimizes" the XML representation. From an XML perspective both
representations are identical. From a binary perspective, they are obviously
different.

If you want to get back the original input document (also on a binary
level), Tamino WebDAV Server offers some configuration parameters, which
will allow doing so.

Please have a look at the community of Tamino WebDAV Sever for more details
(http://developer.softwareag.com/tamino/webdav/default.htm
<http://developer.softwareag.com/tamino/webdav/default.htm> , "http put
storage").

 

Best regards

 

Juergen Pill

Subject: Tamino WebDAV Server's PUT implementation

 

I have a question regarding the Tamino WebDAV Server's

implementation of the PUT method.

 

It appears that when PUTing an XML document, Tamino stores it 

preserving the XML infoset but not the actual byte-for-byte 

layout of the document, so for example, PUTing:

 

  <hello></hello> 

 

will be retrieved using GET as:

 

  <hello/>

 

I've seen some discussion stating that the server must 

maintain octet-for-octet fidelity of the entity enclosed 

in the PUT request.

 

Is Tamino's implementation wrong or is my description of 

PUT too strict?  

 

Thanks.
