Juergen, Julian,

Thanks for your responses.

I agree that this was perhaps more of an HTTP-specific question,
but my sense was that in the DAV world, the document fidelity 
of PUT would be even more important.

I actually prefer a looser, context-specific interpretation of
the PUT semantics as it allows PUT to be more data-centric as
opposed to purely document-centric.

It's never been clear to me where the strict, byte-for-byte 
entity preservation interpretation came from.  It seems folkloric.

- Jeff
