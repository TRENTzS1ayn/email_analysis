What about John's particular question ... should we modify 3253 in
the next revision to state that the "name" and "namespace" attributes
are in the DAV: namespace, and then modify the example in 3.8.1
to reflect this?  If there aren't many implementations yet of the
DAV:expand-property report, we could get this change publicized now,
to minimize interoperability issues in the future.

I could go either way on this, but just to get the voting started,
I'll vote, yes, we should make this change.

Cheers,
Geoff
