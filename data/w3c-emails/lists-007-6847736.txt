For heaven's sake, no!!!!! That would be an incompatible change.

We should clarify that the attributes are in no namespace.

There are. Speaking of which -- I think several server implementors claim to
support RFC3253 (basic versioning). I'd certainly hope that they all support
DAV:expand-property, as it's a required report.

No. Not only because it is a incompatible change (that breaks our server),
it's also a very unusual usage of namespaces in XML. For instance, check
XSLT: XSLT attributes are in no namespace, unless they appear on an element
which itself is not in the XSLT namespace.
