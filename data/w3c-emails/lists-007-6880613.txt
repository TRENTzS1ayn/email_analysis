No, only to CHECKIN one of its members.  One certainly could 
reasonably argue that the spec should have required this
(but currently, it doesn't).

No, only to CHECKIN the version-controlled collection from which
you deleted the member.  Although as above, one certainly could
reasonably argue that the spec should have required this.

No, there is no such requirement for UNCHECKOUT.  And here again,
once certainly could reasonably argue that the spec should have
required this (but currently it doesn't).

Cheers,
