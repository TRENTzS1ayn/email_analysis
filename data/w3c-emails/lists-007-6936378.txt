There is no concept of a "global" property of a version.
Each version is a separate resource, with its own properties.
So each version has its own DAV:displayname property.

But there is a natural place to put a "global" property of a
version, namely, as a property on the VersionHistory of that
version.

Cheers,
Geoff
