Sure, every version must have the displayname property so you can get it
with PROPFIND.  However, no specification requires that to be either
writable or protected on a version, so on some servers it won't be writable.
Also no specification requires it to be either static or dynamic, so it's
possible on some servers that the property would be protected, and it would
change whenever the value on the VCR changed.

I believe on Xythos WFS the displayname property is protected and static on
versions.  It will always have the same value as the displayname property of
the VCR.
