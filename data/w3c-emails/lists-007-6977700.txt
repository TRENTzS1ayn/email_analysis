May I ask what this is good for? If the DAV:displayname always equals the
last path component, it's much simpler not to have it at all. [WYes, I know
that IIS behaves the same -- however this doesn't make it right]

Which reminds me that having the DAV:displayname change with MOVE is deeply
incompatible with bindings. In particular, consider one resource A with
bindings a' and a''. How does the DAV:displayname obtained from a' change if
you rename a''? Don't tell me that the property value will vary depending on
the URL you use.
