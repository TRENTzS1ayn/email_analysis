Nope. DAV:displayname is an *optional* property:

"If present, the property contains a description of the resource that is
suitable for presentation to a user."

It's perfectly OK not to have it when it was never explicitly set.

Yes, but the specification still says "...contains a description of the
resource that is suitable for presentation to a user...". So no matter how a
server implements it's protected DAV:displayname property, it still must
suit this purpose. Just copying the last path component of the request URL
(that's what IIS does) doesn't satisfy this requirement.

Yes (unfortunately).
