The Tamino behavior is a bit surprising (i.e. one would expect that
the version would just have a copy of the DAV:creator-displayname
of the VCR at checkin time), but 3253 does give implementers a lot
of latitude wrt how they handle this property, so this doesn't
violate any MUST requirements.

Cheers,
Geoff
