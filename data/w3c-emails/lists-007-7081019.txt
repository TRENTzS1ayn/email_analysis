I think this is wrong, and as far as I remember, we already discussed this
question some time ago and came to a different conclusion.

In this particular case, the spec says:

"This property identifies each checked-out resource whose DAV:checked-out
property identifies this version."

That is, if there's only one checked-out resource and two bindings, there
should be only one href element, giving one of the bindings.

If a server would report all bindings, a non-binding-aware client might
conclude that there are in fact multiple checked-out resources which is not
the case.

Anyway: we clearly should work on a clarification of RFC3253 regarding
bindings.
