One could equally well make the argument that a binding-unaware
client would be even more surprised when it encounters a checked-out
resource whose URL does not appear in the DAV:checkout-set of
its DAV:checked-out version. 

I do not see anything in the current specification language that
requires a server to do it one way or the other, so until we 
get a compelling reason to do it one way or the other, I'd probably
leave the language as it is.

Cheers,
Geoff
