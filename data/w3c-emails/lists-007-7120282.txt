I think this is less likely, but of course I can't speak of all clients.

Anyway, the spec says that the property identifies *resources*, not URLs or
bindings. Finally, I think we should try to decide what to do and *not*
leave that up to the server. If we do that, reporting all bindings obviously
would be a bad choice because there's always the potential for bind loops
causing the set of URLs for that resource to be ... big.

I think the spec (revision) really needs to clarify a few things regarding
binding behaviour, and this is one of those things.
