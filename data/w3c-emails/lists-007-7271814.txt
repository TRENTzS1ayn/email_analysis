Hi,

I am learning the HTTP protocol and one of the things I noticed is that it 
is stateless.  When I was reading the 3253, it mentions that there are 
states.  So far I have identified these groupings on states:

checked in vs checked out

locked vs unlocked

Is there a state chart diagram anywhere that explains all of the states and 
transitions for this protocol?

--------
Additionally is RFC 3648's ORDERPATCH method generally supported by HTTP 
servers yet?


Thanks,

David Bearh
