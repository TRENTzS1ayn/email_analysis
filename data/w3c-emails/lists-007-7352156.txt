The 13.3.1 description of DAV:unreserved is more restrictive  than  
DAV:one-checkout-per-activity-per-history enforces. The description only 
allows for one checked-out resource for the activity, if that 
checked-out resource has DAV:unreserved false. The precondition however 
allows for multiple checked-out resources for the activity,  where at 
most one of these has a DAV:unreserved property of false. 

Given existing implementations of 3253 which may only enforce the 
precondition rather than the description, I would suggest that the 
description of DAV:unreserved is lined up with the precondition. That 
is, at most one reserved (DAV:unreserved false) checked out resource for 
an activity, but any number of unreserved (DAV:unreserved true) checked 
out resources for the same activity.
