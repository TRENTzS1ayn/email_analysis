I believe the point of a reserved checkout was to ensure that the
checkin would succeed.  But if we allow a reserved checkout to succeed
when there are currently unreserved checkouts against that activity,
if any of the unreserved checkouts are checked in, the subsequent
checkin of the reserved checkout will fail.

So doesn't that imply we should either:
- disallow a reserved checkout if there is already an unreserved checkout
or
- disallow the checkin of an unreserved checkout if there is a reserved 
checkout
?

Cheers,
Geoff
