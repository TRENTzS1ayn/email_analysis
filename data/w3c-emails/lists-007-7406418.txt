Agreed.

First I wonder why we think negative. I think it would be more natural
to make an editorial change to DAV:reserved and depreceate DAV:unreserved.
Also here DAV:unreserved is tied to the activity feature. I feel it already
makes sense without activities (Which for me implies that there is a single
implicit default activity).
