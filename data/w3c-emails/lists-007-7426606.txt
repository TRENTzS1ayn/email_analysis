Renaming a feature only introduces complexity, because for 
interoperability,
new clients and servers would have to support both the old and the new
names.  So I would suggest we not do that.  (The reason it was defined
in the negative is that the default behavior should be "reserved", since
making the checkout unreserved introduces the possibility that you will
not be able to checkin if another checkin for that version for that
activity is done before you.

If a server/client wants non-branching behavior, they would use the
DAV:checkout-fork and DAV:checkin-fork mechanisms, not DAV:unreserved.
DAV:unreserved is only needed to "reserve" a particular activity
(aka branch).

Cheers,
Geoff
