Keith,

I will be happy to review drafts for you that are related to
directory, policy, and schema of any type. If I can ever free up more
time, then perhaps I can review some others as well.

regards,
John

>At the last IETF meeting several people offered to offload some of
the
>ADs' workload by reviewing draft specifications.  I've recently
created
>some mailing lists for use by people who volunteer to review drafts
in
>the following categories:
>
>messaging[-request]@apps.ietf.org
> for people willing to review messaging-related draft specifications
> (including email, netnews, fax, voice mail, mobile messaging)
>
>web[-request]@apps.ietf.org
> for people willing to review web-related draft specifications
>
>directory[-request]@apps.ietf.org
> for people willing to review directory-related draft specifications
>
>Here's how I forsee these lists being used:
>
>When the Apps ADs need review of a draft specification in one of the
above
>categories, one of the ADs will post a message to the appropriate
list
>asking for volunteers to review that specification.  Those willing to
>review the spec should reply to the list.  The AD will then note who
has
>agreed to review the draft.  The reviews, when complete, can then be
>posted to the list (or if the reviewer prefers, sent directly to the
ADs)
>Some reviews might prompt other people to look at those documents,
>so with luck documents that deserve additional review will get it.
>
>Offhand, I don't think these lists should be used for random
discussion
>of these topics.  Many people are too busy to read high-volume lists.
>I hope that by keeping the lists narrowly focused on document
reviews,
>we can keep some of those busy (but valuable) people subscribed.
>
>General apps-area discussion should stay on discuss@apps.ietf.org.

>Thanks for your patience while I got this set up.
>I'm looking forward to having more reviewers.
