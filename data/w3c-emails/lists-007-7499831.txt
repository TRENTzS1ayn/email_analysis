It is clear to all who are responsible for staff members, that more than
6-8 staff members can't be coached anymore. Having more than 0 working
groups per Area director just does not work neither.

I fully agree with someone who stated, that we should not reorganise
(especially not without a clear idea where to go) but to do little steps.
This means you will have to cope with more than 20 groups in the near
future.

You have been chosen area directors for your experience, for your techncial
overview. Let's figure outhow you can psend time in this areas and not
in the administrative hassles. Can you identify tasks which you can
delegate?
o  let do the meeting schedule by someone else, define a form where WG
   chairs can apply for a slot, publish draft schedules on the Web
o  keep all APPS information on the Web up-to-date
o  chase WG chairs for updated charters and deliverables
o  get rid of the one chapter summary at the end of the IETF meeting
   (is this still needed, who reads it anyway?)

Offloading the I-D reading is a very good idea in the right direction.

Do we need an APPS area secretariat?

just thoughts I wnated to share.

Urs.
