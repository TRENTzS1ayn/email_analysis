Hi guys,
  One of the things that was discussed in the apps meeting was how to 
better handle some of the inter-group coordination. I'm currently
experiencing some of this with the NAPTR drafts since they depend
on what is going on with SRVs. What I think would help is, in 
addition to the paragraph summary, the chairs also provide their current
view of any external dependencies. In my case I would provide
a few short sentences showing the dependency of NAPTR on the SRV process.

Its a small change but it would make it easier to check on dependencies
so that bottlenecks are easily detected...

-MM
