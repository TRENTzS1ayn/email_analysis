My problem over the past year or so is that there are
only a few session I wish to attend, but I cannot know
for sure when they will be scheduled, so I cannot make
reasonable travel arrangements (a week in Orlando for
6 hours of meetings is hard to sell to management).  Now
I know there is a rationale here, and that one is encouraged
to participate broadly.  And I am hopeful that new activities
(my own and in the IETF) will give me many more reasons to
attend.  

But firmer scheduling would be a big win.
