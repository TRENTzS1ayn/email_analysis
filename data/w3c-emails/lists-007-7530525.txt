Working groups don't seem to decide at the last minute whether
or not they need a meeting, or what their conflict avoidance
criteria needs to be. This leads me to believe that we could
create the IETF schedule earlier without causing significant pain.

For example, it would be very useful so that the final WG
schedule was available more than 21 days in advance, in order
to get advanced purchase tickets. This would mean that the
apps area schedule should be set tentatively 30-35 days in
advance, so that the draft IETF schedule could be published
and conflicts reviewed.
