A few folks asked that I join this mailing list
to join the discussion on XML and MIME types.
They forwarded (some of?) the messages to me.

I asked for a pointer to a hypertext archive,
but no joy.

So... I dunno if I've seen all the stuff, but
here I am.

I have to say I was a little lost as to what
the issues were.

One interesting bit I picked up was an
XML namespace analagous to the set
of MIME multipart types. Sounds nifty.
Is that what folks were talking about?
