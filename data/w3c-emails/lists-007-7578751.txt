Sounds like a good idea to me.

The problem of integrating security services into applications is a very
important issue.  There are a number of us in the apps area who have
been through the pain and would be willing to help others on a relatively
low-volume list.  Pointing new apps WGs at such a list would be helpful.

That list has too narrow a focus.  TLS isn't the right solution for all
apps.
