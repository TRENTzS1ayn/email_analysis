The topic isn't "designing security protocols", rather it is "how do we make 
sense of and utilize the plethora of security protocols and mechanisms we have 
at our disposal?"

Discussing this under our umbrella is entirely appropriate IMHO. Tho, it'd be 
great if some of the security folks would join in.

Speaking of which, Eric Rescola & I need to discuss "server identity check" 
stuff and see ifn we can't normalize language between..

  draft-ietf-tls-https-01.txt

  draft-ietf-ldapext-ldapv3-tls-04.txt

..which I suppose we'll do on ietf-apps-tls, since there isn't a specific 
apps.ietf.org security list.
