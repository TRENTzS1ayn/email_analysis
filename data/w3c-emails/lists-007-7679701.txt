Things have to be as simple as possible but no simpler. The choice between
parameters vs. name spaces have been discussed for a long time and the
consensus is to go with name spaces. Both solutions have pros and cons -
none is significantly simpler than the other.

What I believe you are saying is that HTTP is sufficient as is without an
extension mechanism like the one proposed. I think the experience from the
multiple ways HTTP is actually being extended clearly indicates that this
is not the case.
