Doing so would be inconsistent with the stateless model for HTTP.

I believe the conclusion to draw from this discussion is that while
header field prefixes do add complexity, and that such complexity
was found unnecessary in other protocols, it's needed here.

I don't know whether this design rationale belongs in the document
before it's published as an RFC. Probably a brief paragraph to that
effect would be useful, if only to point out that this isn't an
example that is necessarily to be followed for other protocols.
