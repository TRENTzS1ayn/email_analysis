Clarify by changing to:

I could see the IFX group proposing extensions or revisions to IPP,
actually -- for example a mechanism to indicate This Is a Fax and should
contain timestamps.  I wouldn't want such extensions to be out of scope.

Conneg?

On the Internet, "Quality of Service" has distinct meaning -- be careful
here.  QoS usually means bounded delay of packet delivery -- much
different from what you mean (which is likely bounded delay of the
physical output).

Perhaps something like: "The WG will attempt to provide mechanisms to
allow interoperable implementations to be created which closely emulate
the existing end-user- expected functionality of fax." but shorter-winded.
