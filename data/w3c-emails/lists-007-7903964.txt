If my understanding of HTTP is correct (and, for the purposes of this
distinction, not including TCN), each of the dimensions of variability
(indicated by Accept:, Accept-charset:, Accept-language:) is presumed to
independently variable.  Thus, it makes sense to permit q-values to be
determined independently for each such dimension.

The 'conneg' framework greatly increases the number of dimensions of
variability (through feature registration), and also provides a general
framework for constraining variations in one dimension with respect to
variations in some other dimension(s).  Thus it seems more helpful to apply
the q-value unidimensionally to a combination of variable features, rather
than independently to each dimension of variability.  TCN [RFC2295] adopts
a similar approach when describing the source quality of a resource, and
avoids allowing a client to indicate quality values associated with feature
tags.

The 'conneg' framework does not preclude further development of some more
fine grained q-value indication, but has not attempted to specify such at
this time.
