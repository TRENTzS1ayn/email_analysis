This is more or less what HTTP has done. It prooved to be detrimental,
because ISO Latin 1 was used as a default (without explicit "charset"
paramenter) and in various parts of the world, there was a rather low
incentive to actually implement handling the "charset" parameter, or
adding one where it was needed. As a result, most HTTP trafic, whether
in ISO Latin 1 or not, is not correctly tagged.
