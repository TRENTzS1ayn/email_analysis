     My first motivation for asking was because P3P
(http://www.w3.org/P3P/) is making use of the HTTP extensions framework -
P3P messages may be added to responses as optional extensions (using Opt:),
and I wanted to see if the extensions framework was going forward to be
standardized any time soon.

     My other question is what other protocols/applications have been
interested in using the HTTP extensions framework? I have been considering
what it'd take to add P3P support to Apache, and this led me down to the
idea of implementing the HTTP extensions framework as an Apache module, but
there's little point if there aren't any users expected any time soon.

     Thanks,

     Martin
