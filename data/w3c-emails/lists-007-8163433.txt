The most important thing is to get an RFC number attached to it because
people think that the current draft has expired.

It is also important to note that there are no public outstanding
technical issues with the current spec nor have there to my knowledge been
since March where it was sent to last call for proposed. I hope that this
will be made clear in the status note of the document.

The term "community support" is inherently hard to define - especially as
there was no working group chartered. I agree with Scott that there may be
dependency problems with standard track specs using it but as I understand
the process, it is possible to change the status from experimental to
proposed without chartering a wg. Keith, can you please confirm this?
