Much as I'd like for such an approach to be workable, I am in complete
agreement with Patrik about this. Indeed, we already have quite a bit of
difficulty with cross-area coordination, and I anticipate that this will be
even harder to do in the future. A separate meeting would drastically reduce
our ability for multiple area review, and that would be a very bad thing.

Exactly. What we need to do is to work really, really hard on getting all the
nearly done work DONE. And I'm not talking about the ADs here, I'm talking
about everyone else who hasn't completed a revision of a draft, who hasn't
sent in those comments, or whatever.
