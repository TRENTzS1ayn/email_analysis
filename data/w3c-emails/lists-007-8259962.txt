Nope.
The difference is between affecting the infrastructure and affecting only 
itself - the bar for routing protocols is SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the bar 
for almost anything else, but there should be no higher bar for Service 
Location or IP-over-vertical-blanking-interval than there should be for 
IMPP or IPP.

That's the same process as in all other IETF groups - see PPP, MLPS, 
DiffServ. Often they don't wait for WG Last Call before shipping sillicon 
either.
And sometimes the predictable disasters result.

We've got one. It's called EXPERIMENTAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

That would mean starting to ship Proposed Standard RFCs that a significant 
portion of a WG objects to. Do you really think that's good?

Feel free to start one. The IETF process rules have a very flexible 
licensing scheme. The W3C, the DMTF, the WAP forum and a dozen others are 
already trying, too.
And, as we saw with HTML, separating those concerns from those things that 
concern the network deeply can in fact improve the attention it's possible 
to give to those things, to all our benefit.

The unique things about the IETF as a protocol forum are:

- It works (however badly)
- It has a certain reputation
- It has contact with a large number of networking experts

If all the things that didn't need all these criteria were done elsewhere, 
the IETF workload would be smaller.
