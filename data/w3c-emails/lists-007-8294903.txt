My suggestion is that APPS have their meeting one week and
all other IETF groups the next week. People can then stay
for two weeks if they want to cover both areas, which I
expect IESG members will do, but the load on the single
weeks will be less.

Some topics which are of special interest to both APPS 
and other areas could be scheduled for the weekend
between APPS and the rest, or the Friday the first
week or the Monday the next week.

This proposal might actually increase cross-fertilization,
because with the present scheme, very few people have time
to go to working groups within both APPS and the other
areas!
