if you allow a document of quality 'A' to reference a document of
quality  'B', (where A is higher quality than B) you dilute the
quality of A documents to be no better than B.  because people
will just develop documents of quality B and incorporate those
by refernece into another document and claim that the second document
is of quality A. (and yes, people try to do this from time to time)

so if you want to publish documents as Experimental, you need to
content yourself with the notion that any document that makes
a normative reference to those documents can have no higher 
quality rating.

perhaps.  but I can't see how IETF should make any statement
about future direction of a protocol (i.e. its liklihood
of being on the standards track in the future) without extended
community review of that protocol - precisely because of the
tendency for groups to work at cross purposes.  

actually, it seems like Proposed Standard is really very close to
your notion of "short term standard" - in that it is likely to
advance on the standard track and eventually proceed to full standard.

and this is precisely because Experimental documents either
a) don't have widespread community support  
b) are considered to have a high potential for being operational
disruptive.
c) have known technical problems

again, if you want some sort of statement that "things will probably
go this way" then you need at least tacit support from a lot larger
community than a single working group, and you need independent
review to overcome the tendency of editors and working groups 
(and human beings in general) to miss flaws after they've been 
working on something too long.  and that's basically what you
get with Proposed Standard.

I've wondered about this - maybe groups should have to publish
as Experimental, and implement the protocol, before going to
Proposed.  It might get people focused on "running code" sooner
rather than later, and some groups need that.  I'd like to see 
a few groups try it before recommending it for everyone in APPS.

occasionally we do make two standards in a given area, call 
them both Proposed, and let the market decide.  but usually 
the conflict isn't between two different ways to do X
(working groups are fairly good at sorting those out),
the conflict is where protocol X intereferes with your ability
to use protocol Y, or vice versa.   and some of the market 
decides to use X and some of the market decides to use Y, with
the result that the ability to deploy both X and Y are diminished
even though X and Y don't directly compete with one another.
for example, NAT boxes interfere with the ability to deploy
many different kinds of protocols, but people don't realize
that when they are choosing a NAT box they are implicitly
choosing not to run those other protocols.

agreed.  but IETF sanction is often a good indicator of the 
usefulness and deployability of a protocol.
