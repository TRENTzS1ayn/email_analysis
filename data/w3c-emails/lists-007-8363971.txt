I don't think you'll ever get a significant number of people or
companies to commit two weeks at a time, 3 times a year, to being away
from work and their families. The end result will be less cross over and
cross pollination than currently happens. It will be almost impossible
to get people who focus mostly on SEC, ROUTING, TRANSPORT or OPS to pop
in to help out in their specific areas of expertise, or to be available
for consultation. Similarly, it will be impossible to get significant
numbers of APPS folks to participate in such areas as XMLSIG, S/MIME,
PKIX, OPENPGP and STIME (to pick a few). In all, I think such a breakup
would cause a significant decrease in expertise levels across the board.
And that would NOT be a good idea.
