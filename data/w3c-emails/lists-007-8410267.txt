My proposal is not to have more app ADs - it is to have a body next to
the ADs that frees them from making architectural decisions and focus on
process. The diversity of the Apps area makes it hard to have an
end2end-interest equivalent and I think such a group has to be chartered
to review documents and to call out dependencies between groups. The
group has to contain app people with a broad knowledge of the app area
and with commitment to actually produce output.

I used the word "directorate" as I believe such groups have existed in
the past in other areas and that this was the term used.
