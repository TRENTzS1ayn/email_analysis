I have specifically suggested adding a 3rd Apps AD to NONCOM. I do not 
think this will solve all of the problems but it could certainly help.

I also suggested a specific TELEPHONY area. With all of the related work 
that is going on it seems reasonable to seperate it out to permit TEL AD's 
a more focused approach to some of the looming and unresolved architectural 
issues.

I also totally reject the idea that APPS should meet separately from other 
IETF WG's.
