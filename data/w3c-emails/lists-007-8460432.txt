    No deliverables = no accountability = nothing happens.

It has to be chartered as a group with deliverables. Reviews of
documents are deliverables and so one possibility is to charter a group
to review drafts from related working groups and individuals; write up
concerns and comments and ensure that coordination happens and feedback
provided to the IESG.
