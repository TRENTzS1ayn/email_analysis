we've occasionally chartered 'review groups' in the past, for instance
we did (a very short-lived) one a few years ago for email extensions.  
at that time, iirc, we had a lot of requests for email extensions appear
in a short time.  and those extensions were relatively small and 
self-contained and easy to think about.  

http architectural issues seem thornier and more difficult to sort out.  
chartering a group to consider http extension mechanisms seems wrong -
seems like the first question is whether http should be extended 
(in scope) at all.
