In practice, last call comments are delivered to any of:

IESG, the ADs, the WG mailing list, the IETF list, the document authors

one of the real difficulties of the present system is tracking 
all of them down.

Also it seems useful to allow privately-submitted Last Call comments,
though one hopes that most comments are public.
