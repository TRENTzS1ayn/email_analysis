One main purpose of the HTTP extensions spec is not to
(mis)use HTTP for completely new things, but to allow
additions/extensions to HTTP proper. A very good example
is P3P (http://www.w3.org/TR/P3P), where the extension spec
is used to indicate which privacy policies the pages exchanged
by HTTP work under (http://www.w3.org/TR/P3P#HTTP_Extensions).

Making things extensible, and reducing the amount of
work needed for each extension at a central point such
as the IETF Apps Area directors, looks like a very
worthwile goal.

Regards,   Martin.
