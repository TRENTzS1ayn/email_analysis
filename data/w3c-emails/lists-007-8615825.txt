Just an observation. I think the main reason why HTTP is still
chosen in this case is the following:

If you design your own protocol, then the default/initial firewall
behaviour is to shut it out. If you piggiback on top of HTTP, then
the default/initial behaviour is to pass things through.

There is probably a better chance to get people to use a protocol,
and to get security people understand a protocol, and set the
right restrictions, if at the start you can just use it.
