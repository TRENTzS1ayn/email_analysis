Management/coordination without accountability is useless. However, there
is no reason why the accountability should be any different than for any
other working group so we should just use that mechanism already in place.
However, that coordination and review has to be there.

That's interesting but unfortunately wrong. Larry - you didn't do your
homework:

This is what you have the mandatory mechanism for. Think of M- as a macro
facility.

> new URL scheme(s)

This has hardly anything to do with HTTP extensions and is already handled
by HTTP.

> new header

This is what you have the optional mechanism for.

> new value for old header

This is a bad idea in any case

> new MIME type for POST body

There already is a registry for this so why come up with another one?

> new return code

This is what you have 510 status code is for. Think of 510 as a macro
facility.

> new interpretation for old return code

Your example is solved using the optional mechanism (bad description of
problem)

Come on, Larry - don't be silly. Stick to constructive arguments.
