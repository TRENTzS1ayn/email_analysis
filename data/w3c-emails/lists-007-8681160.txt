IMHO:

Documents have two versions of status: One that the "great unwashed" reads 
into it, and one that careful people read into it.

The first one is a lost cause.

The second one can be influenced by such things as introductory paragraphs.
If you have an intro that says "This technology is intended by the authors 
to go on IETF standards track, but it is of such world-shaking importance 
that the community felt it best to get a little deployment experience 
before gaining consensus that this is the Way To Go and do standards 
track", some careful people might read it, and some might even believe it.

If there are a few dozen experimentals like that, and the next step HAPPENS 
to some of them, the "experimental stigma" (if it exists) is likely to fade 
over time.
