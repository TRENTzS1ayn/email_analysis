You have to differ between normative and non-normative references. It is
only normative references which can not be made in whatever way you want.

In most cases the difference between a normative and non-normative is just
a matter of wording. So, if you just is careful you can have your document
going to proposed with (non-normative) references to documents which are
experimental.
