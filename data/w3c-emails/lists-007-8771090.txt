our obligation is to follow the process rules.

and (not specifically referring to this proposal)
just because we don't have a good idea about how to do so something
doesn't mean that we need to bless a bad idea for how to do it.
sometimes we need to say "we don't think this is good enough yet,
but here's the best thing we have come up with".  but if it doesn't
meet the criteria for standards-track, it can't get published
as standards-track.

> "proposed" means proposed.

"proposed" means what it says in RFC 2026.
