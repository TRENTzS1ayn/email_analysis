Has any thought been given to the creation of an IRC or other realtime chat
working group?

As an ircd developer, client hacker, and frustrated user, the lack of
standards is becoming a greater problem. The only standard to turn to is a
very outdated RFC, which doesn't cover much of the ambiguity that's causing
problems now.

Any thoughts before I persue this further?
