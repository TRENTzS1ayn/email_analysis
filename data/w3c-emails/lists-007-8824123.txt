The only activity I've seen in this space recently is Christoph Kalt's 
attempt to document the existing protocol before going any further - see 
draft-kalt-irc-* for the details. Helping him get it out the door would be 
a Good Thing - last updates were in October, according to my timestamps.

IRC seems to be among the areas with a large number of people who want to 
see something done, but a very low ability to get agreement on what that 
"something" is. I hope this will change.....
