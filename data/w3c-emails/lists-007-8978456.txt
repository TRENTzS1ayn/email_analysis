Interestingly enough, this I-D was just published. It looks like it
would be relevant to this discussion.

                          Extensible Protocol

Abstract

   This memo defines the Extensible Protocol (XP).  XP is a generic
   application-level protocol meant to serve as the foundation for
   specific protocols, in a manner analogous to the way in which the
   Extensible Markup Language (XML) recommendation of the World Wide Web
   Consortium serves as the foundation for specific markup languages. XP
   is a bidirectional protocol on which XML documents are exchanged
   between two endpoints.
