I think ONC RPC is pretty "thin" as RPC protocols go.  Is it really
loaded with unnecessary baggage that disqualifies it as a candidate
for core protocol ?

It's been around for about 15 years, it's on IETF standards track,
and hundreds of protocols have used it as a "core" protocol.

What are the constraints that prevent ONCRPC from being the
"core" protocol ?  Can those constraints be removed by extending
it to version 3 ?  This discussion seems highly relevant to the
ONCRPC mailing list: oncrpc-wg-request@sunroof.eng.sun.com.
