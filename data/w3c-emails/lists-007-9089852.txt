I wonder exactly what "should be coordinated with the HTTP-NG team and ONCRPC WG" means.  Does it mean that harmony with the HTTP-NG and/or ONCRPC protocols is a requirement?  Does it mean that harmony with the HTTP-NG and/or ONCRPC protocols counts for something when making design choices?

Thanks,
Mike
