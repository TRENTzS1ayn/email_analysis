It looks to me like the goals of APPLCORE are just about exactly a subset of the goals of HTTP-NG (and to make them truly a subset involves some minor quibbles I think we can cover with a little discussion).  What that tells me is that APPLCORE's solution should be part of HTTP-NG's solution.  I'm trying to find out how strongly others feel about making this relationship hold.
