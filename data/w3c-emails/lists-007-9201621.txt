I'm concerned about the idea of the IETF designing a protocol which
completely punts on security issues.  If this is a protocol with a port
number, then it needs to explain how security is activated for that port.
If it's just a layer, then it needs to explain how it's integrated into
lower-level security services or explain the consequences of security
attacks if a higher-level security service is used.  Security tends to
pervade all layers of all stacks in a truly secure system, so I'm dubious
it can be punted as this charter proposes.

I'm also uncomfortable with the idea of replicating all the flow-control
machinery of TCP in a layer above it.  The consequences of doing so should
be documented and justified.
