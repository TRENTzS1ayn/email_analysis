Excuse me for being blunt but that approach (true subset of HTTPng)
could imply that HTTPng is the basis for all future applications
protocols.

I doubt that the IETF is ready to make that step. Rather, we should 
say that HTTPng is one user of whatever APPLCORE becomes.

What that tells me is that APPLCORE's solution should be part of HTTP-NG's solution.  I'm trying to find out how strongly others feel about making this relationship hold.
