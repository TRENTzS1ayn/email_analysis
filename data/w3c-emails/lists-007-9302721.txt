It seems to me that the implication goes the other way (assuming we're willing to assemble a given application's protocol stack from various protocols that solve subsets of the application's problems): the smaller the set of protocol problems you address, the larger the set of applications whose problem set includes the set you address.  Put another way: if HTTP-NG is layered over APPLCORE, then APPLCORE is used for everything HTTP-NG is and potentially also things that HTTP-NG is not used for.
