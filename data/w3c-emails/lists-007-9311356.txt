I second Brian's comments on HTTPng...

I don't want to be in a situation where HTTPng is believed to be the "one 
size that fits all", even if HTTPng works out (and its not soup yet), 
and would want it free to optimize to web operations, which have a different 
set of constraints than many other applications protocols: e.g. low latency, 
since a user is driving it is important for interactive feel, which is 
NOT a requirement on, say, mail.  It is those kinds of requirements (along 
with the "brittleness" of current systems like CORBA), that have made 
me believe something other than CORBA or Java RMI is needed for the web.

It is also not clear to me that HTTPng requirements should bind APPLCORE
hands, as the requirements may be found to be disjoint.

While the web is a common application protocol, it should not,
in my opinion, be the only one.
