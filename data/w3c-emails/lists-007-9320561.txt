My point is only that the word "subset" is open to the wrong
interpretation; if we just speak of layering there is no
possible misinterpretation.

Put another way: if HTTP-NG is layered over APPLCORE, then APPLCORE is used for everything HTTP-NG is and potentially also things that HTTP-NG is not used for.
