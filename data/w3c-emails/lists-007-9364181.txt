What's the vision of where APPLCORE would be used?  (In a world that already has HTTP, being used and abused for many and increasingly many things, plus CORBA, Java RMI, and DCOM --- what's left?)

What will be the requirements for efficiency?  Will we be hearing arguments like: because we know there's a large textual payload, the headers and data parts don't have to be particularly compact?  Or: this is not going to be used in demanding environments (e.g., not more than a single or a few request/response interactions have to happen in a single user-ineraction amount of time) so it doesn't have to be fast?
