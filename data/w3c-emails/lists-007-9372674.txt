Here's an example: in house we've built a few text based protocols
between different vendor supplied services (credit card transactions is
one example). It would help me if I could circulate this document around
the company as a standard starting place for simple protocols.

At least in my mind these are light weight, low to medium demand, very
narrowly defined protocols that never used 95% of the features and overhead
of HTTP much less CORBA, RMI or DCOM...
