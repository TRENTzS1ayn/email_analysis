I'm surprised to hear you use word like "light weight, low to medium demand" together with "credit card transactions".  Maybe that's because it's not clear to me where your protocols fit into the whole financial system; the slots that are obvious to me have fairly high requirements for performance and security.

It seems to me that most big complicated things started out as small simple things that succeeded and grew; how much do you want to plan for further development of your protocols?
