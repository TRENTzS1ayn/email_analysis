The slot for this particular example is between a server that frontends
communication to the clearinghouse provider and our billing backend. 
It's secure but it only has 3 transaction types (verify, charge and refund).
Since each transaction is small and atomic the load is no where near what 
something like our web servers put up with.

For this one? None. Unless some huge paradigm shift happens in credit 
card processing I can't think of any changes we would ever make.
