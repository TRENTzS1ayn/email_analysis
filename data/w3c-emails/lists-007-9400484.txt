I'd say it would be an option for new protocols not related to HTML
document retrieval/updating/versioning, email transfer, user directory
access, or other new services that are not an explicitly documented
purpose of an IETF standards track protocol.

My thought was to target it for people who care about simplicity and
engineering rather than those who like to build things akin to the OSI
protocol stack.

> What will be the requirements for efficiency?  Will we be hearing arguments like: because we know there's a large textual payload, the headers and data parts don't have to be particularly compact?  Or: this is not going to be used in demanding environments (e.g., not more than a single or a few request/response interactions have to happen in a single user-ineraction amount of time) so it doesn't have to be fast?

What does this have to do with the proposed charter?  Are you suggesting
the charter needs explicit efficiency constraints?  I can't predict what
people who attend the BOF/WG will find to be important constraints.  If in
doubt, the WG should go with what has been successful in past IETF
protocols, IMHO.
