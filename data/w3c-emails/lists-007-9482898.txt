As for the first: how do higher layers ever "know" about authentication done in lower layers?  This is an issue of software in the peers, not the protocol, right?  What goes on the wire makes it clear (assuming the protocols above and below MEMUX were prepared to be separated at all --- which they would of course be if they're separate protocols); the issue is that an API for using MEMUX must enable authentication to pass through the MEMUX software layer appropriately.  As this WG is not about designing the API, I figure that issue is out of scope.

I think the other two issues are clearly in scope.
