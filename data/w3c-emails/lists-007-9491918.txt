Huh?  The draft is written very aggressively in terms of a general statement about the services expected from the underlying layer, rather than identifying TCP as *the* underlying layer.  I think that set of services is a "general flavour", and is delivered by T/TCP.

I hadn't expected the protocol to carry any addresses, so I hadn't expected these kinds of issues to come up at all.  Wouldn't you agree that it goes without saying that wherever addresses *do* appear in current IETF work, the demands of the currently underway evolutionary steps of the Internet must be taken into account?
