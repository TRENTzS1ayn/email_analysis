Just a minor nit, your observation is probably correct when you are
actually writing an implementation of the protocol from scratch. I think
when most of us speak about 'debugging' a server by simply telnetting
to the port is after its been built and we are debugging particular
applications that are using that protocol. Or also in the case where
we do not have debugging access to the server or client (proprietary 
binaries).

Also, from a past sysadmin's point of view, you're never gauranteed to
have the libraries needed to parse a binary protocol on any given client.
Telnet is everywhere....

Sorry, hard to resist when your particular religion gets tweaked... ;-)
