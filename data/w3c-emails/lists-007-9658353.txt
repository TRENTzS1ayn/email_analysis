I think it might be somewhat valuable to wrap a draft boilerplate around
that last paragraph and send it out as an informational RFC. IMHO, as
soon as complex data types and marshalling come into play, the low cost 
aspects of a text based protocol go out the window. But that's just the 
test that I personally use.

Exactly....
