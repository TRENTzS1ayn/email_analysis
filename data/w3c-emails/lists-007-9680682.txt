definitely an insightful statement.

However, has IMAP or POP had the same problems because its text?
Or, is it just HTTP's loose syntax of optional and ignored stuff

I havent noticed the same terrible cries in the IMAP/POP world,
but then again, maybe I dont spend enough time in that world
to notice.  Chris ?
