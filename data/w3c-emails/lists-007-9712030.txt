Sigh.  I have identified some.  See my discussion of sections 5.1 (last
point made) and the last remark about section 9 in my original last call
comments to the IESG.

This is all fixable, I believe some of the edits you proposed afterwards
fixed at least some of the section 9 stuff.  You already fixed the
second-to-last 5.1 point for me by pointing out how to get around it.  I
see a definite possibility of converging on this, don't worry. 

Then there is the 'Sec 5 para after enumerated list' thing about tunneling
for unknown methods.  You should really cross-check this with Jeff if you
don't trust my claim that this is not in http/1.1.  I have been known to
be wrong but I don't think I am wrong about this one.  Alternatively,
point me to the appropriate line in the 1.1 spec.

I am much more worried about us converging on my issues re. sec 5 point 3
and sec 5 point 4, and these have little to do with caching.
