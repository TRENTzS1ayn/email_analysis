A nice idea. Is it common in standards?

Binary data in textual encodings seems to be a problem. How
is this usually handled? Base64 is of course an option.
MIME uses, if I understand it rightly, the convention that
<CRLF>--boundary text<CRLF> is end marker of a binary body
part. Not very neat.

I have looked at the XML specs, and not found any good way
of putting binary data into XML either. Have I missed
something?

To indicate the end of binary data with an octet-length
value before the binary data seems to me the neatest way,
but it seems not to be very popular in standards.
