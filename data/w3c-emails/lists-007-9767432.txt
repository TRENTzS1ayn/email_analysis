XML is a text format. As such, it can be transcoded by mail gateways.
If you label something as
    Content-Type: text/xml; charset=us-ascii
and it gets transcoded to EBCDIC, the binary data won't survive.

The web can easily include binary data, it's done all the time
with images, just use a link instead of putting things inline :-).
