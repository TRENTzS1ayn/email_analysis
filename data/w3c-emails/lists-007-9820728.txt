Unless they changed the rule the other day, this is not a requirement.

That's probably what nailed you. "This standard" is inappropriate for a 
draft. "This document" or "this specification" is much better, since you 
don't know what status the draft will get (if any).

Personally, I would say that those are also inappropriate. A draft is a draft.

I also do not think they are sticky on this, but they may have changed the 
rules in the past two weeks.
