To: IETF Applications Area general discussion list<discuss@apps.ietf.org>

I have written an IETF draft on good mailing list
behaviour. It has long been a need to have such a document.
One particular area, where this is needed, is in the design
of groupware forum systems. Such systems often have a mail
gateway, which cause a forum in such a system to appear, as
seen from e-mail, as a mailing list. But the developers of
groupware forum systems often do not have so much
experience in proper mailing list behaviour, which causes
various kinds of problems when their systems become
connected to the Internet mail transport system.

The document is available at
  ftp://ftp.dsv.su.se/users/jpalme/draft-palme-maillist-00.txt

I suggest that future discussion about this document is
done in the ietf-822@imc.org mailing list.
