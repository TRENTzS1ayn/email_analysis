  (Sorry for bothering everyone, but the ietf-applcore list still isn't
active for some reason.  And the discussion's been happening here
anyway...) 

  I've submitted draft-earhart-acp-spec-00.txt to the internet-drafts
directories; it should (hopefully) show up before the IETF.  It's also
accessible via the web, at
<URL:http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~rob/draft-earhart-acp-spec-00.txt>
and
<URL:http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~rob/draft-earhart-acp-spec-00.ps>
(the ps version may or may not look nicer when printed out). 

  I'm not trying to come down from the mountain and say, "This is what the
application core protocol should look like"; I just wanted to throw
something out there so that we'd have something to talk about (assuming
that we get a BOF at the next IETF).  It *is* pretty close to what I think
we want, and at seventeen pages it fits nicely within the proposed length
requirements, but I'm open to suggestions (including suggestions to throw
it out entirely and go with something else. :-) 

  )Rob
