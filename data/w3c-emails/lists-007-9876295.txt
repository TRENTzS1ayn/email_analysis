I think that people have to face the fact that the
IETF is now going to become a "trailing edge"
organization, not "leading edge". As with most
standards organizations, it can play a role in
documenting standards long AFTER they find
industry acceptance. In the old days, the IETF
could lead. In order to do that, they had to remain
at the leading edge. In my opinion, that is clearly
no longer the case....
