Maybe I will get this in before the APPS ADs...

The usual exercise of changing the schedule to avoid the
worst clashes is going on in real time. Last I heard, the
tentative slot for Applcore was on Monday but *this may still

BTW assuming there is a BOF it will for sure not be discussing
specific solutions at this stage.
