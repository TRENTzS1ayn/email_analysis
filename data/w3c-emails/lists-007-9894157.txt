at least for the apps area, all scheduling was still on hold until
last Monday.  (we had groups pencilled in for slots but we wanted 
to wait until the request deadline before announcing anything, 
because we knew that changes were likely)  even so we have had a 
couple of late requests and the agenda folks are still juggling 
things around to try to meet all of the constraints.  but I've seen 
a couple of BOF announcements go out this morning, so they'll probably 
update the schedule soon.
