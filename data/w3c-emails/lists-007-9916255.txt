Do you feel that it is "bad" that the IETF is now
a trailing-edge standards organization, just like
the ITU, IEEE, and ANSI ?

I suspect that some would find it attractive to be
similar to those organizations. Clearly, many of the
IETF members do. Those members collectively
define whether the IETF is leading-edge or trailing-edge.
