overall this is a good requirements summary.

But I find no justification whatsoever for insisting that the reliable
message delivery system be layered on top of HTTP.  One could easily
conclude that expectation that HTTP should be used as a substrate for
applications requiring reliable message delivery is a large part of 
the problem.
