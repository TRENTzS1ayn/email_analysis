First of all, the draft seems clearly about client/server communications, 
and thus using the term "messages" might be the origin of a dangerous 
confusion. Instead of "messages" it would be better to talk about 
"client/server information exchange". A "message" is very ofter related 
to "global messaging services", which is defintly something different.

Then, IMHO, the idea in general seems to me "yet another misuse of HTTP". 
I tend to be worried when I see the approach of using HTTP to do 
anything, and WEB browsers as a good for all application interfaces. HTTP 
il Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (with a number of syncronization and 
reiability problems we all know), and it is not the general all purpouse 
transport protocol. It is perfectly true, Keith and Mark: it is an 
application protocol. 

Tha overall analysis of the requirements is fine, but conveying the idea 
that HTTP is the solution make me strongly disagree. Internet 
applications should NOT be tied to HTTP, and should eventually use their 
own transport / application protocol, carefully desinged to fulfil the 
application needs. Playing any possible method to force an application 
and its protocol into HTTP and a WEB browser is something we should 
simply avoid as much as possible....

just my two cents...
