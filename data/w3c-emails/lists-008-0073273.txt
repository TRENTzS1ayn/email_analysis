(a) I think it is a good thing to have a URI scheme defined for all
protocols we have in the IETF
(b) A specification of a URI scheme need to explain when it is to, and more
importantly, when it is not to be used

Correct me if I am wrong John, but the conclusion I see of this discussion
is that the document is describing the general URI, but, doesn't describe
enough in the Security Consideration Section why this is a bad thing to use
the wrong way.
