I still see two different problems here:

(1) Someone should ASAP write an RFC which explains why using TFTP is a
really bad thing.

(2) We should define a URI scheme for protocols we define in the IETF.

I am, regardless of John's note, strongly in favour of having a URI scheme
definition for all protocols we have (and more). The URI scheme definition
explicitly MUST specify in what environments it can be used. In the example
of TFTP, it should say that having the ability for a user to "click" on
such a URI is "a really bad thing", and further, reference (1) which states
that tftp should _NOT_ be used.
