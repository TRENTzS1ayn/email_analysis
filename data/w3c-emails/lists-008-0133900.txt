I don't see it as standardizing a practice but just allocating an
identifier for an already standard protocol. Like it or not, people
want to be able to express everything that they reasonably (or
sometimes unreasonably) can as a URI. If an identifier is not
officially allocated, some proprietary identifier or incompatible set
of identifiers or bizarre non-URI syntax will be used when someone
wants to refer to TFTP in not just a configuration file but any sort
of meta-discourse.
