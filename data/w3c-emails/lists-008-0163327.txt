... well, in this spirit we should also take care of adding reliability or
other nice features to a number of existing (and in my opinion deprecable) 
de-facto services, applications, etc,... just because they're used by 
most of the (unfortunately) illetarate majority of users of the network 
adopting well know operating systems and "solutions"

(no, I did not mentioned their names...! lawyers could be around...)

:-)

I - still - prefer the idea to build reliable and efficient services and 
protocols, which maybe will replace the broken or simply inadequate ones at 
some time in the future... 

My two cents of engineering idealism...

Claudio
