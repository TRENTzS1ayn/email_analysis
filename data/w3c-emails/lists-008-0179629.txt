There's also the issue that a TFTP RRQ request, unlike FTP RETR or HTTP
GET, isn't guaranteed to be safe.  This means that a TFTP URI scheme
isn't only an identifier, it's a potential means of triggering state
changes on the server.

IMO, all URIs should be able to be resolved safely, and therefore TFTP
shouldn't get its own scheme.
