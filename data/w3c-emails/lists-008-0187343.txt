I don't disagree that reliability is important, but assuming that HTTP
is a transport protocol is a very easy way to do the wrong thing with
it.  HTTP defines an application model, which much more narrowly
constrains how reliability fits in than is the case with a transport
protocol.  Both HTTPR and the requirements draft do not respect this
model.
