You've lost me.

Resolving "mailto:foo@bar.org" is safe per RFC 2368.  What more do you
need to know?

The resolution of some URI aren't safe.  I saw an "aim:" URI scheme
recently that allowed resolution of a URI to send an AIM message.  That
is a Bad Thing.

Eh?  Identifers are publicly transmitted information, and their
resolution should be safe, otherwise their value as identifers is moot.
Nobody would dare resolve anything if they couldn't be assured of this.

Or to use your words, I'd suggest that all URI have this "special
certification".
