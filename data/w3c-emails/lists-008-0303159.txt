I don't think it's inherently bad, any more than
mailto:discuss-request@apps.ietf.org?Subject=subscribe
is bad.  What's bad is for client implementors to make it possible 
for "clicking" on such a URI (or having it appear in a script or
image tag on a web page) to result in a message being sent 
without explicit user verification.
