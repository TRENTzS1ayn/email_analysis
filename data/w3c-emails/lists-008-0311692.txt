this water passed under the bridge long ago.  even HTTP isn't resolvable 
without consequence.   HTTP URLs are routinely used to leak private 
information about users to third parties - either using cookies,
or using information embedded in the URL.

that and since *most* URI prefixes are unregistered, using the 
registration process to discourage inappropriate URI use clearly won't work.

I agree with Patrik - the most effective strategy we know is to insist
that the definition of a URI prefix also describe its security considerations.
