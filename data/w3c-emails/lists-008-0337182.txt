which sort of illustrates the point.  the best way to make a URI
"safe" is to document how it should be used by clients.

(but since almost any kind of URI (including "http") can be "unsafe" 
if a hostile party wants to abuse it, I don't see how the word "safe"
is terribly useful in describing URIs.)
