The real world will continue to make progress using crocks (like random
messaging on top of HTTP), until there is a viable alternative.

Is the IETF a place to develop such an alternative?  Unfortunately, I 
doubt it, given my experience.  It seems to have such vision at the low 
level packet level, but it seems that too few people who build applications 
hang out there, so at most, the IETF might bless such an alternative if 
and when one comes along...  To date, the IETF has at most been able to 
deal with applications protocols for a single application, and not for 
generic protocol frameworks, on which thousands of apps can be built.

(Un)fortunately, the alternatives out there are pretty dismal,
so until such a viable application protocol framework appears,
I believe we are condemned to the current state (or to .net).
