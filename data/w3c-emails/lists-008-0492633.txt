guys - help me out with something. after reading your I-D, i can't help but
think that you can meet your requirements by:

1. shifting more responsibility (e.g., loss detection) to the endpoints.

2. using an application-layer relaying service with deterministic delivery
semantics (e.g., apex with some of the party pack options).

what am i missing here?
