so how does layering over HTTP help this situation?  it certainly
doesn't add reliability or transparency, nor does it help fix 
broken connections.  you can provide reliability and transparency
over HTTP, but you have to work harder to do this than to provide
the same services over IP.

even if you use HTTP as a means to get through firewalls, this is a short 
term fix at best.  because the fact that traffic is tunnelled over HTTP 
doesn't mean that it's any more suitable to pass through the firewall 
than raw IP traffic.  

what we need are better means to provide security than our current
firewalls, with fine-grained access control that is based on other 
properties than just the network locations of the participants, with 
the ability to specify access control centrally (within a domain).
but enforcement done by the hosts and servers.   firewalls should 
also be able to examine credentials and provide coarse filtering of 
traffic to protect the network and to provide security in depth.
and the credentials need to be usable in multiple security domains.
