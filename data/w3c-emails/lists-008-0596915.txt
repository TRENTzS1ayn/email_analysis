I think this states the situation very succinctly, though I would also 
say that making incremental changes to HTTP has gotten very hard, given 
its design.  Trivial things are still (often) simple in HTTP, but some 
slightly less simple things have now become almost impossible.

I think in fact such an effort will have to be done by a small team
(mostly) outside the IETF to build such a framework, but don't know
of anyone working on it right now.  The issue is to make sure
the IETF is "institutionally friendly" enough that such a team
can get the help it needs in the areas where the IETF is very strong.

I hope so to...
