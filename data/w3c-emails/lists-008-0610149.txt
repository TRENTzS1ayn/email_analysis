The short answer, with 20-20 hindsight, is that X stopped thriving the 
day the X consortium was established (in 1988).  We did not understand 
open source as a phenomena then, and the strings attached by the vendors
supporting the X consortium along with the continual fights among the
vendors really crippled progress shortly after its establishment.  More
importantly, it subverted the open culture we had developed for X, and
that killed it.  We may have not had a choice, but we didn't understand
we were making a choice.

Around '93 is when the UNIX vendors understood they had lost the desktop,
and things really didn't progress much after that, and their interest
and support waned.

It is has taken the emergence of Linux, XFree86, Gnome and KDE to again
give a Linux/UNIX desktop a new lease on life; that took a good 4-5 years
to gain enough momentum to start needing to push the base technology again
(i.e. Keith Packard's recent work), though I was amazed to see what they
had accomplished even before Keith started pushing the base system forward
again.

I point you toward my USENIX 2000 invited talk:
Lessons Learned about Open Source
http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix2000/invitedtalks/gettys_html/
A bit dated, given the crash of the speculative bubble, but most of it
I get right....

I think you'll find it a fun talk to read through.  I had alot of fun
putting it together, and it represents months of my time from when
I was getting my head around open source in general.
