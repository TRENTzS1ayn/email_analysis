well, you often need a prototype.  you also need to be willing to throw 
it away.   you can't insist on making your existing products compatible
with the future standard.

problem is, for IDN you couldn't get a correct design without understanding 
the needs of an extremely diverse set of parties.  and to attract such 
parties to the discussion we needed to set up a WG.  unfortunately the WG 
also attracted a number of clueless folk - not to mention the opportunitists
who wanted to find a way to collect a toll on use of this technology.

in the case of IDN, a few individuals were foresighted and intuitive and 
experienced enough to have a rough understanding about what the ultimate 
design would need to look like. but this isn't always the case.  nor can 
you reliably tell in advance which people have the foresight and which don't.
