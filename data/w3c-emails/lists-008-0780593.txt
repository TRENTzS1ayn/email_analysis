While I don't argue what you say isn't true: (it mostly is),
the fact that clients aren't implementing that part of the spec decently
really reduces the incentive for content providers to do so properly.
Their behavior in the face of network lossage is pretty bad.

I think this lack of client support is more of an issue than even what you
describe.

It is probably the case that a caching proxy is needed in the described
situation (lossy wierd networks) anyway, to refetch URL's for you you
visit frequently, as a minimum to increase usability and robustness.
