Yes, it doesn't come right out and say how generic the semantics are.
I was hoping that would be inferred, but so far nobody's picked up on
it. 8-(  I could add that as an appendix, I suppose.

But let me write it here quickly ... the application semantics are
equivalent to containment based software component models, which are
extremely generic and expressive.

HTML FORMs are the most common use of POST, and that use is consistent
with POST semantics, as I attempted to describe in my draft.

But I agree that there's lots of misuse, such as RPC-over-POST,
IPP, etc..

See above.

No argument from me there!  But I think if more of those people knew
what could be done using only HTTP as it was designed to be used,
there'd be less reason to use it improperly.  That was the primary
motivation for my draft.

Yup.
