That's the identifier of the resource that does the POST processing.
Invoking GET on that resource is very different than invoking POST ...
just don't tell the browsers, which for some reason assume that if I try
to do a GET on one of those URIs after a POST, that I really meant to
redo the POST.  Sigh.

Not sure what you mean by "contexts".  The "U" stands for "Uniform",
doesn't it? 8-)
