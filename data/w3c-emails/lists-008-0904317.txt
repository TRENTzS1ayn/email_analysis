I was wondering as to how difficult it is to set up this autoresponder?
Are there any plans to set this up so that others can test against it? 
I agree that providing a test-bed for VPIM client compliance will definitely
spur development.

Glenn had mentioned in one of the posts that Nortel Callpilot allows IMAP
access. I was wondering if one is available on the public net for testing?
