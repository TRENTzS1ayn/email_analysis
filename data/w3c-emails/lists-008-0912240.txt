Hi again. Some of you who are following the internationalized domain 
name discussion may have already seen this. The "how to canonicalize 
names" document has been split into two documents: a framework and a 
DNS-specific profile. The idea of the split is to allow developers of 
other protocols to use the framework without using all the 
DNS-specific rules. We expect that most protocols that need to 
canonicalize internationalized names will use similar rules, but with 
some significant changes.

If you are interested:
framework: draft-hoffman-stringprep-00.txt
DNS profile: draft-ietf-idn-nameprep-06.txt
