> The documented semantics of HTTP 1.1 methods, in particular POST,
> are not well understood, as demonstrated by debates such as whether
> IPP should have used POST or a new method, how to properly bind
> SOAP to HTTP, and the ever more common use of POST for tunneling
> new protocols such as XML-RPC.  This note attempts to define an
> abstract model for the state of HTTP URL scheme addressable
> resources consistent with HTTP 1.1, but hopefully more descriptive.
