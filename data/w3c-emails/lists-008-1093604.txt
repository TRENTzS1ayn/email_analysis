Abstract:
   The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a framework for structuring
   data.  While it evolved from SGML -- a markup language primarily
   focused on structuring documents -- XML has evolved to be a widely-
   used mechanism for representing structured data.

   There are a wide variety of Internet protocols; many have need for a
   representation for structured data relevant to their application.
   There has been much interest in the use of XML as a representation
   method.  This document describes basic XML concepts, analyzes various
   alternatives in the use of XML, and provides guidelines for the use
   of XML within IETF standards-track protocols.

Intended Publication Status
   It is the goal of the authors that this draft (when completed and
   then approved by the IESG) be published as a Best Current Practice
   (BCP).
