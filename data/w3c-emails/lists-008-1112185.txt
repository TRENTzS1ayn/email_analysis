Good. I am happy you are interested in doing this work.

I have a couple of other people which told me they could help aswell. I
presume you are ok with taking the token here.

Martin D?erst and myself talked over the phone the other day, and he let me
know he had a list of things he would like to have changed in the document,
so a new I-D seems to be needed.

Discussion(s) about this is suggested to be on the ietf-charsets@iana.org
mailing list (cc:ed on this message).

    Regards, Patrik
