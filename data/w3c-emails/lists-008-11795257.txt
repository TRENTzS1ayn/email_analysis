two things I don't see considered in your analysis:

1. as a sender, I don't want some random translator making
   subtle changes to the meanings of my messages as an
   automatic side-effect.  If I choose the translator,
   that's better than having it chosen for me.  Of course
   if a recipient wishes to have inbound mail translated,
   there's nothing I can do about that.

2. as a recipient, I currently find it useful that about
   70% of the spam I receive is not in a language that
   I speak - I can therefore delete it without a second
   thought, as it obviously wasn't written for me personally.
   the last thing I want is to have this spam automatically
   translated for me.
