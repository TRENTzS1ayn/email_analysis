Please excuse us if you receive this message repeatedly.

Yesterday marks the first anniversary of the terrorist attacks against the United States of America.

Thousands of innocent people, many citizens of Europe among them, became victims of terrorism in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on 11 September 2001. Many died in a selfless and heroic effort to save the lives of others.

It is with deep sorrow that we remember that tragic day. Our thoughts and prayers go to the bereaved families and friends in the United States and throughout the world who were stricken by the violence unleashed a year ago.

We invite the world to peace with the word of M.K. Ataturk/The Founder of Republic of Turkey; 
?Peace at home, peace in the world?.

With our prayers for a peaceful world.

*with all the best wishes for the regaib night*

Sincerelly Yours
