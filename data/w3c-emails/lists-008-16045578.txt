First off:  thanks for taking the initiative to establish an HTTP
working group.  You've set a very ambitious timetable for getting
things done.  I have my doubts whether the timetable is feasible, but
I'm more often a pessimist than an optimist.

My comments appear below.

Bear in mind that the standards process usually ratifies existing practice.
Therefore, updating the old Internet draft ought to be the first order of
business.  Addressing well-known problems, while important, should come
afterward.

I think this is possibly beyond our control.  If there's interesting stuff,
people will connect.  Otherwise they won't.  I agree we should have the
technology for them to use the Web at acceptable speed and cost.

Yes.  But I doubt this can be solved in the short term.  There are many
ideas around, but I don't see any consensus on how to do this.

IP address is dicey if you're trying to serve those folks with their Macs
and PCs who get a new IP address each time they connect to their Internet
provider.

Some transactions will surely be protected.  Otherwise an eavesdropper
could capture for free what someone else bought.

Don't forget privacy.  I think it will be important for people to make
requests anonymously and/or to feel comfortable that servers do not
accumulate dossiers on their information buying habits.

The numbering scheme may be premature -- it may depend on who gets what
done (and accepted by the community) first.  My guess is that
development will be breadth-first, which works against the usual
numbering schemes.  What I mean is this:  after people agree on the
state of current practice, folks will go off in different directions
that, I hope, are largely orthogonal:  performance improvement,
security, payment.  A linear numbering system won't accommodate that
diversity well.  You might have to say "HTTP 1.1 with performance
improvements", or "HTTP 1.1 with security".

Please please use www-buyinfo for discussions of commercial issues.
(An interesting question is whether security and payment can be treated
separately, or whether authentication connected to payment must be
bundled with other kinds of authentication.  I'm hoping for
orthogonality, but I certainly haven't demonstrated it yet.)

Yes.  I would expect people to agree to the formation of a working group.
Getting them to agree to a draft charter will perhaps be tougher.  Who
knows about a workplan?

Describing current practice may be possible by Spring '95.  The other two
are less likely.  It would be better to have developed working prototypes
of security and improved performance features.  Remember that the IETF
expects working code in conjunction with paper specs.  It will be hard to
have both polished code and a polished draft ready in that timespan.

Great!
