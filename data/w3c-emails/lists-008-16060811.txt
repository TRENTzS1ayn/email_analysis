My reactions to Dave Kristol's comments:

Agreed, although I think that we can work on problems in parallel.

The goal is to unlock the business potential, the means to achieving
this are asserted to be improving performance and simple payment mechanisms.

I think there may be short term steps we should take, e.g. passing
limited copyright information in the HTTP header, perhaps along with
contractual restrictions on right to print/save local copies. A related
idea is to allow publishers of "free" information to get some idea of
how many people are accessing it via shared caches.

Good point. None-the-less there is a need for a basic authentication
mechanism in the absence of the infrastructure for a stronger solution.

Agreed. The intent was to raise the distinction between secrecy and integrity.

Can we do this in the short term?  I am interested in exploiting the
blinding techniques of David Chaum, but don't yet know enough to get
a clear idea of how feasible it will be to support this widely on the
Web in the short term.

When we produce the revised Internet Draft that describes current practise
we will almost certainly want to change the version number in some way.
That would do for now!

I was hoping that say HTTP 2.0 would support the performance improvements
and a framework for plugging in security extensions in a modular way, e.g.
HTTP 2.0 with Shen or HTTP 2.0 with digital cash.

I was too prescriptive here. The intention was to keep the working group
mailing list clear of rambling discussions that are better handled on
a wider forum.

You may be right, but I am hoping that we can build on existing work
rather than having to start from scratch, e.g. EIT would write up how
their modified S-HTTP proposal fits into the open framework, ditto for
Spyglass and others. W3O would enhance the public domain libraries to
demonstrate feasibility of the open framework approach, e.g. with a basic
authentication module (Spyglass have volunteered to provide code for this)
and a module for using Shen. Much of the work has already been done for
handling multipart messages, and plans are in hand for work on reuse of
transactions for follow-on requests.
