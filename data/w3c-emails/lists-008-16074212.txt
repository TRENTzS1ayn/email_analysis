Okay.  I was thinking of a different kind of copyright protection, namely
a technological approach like document marking.  (See
http://www.research.att.com/#docmark for one example.)

I agree.  My quibble was with the specific use of IP address, not a basic
authentication mechanism.

There are a couple of aspects:
1) Anonymous payment mechanisms help to preserve privacy:  DigiCash,
anonymous credit cards.  I don't see how we can preserve privacy using a
billing model for payment.
2) Caching proxy servers help obscure identity (to the information service
provider).
3) I can imagine proxy TCP services that establish connections in a way
analogous to the anonymous reEmailers in Finland.  These would obscure
the original requester.

Note the effect that (2) and (3) have on IP address authentication!

Umm.  Let me be pedantic and note that digital cash is not a security
extension (at least in my book) but a payment extension.  That said, I
agree that we should be working toward a framework that allows
compatible extensions to HTTP.

I support the use of existing work.  I think you and I are agreeing that
we want to define a framework in which all these things can co-exist.  The
WG would define the framework, not necessarily the specific extensions.
