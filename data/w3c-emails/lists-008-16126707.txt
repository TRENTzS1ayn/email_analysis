Problem:

When a document is composite (text & images) it is not nice to have to wait 
for the whole document to load before display, but until the size of the images
is known this is tricky.

Non-Solutions:

1) Opening up multiple TCP/IP sessions. This is a kludge.


Solutions:

1) HTML+ allows the size of an image to be given in the text. We could imagine
some sort of "intall" utility to set up such info.

2) Using MGET we could imagine sending a resume of the images (size etc) before
starting the download. This could be sent in the message header
"image/gif; width=200; height=300; colours=256". Again this would 
require some sort of install perhaps - or the server could
be intelligent and "know" about gifs, jpegs etc.

This is where I think that MGET is not quite enough, we would also need an
MHEAD. 

I think that we need to enrich the content types to add in extra information
also. 


Phill.
