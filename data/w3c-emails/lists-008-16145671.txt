Very true.  But it is kinda breathtaking and effective from the *client* 
end.

This is exactly one solution being given by the same maker of this browser in
their "extensions to HTML" document.  But I don't like this too much, as I
think it crosses the HTML structure-presentation boundary too far and isn't
trustable (the HTML author or install procedure could be wrong, the image
size could change over time, etc.)

I like this idea much more.  I think the server could be configured to 
recognize image files and return coordinates like width, height, and 
color pretty easily - and it could cache that information for popular 
images.
