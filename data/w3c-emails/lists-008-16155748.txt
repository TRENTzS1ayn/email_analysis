The following assumes that the client gets the html document and
then sends the server a list of images to send next, reusing the
same connection.

I like the idea of being able to get the image sizes in advance of
the data, but would also like to be able to interleave the image
data streams. This way users see all of the images start to appear
concurrently, rather than one by one.

One simple idea is to use the segmented encoding approach and include
the stream number with the segment length. The initial info on image
size/type would specify the stream number for each image.

If this sounds too difficult, then at least the server could sort
the images by size and send the small ones first.
