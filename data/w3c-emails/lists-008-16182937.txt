Actually, I'd dispute this. I bet we could get one of our web-crawler
authors to add to his crawling algorithm a measure of the ratio of 
inlined-images-on-same-site to inlined-images-off-site, and that it 
would probably be something on the order of 20-1, if not 100-1.  We can't 
guarantee it, and we certainly shouldn't set up a protocol that would 
make inlining off-site images difficult or impossible, but forgoing 
optimizations because of it is a bad choice, I think.

Right, this would be great, and I don't see how it contradicts other 
proposals made here, it's just another parallel action.
