I have arranged the time for the BOF as Monday evening from 7:30 to 9:30
leaving us time to get to the bar afterwards! :-)

See http://union.ncsa.uiuc.edu/bof.shtml for details of other BOFs.
I will get Daniel to put a link into the proposed charter as posted
to this mailing list.

Looking forward to meeting you all.

Best wishes,
