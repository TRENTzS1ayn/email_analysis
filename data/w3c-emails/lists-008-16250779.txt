I disagree very strongly here. Security proxies such as the TIS proxy are
rather different to what the CERN proxy server provides. Here there is a 
primitive version of an item I beleive represents the future of the Web,
a caching relay server. The name proxy is a misnomer. Client side caqches
help but only to a small extent. Client side caches cannot be safely
shared in most circumstances.
