The issue in question is not that of using CNAME aliases (which provide
different names for the same service), but one of providing different
services on the same machine, all with (vanity) addresses 
of the form above.

I _think_ this is currently done at a few sites with a feature of 
the BSD ifconfig that allows one interface to accept traffic on 
multiple IP addresses on one interface, then hacking the server
to serve up different web pages for the different IP addresses.

It's an ugly hack, but there is a demand. I personally doubt this
can be "fixed" in the HTTP protocol because of the problem of supporting
old clients, and because this is, in effect, trying to subvert the meaning
of the DNS in the context of URLs.
