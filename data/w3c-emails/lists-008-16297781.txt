I think allowing

GET url HTTP/2.0

makes sense just in terms of cleaning up the protocol, independently
of the motivation of helping people who want to serve maultiple
host-names from the same host.

Servers don't really need to know their own names, as much as they
need to be able to discover their own addresses, and, after doing the
name lookup on a new hostname first ask "is this me?".  Servers will
also need some way to discover their own port, though.
