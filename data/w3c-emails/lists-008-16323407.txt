Yes. This is pretty important, since most servers will handle this already.
(Most apparently ignore the HTTP/1.0 tag or don't care if the version
number is off. Try it by telnetting to port 80 and sending GET / HTTP/2.0
to any server) This means that forward/backward compatibility can be
maintained between new clients and old servers NOW, with no changes.

Only if the syntax of the request/response changes. Otherwise, the status
quo can be maintained for old servers while new clients and servers get the
benefit of new HTTP additions.

A question of semantics, I suppose. If all that changes are the header
fields, leaving the syntax of methods, requests, and responses alone, then
there is no fundamental change required of old servers as they can just
ignore the new headers.

If radical change is a requirement for increasing the protocol version
number, then there's no reason to change the version number for this
"hostname" proposal. But if substantial functionality is added in the
context of the existing HTTP/1.0 standard, there's also no reason that it
can't be termed a new draft of the standard, or a new version altogether.
What's in a number anyway?

There's already a draft RFC for HTTP/1.0. Were you thinking of something
beyond the current draft that's available from info.cern.ch?
