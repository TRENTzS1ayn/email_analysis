Two points :-

1) Running httpd under inetd is definitively not recommended. Under many
UNIX implementations the inetd daemon breaks very badly when it
gets large number of simultaneous requests. So one netscape file
upload and your whole system is hosed.

2) The proposal to allow specification of the whole URL at the method
prompt would be an option, not mandatory. The point being that 
proxies should be intelligent enough to identify requests 
to themselves.
