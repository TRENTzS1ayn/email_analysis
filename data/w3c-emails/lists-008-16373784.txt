 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This should be "conflicts between the specification and existing practice."
There will be many differences, since there are many different "existing
practices".

Yes, that would be nice.

Sounds reasonable.  Do we have a "proposed charter"?  Dave?
I know there was some problems (i.e. lack of specificity) with
the first draft, but I never received any updated version.

It will be at

      http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/
       ftp://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/

just as soon as Henrik and I stop making major changes (early next week,
if not sooner).  I'll put a revised charter there as well, if I get one
[the first draft is there presently].
