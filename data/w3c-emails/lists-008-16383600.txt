HTTP - the HyperText Transfer Protocol is an applications protocol
which serves as the basis of the World Wide Web distributed hypertext
system.  The BOF has two main aims. The first goal is to review and correct
the updated HTTP 1.0 specification to make it suitable for standards track
advancement. The second aim is to discuss future work on the next versions of
HTTP, and to formally propose the setting up on a working group for HTTP.
