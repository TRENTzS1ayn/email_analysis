Ack!  I failed to notice that Dave listed the CERN location.  That is
not the main distribution site for the IETF version, and the copy there
is one day old (and what a difference a day makes!).  The version being
submitted to the IETF as an I-D is available at

     http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/
      ftp://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/

it is currently available in compressed postscript as:

          draft-fielding-http-spec-00.ps.Z

The above I-D name will be used until the HTTP-WG becomes official.
Text and HTML versions will follow as soon as I can generate them, and
both the text and PS versions will (eventually) be available from all
the Internet-Draft shadow directories.

Larry, your comments are appreciated and will be addressed as soon as
Henrik and I can get our heads above water.
