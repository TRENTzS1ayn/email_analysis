Is use of MIME or MIME-like multi-part types a current practice 
supported by either clients or servers? (My impression was that it was
not used and it could confuse a lot of clients.)

If not, I'd suggest removing it from this version of the
specification. I note the disclaimer that this specification
may not reflect current practice, but still, codifying current 
practice is a main aim of the HTTP/1.0 spec.
