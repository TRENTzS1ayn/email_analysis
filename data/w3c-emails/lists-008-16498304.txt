Actually, we agree. "+" and space are NOT equivalent. The problem is that
Mosaic and its derivative works (including NetScape, derived from the
programmers rather than the source) all encode spaces as + in object-body
parts. The "+" token is very clearly intended to be a search term
separator, as specified in the URI RFC. Just because "+" is the
representation of spaces from the original Mosaic's data entry dialog for
searches is coincidence. As you say, Mosaic could have prompted repeatedly
for single search terms, concatenating them with "+".

However, we are talking about slightly different subjects. I am
specifically requesting a clarification on what it means to have
object-body content that uses "URL-Encoding", and whether or not the usage
of "+" as an encoding for spaces is acceptable in an object-body part. I
have always felt that it is incorrect to use "+" for ANYTHING but keyword
separators in the search term portion of a URL. "+" in an object-body that
is URL-encoded should be represented as %2B and spaces as %20. This would
avoid any confusion with CGIs that interpret + as space, though it would do
little to keep clients from emitting them in the first place.

In the grand scheme of things, this is a minor issue. But clarifying it can
make life a little easier for CGI authors and client implementors.
