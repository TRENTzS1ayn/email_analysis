Thanks.

The specified behavior will be "no canonical encoding of the object-body
is required before network transfer via HTTP, though gateways may need
to perform such canonical encoding before forwarding a message via a
different protocol.  However, servers may wish to perform such encoding
(i.e. to compensate for unusual document structures), and
may do so at their discretion."

I'd rather not.  If there is a perceived need for non-US-ASCII information
in header field value text and comments (I don't see any), then I think
they should only be encoded by gateways during export.

Just trying to improve the world we live in. ;-)
Okay, okay, I'll fix it.

Actually, I was going to propose adding an optional delta-seconds
for Expires as well, but not until HTTP/1.1.
