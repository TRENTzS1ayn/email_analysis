I occurs to me that one current use of the Simple Request is in the
hack that allows links to HTML documents to be served up for WWW clients
on gopher servers. These are gopher links that are defined something like:

 Type=h
 Path=GET http-path-here
 Host=host
 Port=port

ie.

  http://host:port/xyzzy.html

becomes

  gopher://host:port/hGET%20xyzzy.html

(This currently seems to work for text/only web pages but not for pages
with in-line images.  There is some support for this hack in the
gopher community.)
