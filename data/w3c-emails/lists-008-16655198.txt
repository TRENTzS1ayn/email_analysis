Relative time indications are a requirement if we want `expires' to be
used for automatic refresh of data by the client on dynamic data. The
refresh ratio might be some seconds or minuttes and hence it must be an
relative indication in order to overcome synchronization problems
between server and client. The full date is quite expensive and an
integer might be a lot easier to handle.
