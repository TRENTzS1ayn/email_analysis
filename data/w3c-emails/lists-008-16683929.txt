Oh 0.9 support on server side is very useful.  You wouldn't believe
the number of complaints I had at the time the proxy always spit out
HTTP1, regardless of the request version.  There are
scripts/utils/wanderers/foobars that want to contact a server and not
bother with parsing the header, and a Simple-Request is an easy way to
get rid of the header in the first place.

Every server should support both 0.9 and 1.0.  Clients are another
story.
