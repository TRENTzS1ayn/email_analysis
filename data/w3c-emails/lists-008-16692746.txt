Many thanks for the rapid responses.  Just a couple of follow-ups:

[aside] Odd: the version I have proclaims itself "This document is an
        Internet-Draft".  Problems with document control somewhere!
        How will the Real Internet-Draft be identified?

I'm happy with the situation for responses (connection closes is quite
good enough), but still very unhappy with this definition for the data
(object body) for requests (PUT and POST).  The steps you just
outlined are not defined sufficiently well to be implementable (and
requiring every server to implement the rather gawky multi-part stuff
just in case data comes in that way seems unnecessary).  Is not
Content-Length essentially always present, in current practice, for
PUT and POST?  In which case, why require more that this, or
alternatives, unless truly necessary?

[aside] Maybe, but Long/Lat is more useful to the user than date/time
        of server response, and there *is* no standard for site info.

Excellent suggestion.  Please do.
