I seriously considered using your syntax instead of rfc822's, but we
decided that since HTTP, RFC 822, and MIME were so closely intertwined,
we should stick with the original syntax.

I agree (for most cases) and will fix that in the next version.

Sounds reasonable.

It is a superset because it does not restrict itself to the official
MIME types and x-token types, as does the MIME spec.  Thus, the parsing
is the same but without restricting the token values.  This is equivalent
to the RFC 1590 decision to not constrain media types.

It is equivalent to that in MIME.

I don't know if that should go into HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1.
We should discuss this in San Jose.

Right, we should probably just delete this section, as it is not in
current practice and there may be better ways of handling URC alternatives.
Henrik, what was the reason for including this in the spec?  I can't remember.

I'd rather include the generic syntax, just in case the MIME people
change their minds.  I am tempted to just remove MIME-Version altogether
(except for gateways), but that will have to be a group decision.

Nope. ;-)
