I object.

So far, CRLF and LF have been understood as linebreaks.  In other
words, LF is a linebreak, with possibly a preceding CR.  This is fine,
even when used intermixed.

If we change this in the proposed fashion, you will have ambiguity if
these are inconsistently used;  imagine a situation when you have a
file that begins with LF:

...CRLF
Blaa: foobarCR
CR
LF

This won't be ambiguous if you force the use of CRs and LFs to be
consistent, but I think it's better to allow LFs and CRLFs intermixed,
rather than allow CRs, LFs and CRLFs, but only one of them at a time.
