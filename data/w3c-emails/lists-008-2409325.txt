I think most ppl dosn't care about NAT as long as it works for them.
If you could make a killerapp that didn't work with NAT(perhaps SIP 
could do it?) then ppl might rething the usefullness of NAT.

OK if ipv6.playboy.com existed more ppl would get IPv6 connections to ;)

Small companies that buy a ADSL connection here in Sweden they only get 
one IP, then you haveto use NAT, no one has suggested that you should 
have more, it's simply convenient.
