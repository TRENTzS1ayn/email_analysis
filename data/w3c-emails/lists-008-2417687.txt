I think that's probably true.  But the widespread deployment of
NAT also means that people don't ever get a chance to see what new
apps they could run if NAT weren't there - the presence of NATs
means there's so little market for such apps that they can
never succeed - either that or they require expensive workarounds.
For instance, somebody has a product that lets you access your 
home machine from anywhere on the network.  It works by having
your home machine maintain a connection to a central server,
through which requests can be tunnelled back to your machine.
