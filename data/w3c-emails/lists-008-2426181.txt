apps people can develop attractive apps that might induce people
to use v6 instead of v4 where NATs are required.

but making it more attractive to not buy a NAT than to buy one
probably needs to address the reasons people buy NATs in the
first place - address shortage, avoiding the need to renumber, 
the illusion of security, packaging.  people are going to 
continue to want to buy NATs until these problems are solved
by other, better means.  it's not clear what apps people can to 
do address these things, except perhaps to make apps more secure.
