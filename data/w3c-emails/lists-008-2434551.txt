The thing is that you also need to make loads of tecnical ppl rethink 
their NAT habits, at my current job we use NAT, we have loads of public 
IPs but the head tech thinks that NAT is the easy way to go and that 
it's more secure than public IPs, every client that we install for now 
uses NAT.

Something that the apps group could do is to produce a white paper on 
the downsides of NAT and how easy it is to use regular IPs that could be 
  presented to IT managers.
