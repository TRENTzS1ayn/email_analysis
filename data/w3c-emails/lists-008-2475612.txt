Brian, I completely agree with this, and that's why I would like to 
have something which talk about the following:

- Security is handled by a firewall, not the NAT function
- Security is always in the form of some policy which someone want to 
apply to a path
- If the policy allow application FOO to pass the point where policy is 
applied, the application will only work as planned if there is _NO_ nat 
at that point

I.e. talk about security <> NAT and that NAT is bad for things which 
the policy allow.

Do you think that can help?
