FTP, SIP and DNS are three protocols which have problems. Or not really 
SIP but anything which uses RTP and is launched by an SDP specification.

Or, if you look at the situation when more than one host share one IP 
address (not really address translation, but anyway, the normal way NAT 
is implemented -- as 1:N mappings) and you have more than one host 
listening for incoming connections, like an SMTP server.
