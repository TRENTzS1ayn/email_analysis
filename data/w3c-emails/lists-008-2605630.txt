Well the NAT problem gets bigger and bigger every day. I think the race 
on IPv4 is lost here, it's better to concentrare on IPv6 and have good 
IP rules that every user gets a big net and good documentation from the 
ISP on how to use it.
Things must be easy for the end user and SMB otherwise we are stuck in a 
new NAT swamp.
