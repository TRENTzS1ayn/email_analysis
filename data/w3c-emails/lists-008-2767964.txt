That's exactly why the model (and the registry policy) is that what
ISPs should give to subscribers is a *prefix* not an address,
with /48 being the preferred prefix length and /64 the second-best.

IMHO, the IETF community's job should be to make applications that 
run better with a good supply of addresses and without NAT. Beyond
that we get into economic or regulatory questions, where the IETF
can't play.
