But there's a gross non-sequitur in this: NAT is irrelevant
to enforcing such a policy. You don't need NAT to black-hole
traffic; you just configure your routing accordingly, on both
sides of the DMZ. Plenty of companies protect their assets that
way.

There are lying salesmen who pretend otherwise. There are network
managers who fall for the lies and FUD.
