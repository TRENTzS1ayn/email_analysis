if you can establish a single TCP connection, then you can have arbitrary
message patterns (e.g., initiator receives requests from listener) and/or you
can multiplex traffic over it, if your application so chooses.

obviously, there are some network configurations where you can't establish a TCP
connection, and in cases like that, you need the help of an intermediary and the
BEEP tunnel profile...
