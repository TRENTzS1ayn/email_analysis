I have no problem with your response, you're right in fact.  My only 
angle was that NAT's don't absolutely prevent (in the same sense you 
said it was "possible") to create new applications.  I can certainly 
guess that the job is harder ("guess" out of naivete) - and obviously 
you have a more developed view.

...I admit that the difference between 'hinders' and 'renders 
impossible' is much larger than I initially thought...;)

My real intent was to point out that NATs pretty much wipe out the 
ability to extend applications that weren't built to handle NATs. 
(Besides making it painful to create new ones.)
