 FROM: THE DESK OF DR EMEKA FRANK 
 NIGERIAN GAS COMPANY PLC. LAGOS 
 TEL: 234-1-775-0857 FAX: 234-1-759-7912. 
 
 DEAR SIR, 
 
 FIRST AND FOREMOST, I MUST SOLICIT FOR YOUR 
 CONFIDENCE IN THIS TRANSACTION BY VIRTUE OF ITS NATURE 
 BEING UTTERLY CONFIDENTIAL. 
 
 I AM DR EMEKA FRANK THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE FOR 
 THE NIGERIAN GAS COMPANY PLC. 
 I CAME TO KNOW OF YOU IN MY SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE AND 
 REPUTABLE PARTNER TO HANDLE THIS CONFIDENTIAL 
 TRANSACTION WHICH INVOLVES A HUGE SUM OF MONEY TO BE 
 ENTRUSTED IN THE HAND OF A FOREIGNER. 
 
 THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT, A FOREIGNER BY NAME , 
 LATE ENGINEER JOHN ANDERSON AN AUSTRALIAN CITIZEN, WHO 
 WAS AN OIL MERCHANT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF 
 NIGERIA, BEFORE HIS DEATH TEN YEARS AGO IN A 
 GHASTLY AIR CRASH, DEPOSITED THE TOTAL SUM OF 
 $10,200,000 (TEN MILLION, TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND 
 UNITED STATES OF AMERICAN DOLLARS ) WITH US HERE IN 
 NIGERIA AT THE NIGERIAN GAS COMPANY PLC. LAGOS, 
 BEING PAYMENT FOR LIFTING OF GAS PRODUCTS FOR RE-SELL 
 IN THE AUSTRALIAN MARKET. 
 UPON HIS DEATH THIS SAID SUM OF MONEY HAS BEEN LYING 
 IN THE CREDIT OF HIS ACCOUNT WITH US AND IS EXPECTED 
 TO BE CLAIMED BY MR JOHN ANDERSON`S NEXT OF KIN. 
 
 SINCE HIS DEATH, FERVENT VALUABLE EFFORTS, HAVE BEEN 
 MADE BY THE NIGERIAN GAS COMPANY PLC, TO GET IN TOUCH 
 WITH ANY OF LATE ANDERSON'S FAMILY BUT TO NO AVAIL. IT 
 IS BECAUSE OF OUR INABILITY TO LOCATE MR ANDERSON`S 
 NEXT OF KIN, THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE 
 COMPANY ARE CONTEMPLATING THAT THE FUNDS WOULD BE 
 CONVERTED TO THE COMPANY'S FUND IF CLAIM IS NOT MADE 
 BY ENGR. ANDERSON`S NEXT OF KIN BEFORE OUR ANNUAL 
 GENERAL MEETING COMING UP  THIS YEAR. 

 ALL THAT IS REQUIRED FROM YOU NOW, IS TO ACT AS THE 
 NEXT OF KIN, TO THE LATE ENGR. JOHN ANDERSON, AS THE 
 MODALITIES SHALL BE WORKED OUT, TO FACILITATE THE 
 RELEASE OF $10.2 M TO ANY BODY THAT WILL STAND FIRMLY 
 AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO THE LATE ENGINEER WITHIN THE 
 STIPULATED TIME. THE FUNDS WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY 
 RELEASED TO YOU, AND IT WILL BE JUSTIFIABLY PRESENTED 
 AS HAVING BEEN PAID TO THE NEXT OF KIN WHICH WE ASSUME 
 TO BE YOU. YOUR INTEREST WILL BE PROTECTED AS 
 NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION WILL BE PROVIDED CERTIFYING 
 YOU, AS THE RIGHTFUL BENEFICIARY AND ADEQUATE 
 PERCENTAGES (%) SCHEDULED FOR MUTUAL BENEFITS ARE 
 INDICATED BELOW: 
 
 ( 1 ) NEXT OF KIN WHICH IS YOU, -- 30% 
 ( 2 ) MYSELF, THE ORIGINATOR -- 60% 
 ( 3 ) 10% INCIDENTAL EXPENSES THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED 
 IN THE COURSE OF THIS TRANSACTION. 
 
 NOTE THAT ALL MODALITIES NECESSARY FOR THE RELEASE OF 
 THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN PERFECTED AND THE TRANSACTION IS 
 100% RISK FREE, AS NO TRACE WILL BE FOUND AFTER THE 
 SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION. 
 
 I AM WAITING FOR YOUR PROMPT RESPONSE. 
 
 BEST REGARDS 
 
 DR EMEKA FRANK 
 
 PLEASE SEND DOWN YOUR PHONE NUMBER , IT WILL BE NEEDED TO START THIS 
TRANSACTION.
