Dear Friend,
I am Mr Onuigbo Baldwin Gozie, Bank Manager of Diamond BANK , Lagos
Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered
time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at
US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon
maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got
no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from
his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.
Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I
found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next
of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and
discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin in all his
official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of
US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will
come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration
of 6{Six} years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently, my proposal
is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to
Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get
into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple;
1) I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and
address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and
affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin.
2) We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and
notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.
3) A bank account in any part of the world, which you provide, will then
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of
kin of Mr.Barry Kelly. The money will be paid into your account for us to
share in the ratio of 75% for me and 20% for you then 5% will be set aside for any expenses that may occure during the transfer process.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be
done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please
reply immediately via the private email address below. Upon your response,
I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that
will help you understand. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest
assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us
because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your
country. Awaiting your urgent reply via email or my private telephone 234-80-37234524.
Thanks and regards
Baldwin Gozie Esq.
