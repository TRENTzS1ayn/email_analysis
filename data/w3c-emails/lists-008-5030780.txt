Dear Friend,

I will like to solicit your help in a business preposition, which is by nature very confidential and a Top Secret. 

I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one worried and apprehensive but I am assuring you not to worry, as all will be well at the end of this endeavor. 

I am Mr.Amadi Dominic and I am the General Manager of the African Development Bank PLC and I and my partners have decided to seek your help in transfer of a huge sum of money requiring maximum confidence . 

THE PROPOSITION 

A foreigner, Late Engineer Mark Otagaki, who was an oil merchant and contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria until his death onboard the ill fated Kenyan Airways bus {A310300}was our customer at the AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK and had a balance of US$32 .2million which the bank now expects his next of kin to claim as the beneficiary.We have made valuable efforts to get his people to no avail as he had no known relatives,due to this development our management and our board of directors are making arrangements for the funds to be declared unclaimed and subsequently paid into the federal government purse and to avert this negative development me and my colleagues have decided to look for a reputable person to act as the next of kin to late Mr. Otagaki, so that the funds will be released and paid into your account and this is where you come in. 

All documents to aid your claim will be provided by me and my colleagues and for your help you will be getting a percentage of the total sum . 


Please be assured that this transaction is risk free and we will need your fax number and phone number for more communication and my phone number is 234-80-33052947.
