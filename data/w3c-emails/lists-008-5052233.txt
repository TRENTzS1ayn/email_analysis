This last payment quarter, a total of 30 contractors
were short listed for payment and about 25 of them
have been paid remaining about 5 (Five), information
reaching this office indicates that one among the
remaining has been reported dead. His name is Mr.
Gerrand Schwartz from Sweden, he died in the last Air
France Concorde plane crash. Meanwhile he finished the execution of his
contract December 19th 1999. But since his death, nobody has come
forward to put a claim to his contract fund which is about
US$15,500,000.00 Million (fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S
Dollars) that is why I need your immediate assistance to expedite the
transfer of the contract amount.

your capability. Upon completion of this transaction
I have decided to give you 30% of the total sum, 60%
of the fund which is our share will be used for
investment in your company or in any other company of
our choice. While10% has been mapped out to take care
of any minor expenses incurred. Take note that this
