yes sir!

I think you missed the main point here. RFC2806, RFC3191, RFC3192, and a
large number of rfc-to-be from the VPIM WG in the RFC Editor queue now all
use the syntax and specification contained into
DRAFT-ALLOCCHIO-GSTN-02.TXT and thus are all compatible with it. Thus this
document does not add or updated any of them at all (all authors of the 
above documents are those who contributed to this I-D).

However the specifications are embedded into RFCs whose title and 
purpouse is not to sepcify how you write in text a dial string sequence, 
and this creates continuously the "re-invent the wheel" problem, and the 
ADs and IESG has to send back specifications asking the authors to use 
the existing standard specification. If there is a single "collection" 
document with a sensible title, and which is free from other definitions 
which might confuse the reader, the "keeping the coherence" job is easier.

Local Phone string can work only "locally", and global-phone ones do 
their job globally. If you think the text is not clear enough, we can try 
to clarify it.

... I'm just waiting the kernel to rebuild after I included IPv6 on my 
workstation... thus I have some time...
