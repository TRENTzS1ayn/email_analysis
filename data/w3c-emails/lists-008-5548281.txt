I am pretty bemused at this - I seem to have missed the earlier ones.
The Application ADs suggested it?

What exactly does this add to RFC2806?
It doesn't seem to update 2806, so I don't understand how I use this,
or where.

In particular, the phone-context stuff in 2806 is there for a good reason
- the phone string could well be sent to Finland (inside an email, for
instance). This is not going to work if one uses local phone string
format (with 001 to call the U.S.).

It doesn't seem to be in this draft, so perhaps a warning that this
will break unless you KNOW where the recipient will be dialling could
be (re-)added?

Hey, I'm sure you don't have anything else to do before 2300 MET, right? :).
