interesting question.  I had to look around a bit to find them.  

they are currently being maintained on what used to be the 
www.apps.ietf.org web server (back when I was an apps AD).  
most of the content of the web server has since been moved 
elsewhere, but we never made arrangements for the list to
be archived at a different location.  the list is still being 
maintained on cs.utk.edu, and the list maintains archives by 
appending to a local (NFS mounted) file based on the name of 
the list and the date.  

obviously we need to fix this.  but for the next few days at 
least, you can find the archives (since Feb 1999 - is this
when it started?) at http://wilma.cs.utk.edu/mail-archive/

the filenames are of the form {listname}.{year)-{month}

be aware that these archives include spam and probably viruses, 
most of which were filtered out before the mail was sent to 
the list.
