FYI: I have during the holidays started a system where I keep track of all
Internet-Drafts which are "mine" in the IESG. This does not include the
ones which are on Ned's side of the table.

The notes I have about each draft (the status) might not be accurate now in
the beginning, so I am this week going through all of them to verify that
the status is correct.

With you if I belive that (a) you have requested something which I have not
acted on or (b) I have let you know some changes are needed, and I have not
seen any action.

With IESG and IESG members if I wait for them.

Because both Ned and myself work offline, and we don't have a common place
for updating and storing data like this, we can not (today) have a common
list for everything which is "weird" in Applications Area.

Anyway, expect email this week about your draft(s).

My list is as follows (in alphabetical order), and I have gone through
about 1/3 of the drafts as of today. The remaining 2/3 will be taken care
of shortly:
