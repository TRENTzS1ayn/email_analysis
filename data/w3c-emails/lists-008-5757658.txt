Concatinating makes it impossible for a computer to ever
determine there are multiple languages present; we'll forever
be stuck with this weakness, and will need some MIME-like
device ("++boundary++" or suchlike) to separate the different
languages.

As the behavior of the concatinated text is the same as
multipart/mixed (all parts of multipart/mixed have to
be 'processed' or displayed to the user), how about using
multipart/alternative as you have proposed, but using
multipart/mixed as a sub-type for each language within the
plain part, like this:

  Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=ABC

  --ABC
  content-type: multipart/mixed; boundary=HHH

  --HHH
  content-type: text/plain
  content-language: english

  Good day.

  --HHH
  content-type: text/plain
  content-language: german

  Guten Tag.

  --HHH--


However, I don't know how mailers respond to multipart/mixed embedded inside
multipart/alternative.  As nested MIME parts aren't common, some mailers may
puke on this.

Concatinating makes it difficult/impossible to write a parser that
could pull out individual languages.  But there isn't a way in HTML
to reliably get at other 'attachments'...  Hm, I can't think of a
different way to do this.
