Do you mean multipart/alternative with one body part for
each language? I do not think that is feasible, if you
check how present mail UAs handle this. Most people
would get only the first or the last alternative, quit
independently of which language they actually can read.

My proposal with multipart/alternative, but with an extra
body part first and last in the multipart/alternative, was
an attempt at accomodating your wish to use
multipart/alternative, and still get something wich works
acceptably when received by today's mail UAs.
