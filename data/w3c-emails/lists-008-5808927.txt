When the MIME standard was introduced, the handling by
present mail was central in the design of mail. For example,
the QUOTED-PRINTABLE format was chosen, because messages
encoded in this format would be at least partly readable
for recipients with old mailers.

Why should not a graceful downgrading to existing mailers
be important for language translation in e-mail, when
it was so very important in the design of MIME itself?
