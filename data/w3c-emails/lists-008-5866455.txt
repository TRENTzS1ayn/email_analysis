Not a complete failure, perhaps, but a partial failure nevertheless. And your
assertion that what you propose is "quite readable" is following the exact same
line of reasoning that led to quoted-printable, which makes me very nervous.

That's a fine goal if you can come up with a proposal that achieves it. I don't
think you have done so thus far. And this is basically my point: I think you're
setting your sights on something that isn't achievable. And that's why you're
flailing around.

Unfortunately, the whole space MIME operates in is filled with compromises,
some of which are quite painful. You need to be prepared to make very painful
compromises.

As I've said before, I suspect you're going to find that this works even less
well with existing mailers than multipart/alternative.

This is the same sort of solution as quoted-printable, and while you may not be
willing to admit it, experience has shown that there's a real downside to this
approach.

Please note that I'm not saying that you should avoid this approach. What I'm
saying is that you shouldn't look at quoted-printable as justification
for using this approach. Instead you should look at quoted-printable
and try to learn  what can go wrong from that experience.

One other point to consider is that software that supports (b) will support (c)
trivially. As such, it may make sense to try (b) but plan to cut over to (c) if
the need arises.

I strongly recommend that you stay away from (a).

You're a bit confused here. The bcc field has nothing to do with sending
messages in different formats. The bcc facility in some UAs may end up sending
slightly different messages to different recipients, but that's an effect of
the UA's interpretation of bcc semantics, nothing more.

I haven't done any sort of survey of clients, but I get a lot of bcc's, and
most of them are separate messages with slightly different content.

Sounds to me like you're now optimizing for the very uncommon case. This is
the sort of thing you really need to avoid.
