Receiving a message in multiple language versions,
concatenated after each other in a single body part, and
with an index of languages at the top, will surely be
readable. This is what I have done manually a few times,
when I have had the need to send messages to people, some
of which are in France, a country where people are proud to
claim they cannot understand English.

Yes, that is very reasonable. If we start with (b)
(multipart/alternative with two additional body parts first
and last with all the language versions concatenated) then
we can of course hope for a possible future where the
additional body parts first and last are not needed any
more (c).
