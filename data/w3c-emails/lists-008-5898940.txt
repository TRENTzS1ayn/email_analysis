Jacob,

I think there are two separate problems here that should not be combined:

1. If you are trying to send out multi-lingual text to today's user agents,
naturally you need to choose whatever format you think is most compatible
with the user agents used by the recipients of those messages.  

2. If we want to standardize a MIME format for sending out multi-lingual
text, then we would need to pick a format that met the criteria for 
standards-track documents: no known technical omissions, etc.  As a
practical matter, we would also want reason to believe that at least 
some UA vendors (whether commercial or not) were likely to implement 
that format.

It's quite reasonable to ask which representation of the messages would 
work best for purpose #1.  That doesn't mean, however, that such a
representation would meet the quality for standards-track documents
or that vendors would implement it.

Keith
