I do not think this will work. When I tested sending
multipart/alternative with different languages in different
body parts, then most existing mailers just showed either
the first or the last body part, without even telling me
that there were any other body parts, or giving me any
option to select a particular body part.

Because of this, my conclusion is that if you use
multipart/alternative with different languages in different
body parts, then the first and the last body parts must
both of them contain a concatenation of all the languages.

Did I correctly understand your proposal?
