dear all.

i would like to bring to your attention two internet drafts that i have
recently published:

http://ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wilde-sms-service-01.txt

abstract: This memo describes the registration of the Short Message
Service (SMS) as a registered IANA service selector for Global Switched
Telephone Network (GSTN) numbers. SMS is not available for all GSTN
subscribers, but it has proven very popular with users of the Global
System for Mobile Communications (GSM), and has also been adapted to
other telephone network technologies such as the Integrated Services
Digital Network (ISDN).

http://ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wilde-sms-uri-01.txt

abstract: This memo specifies a URI (Universal Resource Identifier)
scheme "sms" for specifying a recipient (and optionally a gateway) for
an SMS message. SMS messages are two-way paging messages that can be
sent from and received by a mobile phone or a suitably equipped
computer.

any comments on these drafts are welcome.

kind regards,
