SIR,
I AM MR.YESUF SULEMAN A CUSTOM OFFICER AND WORK AS
ASSISTANT CONTROLER OF CUSTOMS AND EXCISE DEPERTMENT
OF THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS STATIONED
AT THE MURTALA MOHAMMED INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, IKEJA
LAGOS NIGERIA. AFTER THE SUDDEN DEATH OF THE FORMER
HEAD OF STATE OF NIGERIA GENERAL SANNI ABACHA ON JUNE
8TH 1998 HIS AIDES AND IMMEDIATE MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY
WAS ARRESTED WHILE TRYING TO ESCAPE FROM NIGERIA IN A
CHARTERED JET TO SAUDI ARABIA WITH 4 TRUNK BOXES
MARKED DIPLOMATIC BAGGAGED.

ACTING ON TIP-OFF AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO BOARD THE AIR
CRAFT, MY OFFICIALS CARRIED OUT A THOROUGH SEARCH ON
THE AIR CRAFT AND DISCOVERED THAT THE 4 TRUNK BOXES
CONTAINED FOREIGN CURENCIES AMOUNTING TO
197,570,000.00(ONE HUNDRED AND NITY-SEVEN MILLION FIVE
HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS).

I DECLARED ONLY (3) THREE BOXES TO THE GOVERNMENT AND
WITHHELD ONE (1) IN MY CUSTODY CONTAINING THE SUM OF
($20,250,000) TWENTY MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY, WHICH HAS BEEN
DISGUISED TO PREVENT THEIR BEING DISCOVERED DURING
TRANSPORTATION PROCESS.

DUE TO SEVERAL MEDIA REPORTS ON THE LATE HEAD OF STATE
ABOUT ALL THE MONEY HE AND HIS CO-GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
STOLE FROM OUR TREUSARY AMOUTING TO US$55BILLION
DOLLARS (REF:ngrguardiannewspaper.com) OF JULY 2ND
1999. EVEN LONDON TIMES OF JULY 1998 REPORTED THAT
ABACHA HAS US$3.BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE ACCOUNT
OVERSEAS. WE DECIDED TO CONCEAL THIS ONE (1) BOX TILL
THE SITUATION IS QUITE ON THE ISSUE. THE BOX WAS
DEPOSITED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY HERE IN NIGERIA AS
PRECIOUS STONE AND JEWLLERIES.

NOW ALL IS CALM, WE (MYSELT AND TWO OF MY COLLEAGUES
IN THE OPERATION TEAM) ARE NOW READY TO MOVE THIS BOX
OUT OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH A DIPLOMATIC ARRANGEMENT.
HOWEVER AS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THE NEW CIVIL SERVICE
CODE OF CONDUCT DOES NOT ALLOW US BY LAW TO OPERATE
ANY FOREIGN ACCOUNT OR OWN FOREIGN INVESTMENT AND THE
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAN BE FOUND IN OUR ACCOUNT
CANNOT BE MORE THAN OUR SALARY ON THE AVERAGE.
THEREFORE WE WANT YOU TO ASSIST US IN MOVING THIS
MONEY OUT OF NIGERIA. WE SHALL DEFINITELY COMPENSATE
YOU HANDSOMELY FOR THE ASSISTANCE.

THERE ARE 2 WAYS WE CAN DO THIS.
(1)EITHER YOU SEND ME YOUR ADDRESS AND THIS BOX CAN
BE DELIVERED TO YOUR ADDRESS VIA DIPLOMATIC COURIER
SERVICE AS PRECIOUS STONE/JEWELLERIES.
(2)WE INSTRUCT THE SECURITY COMPANY HERE IN NIGERIA
TO TRANSFER THE CONSIGNMENT TO THEIR BRANCH OFFICE
OUTSIDE NIGERIA AS PRECIOUSE STONES AND JEWELLERIES
YOU BOUGHT FROM HERE FOR SAFE KEEPING. THEN WE ARRANGE
TO MEET AT SAID COUTRY TO TAKE THE DELIVERY OF THE
CONSIGNMENT. YOU OPEN AN ACCOUNT THERE AND LODGE THE
MONEY THERE AND GRADUALLY INSTRUCT REMINANT TO YOUR
COUNTRY.

THIS BUSINESS IS 100% RISK FREE FOR YOU PLEASE TREAT
THIS MATTER WITH UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY IF YOU
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST TO ASSIT US PLEASE JUST E-MAIL
ME FOR MORE EXPLANATION ON HOW WE PLANNED TO EXECUTE
THE TRANSACTION MY ALTERNATIVE EMAIL IS: murktarinc@yahoo.com

EXPECT YOUR RESPONSE URGENTLY.
BEST REGARDS

YESUF SULEMAN.
