Dear Sir 

Request for the transfer  of $12 Million into your Company or Personal account. 


I am Azare Abdul, an accountant with the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA), I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable institution / person who can handle a very strictly, confidential transaction which involves transfer of a reasonable sum of money to a foreign account. 
There is $12M (Twelve Million United States Dollars Only) in my department awaiting remittance. This money represents the surplus of an over valued contract executed for the corporation some years back. This contract has long been completed by a foreign firm and the contractor duly paid. 

I now seek if you will permit the surplus to be remitted into your personal / company account, so that the money so remitted will be shared mutually among the parties concerned including you. 

However, I would wish to receive your personal assurance that you will not sit on the money when it goes into your account. More importantly, you keep confidential this transaction in order not to tarnish the confidence reposed in the officials involved in this transaction. 

Tentatively, we have agreed that 70% of the money goes to the officials where the money originated, 20% to the owner of the account while 10% will be used to defray whatever expenses that may be incurred in the course of this transaction. I wish to inform you that this transaction requires the most urgent reply and attention to enable us pull out this money soonest. 

You are expected to forward to me through the above email address the following details: 
1, Name of the bank where you want the money to be transferred. 
2, Account number and name of the account. 
3, Bank address. 
4, your personal telephone and fax number. 

A meeting of all the parties concerned will take place few days before the remittance is to be made. Be informed that on the completion of this transaction, I will use the share of my money to procure goods from your company or any company you may introduce. 
Finally, on acceptance of this request, please reply through the above email address this is to guarantee the confidentiality of your interest. 

Please contact me immediately for details. 

Best regards, 

Azare abdul
