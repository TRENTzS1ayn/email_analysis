DearPartner, 
Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani
Abacha the ? late former head of state of Nigeria in June 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the 
present civilian administration, I have been subjected
to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. My son is still under detention arraigned before the federal high court of Nigeria 
for an offernce he did not commit. As a widow that is
so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country.You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various 
huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different
security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there and many outrightly blackmail us. In fact 
the total sum discoveredby the Government so far is in the tune of $700Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. 
You may be surprise how I got to know but I will tell you when you reply. 
I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to
you. due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will 
not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of U.S 40.3million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is witheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safe keeping. This arrangement is known to you and my son alone, so my son will deal directly with you as security is up my whole being. The name of my son is ABBA ABACHA. I am
seriously considering a viable Business venture as soon as this fund get into your account. 
Help diverting this fund into your account which will
accrue you 30%of this fund. Please honesty is the watch word in this transaction. Please forward 
your private telephone and fax number so that we can
commence communicationimmediately. In case you don?t accept please don?t let me out to the security. I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in 
good faith. Please expedite action. 
BestRegards!
Hajia Maryam Abacha
