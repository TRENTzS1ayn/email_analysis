From:Mrs. M. Sese-seko

I am Mrs Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am move to write this letter, this was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation.  I escaped along with my husband and two other of our son Kennedy and Basher out of Democratic Republic of Congo(DRC) to Abidjan, Cote D'ivoire were my family and I settled, while we later 
moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. 

However due to this situation we decided to changed most of my husband billions of dollars deposited in Swiss Bank and other Countries into other forms of money coded for safe deposit because the new Head of State of (DR) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement to the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband treasures deposit in some Europeans countries.

Hence my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation till when things get better, like now that President  Kabila is dead and the son taking over (Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's  Chateaux in southern France was confiscated by the French government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated. I have deposited the sum of Eighteen Million United State Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) with a security company, for 
safekeeping. The funds are coded to prevent them from knowing the content. 

What I want you to do is to indicate your interest that you will assist us by receiving the money on our behalf. Acnowledge this message, so that I can introduce you to my son (kennedy) who has the out modalities for the claim of the said fund. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. I will also like to buy 
properties and stock in multi-national companies to engage in other safe and non-speculative investment. 

May I at this point emphasize the high level of confidentiality, Which this business demands, and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence, which I repose in you. In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son shall put you in the picture of the business, tell you were the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss other modalities including renumeration for you services. 

For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information, that is your personal telephone and fax number for confidential purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail.

Best regards,
Mrs M. Sese-seko.
