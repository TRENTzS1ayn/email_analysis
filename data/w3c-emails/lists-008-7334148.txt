I have created a mailing list, ietf-ldap@paf.se, which will be "the LDAP
directorate" in the Applications Area.

I want all documents which are not products of one of the three LDAP
working groups in the IETF (LDUP, LDAPBIS and LDAPEXT) to be reviewed
there. This include documents which uses LDAP from wg's and individuals in
other areas.

So, if you have a draft which uses LDAP, please either point that out to
me, or pass the document to this mailing list yourself as early in the
process as possible.

The list today consists of the 6 wg chairs for the 3 wg's + myself and Ned.

If you have other people which you think should be on that list, like
yourself, or if you feel someone should be removed let me know.

    co-chair of the Applications Area in the IETF
