First this note is not off-topic for the ENUM WG..indeed it is totally in 
scope with the WG's revised charter.

"3. The Working Group will continue to maintain appropriate contact and 
liaison with standards bodies and groups, specifically ITU-T SG2, in order 
to provide technical or educational information as needed, such as the 
appropriate use of DNS. The Working Group will encourage the exchange of 
technical information within the emerging global ENUM community as well as 
documentation on practical experiences with implementations or 
administration of RFC 2916."

Is there any restriction on the geographic location of participants?

I'd specifically like this ad-hoc group to maintain contact and liaison 
with the chairs and we would welcome ID's documenting the organization of 
this trial, scope and results. As you may know we will eventually want to 
take 2916 from proposed to draft in the usual IETF manner manner.

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2026.txt

The requirement for taking a RFC from proposed to draft standard require 2 
demonstrations of inter operability and this trial could be useful in 
documenting that process.

Thank you for making the list aware of this opportunity!
