OK. However my posting (and this reply) also goes to the IETF apps
mailing list, where it may be off-topic. I sent the announcement there
to try and reach out to developers or ASPs who may have ENUM-aware
products that could be used in the trial.

No. Though for the obvious practical reasons it would help if
participants had a presence in the UK (or in roughly the same time
zone). It's also likely that participants will be bound by UK and EU
law on data protection and privacy. That could present constraints on
what participants in other jurisdictions can and cannot do.

Although I can't speak for the UK trial group, I'm sure it will be
happy to do that. Though obviously this will need to be discussed
first. Pretty much everything surrounding the trial will be in the
public domain. The trial will appoint a manager/co-ordinator and one
of their responsibilities will be liaising with other trials, IETF WG
chairs, ITU SG2 and so on.
