 It was when the new civilian administration in Nigeria set up this panel to review all contracts/ oil licenses to determine their authenticity, propriety in the light of the economic and political realities of my country that we identified a lot of inflated contract funds which are currently floating in our Apex Bank. At this moment we have worked out modalities within ourselves to transfer the sum of US$ 8,500,000,00 (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) only, for our personal use.
 However, by virtue of our positions as civil servant and members of the Contract Review Panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names.
