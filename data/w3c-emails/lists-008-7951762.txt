Hi,

When implementing AMR decoder from scratch as explained in 3GPP 
standard, I am facing lot of doubts. Decoding fucntions are not 
explained properly in the standard. For example, DTX handling in 
decoder side is understandble in reference source code , but nothing 
is explained in the standard (TS 26.093 V3.3.0).

Am I missing something? Can anybody tell where explanations about the 
decoding functions are given in greater detail?

Also, if I use some functions from the reference code, is there any 
copyright issue? 

Regards
biswajit
