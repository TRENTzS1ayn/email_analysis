Urgent business
I will like to begin by way of introduction, my name is Abudu Masabela, a native of cape town, south Africa and a senior employee of the South Africa department of mining and natural resources currently here in amsterdam on a trade mission.
I am writing this letter to solicit your cooperation and participation in a business deal to redeem an investment interest currently being held under trust with the South Africa ministry of mining and natural resources. The said investment now valued at US$18,500,000.00 million was originally purchased by Mr Lucio Manfred and leased to a company the Transvaal Orange mining corporation in 1979. Since the maturity of the contract in September 1989 several attempts have been made without success to contact Mr Lucio manfred or any of his relatives in whose favour the investment cash value can be paid.
My partner who is the accounts director at the ministry of mining and two of our colleagues have initiated the process of filling a claim for this money with the hope of having the funds transferred abroad. We request therefore that you let my partners file a claim for this money from South Africa ministry of mining and natural resources indicating that you where appointed by Mr Lucio Manfred to be the beneficiary of this funds. When the claim is approved, you as the beneficiary will be paid the sum of US$18,500,000.00 United States Dollars. Since this money will be paid directly to any bank account of your choice you are liable to ensure that my partners and I receive 75% of the total sum while you keep 25%for your services. Please we urge you to keep this matter very confidential because we are still in active public service in South Africa.
I want to assure you that my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a stong guarantee that our share will be well secured and that you will not take advantage of our position since the money will be transfered directly to your bank you are nominating.
Be rest assured that there is absolutely nothing to worry about in view of this claim. It is perfectly safe with no risks involved and it is not subject to any enquiry since my partners will be handling it directly in South Africa on your behalf.
I do hope my proposal is acceptable to you. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter so that I can provide you with more clarification about the claim and how we intend to make this deal beneficial to everyone involved.
Please for urgent response contact me through this email address.
Yours truly,
Abudu Masabela.
