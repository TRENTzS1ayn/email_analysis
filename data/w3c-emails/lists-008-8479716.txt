We have chosen Informational, because it describes that is already developed.
If we shall see such necessity and if this protocol will be useful, it is
possible to advance it up to standards track. In this case, it is necessary
to apply a set of RFC published standards for improvement of the protocol,
especially solving security problems.

There are enough reasons to invent a new syntax instead of use XML.
You can see in practice, how big and heavy the XML-based RPC calls looks
like (XMLRPC and SOAP). I believe that XML has all possibilities for
a complex data structure definition, however it does not provide sufficient
possibilities, fixed at a syntax level, for the object definition.
It is possible to describe objects, but there is some freedom degree
in the invention of ways to do it. Have you noticed that there are many
XML-based technologies, however they are incompatible with each other.
XML does not provide node types in hierarchical structures, however
nodes can represent either object or property or container for other
objects. USP gives three levels of node classification:
  1. node essence (part, object, member, folder)
  2. node data type (plain, multipart, table, file, array)
  3. node class
I could give examples demonstrating advantages such syntax, its
representational abilities and definition size reduction.
But I believe that RFC publication is not a right place for such
discourse.
