In short, this paragraph needs work.  The terminology and language
used is a bit odd.  For example, "grabbing" could refer to a session
hijacking or could refer to eavesdropping.  I suggest you align
the terminology with RFC 2828.

I believe the IANA Considerations section to include (directly
or in an Appendix) a registration template for each value it
requests to be registered.  See RFC 3368 for a recent example.

For IETF Protocols, yes.  See RFC 2234.

You're welcomed.
