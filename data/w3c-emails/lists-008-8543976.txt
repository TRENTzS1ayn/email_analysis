Folks,

The IESG is now operating with the policy that application protocols must
mandate implementation of (at least one) strong security mechanism.  In the
case of store-and-forward, MIME-base applications this means choosing
between S/MIME and OpenPGP.  One of them must be mandated for
implementation. (More are, of course, allowed)

These standards have been around for a long time and yet the market has not
yet adopted one.  Hence mandating either of them goes against considerable
real-world market experience -- no matter how much any of us might wish for
a single market choice.

I am hoping there will be some public discussion of this policy and have
written:

  <http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-crocker-mime-security-00.txt>

to prime the discussion pump.  This list seems like the best venue, since
MIME and the issue of general MIME-based security do not have any other list
venue.
