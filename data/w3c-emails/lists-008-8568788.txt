It seems quite reasonable to me that different MIME-based apps would
make different choices here, depending on the assumptions about
relationships between the communicating parties and which trust 
model works best with each.

Then again, if we could standardize a way of generating an X.509 cert
from a PGP key pair, then perhaps it wouldn't be such a big issue
after all.  I suspect the divisiveness is more over the trust model
and the investment in different kinds of keying systems than in
the actual data formats and software. 

Also, the choice between S/MIME or OpenPGP data formats may not
necessarily be sufficient to ensure interoperability - for some
applications it might still be necessary to state some expectations 
about trust relationships.
