perhaps, except for the facts that,

a) they do not currently make those choices based on benefits of one over
the other,

b) there is no clear guidance about the differences between the two that
warrants choosing between them,

c) as I note in the draft, having different working groups make different
choices merely serves to ENSURE continued market fragmentation.

Let's be clear:  my draft is not about the merits of either spec, nor about
the merits of seeking a single standard.  It is about the nasty but
well-established market realities that we face for MIME security.

A standards group that ignores market feedback is engaged in expensive
efforts with no practical benefit.
