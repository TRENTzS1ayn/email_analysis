I can't speak about any of the IETF groups making such choices.  But
I can say there are certainly benefits of each one over the other, 
depending on what you are doing and the kind of deployment (and in 
particular the kinds of trust relationships) you expect.  That doesn't 
mean you can't make either one work for whatever purpose, but for
either choice applying it to some purposes are harder than others.
I think that its the real source of the division.

clear guidance would help.

that's not apparent to me.  maybe it's explained in the draft,
which I haven't read yet.

is there really just one market here?
