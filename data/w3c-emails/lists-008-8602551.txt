This is a common misconception. OpenPGP authentication can be made to 
work in a hierarchical fashion, and PKIX authentication can be made 
to work in a web of trust. There is nothing inherent in either 
authentication mechanism that forces it in one way or another.

Each format's certificates simply say "Person A says that Public Key 
B belongs to Person C". The way that you decide to trust or not trust 
a particular public key is pretty much unstated in OpenPGP and fairly 
obscurely stated for PKIX.

Given the above, I would be hard-pressed to say to a protocol 
designer "based on the way the formats work, you should use this 
format over that one".

Dave is absolutely right: the IETF should pick one for protocols to 
use in IETF standards.
