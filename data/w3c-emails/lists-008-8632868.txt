Whoops, sorry. I took the meaning of your draft to say that you 
wanted the IETF to do something.

OK.

OK. But we disagree about what the market is. The market of protocol 
developers have leaned strongly towards PKIX and away from OpenPGP 
authentication.

Here, we disagree. The IETF can choose one based on what the vendors 
who will have to implement the standard want.

If you mean "email users" as the market, we definitely agree. If you 
mean "the protocols that need to have security", we don't agree.
