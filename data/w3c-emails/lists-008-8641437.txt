Paul,

The "A MODEST PROPOSAL" section suggests four things to do.

Silly me. I keep thinking that markets are defined by customers and users,
not providers. The massive lack of user adoption of either technology is all
that really matters.

I thought we cared more about what users will use than what makes developers
happy.  (I said more. That doesn't mean ignore developers, it means that we
should keep our priorities straight.)

Please review the history of OSI.  It is exactly this philosophy that was
operating for the 15 years of that failed effort.

Again, silly me.  I thought paid attention to use of technology, not just
its implementation.  (There are plenty of other standards groups that do an
excellent job following the philosophy you have described.  And I thought
the IETF had a well-established pattern of using different, and more
pragmatic, criteria.)

Fine.

Please cite the multi-million user open (no pair-wise coordination) market
that has adopted and is using one of these.
