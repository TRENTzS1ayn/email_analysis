I'd certainly like to second Dave's thoughts here but for a different 
reason. Mandating MIME Security IMHO is potentially harmful since the IETF 
has been unable or unwilling to tackle the underlying problem of 
application specific opportunistic key discovery service which could make 
S/MIME or PGP easier to use.

This was the general thrust of the siked BOF in Minneapolis, that as many 
of us remember, did not go well.

Now the Security AD's have permitted a BOF in Atlanta on the narrowly 
scoped problem of IPSEC keys [ ipsedkey ] on Tuesday afternoon.

This is fine .. we all believe that narrowly scoped problem statements lead 
to WG success, tackle the small problems first before the bigger ones. I 
would again suggest the that general problem has not gone away and must 
eventually be addressed.

I submit the two issues are linked.

A number of us have submitted personal ID' touching on the subject.
