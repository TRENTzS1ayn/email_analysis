Folks,

1. The market does not appreciate parenting. It's accepts innovation
quite well, but it rolls right over folks who ignore a market history
of rejection.

2.  This is not about "excellence".  S/Mime and OpenPGP are viewed as
equally competent. (We need to be careful that the discussion does not
devolve into flag waving.)

3. Standards groups that ignore market feedback are standards group
that become irrelevant. (Perhaps folks will note that I seem to be
repeating this point a bit. That's only because it is being ignored...
a lot.)

Filling a void with something new is different from the current
situation. Here we are forcing arbitrary choices between two
alternatives that have both been -- so far, at least -- rejected by
the mass market.

When a working group is creating a new specification and is faced with
alternative design choices, the rule is a good one.

This ain't that. This is a case in which the market has already been
given "several ways of doing the same thing" and it has demonstrated
years of failing to choose one. That is, we did our usual thing. We
"let the market decide" but the market has not (yet) done its job. The
idea that we can arbitrarily do its job for it is not credible.
Certainly not after this much time and certainly not with a policy
that does not, in fact, choose only one.

That was before anything was deployed.

We probably don't want to go down the 'why has IPv6 taken so long'
path, in this thread.

It is a topic that requires beer.

Oh.

No that's not right...

Now I understand the reason for the IPv6 single-malt event at the IETF
meetings...
