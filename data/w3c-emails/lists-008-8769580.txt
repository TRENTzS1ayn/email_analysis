Others that I know who have done informal surveys of "average" computer 
users also state that the complexity of client certificates is the 
reason for low adoption.  Personally, I don't think it is that big of an 
issue.  My own informal survey of "average" computer users didn't even 
get that far:  they either didn't see a need or didn't feel they had a need.

Pardon the ignorance, but is there a deployed hop-to-hop protocol using 
something like TLS?
