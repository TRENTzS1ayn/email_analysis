They won't see the need until some site which stores user passwords in the 
clear is broken and the attackers start breaking into things like bank 
accounts using the principle that most users attempt to have the same 
username/password at every site.

The airline industry didn't see the need reinforced doors for pilots or a 
policy of active opposition to hijackers until after Sep 11.

If you count HTTPS with proxies, then yes.  Otherwise no.

But we do have most of the necessary pieces for SMTP specified and many of 
them implemented.  SMTP STARTTLS is widely implemented and works pretty 
well hop-to-hop.  SMTP AUTH provides a hop-to-hop authentication framework. 
The simplist path to a complete solution depends on the security 
requirements for the layered application, but we could get a deployable 
solution (meaning I could implement it and imagine non-tech friends using 
it) pretty quickly.
