OK .. so IMHO the problem is still how do you make opportunistic key 
management usable across domain boundaries.

CONNEG is a possible way to solve the problem but NAPTR records could do 
the trick as well.

yes please ...

NO ... a standard methodology to find the keys..and the willingness of the 
Security AD's to confront the issue head on ..

I posted a earlier message on the key management issue which may have been 
lost in the shuffle the ID I posted directly dealt with these issues.

Title           : Use of the DDDS System for Cryptographic Key Discovery
                           and Retrieval

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-shockey-ddds-pki-00.txt

Its raw but lays out the basics.

The old siked list is still active and I personally interested in a BAR BOF 
on these issues.. if interested ..please post your interest.
