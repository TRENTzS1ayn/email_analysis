hi,
I am Sampurnananda Mishra,  a new member to the group. I am working on 
GSM AMR Narrow Band Codec. I need the packetised  test vetors  for the 
test streams given in the site of 3gpp. They  have not provided the test 
vectors in the IF1 and IF2 formats. so if any body does have any idea of 
how to get them and from where pls let me know.

                                                       I have already 
written the code for  bitstream packing as specified in the document 
26.101. I need them for verification purposes. So if any one has any 
idea abt that pls let me know.
Regards,
Sampurnananda Mishra,
