>This document defines a new protocol element, the Internationalized
>Resource Identifier (IRI), as a complement to the URI [RFC2396].  An
>IRI is a sequence of characters from the Universal Character Set
>[ISO10646].  A mapping from IRIs to URIs is defined, which means that
>IRIs can be used instead of URIs where appropriate to identify
>resources.
>The approach of defining a new protocol element was chosen, instead
>of extending or changing the definition of URIs, to allow a clear
>distinction and to avoid incompatibilities with existing software.
