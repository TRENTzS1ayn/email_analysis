 SIR/MADAM,

                      STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.


I am pleased to introduce myself  to you.My name is Mr. Wilson Kamela 
a native of South Africa and a senior employee of mines and 
natural resources department currently on a trainning course in Holland for few months.

I  am writing this letter to request your assistance in order to 
redeem an investment with the South African mining Corporation.The 
said investment, now valued at  ($22.5 million dollars) Twenty-two 
 million,five hundred thousand dollars only was purchased by ( Lucio 
Harper ) and contracted out to the South  African Mining Corporation 
in 1977 now recognised as mines and natural resources department.This 
redeemable investment interest,has now matured since March last year.

Since MARCH last year, several attempts have been made to contact 
Lucio Harper without success and there is no way to contact any 
of his close relatives in whose favour the investment cash value 
can be paid.                                                    
                                   
Since we have access to all Lucio Harper's information,we can claim 
this money with the help of my partners with the South African Mines 
and natural resources department.All we have to do is to file claim 
using you as Lucio Harper's relative.

I will like to assure you that there is absolutely nothing to worry 
about,because it is perfectly safe with no risk involved.Please 
ensure to keep this matter strictly confidential.My partner will 
file a claim for this money on your behalf from the South African 
mining Corporation.When the claim is approved,you as the beneficiary 
will be paid (25%) of the total amouth.

Since this money can be paid directly into any bank account of your 
choice,you have responsibility to ensure that my partner and I receive(70%)of 
the total amouth.While the balance (5%) will be set aside for any 
unforseen expenses in the cause of transfering this money.

I will appreciate if you can give your assurance and guarantee that 
our share will be well secured.Please for the sake of confidentiality,reach 
me on my e-mail address:  wilsonkamela@yahoo.ca . And let me 
know if this proposal is acceptable to you.And kindly reach me immediately 
with any of the stated contact addresses so that better clearifications 
relating to the transaction will be explained to you.


Truly yours,

Wilson kamela
