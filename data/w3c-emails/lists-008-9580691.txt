I don't understand the problem the draft is trying to solve. URI
equivalence is defined in RFC 2396 and the scheme registration
documents. URIs have canocical forms that can be compared character
by character. Where is the need to introduce a new URI scheme? What
does a hashed:... URI actually identify?

Editorial:

Appendix A has an example:

[...]
  Original URI: "http://Fred@WWW.Thus.net:0112/Test/index.html"
  Variant N:    "http://Fred@www.thus.net:112/Test/"
  Variant P:    "http://fred@www.thus.net:112/test/"
[...]

These are all invalid, the HTTP URI scheme does not allow user names to
appear in the URI.
