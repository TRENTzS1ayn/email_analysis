Dear ietf-discuss@w3.org,

We are dealing the contact lens mail order business in Japan through
the web-site about 5 and half years. Our major products are disposable,
replacement and color contact lens. All the orders are shipped to our
customers directly from the suppliers. Our monthly sales is over 
US$100,000 per month now. This is our nearest goal and target to reach
US$120,000 within a couple month. Also from January,our big e-commerce 
shop will join us.We have been trading with some suppliers during these period. 
However our order seems beyond their managing capacity and we need more suppliers.
We are looking for the confirmed supplier in settlement, shipping & delivery,claim settlement and financial settlement. We are looking for a more firm supplier who can delivery quickly, supply the competitive price and follow our instructions in our method of shipping. Please contact us if you have any interest to start this business with us.

Thank you


Toshi Fujii
