FROM THE DESK OF:
BARRISTER SAMUEL BASSEY
FAX: 234-1-7596975

MY DEAR FRIEND, 

I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THIS LETTER WILL NOT COME TO YOU AS AN 
EMBARRASSMENT BUT RATHER A SURPRISE SINCE WE NEITHER KNEW EACH OTHER BEFORE NOW NOR HAVE HAD ANY PREVIOUS CORRESPONDENCE OR CONTACT.

I AM BARRISTER SAMUEL BASSEY, LAWYER TO THE ABACHA'S FAMILY. YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD A LOT OF THE CHANGES THAT IS CURRENTLY TAKING PLACE IN NIGERIA SINCE THE DEMISE OF MY CLIENT, THE LATE HEAD OF STATE, GENERAL SANI ABACHA. 

AFTER HIS DEATH, THE ABACHA'S FAMILY WAS FACED WITH A LOT OF PROBLEMS 
FROM BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY. THEY HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING A LOT OF EMBARRASING MOMENTS; THE FAMILY ACCOUNTS ARE BEING FROZEN ALL OVER EUROPE AND AMERICA. 

THE GOVERNMENT HAS SEIZED THEIR PASSPORTS AND THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO 
TRAVEL OUT OF THE COUNTRY. I CANNOT BEGIN TO RECOUNT WHAT THEY HAVE 
LOST SINCE THIS PROBLEM STARTED, BUT IT IS WORTH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT I AM SURE YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF BECUASE IT IS ALL OVER THE 
INTERNATIONAL PRESS. 

HOWEVER, OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, WE HAVE BEEN HOLDING SERIES OF 
FAMILY MEETINGS AND WE HAVE DECIDED TO SALVAGE WHAT WE CAN OUT OF THE MESS. SO, THE FAMILY HAS MANDATED ME TO LOOK FOR A FOREIGN PARTNER THROUGH WHOM WE CAN HIDE SOME FUNDS.

YOU REMUNERATION WILL BE DISCUSSED AND WORKED OUT UPON HEARING FROM YOU INDICATING YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST THEM IN RECIEVING THESE FUNDS FROM THE SECURITY FIRM FOR THE FAMILY UNTIL THEY ARE ABLE TO TRAVEL OUT 
OF THE COUNTRY TO MEET WITH YOU.

THIS MONEY IN QUESTION (US$20M) TWENTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS WAS DEPOSITED WITH A SECURITY FIRM, SHORTLY BEFORE THE DEMISE OF MY 
CLIENT, GENERAL SANI ABACHA, WHO WAS THEN HEAD OF STATE IN NIGERIA.
EVER SINCE THE DEATH OF MY CLIENT, SUBSEQUENT ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE 
EMBARKED ON A VINDICTIVE WITCH-HUNT AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY. 

A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY TRUSTED HAVE TURNED AGAINST THEM, BY AIDING THE 
GOVERNMENT IN CONFISCATING THE FAMILY WEALTH; HENCE, MY REQUEST FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE. THE MONEY IS ALREADY WITH THE SECURITY FIRM IN A CODED SAFE, ONCE YOU INDICATE YOUR INTEREST TO ASSIST THE FAMILY, I WILL GIVE YOU FURTHER DETAILS ON THE BUSINESS IF WE AGREE ON REMUNERATION, AND I WILL ALSO FURNISH YOU WITH DETAILS ON HOW TO COLLECT THE MONEY.

THERE IS NOTHING FOR YOU TO WORRY ABOUT, AS THE MONEY WILL BE RELEASED TO WHOEVER HAS THE SECURITY CODES FOR THE DEPOSIT. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS MAIL IS OUT OF DESPERATION FROM FEAR THAT THE FAMILY MIGHT LOOSE ALL THEY HAVE; SO, THE ABACHA FAMILY IS WILLING TO WORK OUT A VERY GOOD DEAL WITH YOU IF YOU ACCEPT TO HELP.

ALSO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIS TRANSACTION WILL NOT TAKE MORE THAN SEVEN WORKING DAYS TO CONCLUDE ONCE YOU SIGNIFY YOUR FULL INTEREST, AND I 
CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THE NEED FOR TRUST AND CONFIDENTIALITY IN THIS 
BUSINESS. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR URGENT FAVOURABLE RESPONSE.

BEST REGARDS,

BARRISTER SAMUEL BASSEY.
