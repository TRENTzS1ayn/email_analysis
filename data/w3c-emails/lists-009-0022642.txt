Regarding line-break treatment, I agree that it is possible to
write a finite state machine which can usefully interpret
CR, LF, CRLF (but not LFCR) as end-of-line breaks.

I wrote such a program a year or two back to unscramble people's
mistakes with FTP ;)

However, I think this is too much of a burden to add to client
writers.

I'd rather accept the mix of LF or CRLF as line breaks or
treat LF as a line break and CR as white-space. (Both which
coexist with Unix-centric practice.)

(Even though I have a mac on my desk...)

If we were writing a standard from scratch, I'd insist on one
line break.

I think this issue has also wandered past in the HTML working group list
lately, I'm having trouble keeping the two straight  ;)

It would be nice of HTTP and HTML standards agreed on the treatment
of line breaks in text/html....
