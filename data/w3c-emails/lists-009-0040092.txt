Content-Length will only be essentially present when PUT and POST deal with 
pre-existing forms and files.  Doing a PUT or POST with large amounts of 
data created on-the-fly does not lend itself well to use of Content-Length 
as documented better by others than myself on this list.  I really hate to 
restrict the possibilities for future Web applications by making the 
multi-part stuff optional (or leaving it out entirely).

What is so particularly gawky about the multi-part stuff?  From my 
viewpoint, you either have to deal with fragmentation (UDP) or with message 
boundaries (TCP with multi-part messages).  If you have a better idea on 
handling multiple bodies of data, I for one would sure like to hear it.
