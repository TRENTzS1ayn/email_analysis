Current practice is (a) -- it just doesn't work any other way with
existing servers.

Ummm, I think (b) and (c) are confused, but these are reasonable questions.
The problem is that the HTTP spec must define not only origin servers, but
proxies, gateways, and client usage of HTTP as well.  We (as in the authors)
will have to clarify this in the next version.  Perhaps a section on
minimal compliance is called for.
