My words exactly since a boldface font is not available.  Servers are
already facing problems with TCP kernel bugs, and intentionally
dropping connections from the client side would only make things

Yes; even proxies do it (at least both that I've written), and it was
doable even then, although slightly more complex (with all the
combinations of incoming and outbound requests).  But the benefits far
outweigh the complexity.
