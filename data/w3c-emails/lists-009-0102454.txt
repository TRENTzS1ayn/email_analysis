Looking at IMS on a packet by packet basis, in the presence of possibly 
large headers greater than 512 bytes,  having the client  cancel will save
2 packets in the best case, and be no worse in the worst case. I sent 
a message on tis to www-talk during chicago with more analysis. my hands aren't up
to recreating it at the moment, and I think the message dissapeared 
in transit. i'll see if i can find it again.

Well, did you monitor the impact on the server's TCP kernel when that
is constantly happening?  Basically what you're suggesting is very
ugly anyway, and I don't like it one bit even if it wasn't expensive
for the network.  Gee, it's a few lines of code to do it cleanly.
It's like smashing your car on a signpost because you don't feel like
hitting the brakes.
