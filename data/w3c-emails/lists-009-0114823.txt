Good luck.  Given that a typical IMS request message is

     64 bytes + length(URL) + user-agent (if any)

and a 304 Not Modified response is typically 98 bytes, I haven't got a
clue as to how you could come up with such figures.

That means (aside from the connection packets) one packet for the request
and one for the response.  In contrast, a normal request will generally 
buffer 16 packets before the client even has a chance to read the response --
cancelling at that point is useless.
