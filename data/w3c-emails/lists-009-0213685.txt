Subject: Hypertext Version ready of HTTP Spec



I have just installed a HTML version of the spec. It is available at

http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/Overview.html

It is generated using WEBmaker, but some of the alignments are not
perfect. This would not have been a problem if more clients support
tables ;-)

- -- cheers --

Henrik

PS: Sorry for not beeing very active right now on the many questions. I
have been extremely busy preparing a code release before I go to San
Jose tomorrow morning. I have already promissed Roy a beer overthere.
