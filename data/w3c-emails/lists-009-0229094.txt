A FTP server only does this if the user requests ASCII mode. And then, it
is doing it for a single file transfer. Not every single transfer of the
same text file for every user request. FTP servers also handle many orders
of magnitude FEWER requests per hour than a Web server on the same host.
FTP servers can afford to waste a little time as they are typically batch
oriented file transfer processes with no user interface to speak of. HTTP
servers are part of a real-time interactive system where long transfer
times and unnecessary delays are unacceptable.

Have you ever tried using a set of Web pages being served by a FTP server?
I think you'll understand why HTTP was developed as a more efficient
alternative. Simply making HTTP as inefficient as FTP defeats its entire
purpose.
