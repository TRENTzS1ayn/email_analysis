Two (hopefully) simple questions:

1. In a HEAD response, what should Content-Length be set to?  The
   length of the (non-existent) object body, or 0?

2. Is there a view on how locally-time-stamped data should have their
   Last-Modified GMT computed?  It's impractical to recreate the
   true original GMT time-stamp (as the timezone and daylight savings
   regime of the place of last modification is usually unknown).  Using
   the current GMT offset will result in the timestamp of some data
   jumping forwards or backwards an hour, twice a year, which could
   affect caching.
