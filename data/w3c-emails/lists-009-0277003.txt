The 401 code is not tied to the basic  AA scheme. The WWW-Authenticate and WWW-Authorization
headers both are defined to contain extension tokens. HOwever, if you are sure that the 
server is not going to send the object to the client and the client shouldn't try again
then the right code to use is `403 Forbidden'. If using the basic AA the server should repeat
sending back a 401 code following the current spec.

Though the server can switch to a 403 code if multiple attempts have been tried, but this 
requires that the server keeps state of the connections whic his outside the scope of the
spec.
