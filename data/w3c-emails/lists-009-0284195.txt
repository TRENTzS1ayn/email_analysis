The length of the object-body that would have been returned had

There are many views as to how this should be done, but none of them
are within the realm of the HTTP protocol.  All that matters is that
the date used within the protocol is GMT (UT).  How the date is obtained
(and, in fact, what it means to be "modified") is entirely up to the
application sending the object.
