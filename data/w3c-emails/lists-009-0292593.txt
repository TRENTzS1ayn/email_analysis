This is not very clear in the description of the Content-Length field
that it describes the length of the object referenced by the URI,
which may or may not be present in the message.  Maybe HEAD should
return the description of the object as the object body of the message
so such ambiguities and overloading dont occur.

Doesnt the lack of a clear meaning of modification make this almost '
useless, except maybe for a matched pair of client and server that
have a common meaning.  It needs to reflect that either the content
as returned is different then previous to the date.  I could also 
reflect metainformation change, such as expiration updated.  But, I
think that is a little too nebulous.

Either way, some agreed meaning needs to be assigned to modified.
