As dynamic objects don't have a default Content-Length the right thing
to do would be not to send the header field at all. This is one of the
the reasons why the field can not be mandatory.

Ohh - this would screw up a lot of cache managers which use the LM
(which is the previously returned value) if the expired header is not
present. They don't like to get a future last modified date!
I would not recommend this at all!
