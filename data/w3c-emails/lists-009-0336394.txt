Neither of the words `modified', `different', and `change' do define
what is actually meant by this field. And this is how it should be! It
does _not_ make it useless but merely take away the binding to the
date and time typically given by the file system. As somebody (sorry,
but I don't remember who) pointed out, a document can be generated
automatically on every request, however, this doesn't necessarily
indicate that the LM field should change value.
