I will clarify the description of HEAD.  The latter suggestion, though
appealing  from a design point of view, is outside the scope of HTTP/1.0.

Well, there is an implied meaning as given by the name (i.e. when the
object was last modified).  What is not defined is how much (or how little)
modification needs to occur, and why.  All that matters is that the origin
server thinks that the object was last modified at the given time -- the
client is trusting that the server knows what it is talking about.

Perhaps we could define it in terms of how it is used, i.e.
"If you have a copy of this object which is older than the given LM date,
 that copy should now be considered stale."

Maybe.
