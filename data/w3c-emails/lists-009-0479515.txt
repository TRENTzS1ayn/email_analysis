Um. Please define "canonical text form". There are far too many
encodings for this to to exist. MPEG and GIF are shipped as a sequence
of bytes.

My proposal for dealing with this in HTTP is to have a seperate field
for charset negotiation, and to ship Unicode (UTF) (marked up with
some languages/presentational tags that are autogenerated) as the
"canonical" form into which everything can be converted into and from.
My proposal also allows clients to send any other commonly understood
charset (or rather encoding/charset pair, though MIME messed these two
together... another area where "it's broke"). If MIME does not allow
this, it is hopelessly broken, and doomed to be changed at some point
in the future. Hence, this CRLF issue should just be ignored as
"impractical".
