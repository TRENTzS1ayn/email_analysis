Concerning the many remarks about EOL encoding, here's a possible
(somewhat ugly) solution:  clients can specify a header Accept-EOL
with values like CR, LF, CRLF.  The default would be
Accept-EOL: CR;LF;CRLF

A permissive client could specify all three encodings (the default),
which would take the server off the hook for doing the transformation.
However, if a Unix server (with EOL == LF) got only an Accept-Encoding:
CR from the client, it would be obliged to do the translation, ugly
though that might be.  But at least this way the client says what it
allows, and the server knows both what is expected and what it has (I
presume).
