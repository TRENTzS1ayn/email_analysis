> Um. Please define "canonical text form".

I have already done so several times.  The canonical form for text is defined
in RFC 1521 (which just cites 822, of course) as CRLF delimited for US-ASCII
or ASCII-like things like 8859-1.  I do not know of a single Internet standard
protocol that does not employ this representation; let me know if you know
of one.

If you want to say that using this form is unneeded, OK, but please don't
say there isn't one.

Unicode, of course, is newer and doesn't have decades of developing canonical
forms behind it, so things are less clear for such cases.  But we weren't
talking about Unicode, though obviously we don't want a solution that could
screw things up for it in the future.

Sounds interesting as a long-range approach, though I don't think it sounds
simple enough to just drop into place.
