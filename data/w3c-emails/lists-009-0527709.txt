Our text, which art in transit,
Hallowed be thy representation,
Thy bytes arrive, in order derived,
rom earth, not the RFC's

Your "canonical" text representation does not work for at least half
the world's languages, and for more than half of the world's
population. DOn't you think it's somewhat "inconsiderate" to force
these people to use non-standard kludges because people 10 years ago
had no idea at all about language encodings?
