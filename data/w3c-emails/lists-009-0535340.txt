The MIME standard does refer back a lot to RFC822 for text...

But the more I read these specs together, the more I seem to be
convincing myself that HTTP is not MIME, as the older spec
I quoted earlier suggests, but "MIME-like" as the recent draft says.

(Sort of a "Son of MIME" or "MIME meets Mozilla" ;)

We _are_ using a bunch of headers and the MIME/Internet media types
but the message structure is rather freely interpreted.

This leads me to some different thoughts:

- We should omit MIME Version headers, since the body returned
isn't really MIME-conforming.

- We should put off multipart types to HTTP-NG or some such
because 1) they aren't current practice 2) their syntax is
complex and may be sensitive to what we do with EOL.

We still need to agree what to advocate for for treatment of EOL
but it may be easier to explain if it's not MIME...
