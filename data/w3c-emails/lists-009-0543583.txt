Of course; it's a canonical form only for some things, which happen to be
ones that account for the vast majority of current usage (though that will
probably not remain the situation forever.)  It's a canonical representation
for ASCII and ASCII-like text; it says nothing about how one should represent
non-ASCII-like text.  Or GIFs or MPEGs.  Those things can be defined by others.

HTTP is for transferring objects; I think it's way beyond the scope of 
the HTTP spec to standardize an international character encoding.  HTTP
should be designed to that whatever method is desired can be dropped in
and used.  In the long run maybe one method will be a clear victor.  Or
maybe not.  Certainly not today.

Can you be more specific about what you are trying to say?  How exactly
should an ideal HTTP server send a document that is in plain, unformatted
US-ASCII text?  Using Unicode?
