RFC 1521, Section 4:

     content  :=   "Content-Type"  ":"  type  "/"  subtype  *(";"
     parameter)
               ; case-insensitive matching of type and subtype

     type :=          "application"     / "audio"
               / "image"           / "message"
               / "multipart"  / "text"
               / "video"           / extension-token
               ; All values case-insensitive

     extension-token :=  x-token / iana-token

     iana-token := <a publicly-defined extension token,
               registered with IANA, as specified in
               appendix E>

     x-token := <The two characters "X-" or "x-" followed, with
                 no intervening white space, by any token>

A BNF defines how a conforming application should *parse* the input.
RFC 1521 specifies that the parser should declare a syntax error if the
MIME type is not registered with IANA.  RFC 1590 only changed the registration
procedure -- it did not change the MIME requirements.  Naturally, no mail
application I know of is stupid enough to implement this requirement --
they generally just check the ~/.mailcap for any token/token types.

HTTP doesn't care what the actual content-type is of the object-body.
All it cares about is that the Content-Type header can be parsed, and thus
it gives the only valid parsing rule possible for HTTP.

It already mentions these issues and includes explicit reference to how
media types are registered.  I will attempt to elaborate on the finer details,
but the decision HAS been made that HTTP is not a MIME-conformant application.
