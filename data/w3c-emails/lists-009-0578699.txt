I think I see what you're saying now; I see it as a normal distinction
between spec (which is tight) and practice (where an implementation is
welcome, even encouraged, to accept a larger set of potential inputs
than the grammar specifies if such can be done cheaply and without
introducing ambiguity or other such problems.)

But, if you really think it belongs in the grammar, OK.  I just
instinctively shy away from creating new grammars unless it's
absolutely necessary; goodness knows there are enough of them in the
world.

Well, the issue I take is with the statement that HTTP should be
"allowed more freedom in the use of non-registered types."  I believe
one way to interpret this is "use whatever non-registered types you
want, as long as it's HTTP and not email that's no problem," and I'm
not sure that is what was meant.
