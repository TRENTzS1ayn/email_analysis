I'm not sure what you're suggesting here.

I can see that real world nasty problems require real world nasty
solutions.

But as far as a spec, shouldn't we use the categorical imperative?
i.e. what if everybody did that?

If everybody customized their documents on a per-user-agent basis, and
caching proxies don't take the User-Agent: header into account in
their cache keys, then things will be broken.

The question is: where do we assign the fault?

If we say that the proxy was broken for not using User-Agent as a
cache key, then we're saying that cached objects can never be shared
accross clients with different user agents. I don't think we want
that.

So I'm suggesting that serving up different documents for different
User-Agents should be a protocol violation.

A spec tells you what happens when everybody plays by the rules. When
there are bugs, all bets are off, and you do what you must.
