I've had to do this too.  "In an ideal world" blah blah blah.... what 
matters is that when people say "you'll pry MacMosaic 1.0.3 from my cold 
dead fingers", well, you have to shoot them.

Mitra and I use it to atone for bugs, er, "incomplete implementations".  
Once we have HTML and HTTP standards, and a "www-user-agent" standard, 
and people *stuck* to them when calling their browsers "WWW Browser Level 
N", *and* we have servers that do format and protocol negotiation 
correctly, we won't need to look at the User-Agent.  That's a hell of a 
long list, one we're all striving to achieve but won't get there for awhile.
If use of User-Agent is mentioned in any spec, let it be allowed for use 
in accounting for incomplete implementations - serving out semantically 
different documents should be the discouraged action.

Proxies *must* be nearly invisible.  A proxy accessing a server must look
just like a client accessing a server.  A client accessing a proxy must
look just like a client accessing a server.  If this is not a design goal
of proxies, they will never become as ubiquitous as they need to be to
allow the net to scale correctly. 

Obviously there needs to be some way for the server to communicate bck to 
the proxy "this response is particular for *this* and *this* and *this* 
parameter, but this response is constant for all other parameters." How 
the server determines this from the way the documents are created is up 
to the server and server maintainer, not an issue for HTTP.  A  
header could be returned in the response:

Cache-Key: User-Agent = WinMosaic

which contains qualifications on various headers for caching.

The suggestion above could be used for more than just User-Agent.
