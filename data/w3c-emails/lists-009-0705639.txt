What I'm suggesting is that competent production people will work with
whatever the real world users have their.  Incompetent production people
will assume a perfect world where everyone has infinite bandwidth, and
bug-free clients.

What I'm suggesting is that the statement

is unreasonable given the lack of a perfect world.

Now - if we had URCs and version control .... then clients could return
explicitly different URLs for different browsers, and have the caches do
the right thing, but I'm probably dreaming.

If everyone did that, then more documents would display reasonably on more
browsers, but caching would be much harder.  I'll gamble on upgrading poor
caches more than I'll gamble on upgrading poor clients, because there are a
couple of orders of magnitude fewer.

Assigning the fault doesnt help - once the bad clients are out there, it
does a production group no good at all if they assume they dont exist.

Just an idea ..... Allow for a User-Agent field in the mime header of the
returned document. If a server wants to recognise the User-Agent field,
then it should return a User-Agent field to say this document is only valid
for that User-Agent.

And I'm saying that when the clients dont play by the rules, then the
servers cant. So this particular rule should be modified.
