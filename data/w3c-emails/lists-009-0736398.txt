Haven't you left out the possibility that the proxy<->server protocol
might be differentt than the client<->server or client<->proxy
protocol? In particular, servers that support variants need not report
the variants back if they're being queried by an end-user agent, but
might if they're being queried by a caching server. After all, we did
this for if-modified-since...
