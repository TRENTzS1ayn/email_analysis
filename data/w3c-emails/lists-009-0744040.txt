What matters is whether or not the client (user agent or proxy) has
a shared cache.  There is no way for the server to know that, though it
could be added to the protocol.  However, I think information on variants
may be as useful to a user-agent as it is to a cache manager.

No, we didn't.  If-modified-since is also used by user agents (like Netscape).
