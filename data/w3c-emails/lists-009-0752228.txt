Netscape doesn't have a 'shared cache' in the sense that user agents
with different capabilities share the same cache.

Yes, you're right, it is more precise to suggest that the behavior of
a HTTP agent that caches documents for other HTTP agents should ask
for more complete information than a HTTP agent that is only asking
for itself.
