One paragraph summary of the HTTP-BOF, held Wednesday 7-Dec-94
at the 31st IETF meeting, San Jose. Chaired by Dave Raggett
<dsr@w3.org> +44 272 228046

I tried to send this out from the IETF meeting, but somehow
it screwed up ...

The full minutes will follow soon.

The HTTP-BOF was held to assess the need to set up a working
group for the World Wide Web hypertext transfer protocol.
The suggested goals are to document current practise for
HTTP 1.0 as a standards track RFC; to elicit needs for
extensions to HTTP and to develop standards for these.
Roy Fielding and Henrik Frystyk Nielsen reviewed the Internet
Draft for HTTP 1.0 and suggested extensions for 1.1. This was
followed by vigorous discussions on ideas for keeping connections
open and related ideas. Recent work on HTTPng was reported
by Simon Spero. This work adds a session layer to tcp and uses
ASN.1 and PER for message encoding. Under congested conditions
Simon reported dramatic improvements in performance. The BOF
ended by recommending setting up a working group.
