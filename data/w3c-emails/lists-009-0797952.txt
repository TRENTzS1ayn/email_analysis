Oops! I pasted the wrong URL! That should be:

http://gummo.stanford.edu/html/hypermail/www-talk-1994q1.messages/955.html

Also, I've updated my caching formal model draft to put the onus
on original servers to advertise variants.

Please see "An Example Scenario" in:

I still need to write up an example of the case where there are
variant representations and the proxy server is smart enough to be
able to cache them...
