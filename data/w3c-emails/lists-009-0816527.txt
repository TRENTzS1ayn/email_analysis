The language parameter should not be part of the spec. This assumes
that a single document will contain a single language. In addition, I
tend to think that any information that is available in multiple
languages, will probably be stored as seperate files (or "documents"),
and hence, would have different URI's. I do not think decisions can
reasonably be made automatically at the protocol level. They are
rather, a navigational problem (and this might also be better handled
at the markup level via the LANG element).
