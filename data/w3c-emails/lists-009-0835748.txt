No it doesn't. The Content-Language header has explicitly been defined
so that multiple natural languages can be specified. The
Accept-Language header can also contain a list of languages which also
covers multi-linguistic documents.

This is exactly what we want to avoid ;-)

If you already have the document and actually parsed it in order to find
the <LANG> element, then there is no idea in the language negotiation
at all. It must be done at the protocol layer.
