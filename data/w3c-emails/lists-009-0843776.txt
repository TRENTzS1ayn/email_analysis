I would be very sad if we decide on taking it out. I have great plans
of implementing it in the next release of the Library. Imagine the
possibilities it gives when used in the line mode browser:

www -language dk

It is definitely needed in this version of HTTP!

You can have a list of multiple languages in the Content-Language for a
multi-linguistic document - or an audio file etc.

There are arguments for both views. If you have a dedicated client for
only a few content-types then you are not interested in anything you
don't ask for. However, general WWW clients might be able to handle
most formats so here it doesn't really matter.

This _is_ current practice but the server _must_ have the possibility
of not sending the object, that is "406 None Acceptable", as the client
very easy can specify that it accepts all formats by using "Accept: */*"

In theory this is a good idea, but in practice it will never be
possible to standardize the quality factor in terms of absolute values
as the client does not know the server values. The q factores are only
valid as long as they are relative to each other.
