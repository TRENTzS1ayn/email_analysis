One thing to consider (not that i think this is a bad idea) is that often
the objects being sent along are images leading to two non-optimisations.

1) Mime encoding is going to roughly double the number of bytes sent
2) By explicitly sending them every time, the server wont allow the client
to cache the images, so for example the stupid blue ball for a "bullet"
will get send a zillion times.
