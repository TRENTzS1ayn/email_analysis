Hmmm, I don't necessarily support this -- this wastes bandwidth.
Besides, the set of available versions may vary, so the proxy can
never be sure if it has all the presentations/knowledge of them
without going to the original server.

That's why:

Yes!  If it doesn't find a perfect match locally it goes to the
remote.  It may be that the remote tells to use the local copy, which
is ok, and still saves a lot of bandwidth.

Definitely.

No; the list can't be guaranteed to be exhaustive after some period of
time.  Rather than futher complicating things with life times for this
information, have the proxy connect to remote every time in these
cases to make a check.

Mmmmm (the way Marge Simpson sez it).

Jackpot. Me too.
