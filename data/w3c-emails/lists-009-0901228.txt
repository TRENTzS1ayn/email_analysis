    2) By explicitly sending them every time, the server wont allow the client
    to cache the images, so for example the stupid blue ball for a "bullet"
    will get send a zillion times.
    
This is why in our experiments we added a GETLIST method, so that the
client can explicitly request those images that it needs.  We also
had a GETALL method ("give me the HTML and all the inlined images")
but we had to do some tricky heuristics to decide when it was better
to use this than to do a GET followed by a GETLIST.

GETLIST, of course, can also be used to retrieve a set of HTML files,
not just a set of images.  And we actually implemented it as a series
of GETS stuffed into the same pipe, rather than as a new method.
