I agree. But I didn't say the server should or must; just that it may.

The only thing that it _must_ do is issue _some_ URI: header with 
a vary parameter if it's got variants. That's enough to prevent
proxies from jumping to conclusions.

If the server gives an Expires: header, the proxy can conclude that
the variants are stable until then. Otherwise, the usual hueristics
apply.
