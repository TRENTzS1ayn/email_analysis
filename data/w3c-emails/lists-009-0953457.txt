Ok, very good.

Not necessarily -- take a Stephen King book "Killer Web".  It's first
published in English and put online.  It's static data and practically
never expires.  A month later they publish it in Finnish, and a month
after that in French.  This still shouldn't impose that the English
version expires once a month.  And you can't know of the translation
schedules beforehand in the first place anyway.

Ok, so King probably would make this interactive book in which the
plot changes as a function of time, number of people killed, and
whether IT really died in part two...
