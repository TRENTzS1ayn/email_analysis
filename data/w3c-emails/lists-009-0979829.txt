Yeah!  Other than the fact that MIME existed as did tools for processing,
I have never understood why an 8bit clean protocol like TCP/IP is
cluttered with the syntax of mail/MIME (a comment was made at the IETF
that MIME semantics for multiple part content with a new binary syntax
might make sense).

I haven't had time to read any drafts on HTTP-ng yet but I'm hoping that
the binary encoding I hear mentioned deals with eliminating 
(minimizing) ascill headers by using nice terse binary structures.
