I think we went through this with HTML; one might have said (many did)
that:

"... HTML files are (as the recent spec suggests) SGML-like, not SGML
conforming. With so many other deviations from SGML...."
  
I think the original *intent* was to be MIME conforming, and that it
isn't *hard* to be MIME-conforming, and that there are *benefits* to
being MIME-conforming.

Now, we have to be careful to define what we mean by MIME-conforming,
and, in particular, we may well want to register some new MIME-types
or content-transfer-encodings. 

The EOL convention issue is not a 'HTTP' issue but centers around
whether "text/html" is allowed to be more flexible about EOL
convention when transport in binary form than other text forms.

MIME is not basically a text-based protocol, any more than HTTP is.
