Actually, it should be easy to find the boundary if we make content-length a
required field.  Since it's easy to tell where the content starts, you know
that any sequence of bytes before you've reached content-length isn't a real
boundary.  (For that matter, you could probably make due without a boundary
at all, by assuming that the next item began immediately after the first.)
