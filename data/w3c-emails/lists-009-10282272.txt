Please can you let me have your input for agenda items for the Dallas IETF
meeting as a matter of urgency.  So far I am intending to devote most
of the time to discussing HTTP 1.1.  I would also like to include a status
report on HTTPng and plans to revise the Digest Access Authentication scheme.

It has been suggested that a single two hour slot on Monday morning won't
be sufficient.  There is a possibility of some additional time on Monday
evening, but we need to pin down the agenda needs quickly if we are to be
granted this additional time.
