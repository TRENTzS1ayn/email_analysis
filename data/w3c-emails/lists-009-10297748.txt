Argee with one exeption:
Koen's modelling does not contain Accept-Language, which will be important
in future, adding some bytes to headers.
Currently only Lynx (2.4.2) supports Accept-Language from browsers which I use.
(I not tested the latest Mosaic for Linux, I not support ELF executables yet.)
Lynx adds 
Accept-Language: en; q=1
Accept-Language: *; q=0.1
which should be folded as:
Accept-Language: en; q=1, *; q=0.1
but really I want to see
Accept-Language: hu; q=1, en; q=0.75, ru; q=0.5, de;q=0.25
(60 bytes, including CRLF)
but unfortunately Lynx doesn't support that. (NOTE: I don't know, what is
the proper language tag for russian, I assumed "ru" but it is only a (bad) guess.)
Others may have a significantly longer list of languages.
While browsers and servers have only minimal support for Accept-Language, we
shouldn't expect too much URIs having variants in many languages, but I expect
more and more in the future. If a software vendor supports multiple languages 
in its products, it will be willing to run a multi-language web server.

Agree.

Agree.
