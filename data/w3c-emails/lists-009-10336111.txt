<Rest of Shel's message cut>

I'd like to second the addition of state management.  Our initial development
plans for sessions (or state) included support of Netscape's cookie, however
I've been informed by someone who watches www-talk much more closely than I do,
that there is some debate over whether the Netscape implementation is the way
it should be handled.

If the group can come to some agreement on how sessions and states should be
handled, we'll implement it (on the server side) early '96.
