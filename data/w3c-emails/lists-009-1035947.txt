Correct me if I am wrong, but I concluded from Spero's postings that
nothing currently proposed including MGET, hold-open, or even HTTP-NG
would improve (or even match?) the user's perceived performance
currently given by Netscape.  By this I mean the ellapsed time until
the user can start reading *all the text* and the ellapsed time until
the user can jump to a new link.

It seems to me that this "user's perceived performance" or UPP is going
to be the dominant consideration for commercial client developers.  If
they can't match Netscape they simply won't be viable.  Accordingly I
strongly suspect that in six months all the major vendors will be doing
what Netscape is doing today.  I don't see that they really have a choice.

And I don't see this as really bad.  I know the Netscape technique will
put a heavier load on network bandwidth, and maybe will stress some 
servers.  As Spero pointed out there are many aborted connections as
users jump to a new document without waiting for the current one to
completely download.  But all that is the price we pay for quality service
(from the user's point of view).

I guess the bottom line is that there is not much point in changing
HTTP unless the resulting protocol can (1) at least match the Netscape
UPP, and (2) simultaneously significantly improve network efficiency.
