I certainly agree that state-info should be in there, and I _very_ strongly
agree that Dave Kristol's proposal is a far superior implementation to
cookies.  Most of my complaints with the cookie proposal have to do with
privacy, which has been discussed at length on www-talk.  A number of
cookie implementations have had serious privacy problems; and I have yet to
see an implementation that gives the user any clue as to what the hell it's
doing.

Since Dave's proposal makes very reasonable efforts to reduce no-caching,
and since the whole proposal makes session-munged URLs unnecessary, this
issue falls well within the scope of Shel's closing statement:

That would be great.  Any server supporting CGI can be made to use
State-info through scripts, so if clients start recognizing it, the rest of
the implementation can be done pretty quickly.
