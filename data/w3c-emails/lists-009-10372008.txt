See <URL:http://www.research.att.com/~dmk/session.html>.  Past discussion
is scattered throughout the http-wg mailing list archives
<URL:http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/> and various www-* lists.  I
think Dave has done a good job of summarizing the issues in his draft --
reading the mailing list archives might be more trouble than it's worth.
