Dave's proposal does nothing to solve the privacy issues that
cookies bring up.  But it does significantly reduce the capibilities.
In fact, it reduces the capibilities such that it is nearly
unusable for large scale applications such as online shopping.
A simple session ID requires the server to hold all the state
information.  This leads to the need for large database lookup's
and distributed database problems.
