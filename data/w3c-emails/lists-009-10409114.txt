The State-Info proposal is not the session ID proposal.  The purpose of
State-Info is for the client and server to exchange stateful session
information, very much like cookies.  In particular, the point is to
avoid requiring the server to keep any state.

I've been waiting for Netscape to submit their Cookie scheme for
