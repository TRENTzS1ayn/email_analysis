Just a clarification.  HTTP is *not* going to use a language tag that
is different than that defined by RFC 1766 (or it successors).  Any change
proposed must first be made to that document, and that should be done
within the MAILEXT WG (or through discussion with Harald, the author).

It is not a topic for discussion within the HTTP WG.
