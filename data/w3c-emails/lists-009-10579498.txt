So because there were a mere 70 lines document (headers dropped)
written in 1993 (Rfc1544 (hmm, reissued with almost no changes as
rfc1864 very recently)) *suggesting* the use of a *specific*
algorithm, for Email should imply that world stopped and that for a
new proposed protocol (http/1.1) you have to use the same buggy
specific definition ? No evolution possible ? No new ideas/fixes ever
allowed ?
And you make htpp/1.2 when MD6 or something else pops out ?

Why not using Accept-Gif: Accept-jpeg:,... headers ? would be
easier...
