Short specs are better than long ones, and stable standards are better
than those which change frequently.  No bugs in that.

No.  If you read the HTTP specifications, you will notice that the version
number is not changed for additional message components which only add
to extensible field values.  You will also notice that Entity-Header is
an extensible field, and thus anyone may add Content-Fred at any time
without changing the standard.

Using separate header fields for the *same* algorithm is a different matter.
