The I-S-nnn approach is fully consistent with the current RFC
1766. Is a revision of the RFC justified, only to save 2 bytes?

Does the MAILEXT WG still exist? The latest minutes seems to be
mailext-minutes-95apr.txt, which says:

: The working group should conclude its work by the Stockholm IETF. (Note:
: the Area Directors would like to see the group conclude its work prior
: to the IETF.)

How can one in general find out which IETF WGs are not yet
disbanded? Is there any always up-to-date database covering WGs?
Is dissolution of WGs always announced on the ietf-announce
list, with some unique substring in the Subject header?
