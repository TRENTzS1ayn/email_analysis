I have two additions to the list:

- Accurate statistics in spite of caching: schemes to let proxies
communicate hit counts and other statistics for cached resources to
the origin servers.

- Request-id (which is different from the State-Info proposal by Dave
Kristol).  Request-ID would be an optional header (or optional part of
the From header in some variants), send by clients, to allow accurate
clicktrail analysis on server logs, even if the clients are behind
proxies or firewalls.  I don't care much for this idea myself, but I
can't recall that we reached consensus in this discussion. (We did
reach consensus on the need for Request-id and State-Info to be two
separate mechanisms.)

These things were discussed extensively on www-talk in July, for
example in the `3 Proposals: session ID, business-card auth, customer
auth' thread.

Koen.
