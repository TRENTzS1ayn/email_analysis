Besides, hopefully this "extremely large shopping site" will be sufficiently
funded and motivated to build a shopping cart Java applet which will store
everything in a client-side database so none of this information needs to get
transmitted over the wire more than twice (once at browse-time, once at
order-time) and there's no limit to what can go in your shopping cart.  Oh,
the Java applet API doesn't have persistant object support - oops!  Big
mistake there.  Hopefully the API v2 will fix that...
