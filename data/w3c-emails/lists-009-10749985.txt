There is a Content-MD5 RFC in common use already.

On the other hand, it seems clunky to have the hash mechanism specified
in the header, as opposed to having a key/value list in a single
"Content-Hash" header.  Years ago I started putting Snefru hashes on all
my posts to comp.sources.unix.  When that was upgraded to MD5 (after
weaknesses in basic Snefru were found), it didn't feel right.

Sorry to be so indefinite, but speaking as an implementor "it just didn't
feel right" should carry some weight.
