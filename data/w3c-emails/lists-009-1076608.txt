The fastest way to get all the text is to send it first but it can't be
displaye until layout information like the size and shape of all images is 
known.  This is the point of the Netscape multiple connections.  They get
the first few bits of each image which contain the size information.

rom the *user's* perspective this would be *much slower*.  The user 
couldn't read past the first image or jump to another link until everything
has been downloaded.
