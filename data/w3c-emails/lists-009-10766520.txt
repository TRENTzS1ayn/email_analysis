I would like to request that we have a well-defined 30 minute
discussion on content negotiation in the context of whether there is
possibly a generic content negotiation mechanism that will work for
mail agents as well as HTTP.  This is in lieu of a separate BOF on the
the topic. Since content negotation is part of HTTP 1.1, we could make
it part of the HTTP 1.1 review.

While HTTP 1.1 introduces content negotiation, it is a capability that
is also needed in the mail community, and involving the other
constituencies for this discussion is a good idea.

You say:

Do you have a room/time assigned for Monday evening? It may still
possible to schedule a BOF Monday evening specifically on the topic.
