I do think it is broken.  I exchanged a half-dozen messages with the
authors.  The history of this particular RFC is a little funny; it went
through a long revision time because it was worded badly.  Content-MD5
has been around for years, the fact that the RFC is just now coming out
is funny timing.  The phrase "years of compliant behavior" was quoted
to me by Mr. Gardiner.

Just as HTTP as extension headers, so does IETF email.  Just as HTTP
is free to accept Content-MD5, the email-wg is free to accept any improved
header that we come up with here.

Yes.  Has either "side" made a strong commitment to convergence?

I disagree.  MD5 is routinely used in production RPC systems all the time.
I expect that for some time most hashes (and signings) will be done off-line
where speed is not an issue, and also verified while the document is being
displayed where, again, speed is not an issue.
