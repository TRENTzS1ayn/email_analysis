Perhaps.  But by now we have all had extensive experience with Netscape
and while there have been numerous theoretical objections to multiple
connections I don't think servers have collapsed under the load.  I suspect
that most providers will simply see the increased load (and I don't think
we really know how much it is increased) as the price of supplying a
better product (from the consumer's point of view).

As for the TCP slow start problem, I don't understand why a single
slow start ala HTTP-NG is better for the UPP (user's perceived
performance) than multiple slow starts in parallel ala Netscape.

Even if HTTPng will win over multiple connections, I think it will have
to be a dramatic win before client vendors will completely switch.

Could you give a reference?  Thanks.
