Can you  guys stop squabbling about history? If there is really
grounds for adding 

content-digest: MD5:xxxxxx

as an alternative for

       content-MD5: xxxxxxxxx

so as to allow for 

       content-digest: SHA:yyyyyy

and other hash algorithms, because these are needed both by HTTP and
by mail, we could get this through as an experimental RFC and make
progress here. The draft should be reviewed by both mailext and by
http-wg.

Don't you agree that this would be a Good Thing?
