Not when its relevant to the task at hand. There is an important point to be
made here about the IETF's attitude towards having multiple conflicting
standards for doing the same thing. You may not think it is important, but I
do.

Larry, this is exactly the point I have been trying to make, apparently with no
success whatsoever. No, I do not think this is a good thing. I think it is a
very bad thing. I want one scheme for both mail and HTTP and news and for
whatever else comes along that uses MIME. I don't want two or three or four or
five, not even one that's a standard and one or more that are experimental. Its
just make-work for everyone to have to support all the variants.

If Content-MD5 is busted then fine, let's move it to historical ASAP and define
something new. I never liked it much anyway. But if it isn't busted then let's
simply use it and be done with it. Either of these options is fine with me.
Having an ever-growing list of headers and algorithms and syntaxes that perform
identical functions is not.

Ned
