Agree.  It certainly does seem that most of the performance improvements
made by HTTP-NG could also be made in HTTP-TOS, with a simple modification
to allow multiple objects to be retrieved/posted over a single TCP/IP
connection.

Are we really willing to switch to something totally different and
incompatible, just to eke that last 10% speed improvement?  I'm skeptical.
