I doubt this is an adequate reason, but let me identify an issue.  (BTW,
I take no position regarding Content-Digest vs. Content-XYZ for XYZ in
{MD5, SHA, ...}.)

If there's more than one digest header, we have to define what it means
if a message contains more than one, and they disagree about the
integrity of the message.  Example:

I have headers
Content-MD5: xyz
Content-SHA: qrs

The recipient computes the digests of the message and finds that the MD5
digest matches xyz, but the SHA digest does not match qrs.  Now what?
I imagine we assume the integrity to be compromised.

With a single Content-Digest header, there's no ambiguity.
