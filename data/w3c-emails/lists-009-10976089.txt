Ahem, the mecanism I suggested does not state you have only one
algorithm key pair, you can have one or more (maybe that's not a good
thing, and can be changed,... but..)
In your example it would be "Content-Digest: MD5=xyz SHA=qrs" {or
maybe with added ";"} and as you suggested if they disagree you can
probably deduce there is a problem. So in this respects there are no
differences.
