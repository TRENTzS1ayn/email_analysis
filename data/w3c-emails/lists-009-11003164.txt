This doesn't seem to be a blocking problem. I have experienced this
solution with 1alpha3 API, and it seems doable, although the stuff
you'll find at ftp://koala.inria.fr/pub/abs/java/sb.tgz works just
enough to say this ;-) 

BTW: the nicest thing about this scheme is that you don't need any
more proxy-defeating stuff in implementing shopping basket.
