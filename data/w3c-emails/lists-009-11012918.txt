Hello

I am looking at HTTP 1.0 draft (oct 14 1995 )and trying to implement HTTP
server. I got some questions

Why certain headers fields are missing

e.g

accept
without this you don't know what type date
client can accept

accept-charset

without this you don't know what type charecter sets
client can accept

accept-encoding

without this you don't know whether client can perform
decode on data, If server sends encoded date

accept-language

This never made any sense because IANA language
codes are not defined anywhere. I may be totally
wrong. I saw only three language codes on ics
web site.

charge-to

????

how come hopmann extension are not included

e.g

ietf-draft on http-extension

connection: maintain

Why some methods are gone out of the draft

unlink

I never understood what link and unlink does 
If any body has an example of link and unlink
I would appreciate it.

I need explanations from some body from the working group
what impact will it have on new server implemetations

Thanks
