I think the changes you are referring to are the result of a recent
decision to write the first HTTP RFC as a "best current practice"
document rather than a standards-track RFC. 

As a result of this is it planned that the next spec written will
be called HTTP 1.1 and be standards-track, but will closely
resemble what prior drafts called HTTP 1.0. (And what we were
previously planning to call HTTP 1.x may become HTTP 1.(x+1) etc.)

So the features you are looking for _are_ still part of the big picture.
