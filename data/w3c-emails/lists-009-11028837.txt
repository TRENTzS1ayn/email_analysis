Hello folks,

We have a new standard for extending HTML to include programming;  we
are calling our language Meta-HTML.  Our documents get run through an
interpreter where HTML comes out like it went in and Meta-HTML gets
executed and the results substituted inline.

Recently however, I noticed there was some confusion about which
organization to address for standards, so pointers would be
appreciated.

Thanks,
Joe
