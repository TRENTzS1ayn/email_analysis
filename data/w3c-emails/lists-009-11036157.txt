A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts

The wide success of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer from Netscape Communications
Corporation) has made it vital that the current WWW proxy protocol be
extended to allow an SSL client to open a secure tunnel through the proxy.

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                        
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type:
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-luotonen-ssl-tunneling-01.txt".
                                                        
NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.
