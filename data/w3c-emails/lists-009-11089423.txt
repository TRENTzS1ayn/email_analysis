    One thing that I don't understand is why you insist on 3-letter
    tags nnn instead of 7-letter tags I-S-nnn for Ethnologue-based
    language labels.

I would accept the I-S-nnn form, and would encourage the folks working
on the new ISO 3 char standard to accept as an input document the existing
Ethnologue list.

Regards,
Glenn
