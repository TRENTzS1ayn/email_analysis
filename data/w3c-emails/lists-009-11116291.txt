I read this as:
multiple firewall travelsal has no efect on the protocol, it's a proxy
implemenation issue.
Partially agree.
As I see, the (HTTP) protocol has no features to report the server/proxy
which generated the error response when something went wrong.
Client      <->     firewall1           <->           firewall2 <-> server
      connect ->
      <- 407 proxy-authenticate
      connect/proxy-authorisation ->
      <- ???
                   connect
   407 proxy-authenticate
      407 proxy-authenticate
???
In some cases irrelevant, on which stage the problem occured, but in case of
authentication it is relevant.
If "100 connecting to gatekeeper" stays in the place of the first ???,
the client will know that the second 407 generated by gatekeeper.
(Alternatively, the second 407 can be handled at the first proxy, depending
on authentication scheme.)
As far as I know, we have no standardised proxy-authenticate, only have
a placeholder. While it is a placeholder, the ssl-tunneling is fine, but
when proxy-authenticate is elaborated in detail, some modifications will be
needed.
Of course, this objection applies mostly to the 1.1 draft, not to ssl-tunneling.

With autenthication on both firewalls?
