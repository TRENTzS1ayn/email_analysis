My recollection from the time the spec at NCSA was written is that
everyone did want to discourage people from putting data in 
command line arguments.  Some people wanted to completely exclude
it, but that was ruled out because of its existing use with ISINDEX.
I think it was decided to allow it only in ISINDEX.
