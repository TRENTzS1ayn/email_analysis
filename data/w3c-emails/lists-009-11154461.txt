One important security note that should be added to this draft: any client
that supports this extension MUST perform some correlation between the
requested hostname and the certificate returned in the SSL connection -
otherwise the system becomes vulnerable to trivial Person-In-The-Middle
attacks, with much less effort that conventional attacks. 

No currently deployed systems perform this checking; the next release of 
the Netscape 2 Beta does do the checking; previous versions are 
vulnerable.
