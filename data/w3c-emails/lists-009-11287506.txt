Oh. Very good point. I hadn't thought of that.

Well, it would mean 205 couldn't be used for Reset Document, as was 
discussed a couple months ago on this list, and that most agreed was a 
good idea (it would reset the document to how the browser originally 
received it, clearing forms and so forth, sort of like 204 No Content). 
Except for that, a Partial Content response seems good. Satisfies my 
thought, which was that a non-byte range server should just return the 
full document (with status 200).
