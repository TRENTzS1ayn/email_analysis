If you treat data as trees (and I'll agree that it's "The Right Way"),
then the TEI locators provide a very flexible and powerful addressing
scheme based on occurence, typed occurence, and direct address. You
can browse the TEI guidelines at EBT's site.

I also have a problem with byte ranges as they have absolutely no
meaning for many data types (HTML being one). If one wants to *really*
do this the right way, one should have a general/extensible addressing
mechanism like that offered by HyTime (not that I am proposing it be
adopted as is).
