If a server claims to support byte ranges, then it always has the
option of implementing them trivially (but expensively) by simply
editing its own output, either on the fly or out of a server-side
cache.  If it has a cleverer algorithm for reverse-mapping from byte
indexes to the position in its own internal representation, then so
much the better, but that is in the realm of optimization.  There
is always a way to do this, and it is usually going to be more
efficient even to do the naive thing of generating the whole document as
it will be transmitted, and throwing away all but a requested range of
bytes, than it would be to generate the whole thing and then transmit
the whole thing.   Now, whether its a good idea is another question.

Despite the fact that it's 1995, what goes over the net is still a
byte stream.  This isn't about internal representations, and servers
don't have to implement this.  (They better not have to...)
