Wrong. We need a method of saying "Send me pieces n to m". 

BTW. Your argument that EOL conversion by servers is "badly broken" is
also wrong. I fully expect to see servers capable of coded character
set and encoding translation appearing in the very near future. For
such servers, byte ranges are simply BAD (Broken As Designed), because
a byte might no longer be the atomic unit of information, and because,
as Chuck pointed out, the server would have to convert *everything*,
and then select the piece requested.
