I was responding to Mitra's point that if you don't use some sort of
encoding on the data, a file could conceivably contain
<CR><LF>--boundary--<CR><LF> (or whatever else you wanted to use).  I can
envision a situation where you couldn't download httpd using http because
the file contained the boundary string.  Using content-length to determine
the end of a document would be 100% reliable, since the actual content
couldn't possibly conflict with the protocol information.
