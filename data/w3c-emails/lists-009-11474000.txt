Amongst other things, yes.

It's all in pieces right now (split amongst my notes) but I have not
physically changed that section of the FrameMaker document yet.

I am hoping to include reactive negotiation on an equal footing with the
current description of preemptive negotiation.

None planned.

Some things, yes.  What did you have in mind?

> Will there be changes to header semantics?

Yes, but perhaps not the ones you are thinking of.  It is difficult
for me to read minds, so I can't tell for sure.

Are they different than the comments already on the mailing list archive?
If so, then they may be useful, and I'd prefer to hear them before
generating a new draft.  I can change my mind in a nanosecond, but it takes
several days to generate a new draft.  I already have the old comments
saved and will review them again before finishing the section.

I actually made a great deal of progress on it this weekend, so it should
be published next weekend (it must be published by Nov 22).
