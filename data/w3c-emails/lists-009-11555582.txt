Simon beat me to it:
   I don't really understand why TCPIP_NODELAY would need to be set for
   P-HTTP; although I haven't implemented the P-HTTP specifications, I
   have taken measurements for HTTP-NG operating in the closest
   available mode, using the HTTP-TOS relay facility.

While Simon then goes on to discuss why he doesn't think TCP_NODELAY
is required for HTTP-NG, he does leave open the more immediate issue
of whether it's required for persistent connections in HTTP V1.1.

I would not be entirely surprised if TCP_NODELAY were useful in
the context of persistent connections, but it's Monday morning
and I can't figure it out for myself.  So if someone could explain
in some detail why it is required, that would be nice.

Thanks
-Jeff
