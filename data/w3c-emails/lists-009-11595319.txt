If your server wishes to compute data on the fly then that's fine. 
Ari's byterange proposal allows the server to specify explicitly 
which objects are byterange seekable and those that are not.
Since your server is not smart enough to be able to compute a 
byterange, you can simply keep byteranges off.

You seem to be content with ignoring the fact that users interrupt transfers
on nearly every heavily laden graphical page they visit.  This causes many
many valid partial transfers to occur.  If you want to sit around and ignore
the issues users are having trouble with that's fine, but don't try and
block a perfectly valid solution to a very serious problem.
