To use your Xmodem/Zmodem analogy, it's like suggesting that download
parameters be tied into a name of an object to be transferred.  Using a CGI
script to deliver parts of files is definitely not "wrong".  However, writing
a PDF viewer which presumed any server serving PDF files to also have a
"/cgi-bin/pdfsplitter" CGI script or something in its namespace is going
beyond the bounds of what a transport or communications protocol should
define.  The point of trying to decide on a "standard" for this is not just
so that server authors can agree to implement common support - proxy servers
need to know that a request for part of a thing can be immediately fulfilled
if the whole thing is in the cache.  This is presumably why John and Ari
brought it to the table in the first place - so that Ari can support this
kind of functionality in the netscape proxy.  A CGI-based implementation
makes this impossible, unless you suggest that the proxy recognize and
intercept requests to /cgi-bin/pdfsplitter or whatever it is called. 

I believe what you are really asking for is a way for the client and 
server to have something of a conversation about how to access sub-parts 
of content - i.e., frames of an movie, time ranges of audio, a page 
out of a PDF file.  Obviously byteranges are inadequate for these kind of 
application-level queries.  Let's <em>separate</em> this from the 
byterange proposal for the time being - there are definitely better 
answers to this problem, Hytime is/was one solution, and I think it's 
ill-advised to hold everything up until it's solved.  Focus on byte 
ranges as being specifically for transmission recovery for incomplete 
files - the fact that some companies will be using them to access 
individual pages out of a PDF file should just be considered an abuse.

You're right, it doesn't, I'm with you there.

The algorithm I posted yesterday allows for servers to return full 
objects even when only a part is requested - the choice is up to them, 
since that point may be hard to compute or dynamic or whatever.  So, I 
would presume in your case the server would just always return full 
objects.  No sweat - that's what the current netscape implementation 
presumes anyways.  Recognizing byte ranges is just a window for 
optimization.  If you don't want to do it, fine, you don't lose.

I hear Eric Drexler is making a comeback....
