I couldn't find your notes, and I have a question.

Did your proposal include multipart/mixed responses for
keep-alive cgi scripts?  That seems to be what everyone
is implementing.  I'm not happy with using the "multipart/mixed"
name.  I would prefer "multipart/x-http-response" or something
like it so that we don't have name space collision with email
messages.
