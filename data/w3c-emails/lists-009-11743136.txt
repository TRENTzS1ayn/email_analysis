Lou- the 205 response is not part of http/1.0 as described, and this can 
lead to some caching confusion; if a 1.1 client is talking through a 1.0 
proxy to a 1.1 client, and a partial fetch is done, it's possible to the 
1.0 proxy to keep a copy of the partial contents, yet not be aware that 
the contents are bogus- the next client to do a fetch could end up with 
partial data, yet not be aware of it.
