I see, so we are back full circle to the reason why byte ranges were
originally proposed as part of the URL.  

But your concerns are not valid.  Neither of the two most used proxy
servers (CERN and Netscape) will cache objects that are not returned
with a 200 status.  If there are any other proxy servers that do
cache non-200 requests then they are clearly in violation of the
HTTP spec.
