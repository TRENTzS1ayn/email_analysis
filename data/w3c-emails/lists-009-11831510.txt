You wouldn't want to use If-modified-since itself, since that would cause
incorrect behavior with non-byte range compatible servers. Me, I would
incorporate it into the range request header, since it's part of that
function. Something like: 

Request-Range: Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT; bytes=0-499

That would seem to make sense to me, since you're saying "send me the 
first 500 bytes of the document if it hasn't been modified since this 
date, otherwise send it all."Of course, you'd still want to be able to 
say

Request-Range: bytes=0-499

For those cases where you really just want a certain byte range from a
document, even if it's changed (or if you've never seen it before). I'd
assume servers are smart enough to tell the difference.

Great!
