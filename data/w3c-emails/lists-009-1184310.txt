Brian makes a very good point that I wasn't fully aware of.  It bears
repeating. If documents containing in-line images all specify the
WIDTH and HEIGHT of those images then an MGET can be nearly as good as
multiple connections in user preceived performance.

Of course, there is the political problem of getting providers to include
this information in their documents.  There is no mention of these parameters
in the IMG tag in the HTML 2.0 specification.  I don't know about their
status for 3.0.

There is a little bit of a chicken and egg problem here.  I would happily
put MGET in WN if there were any browsers supporting it.  I would probably
even put it in if there were some consensus on a standard for doing it,
assuming it was kept simple.
