If byte ranges do not address an object on the server, or a part thereof
(and part needs to be defined in that case), then they do not belong
in the URL space.

I have nothing against byte ranges, or partial transfers in general,
but limiting oneself to byte ranges, and adding the syntax to the URL
space, is not the way to do it.
