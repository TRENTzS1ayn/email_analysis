I agree with you.  I think that "if-not-modified-since" would
be a great addition and would work well for byte-ranges.
It should be tied into the header some how though.

Maybe we should make "if-not-modified-since" an optional
attribute to the request-range header.

Therefore a byte range request would look like:

GET /byterange-capable-document HTTP/1.0
Request-Range: bytes=500-999; if-not-modified-since="DATE"

We should also be able to send size checksums, so we
could add 'if-size-equal="LENGTH"' as well.
