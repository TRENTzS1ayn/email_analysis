Give a 5MB HTML document to Netscape Navigator. For certain media
types, and HTML is one, you can request peices (not byte ranges), and
do not need to reparse the data. For example, it makes more sense to
ask for single elements from HTML, than a byte range.

Byte ranges are not sufficient for many data types, and indeed, are
potentially harmful. A general naming mechanism would allow byte range
naming, as well as things like asking for elements m to n in an HTML
document.
