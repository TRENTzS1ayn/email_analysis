Netscape navigator and the netscape server both use 
"multipart/mixed" as per Alex's proposal.  I'm not
aware of any server implementer's even wanting to
support chunked transfer encoding.  I for one
will strongly fight against adding yet another 
encoding form.

There is a namespace collision.  the user representation of
a multipart/mixed message is well specified and does not
conform to the usage in Alex's proposal.  "Multipart"
encoding is the right thing for HTTP but it should use
a different sub name.
