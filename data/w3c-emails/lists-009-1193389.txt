NetScape themselves provide a solution in the form of WIDTH and HEIGHT
attributes to the IMG tag - if used everywhere the document can be laid out
completely before any images retreived.  I'd be against having authoring
tools or the author themselves put this information in, but if we go down the
path of having servers "do something" to the HTML they serve before sending
it to the client (a la server-side includes, something we use a lot here)
then having servers add those attributes to those tags isn't such a bad idea
(servers can cache these translations anyways).  

I guess the big question is - do we solve this problem in HTML or HTTP?
Or both?
