If the results are reproducable than the server can produce any date
that it wishes to use as a time checksum.  I have written such scripts
in the past and I usually use the most recent modification date of
all the dependancies for the data.

In most cases the server returns a content-length for the object.  The
content length would be returned in the if-size-equal header.

The added value of the option is to give an additional checksum to guarentee
accuracy.  A generalized checksum method would also be desirable.
