I have no problem with that. My initial leaning towards putting it in the 
URL for the sake of not breaking proxies was more than adequately handled by 
the header proposal. I have a deep suspicion that this is a case of 
violent agreement. I was concerned about partial caching (something I 
think is *badly* needed) while you were concerned about the byte range 
being part of the URL (something you are massively opposed to). We were 
simply not talking about the same thing.
