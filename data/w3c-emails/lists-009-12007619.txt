Much as I hate to agree with someone who is trying to disagree with
me, I hate to disappoint you, but I think we're still agreeing.  My
suggestions were intended as things the server could use in computing
the validator, not things the client would *know* were in the
validator.  I certainly DID NOT mean to imply that strings such as

"Validator:date=01-March-1995" or "Validator:checksum=19283719827"

would appear.  I meant we'd see

"Validator:8923984792"  and that the server would be

responsible for generating and understanding this.  Sorry for being,
uh, opaque about this.
