[rest of my suggestion, which gave more information about how
"flexibility" of the digest can be used to make the thing really
opaque was deleted by Jeffrey]

As I said, It can be made, just a matter of defining the correct
behaviour, see below. (as content-digest: does not yet exists, it is
still possible to state precisely several cooperating utilisations)

This is not a problem, as the "digest" can be anything server wants

It can, As I gave in exemple (did you read?) there is no problem using
Content-Digest: WHATEVERKEYWORD=WHATEVERVALUE
which couple is opaque
ie it is ok to have (again from my exemple):
Content-Digest: date="Tue Nov 14 21:18:28 MET 1995"
or whatever the server wants
even
Content-Digest: private="816380285"
which is faster to compare, or whetever...

anyway, again, if you can't bare the name, its no problem for me to
use another one 
(though suggesting server implementation based on digest is probably
the safest (compared to date stuff))
