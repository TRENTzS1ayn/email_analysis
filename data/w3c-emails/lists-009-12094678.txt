Okay, this would seem to solve the problem conditions I can think of.

My mistake for calling them file attributes rather than object 
attributes - while you might refrain from calling it a "file access 
protocol", I think we could certainly agree to call it an "object request 
protocol".  To some extent, "Send Unless" and conditional GETs are just 
an optimization over doing a HEAD request on an object before fetching 
it, so i'm not going to proclaim that the WWW will fall apart if it's not 
implemented.

I will defer to the cache validation experts.  Of which there don't seem 
to be many :)
