No major http UA use Content-MD5
and no server at all produce them

Some user *will* need other algorithm
If not today, in few monthes or years, I'll bet on that,
you need to think a bit for the future and standardize will its not
too late

My bike works well for some stuff, but I won't use it to go 100 miles
away

This has to be defined, indeed

It is no big deal except you can use it as hex with 0 lines of new
software...

That's untrue
some people could be happy with unix sums, or any private digest
algorthm,
Also the Digest could be used as an opaque string by the client to do
conditional requests...etc...
