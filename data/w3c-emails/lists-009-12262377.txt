It still does not work with the following (chained-Proxies) configuration: 

     (C) <--------> (P1) <--------> (P2) <--------> (S)
      ^     co1      ^      co2      ^      co3      ^
      |              |               |               |
     NEW            OLD             NEW              ?

 - `C' sends `Proxy-Connection: keep-alive' to `P1' 
 - `P1' is not compliant and ignores that header field forwarding
    it to `P2'
 - `P2', receiving `Proxy-Connection: keep-alive', supposes to talk
    to a compliant client and decides to keep alive `co2' connection,
    whereas `P1' is waiting P2 to close connection after its response.

The `Connection: Keep-Alive my-name' solution allows each compliant
proxy to realize whether is talking to a compliant proxy/client or not.


   Cheers,
   Lorenzo
