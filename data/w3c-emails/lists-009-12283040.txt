In a word, NO.  It does not adequately take into account the presence
of hierarchical proxies, nor does it help with gateways.  The only
way to differentiate communication capabilities is through the 
protocol name + version number, since that is the only feature
that cannot be passed on by a proxy.  Things will improve with HTTP/1.1
in terms of communication rules, but we are not going to add another
proxy header hack when it won't be sufficient anyway.
