I'll look at the definition of tunnels before commenting more on this.

In the original message, and in further postings, Lorenzo and I
talked about "unique identifiers" of the node (client, proxy or
server), not IP addresses. I agree that addresses exist at the
transport level, but there must exist some other form of unique
identifier that is understood at the application level. Just use
that.

I fully agree on this point; this is something that probably hasn't
received much attention in the past.  Note, though, that at times the
distinction between application and transport is very difficult. As an
example, URLs can include IP addresses, such as

    http://131.114.9.237/~luigi/

and all browsers will happily find the requested info.
