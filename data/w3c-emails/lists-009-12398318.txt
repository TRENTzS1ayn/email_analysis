Hmm. The word tunnel mean for me IP tunneled trough IPX or vice versa.
(One transport protocol tunneled trough another.) Not better to name
application level bridge?

I propose using {transport-protocol,node-name or address} pairs as unique
identifiers.
I guess Novell later or sooner will define http over SPX as did with
smtp/spx and telnet/spx.
As I am informed, Novell operates an IPX network number registry, which
can be extended (on the technical side with some appropriate extensions
to NDS) to operate like internet address registries.
An other argument that Novell plans (or already does) world-wide scalability
tests of NDS.
And the HTTP draft speaks about TCP/IP implementations of HTTP, but not
excludes implementations over other transport protocols.
As I see, support for other protocols needs some change in URL syntax too.
(the "//" host [:port] part should be renamed to network part and extended to
support multiple transport protocols having multiple node naming schemes).
I don't know yet, how the IPv4 -> IPv6 transition will be made, but that may
need some distiction, because the first needs a name to IN A lookup while the
second needs name to IN AAAA lookup.
