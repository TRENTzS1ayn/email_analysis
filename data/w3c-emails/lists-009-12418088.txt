rom your document

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-04.ps.gz

(btw, on http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/, the link to HTTP/1.1
spec points to an older version than those of HTTP/1.1)

tunnel

A tunnel is an intermediary program which is acting as a
blind relay between two connections. Once active, a tunnel
is not considered a party to the HTTP communication, though
the tunnel may have been initiated by an HTTP request. A
tunnel is closed when both ends of the relayed connections
are closed. Tunnels are used when a portal is necessary
and the intermediary cannot, or should not, interpret the
relayed communication.

I think the sentence "A tunnel is closed..." is ambiguous. When
either side of the tunnel closes the connection, I expect the tunnel
to close the connection on the other side to propagate the change
of state. I would change the sentence it to something like

When the connection on either side of the tunnel is closed, the
tunnel closes the connection on the other side. The tunnel
ceases to exist when both ends of the relayed connections
are closed.

With this interpretation, and given that the tunnel is a blind relay,
a party cannot tell the presence of a tunnel unless the other party
clearly identifies itself in a way that is distinguishable (e.g. by
specifying the transport address they use for the connection).
