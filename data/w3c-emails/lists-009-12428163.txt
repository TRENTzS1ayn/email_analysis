Yes, which is precisely what HyTime does. I can do the same thing in
LISP. I cannot imagine a way to define a general adressing scheme
without also making the addresses almost impossible to remember
though... in an ideal world, one would not see most of these links "in
the raw" anyway.

I tend to agree.
