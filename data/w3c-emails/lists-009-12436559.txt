Hi All,

Here's a suggestion to help out the problem with proxy accesses all coming
from the same address?

If the request included an Entity-Header, Really-From, then the proxy
could pass this information on to the server which would be more meaningful
than the proxy's own address. So:

If "Really-From: machine.name" exists then "machine.name" is used in preference
to "proxy.machine". Admittedly this allows unscrupulous individuals to spoof
where they have come from so perhaps the header should be "Supposedly-From".

What do you think?

Lee
