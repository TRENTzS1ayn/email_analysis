Now, after all the hard work that has gone into an HTTP/1.0
specification, it occurs to me, ironically, that it will never matter
whether there are "conforming" HTTP/1.0 specifications.  (BTW, in no
way do I mean to denigrate all the work!)  The reason is that a program
could never tell whether it's talking to a conforming implementation,
because all the non-conforming implementations we've been using over
the past few years claim to be HTTP/1.0.

On to HTTP/1.1!
