  I went out to http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/ and downloaded the
  postscript versions of the HTTP protocol documents. The link under the
  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0" is to draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-04
  and the one under "Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1" points at
  draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-01.

  I don't want to understand how that naming convention works :-) but I 
  do want to know:
    1. Why both documents are titled HTTP/1.0?
    2. Why the document, supposedly for HTTP/1.1, is dated August
       and the HTTP/1.0 is dated October?
    3. Are these the correct documents?
    4. Is PUT part of the HTTP/1.1 spec?

  I'm just confused,
  Brad
