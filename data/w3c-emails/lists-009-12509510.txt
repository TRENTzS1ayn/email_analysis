Regarding the use of the "chunked" coding for persistent connections,
I am confused how this will work if the proxy must remove this
encoding according to the language below.

rom the draft:
> C.5  Introduction of Transfer-Encoding
> 
>    HTTP/1.1 introduces the Transfer-Encoding header field 
>    (Section 10.39). Proxies/gateways must remove any transfer coding 
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
>    prior to forwarding a message via a MIME-compliant protocol. The 
>    process for decoding the "chunked" transfer coding (Section 3.6) 
>    can be represented in pseudo-code as:

Here the chunked transfer represents a single, potentially unbounded
POST request and the server can be concurrently transmitting response
data during the request.
