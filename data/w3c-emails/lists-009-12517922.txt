I think you're misreading the line following the one you indicated:

Remember, HTTP is not a MIME-compliant protocol. But if you have a gateway
that's translating HTTP to, say, email, you need to "remove any transfer
coding", because MIME email agents won't know what to do with it.  That's
all that line is saying. If you've an HTTP proxy through and through, 
then there's no need whatsoever to remove the encoding.

Of course, I may be wrong. But that's my take on that sentance.
