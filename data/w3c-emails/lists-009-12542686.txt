Finally I could get a copy of the 1.1 draft.

The Forwarded: header can actually be used to detect loops. However,

* it is not compulsory (although a node willing to avoid loops will
  certainly insert it and detect the loop);
* in principle, it does not prevent the occurrence of arbitrarily
  long paths (although a node can decide not to pass a request which
  has been "Forwarded:" too many times);

and these reasons make me like better the use of a *compulsory*
TTL field as a loop detector (which is also simpler to manage).

The "Forwarded:" header was inspired from email, but email loops
are different from http loops. The former are built one step at a
time, in a store-and-forward fashion:  it might take hours before
a loop is complete and detected, during this time the system does
not allocate resources other than the storage for a single copy of
the message.  But http allocates resources on all nodes, so loops
are more expensive for the network.
