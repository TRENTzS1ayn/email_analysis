One thing that I'd like to see in the protocol is a request identifier
in the response headers, that would allow to match responses with
requests.

This would have many applications, such as enable a client to send
a batch of requests to a server, and receive the responses out of
order (in order to minimize the overall response time). Ultimately,
this would even allow to separate requests and responses, or (in
many cases) use a connectionless transport for HTTP.

Has this subject been discussed before ?
