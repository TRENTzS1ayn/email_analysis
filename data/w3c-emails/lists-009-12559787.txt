Hi Again:

I think the central issue here is where the concept of media
is handled. If the HTTP server is considered as a media server
then it must have the facilities to deal with media. Time code
is the language of the professional media creators. Therefore 
given the web's ever increasing consumption of media it would
have to deal with time code. However if the server is still
viewed as a byte stream server then this would push the
responsibilty for dealing with  media out to the clients; ie,
browsers and any tools they use.

Either way there has to be a richer media control mechanism
than byte ranges. I think time code is it. For me the important
issue becomes which end handles it.
