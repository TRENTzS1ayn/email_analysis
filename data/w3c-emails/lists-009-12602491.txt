I think the central issue here is where the concept of media
is handled. If the HTTP server is considered as a media server
then it must have the facilities to deal with media.

We've had this discussion at least once before.  I firmly believe
that HTTP should NOT be used for real-time continuous media.  The
URL mechanism allows us to include multiple transport protocols
(e.g., HTTP, FTP, Gopher) in the web, and if we want to include
real-time continuous, then we should use a protocol optimized for
that.  We should not try to turn HTTP into a kitchen-sink protocol,
making it into a second-rate media protocol while also making it
harder to implement.

As a purely practical matter, this working group is chartered to
work on IETF standards, which normally require "rough consensus
and working code" to progress.  We would be in relatively uncharted
territory when it comes to real-time continuous media, which is
still the subject of active research and debate.   It would be
quite premature to try to standardize this kind of thing, especially
in the context of the most heavily-used protocol protocol in today's
Internet.
