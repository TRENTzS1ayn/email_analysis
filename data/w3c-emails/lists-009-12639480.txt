The media would not have to be served in real-time. Rather
I envision the first pass providing the ability to provide
users with richer access to media via mechanisms like time
code. I don't think including a more media friendly mechansim
would make http a kitchen-sink protocol. It could make it
more powerful to work with media which would ultimately permit
a richer communications environment.
