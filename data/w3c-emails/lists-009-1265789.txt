Too jumpy, yes.  Look at MacWeb and MacMosaic - both leave a small icon 
for the image, redrawing the screen when it starts rendering the image.  
If I am reading something below that, I completely lose my place when it 
gets resized.

But aren't you 75% of the way towards -NG when multiplexing MIME?

For the last week, NetScape (any platform) accounted for 65% of hits to 
our home page.

Definitely - I'd like to be able to send an HTML document + inlined 
images as a multipart mail message or posted to a newsgroup.  I can do 
that now, it's just hardly anyone has a MIME news reader and there's no 
100% reliable way to build an HREF (that I know of) from one part to 
another.  Likewise I'd like to see HTTP kept separate from HTML so that 
its benefits extend to other media types too.
