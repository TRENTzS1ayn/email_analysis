Ummm, I thought traceroute just used this hack (useful as it is) because
there was no way to change IP to include a "traceroute" command sending
a response from each recipient.

That is why I put TRACE in the HTTP/1.1 specification as a new method.
The only problem is that you won't get any response back from an unbounded
circular route.  I suppose we could add a Max-Forwards request header,
but I'd prefer to have an application test it out first.
