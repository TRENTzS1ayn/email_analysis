Avid readers,

The http-wg mailing list will be left to run on its own for 2 weeks as I fly
from England to attend the IETF meeting in Dallas and WWW4 in Boston.  (Hope
to see some of you folks there.)

Since the list is manually administered, all subscription and unsubscription
requests will be queued until 16/12/95.

If you see irate people posting to the list, can you warn them.  ;-)

Thanks!
