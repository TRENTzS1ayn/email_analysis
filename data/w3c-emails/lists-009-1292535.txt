I think the perceived performance of Netscape is a function of doing
the layout and displaying the text *before* the images are downloaded.
This is not completely independent of the protocol.  It is also a function
of being able to jump to a new link before all the downloads are finished
(and hence abort all those downloads).

I was, by chance, just looking a Eric Bina's home page where he discusses
getting the FLAME OF THE MONTH award.  I fear Simon may be in the competition
this month.  I am not sure what he means by "stealing other people's 
bandwidth."  If I only use lynx and my viewing is slowed because I share the
bandwidth with people who have a lot of images, are they stealing my
bandwidth?
