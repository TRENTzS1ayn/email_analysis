Hi...

Reading over draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-00.txt, which in general looks 
rather good, I have become confused about a certain part. In section 
10.40, regarding the Unless header, it says:

   When a request containing an Unless header field is received, the 
   server must evaluate the expression defined by the listed 
   logic-bags (Section 3.11). If the expression evaluates to false, 
   then no change is made to the semantics of the request. If it 
   evaluates true and the request is not a conditional GET 
   (If-Modified-Since, Section 10.23) or a partial GET (Range, 
   Section 10.33), then the server must abort the request and respond 
   with the 412 (unless true) status code. If the request is a 
   conditional GET, then the server must disregard the 
   If-Modified-Since value and respond as it would for a normal GET. 
   Similarly, if the request is a partial GET, then the server must 
   disregard the Range value and respond as it would for a normal GET.

This handing of conditional GETs seems to me completely wrong. If I read 
the above correctly, here's what happens:

* No If-Modified-Since, but an Unless:
- Unless true: 412 response
- Unless false: send the document

* If-Modified-Since, no Unless:
- Not modified since: 304 response
- Modified since: send the document

All well and good so far, but...

* If-Modified-Since, and an Unless:
- Unless true and not modified since: send document
- Unless false and not modified since: 304 response
- Unless true and modified since: send document
- Unless false and modified since: send document

The first two are backwards! The first one will send me the document, even
though it's matched all the paramters I told it to match. For example if I
said "Unless: {eq {Content-MD5 "whatever"}}, but also threw in an
If-Modified-Since, I'd get a 304 if the MD5 *didn't* match. In other
words, it's behaving more as an If:  header than an Unless: header. This
seems rather contradictory. It seems to me the only change to Unless
semantics when an If-Modified-Since header is present should be to replace
the 412 with a 304 if it's found true, and add an {le {Modified-Since
"date"}} to the internal parsing of the Unless header.

It seems to me that more often then not, browsers will send Unless and 
If-Modified-Since at the same time, to maintain compatibility with HTTP 
1.0 servers. However, the current draft's wording on this is very oblique 
and hard to interpret. The above is what I think it says, but I have to 
admit I'm really not sure. Is it possible to get some clarification on 
this point?
