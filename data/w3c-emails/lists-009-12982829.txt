Hi all,

I will be running an HTTP Futures birds of a feather session at the WWW4
conference next week.  At that time, I would like to have the various
groups working on bits of HTTP/1.1 to explain to people (i.e., me)
how they intend to proceed, maintain communication with the other groups,
and feed the results back into the main draft(s).

Speaking of which, this would be a good time for our new co-Chair
Larry Masinter to explain what on earth I am babbling about. ;-)

......Roy
