|Well, I assume you are proposing (hypothetically, anyway) that the
|server rewrite the HTML it's transmitting to add the WIDTH and HEIGHT
|attributes.

If the server would have to open each image in any event in order to pack it 
into a multipart message.  It could have access to the image size parameters
and include them in the a MIME header.
