Are you volunteering some resources?

Some venting in "post mortem" mode is healthy, but let's keep in mind
that this is a volunteer organization.

Some of your comments directly addressed works-in-progress, and I
appreciate those comments (I disagree with some of them -- in
particular, the notion that content negotiation is subordinate to the
main focus of the HTTP spec...)

But the general exhortations to the group aren't really all that
useful, are they?
