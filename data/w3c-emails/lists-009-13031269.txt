    But the general exhortations to the group aren't really all that
    useful, are they?

I think they are.  It is quite a different thing to develop new standards
than to label as standard an existing practice.  The former requires much
more work, organization, and a strong voice every now and then to bring the
flock back in from its wanderings.

It seems to me that both the HTTP and HTML WGs have yet to prove themselves
in terms of developing extensions to defacto standards that actually get
widely implemented.  Thus, I think Daniel's remarks are quite apropos.
