I think they're somewhat useful, in that:
 (a) the big changes to the spec do not seem to mirror the conversation on the
working group mailing list, or even to follow the process described
by Roy.  (Are there working implementations of Unless and
logic bags that I don't know about?  What about the new methods?)
 (b) issues that have been brought up repeatedly in the working group
are not resolved by the spec.  As the perpetrator of some of those
issues I am not going to harp on them more right now, except
to say that I think issues that could be resolved rather
easily are too often left unresolved.
 (c) by ignoring things like Netscape's cookies, the working group
stands in danger of simply being bypassed by the market.  If 
the working group continues not to respond to such issues
(whether they've been submitted as I-D's or not) then it will simply
become irrelevant over time. I think it would be unfortunate
to abdicate control of this protocol to any single commercial entity
by such obvious inaction.
