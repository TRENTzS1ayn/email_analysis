    No, I think he meant an implicit Range: 0-0 with the intent that
    nothing be sent (but actually it would send one byte).

Correct.  I should have written that a missing Range: header implies
"Range: bytes=1-0" ... or more properly, I should have simply written
that a missing Range: header implies "the empty set."

    I think this illustrates the potential for confusion that could be
    eliminated with an If-cache-valid: <authenticator> and
    If-cache-stale: <authenticator>.

No, it illustrates the potential for confusion when I don't think
hard enough about what I am typing :-).
