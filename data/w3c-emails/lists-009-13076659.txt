This is a great idea, but I've tried to do it, and found it to be
exceedingly difficult. I expect some suitably easy-to-use issue
tracking tools to hit the web any time now, what with all the
collaboration experiments and Java applets wizzing around.

If anybody has a solution they really like, please let me know!

This is another good idea. Again, I've found that it's a LOT of work.
I think you'd need another editor to take on the work of doing
a rationale. Any volunteers?
