I really don't like the "If".  401 (not to mention 3xx) -require- the
client to read the response, because they aren't fatal, and they
contain critical information to making the transaction succeed!
If there is any doubt that the client might not read the response,
then we are doing something wrong.

The protocol should be deterministic in any case where the physical
connection hasn't been screwed up.  I'm all for fault tolerance and
fallback mechanisms, but they should not be the "standard" way of
moving data around.

Anyway, everyone keeps talking about the 4xx and 5xx -fatal- cases.
These are the easy ones.  In any scenario, please think in terms of a
harder case, such as the client wants to PUT a giant chunk of data to
a location that requires authentication, or tries to POST to a
resource that has moved, etc.
