I'm sorry that the two-day delay in getting the minutes out for the
afternoon session have caused you some concern, but I promise I'll be
doing so soon.

I do think there've been concerns about the progress of the group so
far, but I hope that we've established a mechanism to make more rapid
progress. More news when the minutes are out.
