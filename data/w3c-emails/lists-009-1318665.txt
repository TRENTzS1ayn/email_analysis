This is a very good suggestion.  A simple MGET proposal which included 
headers like this would be easy from the server side.  I'm not a client
writer, but I think it should not be too difficult there either.  One
could probably get user perceived performance similar to that of Netscape.
I think it would be cleaner than multiple connections and would it should
decrease bandwidth use slightly.  What Netscape has that this wouldn't
provide is the ability to draw all the images simultaneously rather than
sequentially, but I am not sure how important that is.

This proposal removes the onus of getting the image size from the author
and puts it on the server which is probably a good thing.
