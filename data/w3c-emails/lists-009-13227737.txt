Mostly reflects what I recall after allowing for possible naps when I may
have missed a whole discussion fragment I don't recognize ;-:). See one
comment below.

Somehow I was under the impression that changes to the current 1.0 document
were to be largely cosmetic to change the boiler plate to align with the
informational status. What I see recorded here sounds like a major rewrite
and that seems like an awful lot of effort for all of us. Find some
verbage to describe it as commonly available interoperable current practice
and perhaps allow some focused comment from current server/UA authors who
feel they have a commonly used feature which has been missed. Then lets
move on to 1.1 quickly!

My sense is that 1.0 should be a document from which a workable server could
be implemented and exoect to interoperate with user agents which existed
circa Mar 1995 (or pick another date). Secondly, it will describe current
usage for problem determination.
