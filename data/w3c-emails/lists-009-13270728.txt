I don't care if it's reasonable or not -- it is simply how I would like
to run the BOF.  It is my BOF, my time, and my effort -- not a WG meeting --
and I would prefer to have the discussion reflect the actual plans of the
WG.  Why is that bad?  Would you prefer that I just say the HTTP WG
doesn't know what it is doing?

No, it was a reminder to the WG Chairs that they needed to get the information
on the list NOW (which Larry and Dave promptly accomplished) before I gave
two separate presentations on the topic next week.
