In the IETF, the WG chairs seem to have the perogative to declaring
whether or not the WG has reached 'rouch consensus'. If you disagree
with the WG chairs on this issue, you may appeal this decision to the
area directorate if you can't come to some resolution with the WG
chairs first.

As far as I am concerned, there is no 'rough consensus' on any of the
issues for which we have constituted subgroups; this includes 'state
info'.

I would appreciate it if WG members would avoid declaring or denying
the existance of 'consensus' on any of these issues.

The members of the subgroup on 'state management' are:

Dave Kristol, Rohit Khare, Scott Powers

If you would like to join this subgroup, please contact those people.
If the subgroup wishes to report on their meetings, conversations,
discussions, and the progress or lack thereof, please do so.
If there are technical issues on which you cannot make progress and
would like to consult the rest of the group, please let us know.
