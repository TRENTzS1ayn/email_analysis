I will try to fix the minutes so that it doesn't sound like this is
intended to be a lot of work.  I'm not expecting a major rewrite of
the 1.0 draft, just enough so that we don't get any more "where's
Accept: ?" queries.

I suggest we give Paul Hoffman and Roy a couple of weeks to post new
draft with these changes before starting to worry that 1.0 will be
bogged down.
