I have no problems with the WG chairs claiming the right to declare
rough consensus, _if they indeed plan to regularly exercise that
right_.

In at least the last half year, I have never seen the WG chairs take a
leading role in the consensus game, which resulted in the WG reverting
to "consensus by lack of discussion" mode as Shel Kaphan described.

If the chairs want to take the effort to let this WG function as
described in the IETF rulebooks again, they have my full support.

I have reported to you that we did indeed reach rough "consensus by
lack of discussion" on the State-Info draft.  I even included a
summary of relevant issues.  The whole story can be found in the
http-wg and www-talk archives.

While I think that the State-Info draft could be decided on now,
waiting until the end of January 96 is acceptable.

If you mean by this that the WG chairs never declared consensus, I
agree.

I could live with that.  Please tell me how to refer to the "lack of
discussion" type of consensus we have had in the past.  I am not
prepared to have the whole privacy discussion we had on www-talk and
html-wg last summer again, this time in a more formal setting.

Thank you, I will.


One other thing: Roy Fielding recently said on this list:

| "Rough consensus" can only be tested by polling the list.
|To date, the only piece of HTTP that has ever gained "rough consensus"
|for includion in HTTP/1.1 is the Host header field and those features
|which already exist in HTTP/1.0 (by definition).

Would you (the WG chairs) please either confirm or deny this?

Koen.
