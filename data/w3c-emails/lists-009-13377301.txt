Seems like the state-info proposal covers what one would need for the
moment. While it pushes the really difficult aspect of implementing
transactional concepts to CGI bin scripts, one could argue that is how it
should be (since the notion of transaction varies in different application
areas). 

Regarding Koen's proposal about a path name as a value for state-info (in
order to accomodate Netscape cookies) I actually prefer leaving the
state-info: header value un-specified for the moment. If I understand the
use of path one could use it to store and look up state maintained on the
server side (correct me if I am wrong). But, that again gets into one of the
models for implementing state management on the server side. There are other
equally viable ones (shared memory with a flat look up is another). Also, if
we leave it unspecified then I could think of using IF (the renamed unless)
to implement comparator functions on types of state-info information. I
believe that the combination of IF and state-info  is a more extensible way
of implementing different types of session management strategies by CGI bin
scripts.
