I think there is some confusion here.  The discussion was on whether
the state-info mechanism proposed by Dave Kristol should be extended
with a `path=' attribute as in Netscape cookies.  Someone suggested
that this might allow for more session state to be kept without
resorting to server side databases, if I remember correctly.  I
remarked that I failed to see how that `path=' would allow this.
