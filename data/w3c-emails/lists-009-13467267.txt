Yes, and that exactly matches current practice.

Yes, this was discussed before, and the decision made on this list was
that lack of headers meant qe=1 and qc=1 and that if the client wished
to exclude other encodings and charsets, then

     Accept-Encoding:
     Accept-Charset: iso-8859-1

is what the client must send.

They are there to support collaborative systems.  They are also optional.

Ahem. May I remind you that one person's fringe interests are another
person's requirements.  The fact that the industry has only implemented
HTTP/1.0 is irrelevent to what goes in the initial draft of HTTP/1.1.
If the industry does not implement these features *by the time HTTP/1.1
is ready to proceed outside the WG*, then they will not be in the final
document(s).  However, if two implementations of these features do
exist and are interoperable, and the features are optional, then they will
be represented in the final standard (perhaps as a separate document,
but that is a non-issue).

We cannot discuss hierarchical caching without also discussing content
negotiation and its effect on the request/response semantics.  Since
HTTP/1.1 will not progress without caching, content negotiation cannot
be removed from the HTTP/1.1 standard.  One way or another, this WG must
deal with the questions at hand regardless of whether it is all done
in one document or in multiple documents.
