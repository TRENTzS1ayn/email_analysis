(personal opinion)

One of the reasons i don't like 'if' is that the body of it has
complex parsing rules. I'm thinking ahead to binary-encoded HTTP,
where the headers themselves are sent in binary. Yet, with something
like 'if', you're still stuck with parsing the things.

It's another reason why I'd prefer specific mechanisms (validator)
over a generalized one (if).
