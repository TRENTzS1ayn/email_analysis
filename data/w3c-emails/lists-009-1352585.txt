I think there's some interest in forming a new 'media type' working
group that concentrates on Internet media-type registration issues to
satisfy the needs of multiple protocols, including MIME, HTTP, news,
etc., and could take on some of the issues of attribute registration,
image description tags, manditory auxliary information, character set
registration, etc. that keep coming up.

It might be appropriate to do this after the mail-extension RFCs get
passed as proposed and that WG shuts down.
