I think the issue between opaque validators vs. header-based
validators is one of where you expect the additional implementation
work to be if a different value is chosen as validator.

IF: {eq {Content-MD5 "blah"}}

or

content-validator: md5:blah

====

IF: {eq {Last-Modified "Fri, 01 Dec 1995 14:13:06 gMT"}}

or

content-validator: lastmodified:19951201141306

These are logically equivalent in terms of protocol, but using IF the
cache has to decide which field is relevant for determining cache
validity, while in the latter case, the server decides which field is
valid.
