You're assuming one 'checkout' operation for the whole site.  At a
"mall"-type site, each store could have its own directory and checkout
operation.  In this case, 'path' would prevent the browser from sending
every cookie for the whole mall with every request.

Yes, you're right.  I meant only that the inclusion of path would shift
away from the whole header value being opaque, to one attribute of the
value being opaque.  Minor point.
