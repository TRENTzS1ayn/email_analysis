Turning an expression into a tree or quads or some form of binary is
pretty common knowledge, or readily available for the cost of the new
Dragon book.  Nontheless, if "If:" survives I'd like to see the syntax
look more like something already known, such as C, Lisp, etc.  The semi-
TCL-syntax and the FortranIV operators make for a funky mix.
