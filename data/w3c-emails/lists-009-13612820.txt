Well, your proposed rule would, if I understand it, preclude my host
and root domain:
   xpasc.com
from using the facility.  To preclude domains such as '.com' two periods
isn't the answer.  One needs at least two non-null name parts separated by
periods.

In any case, if security is an issue, surely your hypothetical user will
use SSL or SHTTP? Perhaps the protection should be based on some aspect
of the SSL / SHTTP key certificate.
