I agree.  And I would like to see the Cache-Validator be opaque.  This
seems simple and robust.  It places all the cache validation responsibility
with the origin server which is where it belongs.  Trying to share this
responsibility between the client/cache and the origin server may offer
some benefits but I have yet to see a persuasive case made for it.

Conditional gets may or may not be a good idea, but they should be 
a separate issue from cache validation.
