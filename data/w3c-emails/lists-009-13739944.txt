] Larry Masinter has asked me to lead the "persistent connections"
] subgroup.  After spending a few days recovering (almost) from the
] flu, I'm trying to get things underway.

] According to the Dallas minutes, the volunteers were
]     Alex Hoppman
]     Simon S
]     Mike cowlishaw
]     Andy Norman
]     Scott Powers
]     Brian Swetlund
]
] I do not have email addresses for Scott Powers or Brian Swetlund,
] so would you each please send me your address?  (If someone out
] there has a copy of the roster from the WG meeting last week,
] perhaps you could send me their addresses?)
]
] If other people *really* want to join this subgroup, please
] send me a message.  I don't want to leave out anyone who has
] something important to contribute, but I also want to keep
] it small enough that we can reach an actual consensus by
] the "January 1996" deadline.
