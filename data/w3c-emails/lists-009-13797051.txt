What do you do when the lease expires just when the client does the
PUT?

How do you know how long to lease the document for? Why not always ask
for more than you need? For infinite leases?

I've seen a lot of version management systems around, and I've never
seen any with leases. Why do you imagine this is EVER a good idea?
