I'm aware there is controversy but despite that, it seems to work
pretty well.  I would say the IETF is full of controvery and some
think the output is bad but it seems to be better than all other
standards bodies in its area.

You must be unaware that there was a strong consensus that adding new
top level type was a big deal and the ietf-types list was really set
up for registering subtypes.  The chemical/* type seems to have been
merged with a number of other ideas and subsumed into a model/* top
level type which is more likely to succeed.

Seems to me that you believe unless there are exact and precise rules
for everything, then there is a "problem".  I don't see it that way.

Unless there are rules to the contrary, IANA is in charge of allocating
/ registering most everything in IETF standards.
