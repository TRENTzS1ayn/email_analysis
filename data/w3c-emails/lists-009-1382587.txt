Because it defeats caching.  Besides, some people may want to use MIME
multipart types on HTTP for other reasons -- why should the server treat
them any differently than other content types?  [just server here -- I know
why clients would want to do so]

It's much easier to just keep the connection open (with possibly a very
short timeout as defined by the server) and respond with multiple responses
(each one of which may be a multipart entity).

Sounds like fun, but that's not the hard part.  Serving up MIME multipart
is not the problem.  What you need to do is get clients to understand
(and parse) MIME multiparts.  And that means ALL clients.

This is an invalid use of Message-ID -- it must be unique.

This is an invalid use of Content-ID -- it must be unique.

And what do you do about Content-Encoding?  It's not valid MIME at all.

What?  See RFC 1521.  Or, for that matter, read the HTTP/1.0 draft -- it
already defines EObody-part and EOentity for Multipart entities.

They already want to ship SGML as a multipart/mixed -- adding a bunch of
HTTP-specific controls to it just mucks-up things for the mail people.
