Larry, most of the problems you write about are addressed to some
extent by the 1.1 content negotiation mechanism, not the caching
mechanism.  You may want to read my 'notes on content negotiation', I
believe they address some of your concerns about things currently
missing from 1.1.  The notes are in

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1995q4/0289.html

and

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1995q4/0347.html .

In my notes on content negotiation, I proposed a new header

  Send-no-body-for: <list of variant URIs> 

for the purpose of indicating the variants the cache DOES have cached
for a negotiated URL (called a negotiation port in my notes).  

It is interesting to note that the IF: (Unless) header allows one to
implement the functionality of my proposed Send-no-body-for
header. Roy's

  If: {ne {Location "http://blah.com/doc.french.html"}}

would have about the same semantics as my

  Send-no-body-for: http://blah.com/doc.french.html .

Reading your message, it seems to me that we have both independently
concluded that `Send-no-body-for' functionality is needed.

Koen.
