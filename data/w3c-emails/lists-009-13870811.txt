what i'm wondering is why content negotiation can't just return
the actual URL of the negotiated resource, using the new
"Content-Location".  so if you requested /foo/bar/constitution.txt
and preferred english, you'd get /foo/bar/constitution-english.txt
(and would be silently redirected there), and the proxy would cache
it under that name.  similarly, the french request would get cached
under the other name.

granted, this would mean a "reload" would go to the specific one
(and pre-empt negotiation).

sorry if this is an obvious question, but just how *is* cacheing
supposed to work with content negotiation?
