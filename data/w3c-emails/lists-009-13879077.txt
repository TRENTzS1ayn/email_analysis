At least one issue is the spoofing issue: If clients use the
"Location" header as the cache key for the resource, then it is easy
for a server to claim to be sending any old URI, and for that resource
to get lodged in a cache under the false URI.  This might not be *so*
terrible for end-user caches, but it could cause some real trouble if
it happened in a more public intermediate proxy cache.  I don't recall
anyone having mentioned a good workaround for this either.
