This is not a safe assumption. Numerous providers sell space to many 
independent people on single servers. For example: www.xmission.com 
serves on the order of 1000 independent entities, including many 
businesses and people, and allows CGI to be owned by the individuals. 
Clearly there is the opportunity for someone to spoof there under the 
rule. It is not significantly safer than unrestricted redirections when 
many (most?) people share common servers.
