At first I thougt that deadlocks would only occur when a node in the
loop finishes it resources (be them connections, processes, whatever).
I thought that there were *many* of them, so a suitable TTL would avoid
deadlocks. This looks like the same problem, except that there is
exactly *one* resource on each node.

Convincing arguments!
