doin' that

Now that would be interesting!  Given all the packet-level games that
Simon wants to include in HTTP-NG, it would be interesting to see if it's
even possible to describe it with ILU.  That would certainly go a long
way toward making it easier to implement.

yep, no guarantees though.  I prefer small steps.

doin' that, though it is important to have multiple common bases of
reusable code.
