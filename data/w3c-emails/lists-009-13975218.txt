Hmm, forging does not happen that often AFAIK.  Anyway, the kind of
web spoofing we are talking about here does not have the same global
impact as spamming and forging: with the rule that 2xx Location
headers not pointing to the server that generated the response should
be ignored, this kind of web spoofing can only harm users that share
the host with the spoofer.

As the impact of mismanagement would be limited to local content, I
have little problems with this reliance being placed.  Service
providers with security management lousy enough to allow prolonged web
spoofing will simply loose their customers and die.

Not if the Location header filter is user-id based as described
before.  Experienced admins could create such a filter in a few hours,
if it is not already a standard option of future 1.1 http servers.

In other words, I don't share your pessimism.
