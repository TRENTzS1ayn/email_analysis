It does happen that often. I am engaged in cancelling a large (in excess 
of 2000 articles) combination spam/forgery (with the intent I think of 
mail bombing the forgery victim) right now. Drop into

getting daily reports of forgeries with intent to cause harm.

I think we will just have to agree to diagree on this. Among other things 
it does not address the practice of 'sub-letting' web space. A number of 
sites (including www.xmission.com) allow this as well.
