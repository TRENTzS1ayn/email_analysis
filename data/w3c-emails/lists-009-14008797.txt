I agree that this is not exactly a protocol design issue.  However,
there are a number of aspects to caching that are not exactly part of
the communication protocol.  Larry Masinter wondered (though I think
it might have been just to me) whether we shouldn't consider doing a
separate I-D to cover caching, presumably to address the kinds of
issues that are not strictly part of the communication protocol, but
that need to be, or at least would be far better off being, nailed
down in any case.

But we can talk about this after the caching sub-wg gets going.
