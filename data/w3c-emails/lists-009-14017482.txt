I've taken our notes from the minutes and other discussion and created
a proposed new 'charter'. Diffs with the old charter attached.

Please comment on the charter before it is sent to the area directors
for approval.

DESCRIPTION OF WORKING GROUP

Note: This working group is jointly chartered by the Applications Area and the
Transport Services Area.

The HTTP Working Group will work on the specification of the Hypertext Transfer
Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is a data access protocol currently run over TCP and is the basis
of the World-Wide Web. The initial work will be to document existing practice and
short-term extensions. Subsequent work will be to extend and revise the protocol.
Directions which have already been mentioned include: improved efficiency, extended
operations, extended negotiation, richer metainformation, and ties with security
protocols.

Note: the HTTP working group will not address HTTP security extensions as these are
expected to be the topic of another working group.

Background information

The initial specification of the HTTP protocol was kept in hypertext form and a
snapshot circulated as an Internet draft between 11/93 and 5/94. A revision of the
specification by Berners-Lee, Fielding and Frystyk Nielsen has been circulated as an
Internet draft between 11/94 and 5/95. An overview of the state of the specifications
and a repository of pointers to HTTP resources may be found at

http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/Overview.html

The working group will expand and complete that document to reflect
HTTP/1.0 as it has been implemented by World-Wide Web clients and servers prior to
November 1994. The resulting specification of HTTP/1.0 will be published for review as
an Internet-Draft and will be submitted to the IESG for
consideration as an Informational RFC.

In parallel with the above effort, the working group will consider
enhancements/restrictions to the current practice in order to form a specification of
the HTTP protocol suitable for eventual consideration as a proposed standard.

GOALS AND MILESTONES

Dec 95
    Publication of HTTP/1.0 Internet-Draft prepared to be considered
    as an Informational RFC describing current practice of HTTP.

Dec 95
    Initial publication of HTTP/1.1 proposal from document editors.

Jan 96
    Complete review of HTTP/1.1 proposal and pending Internet Drafts
    by subgroups:

    * Persistent connections
    * Cache-control and proxy behavior
    * Content negotiation
    * Authentication
    * State management
    * Range retrievals
    * Extension mechanisms
    * other new methods and header features

Feb 96
     Subgroups complete Internet Drafts for separate documents from
     HTTP/1.1 specification, or prepare HTTP/1.1 differences.

Mar 96
     New HTTP/1.1 Internet-Draft distributed

Jun 96
    HTTP/1.1 submitted to IESG as Proposed Standard.

CURRENT INTERNET-DRAFTS
    o Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0
    o Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1
    o A Proposed Extension to HTTP : Digest Access Authentication
    o Mediated Digest Authentication
    o HTTP Session Extension

! Once established, the working group will expand and complete that document to reflect
  HTTP/1.0 as it has been implemented by World-Wide Web clients and servers prior to
  November 1994. The resulting specification of HTTP/1.0 will be published for review as
! an Internet-Draft and, if deemed appropriate, will be submitted to the IESG for
! consideration as a Proposed Standard or Informational RFC.
  
  In parallel with the above effort, the working group will consider
  enhancements/restrictions to the current practice in order to form a specification of
  the HTTP protocol suitable for eventual consideration as a proposed standard.
  
- Also in parallel with the above efforts, the working group will engage in defining (or
- selecting from various definitions) a next-generation protocol for hypertext transfer
- (HTTPng).
