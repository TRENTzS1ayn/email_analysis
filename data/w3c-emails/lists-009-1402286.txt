Besides various ILU translators being available (lisp, C++, C, IDL)
this strong recommendation from Dan wouldn't be because ILU
happens to be very much like Modula-3 now would it? :-)

BTW. Apart from Fresco, and the Sun CFE, does anyone know of any
free compilers/translators for IDL, and/or perhaps a free ORB? 

Not directly related to HTTP, but...
