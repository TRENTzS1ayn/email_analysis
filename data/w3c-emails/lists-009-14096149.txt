The expired draft is available at 

http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/digestauth/draft.rfc

There is also a digest authentication protected document there at

http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/simp/index.html

with user name "Mufasa" and password "CircleOfLife" which can
be used if you have a digest savy client.  Unfortunately
that does not include Netscape clients.   :(
