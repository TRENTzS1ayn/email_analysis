And they would be right.  If it were not for Dan's two years of hard
work, they wouldn't be valid SGML.  The reason they can be today is
because there was a very good reason to force HTML into SGML conformancy
and resulted in only a minor loss of functionality (i.e. <PLAINTEXT>).

The original intent was to use MIME as a means of data typing, and the
history of design choices can be (mostly) viewed on the www-talk archive.
HTTP has never been MIME-conformant, and threw all possibility of that
out the window when Content-Encoding was invented.  Until the MIME people
add Content-Encoding to the official RFCs, there is no point in even
discussing the issue here.  All that we can do is show how they differ
and possibly how an HTTP -> SMTP/NNTP gateway should behave.
