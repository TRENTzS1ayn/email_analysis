by popular request, we are in the process of resubmitting the draft.
it should be available tomorrow.  i think jan 10 is a good goal.

i think we should leave these ideas for another authentication scheme.
the orignal goal of Digest was that we can do significantly better
than Basic with a near-trival set of changes.  we went from practically
no security [uuencode("username:password")] to something with some nice
properties while retaining the existing (2 party) web-model.  we were
also able to keep it free of patents and royalties and fully exportable
and (probably) importable.  i think we should be happy with it as is.

yes, let's discuss this in the sub-group.  whether we change the syntax
or not, there's a definite need to improve the wording and eliminate
some ambiguity.

FYI, NCSA, John Franks, and David Kristol also have implementations.
are there any others ??
