My apologies to the group.  I have given out incorrect information.

Brandon Long (an actual developer) has corrected me.  I'm sorry,
the "GETHOSTBYNAMEISEVIL" was either in an internal version or comment
and the name stuck with me.  I should have checked the code before 
posting.

Sorry folks,
Beth
