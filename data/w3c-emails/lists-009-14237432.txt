The most important thing to remember is that this type of URL syntax only
has meaning to WWW clients. HTTP servers always receive the complete path
so all of this relative URL stuff is client-only. If clients are
interpreting the ".." above the root of the doc tree, you should be very
worried because they know something about your server that the server
didn't tell them.

If you are worried about encoded ".." characters in a URL, then that is
strictly a server side problem and the server author should be spanked for
not checking.
