While Unix uses ../ and DOS uses ..\ and MacOS uses :: natively to "go up a
level in the file system", it is quite clear (at least to me) that native
notations have no place in a valid URL. As was quoted in another message,
only ../ is valid for denoting hierarchy in a URL. I wish browsers were
stricter about this... ::sigh::
