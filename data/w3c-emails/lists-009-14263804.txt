Try that on my server (WebSite, try http://solo.dc3.com/) Try other ugly 
combinations like \../\./\.. well you get the idea. It doesn't do the 
multi-dot stuff for multiple "ups" though... Not a bad idea. Maybe next 
verision :-).

WebSite "normalizes" any of that junk out of a URL. The /../ is assumed to be 
the same as / (the parent of the root is the root). If it had to change 
anything to get the "normalized" form, it sends a redirect to the browser in 
an attempt to "send a message" to the browser operator and prevent further 
abuse from relative links in the document.

Just one person's solution to the problem.
