Firstly, I'm not convinced that it's a _huge_ burden; does anyone have
any statistics on Accept: headers?

Yes, there are cases where a Vary: header will not provide enough information
for a cache. But are you arguing against the implementation of the
Vary: header? I am suggesting that it is a useful feature for varying
resources. You seem to be arguing that it may not be enough for caching
of content-negotatiated resources. Does that matter?

I'm not quite sure what you mean, but half of the point of the Vary: header
was to inform about the server's varying content outside the content
negotiation scheme.
