It's likely not much of a burden now, but as browsers become more willing to
let uses set their own q's, or add type and encoding helper-apps to their
Accept* headers, it will become hugely burdensome.

Yes.

Yes.  Caching is integral.

So, tell me again what functionailty the Vary: header would provide?  How
would I modify my behavior based on a Vary: header?  Either variances are
acceptable future responses (in the content provider's mind), and hence
cachable, or their not, and then the server will send a Cache-Control.
