THe only problem with your position is that desigining negotiation 
while igoring proxy/caching issues can't be successful. Either negotiation
won't work in the general cases or proxies will never be able to determine
if a response can be delivered in response to another requrest.

Furthermore, to some degree or another all clients provide caching as well
so caching is not simply a proxy issue.

I think Larry Masinter's split makes much sense, especially considering the
broad participation in the proxy/caching sub-group. If the negotiation group
can identify how to specify and what to negotiate then the join the 
caching/proxy discussion to make sure we end up with a cohesive mechanism
which covers all issues.
