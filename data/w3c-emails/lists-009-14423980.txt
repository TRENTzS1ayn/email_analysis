One of the possible solutions we (Henrik and I) discussed this summer was
a two-request form of PUT (using PUTQ as the probe method).  That solution
was discarded because the server's requirements/status may change between
the two requests and thus the second request must still be protected using
the two-phased approach (or something similar).  Therefore, there was no
immediate advantage to using two requests other than for obtaining the
access requirements -- the OPTIONS method does that.

If we allow such negotiation, we must also provide a mechanism for
expressing it.  None is available currently and it's a bit of a rats
nest to come up with one that can encompass the server's options.
On the whole, I think we are better-off having the client ask
"can I do this" for each combination of request until the server
says "go ahead and do that".
