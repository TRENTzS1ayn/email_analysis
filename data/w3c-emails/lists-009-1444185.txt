True, but if the user is discouraged by the responsiveness they perceive
then they won't come back or won't be back as often.

Additionally, from a providers perspective, I presume that some form
of 'advertising' is the motivation.  The more information which can be
presented to a user per unit of time the user is willing to spend, the
greater the chance that the user will react to some piece of information
as desired by the provider.
