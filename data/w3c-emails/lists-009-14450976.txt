Ah. I hadn't understood that was the desire, but I certainly agree with it.
I'll do another round quite soon with much less in it.

There is also the question of downgrading "musts", since this is an
informational document.

And, on a separate note, I'll be taking the "Allow" header out of the 1.0
doc since only one known server appears to emit it. Worse, that one server
does it incorrectly (it always emits GET HEAD POST even for URIs where POST
is not allowed...).
