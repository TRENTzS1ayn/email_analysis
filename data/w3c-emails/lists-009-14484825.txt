As one can tell by my previous message, we are concerned about having
to upload files twice, but there are many cases where it isn't as bad
as it sounds:

- on a LAN, twice is often only a second or two longer than once

- even over dialup, because of the way the URL permission
  scheme works, we don't have that many twices:

if someone saves something they edited, they
had to GET it to begin with, so if they used
a PUT-authorized identification, the PUTs go
through on the first try.

if someone does a save as, the embedded assets
tend to fall under the same path-prefix and
have the same access control as the HTML file,
so even if the HTML file (which is short) has
to be retransmitted, the images (which may be
large) tend to go through on the first try.

So, in regular use, there aren't that many retransmissions (certainly
not "always twice").  Where we get bitten by permissions are where we
fake up atomic transactions by saving an entire URL tree in one HTTP
transaction -- if one does a "save as", one may wind up with many MB
hitting a particular URLspace for the first time.
