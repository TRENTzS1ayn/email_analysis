I'm sorry but I'm quite skeptical about your experimental design and
it's applicability to the HTTP context as well.  For starters finding
split points in an inbound byte stream is a different problem than
presented by a file full of bytes all present and waiting for processing.

Secondly, I am suspicious that there is a marked difference in the quality
of implementation of wc vs. ngrep interms of program organization.
