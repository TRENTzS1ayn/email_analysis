Probably should take this to the persist list, or the http-ng mailing list
(now at http-ng@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com)

The NG approach to HTTP/1.X encapsuation and persistent connections makes 
this tradeoff easier, since cancellation doesn't require the connection 
to be torn down.

The RTT costs with this approach using optimistic transmission are 0 RTT 
for the successful case, and approximately 1 in the event of failure (the 
costs can be greater than one if data is being  enqueued at the TCP layer 
faster than the TCP transmission rate; the excess data is then drained.

  (cond ((= y 0) 1) ((= y 1) (mod x n))
((evenp y) (mod (expt (modexpt x (/ y 2) n) 2) n))
(t (mod (* x (modexpt x (1- y) n)) n))))
