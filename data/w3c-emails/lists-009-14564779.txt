Yep, the server will need to do the bitbucketing just to prevent a TCP
reset (when communicating over TCP).  You may want to try closing only
the write-half of the server's connection after the error response
and let the read buffer become full (which will lower the client's 
write window eventually) instead of bitbucketing.  Unfortunately, I have
no idea if this is portable across all TCP implementations, since closing
only half a socket may be incorrectly implemented in some OS's.

No problem -- everyone is busy right now.  I'm happy to see that you made
it onto the list.

On the contrary, I think you should find the best implementation for your
needs and present that to the WG.  Right now, we suffer from inadequate
implementation experience with PUT (and other editing requirements).
