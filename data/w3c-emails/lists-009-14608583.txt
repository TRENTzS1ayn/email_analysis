I agree, doing it this way is the best solution.  Of course, this
implies that the caching/proxy group stops discussing the caching of
negotiated responses for some time.

While the content negotiation subgroup is working out the negotiation
mechanism, the caching/proxy subgroup can work on the caching model
for non-negotiated responses.  There are still plenty of things to
discuss even if negotiation is presumed absent.

According to the current 1.1 draft (Section 12, second paragraph), a
response is non-negotiated if it does not have an URI header listing
the available variants.  I doubt that the content negotiation subgroup
will propose a change of this rule.
