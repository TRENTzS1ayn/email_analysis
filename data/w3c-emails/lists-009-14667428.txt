I see your point, though I wonder how tractable your alternative would be.
To ensure cache coherency using the method I think you are suggesting,
each time a given object is returned in response to any request, the
server would have to indicate all the possible request URIs for which that
object might be returned (in addition, possibly, to the
content-negotiation info by which the object would be selected).

There is also a spoofing issue, especially in the present design with
its Location headers.  We can't let responses claim anything
that would allow the returned objects to be cached under a bogus key
that would allow later requests to erroneously return the object.
This is why people appropriately shot me down some months ago when I
suggested that, in order to solve the duplicate object problem as
mentioned above, caches replace any objects they contain that used the
same Location header.

So, the only thing I have been able to think of that will work --
by which I mean it will ensure cache coherence and also a
reasonable hit rate -- is for the cache to flush any other objects it
contains which claimed the same URI as the returned Location header,
but only if they do not have the same cache validator.
