The question here would be whether the server *knows* that there will 
be no variants in the future.  I accept that it could and often does but
it may not.

The current draft 1.1 does not seem to support this position.  By my 
my reading it is correct to send whatever the server has if it 
have only one choice.  There is no special significance to q=0.0 that I
could find. Just really undesired by the requestor.
