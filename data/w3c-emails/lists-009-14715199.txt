Yes. I'm not sure if this is the right way, but there clearly must
be a way to pre-reject certain content forms. */*;q=0 would I guess 
means don't send anything I haven't listed explictly. But since
this is optional, the client must be prepared to receive junk anyway.

Assuming this is the interpretation or clarification, Jeff's original
comment basically still holds as the proxy would know that the origin
had only one choice and it wasn't acceptable.
