I think the ideal approach would be:

1) to send small files in one-phase PUT (where extra RTT has big effects)
2) to send large files in two-phase PUT (where extra RTT has less effects)

Now, here is a hybrid scheme:

Step one:   send header PLUS part of the data (fit into one packet)
Step two:   wait for "continue" or timeout
Step three: send the rest of the data if there are any 

For small files (ie, header and data fit into one packet), it is effectively
a one-phase PUT while for large files, a two-phase PUT.

Cheers
Zheng
