One additional risk is traffic analysis, as in, "Gee, EDS is sure sending a 
lot of encrypted messages to GM today".  Remember that Kocher's attack on 
RSA involves timing analysis, a form of traffic analysis.  Sending the whole 
PUT could open it up to Kocher's or a similar attack, especially if the 
object being PUT is publicly readable, as some of the data would then be 
known plaintext.
