The multithreaded feature in the Arena is a result of the new
achitecture of the WWW Library of Common Code. It allows data-driven
parsing or rendering as soon as data comes in on the network, and new
requests to be issued at any time. So rendering GIFS before finishing
the text is perfectly possible.
