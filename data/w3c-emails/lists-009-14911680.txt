   That's why I suggested language that would suggest that the 
server have a configuration option for the sysadmin to specify 
wild-cards that would protect against classes of files:

   That way, I could have entries like this in my access.conf 
file: 

<Directory /web/doctree>
<Limit GET>
order allow,deny
allow from all
deny files "..*"
deny files ".*"
deny files "*.cgi"
deny files "nph-*"
</Limit>
</Directory>

   Currently, I have a server that I'm planning to put on the net. 
I am the only user on the system so I didn't see any particular 
risk in having local ACFs in the filesystem until I realized that 
they could be retrieved by a GET. If I could restrict them as 
I've shown here, I would be able to use them.
