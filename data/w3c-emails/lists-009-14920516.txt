   I like the wording here "outside those intended to be accessible", as 
that is more general than what I had suggested. I would also like to 
see some suggestion that the sysadmin be able to specify what is and 
is not "intended to be accessible". 

   Unix, in particlar, is flexible enough that a sysadmin may have 
non-standard filenames for sensitive files. Some do this as an 
added security precaution. 

   This language was in the paragraph that I had suggested earlier:

 + A server should 
 + make a configuration option available to the system administrator to 
 + ensure that this protection is made sufficiently flexible for 
 + site-specific security considerations.
