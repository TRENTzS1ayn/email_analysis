I think your comments on the cachability of POST requests are
well-taken. I would guess that the v10 specification, as an
Informational RFC describing 'current' practice, should soften the
wording to describe what current clients and servers actually DO.

As for HTTP/1.1, there's a cache subgroup that will be meeting, and
perhaps they can deal with caching of other methods. (My guess is that
the 'method' and attached data can just be added to the set of input
parameters that might affect the output of a HTTP call, and that the
primary difference between GET and POST is the presumption of Expires:
for POST is 'immediate'.)
