Sounds very nice! However, as as been pointed out several times, the
reason Netscape is popular is the *reverse*.  It can layout all the
text before rendering all the GIFS.  Presumably arena can do this too,
if it can get the information about GIF sizes.  But the ability to do
*that* is a function of the protocol and hence relevant to the topic
of this list.  :)
