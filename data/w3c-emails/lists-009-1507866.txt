If no information on the size is given in the link, then it _is_ the
same thing. Before you then can get the size of the image, you need to
download the first part of it giving its size, that is issue new
requests at any time when parsing through the text file. Remember, I am
talking from a programmer interface's viewpoint, not a user interface's
viewpoint. The only `real' user interface to me is the Line Mode
Browser ;-)
