 * The MGET causes an extra roundtrip time as many servers will think:
 *
 * "Gee - nobody has told me about this method. I simply refuse
 * to do anything about it"

It seems to me that this could be alleviated by having regular GET
methods on MGET-capable servers return

Allow: MGET

so that the client, after the first GET, knows whether it should send
MGET or GET.

 * This is the reason for waiting with a SESSION method to HTTP/1.1 as
 * Roy points out. Also we would like a more general approach than
 * only having GET as a possibility. A SESSION method can also be used
 * for interactive sessions.

Does the SESSION method you propose allow for servers to mix pieces of
responses to different requests together like HTTP-NG?
