Charsets are not to appear in mime type tags in URI/Alternates headers.
They ave their own slot.  The above examples would be:

This variant below would be invalid by the anti-spoofing content negotiaion
clause because they don't have matching prefixes.  Soemthing more valid
would be:

There is a mechanism for specifying qualities on language, just not on
charset.  so you could ask for "Accept-Language: native-language; ql=1.0,
en; ql=.7" and "Accept-Charset: native-charset" (which implicitly includes
iso-8859-1).

If that is not sufficient, we now that we have Koen's method for reactive
negotiation, by which you will be able to precisely pick which varaint you
want, which might be useful if you recieve the the language you wanted, but
not the charset you wanted. (You recieve TheProject.ru.html, but you realize
there was also a TheProject.ru2.html, so you ask for it by name.)
