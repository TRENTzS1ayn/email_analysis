Holtman paper says (4.6 Alternates):

The type, language, encoding, and length attributes of an
alternate description refer to their Content-* header
counterparts.

Content-Type has charset for text/html entities (for iso-8859-1
it is implicit). Where is own slot for charset? As an extension
postponed till HTTP/1.2?

An example

Accept-Language: ru, *;q=0
Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, koi8-r, unicode-1-1-utf8

Server has alternates with all charsets.  By current papers all my
alternates has the same quality factor.  With what charset I would
receive document, if any, with preemptive negotiation?  In what order
alternates will be present to user agent for reactive negotiation?  Per
drafts the order is significant, because the first alternate is the
best one. Why not to have quality factor charset? Like this

Accept-Language: ru, *;q=0
Accept-Charset: koi8-r, iso-8859-5;q=0.8; *;q=0
