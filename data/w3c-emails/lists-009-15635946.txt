] Digest-MessageDigest has been part of the draft since its very early

[omitted]

The problem is, this is broken when a proxy is involved.  I don't care 
if you enhance the section along the lines of my suggestions, but it 
has to work when proxies are involved, otherwise huge numbers of 
clients can't use digest auth -- perhaps even the majority of users in 
the near future.
