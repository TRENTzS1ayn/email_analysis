] Digest-MessageDigest has been part of the draft since its very early
] versions.  It has limitations. I don't think we are in a position

] agree with Paul that there is not much reason to keep the user, nonce
] and realm fields.  In the fullness of time we can and will create
] stronger ways of dealing with authentication, proxies, headers, etc.

[proposal omitted -- same as in current version]

What about Proxy-Authentication and Proxy-Authorization?  Can they use 
Digest Auth challenges and responses?

My reading of the HTTP spec is that any auth scheme must support both 
origin-server (WWW-Authenticate and Authorization) and proxy 
(Proxy-Authentication and Proxy-Authorization) authentication.
