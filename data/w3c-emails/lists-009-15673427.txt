It always has to go to the origin-server.  Here is a quote from
from section on Access Authentication from  the HTTP/1.1 spec draft at

http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/spec.html

   "Proxies must be completely transparent regarding user
   agent authentication. That is, they must forward the
   WWW-Authenticate and Authorization headers untouched, and
   must not cache the response to a request containing
   Authorization."


The problems you are addressing are important and need to be solved.
But Digest Authentication is not the mechanism to solve those problems.
It is a very small step in the right direction, intended only to replace
a misstep, viz.  Basic Authentication.
