I wouldn't say I _want_ this. 

One could argue that US-ASCII is the default character set in MIME
mail, but historically, prior versions of the HTTP/HTML spec have
specificed ISO-8859-1 as the default character set for the Web.

What I recall someone suggesting recently was that because of the
(IMHO broken) state of current practice, one couldn't safely 
state that user agents actually were defaulting to ISO-8859-1.

Independent of this line of argument, the discussion of internationalization
that went into the HTML 2.0 RFC established the requirement that
all HTML interpreters should use an SGML document character set
that included at least the characters of ISO-8859-1. This
doesn't say anything much about the encoding, but it tends
to imply that support for ISO-8859-1 is a practical requirement
to comply with the HTML 2.0 spec.
