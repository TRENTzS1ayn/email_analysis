Since sending my writeup for variant IDs, which contained a section on 
the Vary header, I found a writeup by D.R.T. Robinson on the Vary 
header -- I think the reason I didn't find it in my search is that he 
posted a URL to it, rather than the writeup itself, thus confounding my 
whole text search for the string "Vary:". His writeup is much more 
comprehensive than mine, and is correct for use other than with 
Variant-IDs. Mine should be ignored.

It turns out that the differences do not break Variant IDs.
