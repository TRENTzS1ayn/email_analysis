Phill,
This brings up some good points, because I would assert that chunked
encoding does not yet have consensus of this working group for anything
beyond experimental use (at this point). I have spoken with several people
who feel that it is an unnecessary mechanism at the wrong OSI level. So as
your paragraph below suggests, it does start to become a problem if people
start shipping/sending out software claiming to be HTTP/1.1.

I will post more a bit later regarding chunked encoding.
