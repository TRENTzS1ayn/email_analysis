I have been looking into the action of posting forms. 

- --------------
POST / HTTP/1.0
Referer: http://************
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/2.0b6a (X11; I; OSF1 V3.2 alpha)
Host: zorch.w3.org:5000
Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, */*
Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 36

action=Submit&text=This+is+some+data

- --------------

Now by my reconing the final CRLF is bogus. I would expect the next 
transaction to start. The HTTP/1.1 spec does not require a trailing
CRLF and the entity is precisely 36 bytes:-

action=Submit&text=This+is+some+data
123456789012345678901234567890123456


This is worrying me, is there a plan to permit footers on keepalive 
transactions and the CRLF is simply an artifact of that. Or is there
a "feature" here that people have been writing code ?


I got the same result from Mosaic:

- --------------
POST / HTTP/1.0
Accept: */*, q=0.300
Accept: text/plain
Accept: text/html
User-Agent: Spyglass_Mosaic/2.10 OSF1V2.0 Spyglass/9
Accept-Language: en
Connection: Keep-Alive
Referer: http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/WIT/Specification/entry.html
Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 36
Extension: Security/Digest
Extension: Payment/FirstVirtual

text=This+is+some+data&action=Submit

- --------------


Is this simply me misreading the 1.1 spec or have we got an issue 
here? It would be "upsetting" to discover that forms handling programs
were dependent on a bogus trailing CRLF to teminate a www-form-urlencoded
data item.
