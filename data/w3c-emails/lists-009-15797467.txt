Actually, I should have put "msg-id" as in MIME, which is defined
by reference to RFC 822:

     msg-id      =  "<" addr-spec ">"

which is actually a bit more complicated than <local-part@domain>.

Suffice it to say that we should come up with a set of suggested
formats.  For instance, I like

     <8fdea782afd3973fg@md5.my.server>

but there are many other possibilities that give us the desired
characteristics of world-unique, must change if content changes,
and should not change if content remains the same (for that Request-URI).

The reason to stay with the MIME syntax is for maximum interoperability.
We should ask Ned if there are any plans/desires to change that syntax
before trying to come up with something more compact.
