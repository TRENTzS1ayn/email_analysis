Good question, but the answer is no (this used to be clear in the draft,
but I deleted the original wording because somebody said it
was overspecifying future versions -- *sigh*).

No conversion occurs within the same major version number.
In fact, that is the main distinguisher between the major and
minor version changes.  Any 1.x proxy can safely forward any
1.x request or response without changing anything except
the Request-Line/Status-Line (it always sends its own native version)
and the Connection, Forwarded, and Host header fields.

Visualizing that ....

              1.0                  1.1
    1.0 UA ---------> 1.1 Proxy ---------> 1.0 Origin Server
           <---------           <---------
              1.1                  1.0

Likewise,

              1.0                  1.1
    1.0 UA ---------> 1.1 Proxy ---------> 1.1 Origin Server
           <---------           <---------
              1.1                  1.1

              1.1                  1.1
    1.1 UA ---------> 1.1 Proxy ---------> 1.0 Origin Server
           <---------           <---------
              1.1                  1.0

              1.1                  1.0
    1.1 UA ---------> 1.0 Proxy ---------> 1.1 Origin Server
           <---------           <---------
              1.0                  1.1

Ummm, not exactly.  All messages within the same major version
(e.g., HTTP/1.x) must be sent with the sending application's native
version supported.  So, a HTTP/1.1 proxy will always forward a received
HTTP/1.0 message with a new version of HTTP/1.1 the Status/Request-Line.

I'd say more, but its time to register.
