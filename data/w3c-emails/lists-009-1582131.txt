There is another important principle, which is generality.  The
Image-Size: header as proposed is incredibly un-general.  HTTP is
supposed to be a generally useful protocol, not just an HTML delivery
mechanism.

If you're going to have HTTP headers to describe meta-information
about entities inlined within the current entity, it should be at
least a little more general, like maybe:

Inlined-Object: foo.gif, image/gif; width=100; height=150; colors=16

although I remain convinced that, in the case of HTML, it's better to
put this information inside the <IMG> or <IMAGE> or <FIG> or whatever
tag rather than make the server try to understand it.  For static
documents, software to automatically update these tags is pretty easy
to write (and is orthogonal to existing servers, rather than requiring
them all to be changed.)  Dynamic documents are built on-the-fly
anyway, so including extra tag information isn't any more complex than
including HTTP headers.

Obviously in either case this information should be considered
advisory only, and if it's wrong the display will flicker as the
presentation is corrected.  People will live with that somehow.
