Hello!

I apologize if this question is inappropriate in this forum, but it does
raise an issue with the current specification that may be of interest to
this group. If it is inappropriate, then please indicate what you feel
would be a more correct venue.

I'm having a problem resolving the "correct" specification for URIs using
the "http" scheme.

In the HTTP specification (draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-05.html) the grammar
shows that "params" are legal in a URI in section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 (http_URL
has an abs_path which allows params).

The conflict is where the HTTP spec refers to RFC 1738, section 3.3. That
section does not show parameters.

Which is the correct form? I would like to use the parameters in a system I
am putting together (passing parameters in the query section is a bit weird
semantically). Most software seems to deal with the params fine, but I'd
like some form of acceptance before relying on this aspect of URIs.

Thank you.
