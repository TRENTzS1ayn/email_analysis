As I said to Ari, I don't really care about CRLF or not CRLF. We can add any 
number of bytes at the ent of the URI and it does not much bother me.

What bothers me is that the content-length given is wrong. If we rewrite the 
www-uri-encoded-form spec to allow (sounds as if we need to require) trailing 
CRLF and give the size of the message as the complete chunk up to and including 
the CRLF.

I know this sounds picky but that is what stards are about:-)
