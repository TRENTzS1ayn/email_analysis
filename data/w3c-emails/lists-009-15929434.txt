Perl's getline (or <STDIN>, etc) uses both CRLF or EOF - when a server is
receiving POST data, and it has received as many bytes as the content-length
header says it should have received, doesn't the server close the stdin pipe
to the CGI script?  Or is it left up to the CGI script to start responding
autonomously?
