Just a thought, but looking at my server there are a number of documents which if I PKZIP them, reduce in side anywhere from 20-60%
As bandwidth becomes more of a premium, and response times more critical as the number of users increase would it be appropriate to implement some form of compression of the raw text in the .HTM / .HTML documents ?

Obviously this would require support at two places - compression (on the fly - as some documents need to refresh frequently, or cached) at the server, and at the browser.
As long as the (de)compression algorithm was fast enought to reduce the overall transmission time there are benefits.
