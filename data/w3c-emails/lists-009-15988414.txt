I'm not [the prime] authority on this subject, but some browsers handle
compress'd and gzip'ed content well.  However, they are not well-behaved
enough to indicate whether they do or not (concerning Mozilla and NCSA Mosaic),
so the server doesn't know about that.

It seems that Accept-Encoding: and Content-Encoding: serve this purpose well,
the browsers just do not seem to send them (although Content-Encoding is
recognized in browsers above, even Netscape2.0 proved not to send
Accept-Encoding, but IMHO this issue may better be discussed through
www-talk [in HTTP/1.0 draft it's covered well enough, just the current practice
stays behind]).

gzip/ungzip proved to be fast enough to speed up transfer, even when fetching
from local server (from the same host).  on-the-fly-compression overhead on
server side may be considerable enough to advise caching of compressed files
(on server), but again we go off the HTTP issues.
