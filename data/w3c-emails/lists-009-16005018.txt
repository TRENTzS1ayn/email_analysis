     I guess the important thing to do is get it drafted into (if not the 
     standard then) recommended guidelines, so if browsers / servers want 
     to support http/1.1 they need to support the gzip/ungzip of the html 
     and data they are transfering.
     
     If will follow up on the suggested reading, reason for this posting 
     was that it seemed to make sense to do to save bandwidth
