I'm told that Vermeer's FrontPage uses POST instead of PUT, DELETE,
etc. in order to modify the content of the backing data storage. Using
POST allows the transaction to include more information, e.g., access
control information for the new information, versioning relationships,
multiple alternatives for variant resources, etc.

"PUT and Derived-From with magic Content-Version" and "PUT and
If-Valid with magic null validator" are less magic than "POST with
magic posted data"?

Does "POST" allow a "Modifies: URI" response header?
