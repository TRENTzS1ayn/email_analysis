Apologies if this is clear in the text, but it didn't seem to be when
I scanned 1.1. Some older proxies seemed to be modifying URLs, e.g.,

if you  

    GET http://foo.com/test#frob HTTP/1.0

they might ask foo.com for

    GET /test%23frob HTTP/1.0

or vice versa. Is there any reason to disallow this, and if so, what
language would be put in the spec to disallow it; alternatively, if
proxies might do this kind of transformation, what should we say?
