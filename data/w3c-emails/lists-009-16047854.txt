Dear All,
        following an exchange on the list of the Spinner web server, it was
pointed out that your working group is already busily formulating an
improved system for caching. Having now read draft-mogul-http-caching-00.txt
I would like to make 2 suggestions as to how the caching system could better
handle the problems of running a web server.

1) It has been noted that Webmasters would like to receive data from the
proxy on how the cache has been accessed, and that there are various ideas
on what information is appropriate. I think the most important information,
affter the number of hits, is the type of browser which has been used. This
defines the version of HTML which can be used, whether java can be added etc.

2) Mostly it is not possible to know in advance when the file will next be
modified. The "customer" may bring a new version the next day, or never.
Therefore it may be sensible for the server to log proxies and send a
message to invalidate the cached version when a file is modified.

Yours
Ian
