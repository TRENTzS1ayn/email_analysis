I believe that caching proxies are supposed to rewrite the Date:
header in a response that is refreshed with a `not modified' response
to a conditional GET.  See the last line of the 304 definition in the
1.0 draft spec.

I don't know if this is actually done, though.

But if the date header is part of the data digested for the
message-digest, this would certainly give problems under 1.1.
