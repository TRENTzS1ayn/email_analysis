There is no such implication of the Date being changed by a proxy in 
the 1.1 section on 304 -- it does say the cache should update its 
stored copy of Date from what it gets from the origin server in the 304 
response...

] But if the date header is part of the data digested for the
] message-digest, this would certainly give problems under 1.1.
