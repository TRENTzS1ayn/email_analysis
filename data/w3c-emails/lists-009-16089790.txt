Any digest that included the URI would be wrong if the URI is munged by 
the proxy. It would break Digest Authentication, for example.

] Apologies if this is clear in the text, but it didn't seem to be when
] I scanned 1.1. Some older proxies seemed to be modifying URLs, e.g.,
]
] if you
]
]     GET http://foo.com/test#frob HTTP/1.0
]
] they might ask foo.com for
]
]     GET /test%23frob HTTP/1.0
]
] or vice versa. Is there any reason to disallow this, and if so, what
] language would be put in the spec to disallow it; alternatively, if
] proxies might do this kind of transformation, what should we say?
