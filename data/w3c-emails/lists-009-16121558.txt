] All the protocol has to say (with respect to cache behavior) is
] "when combining headers from an old response and a refreshed
] 304 response, always use the more recent value for any fields present
] in both responses."

If digesting is going on, the requirement will likely be a little 
stronger -- the cache won't be able to combine headers from different 
responses, so the server should make sure that it always sends a 
complete set, or that it sends a digest of the set that the cache will 
choose to send, and perhaps the cache should detect if it gets 
out-of-date headers.
