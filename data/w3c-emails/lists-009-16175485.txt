I don't think I'm confused about what caches do: the concrete example
you give is exactly the example I would give.

I remember the discussion, and I don't think that now is the time to
restart it.

Yes, it does not really matter.  We seem to be agreeing on what
happens in caches, though we all have different explanations (models)
of how it happens.

What we need now is not some general model, but concrete text.

We need text, that exactly defines how caches must behave, for the new
1.1 draft which should be ready on April 1st.  Whether this text talks
about `responses' or `values' or `entities' as being stored by caches,
is an editorial decision that can be made while writing the text.

Koen.
