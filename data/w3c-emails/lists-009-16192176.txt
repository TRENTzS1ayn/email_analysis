Actually, a proxy munging the URL will cause no problem for digest
authentication.  The URL is duplicated in the uri field of the 
authentication header to deal with exactly this issue.  Of course,
if a proxy munges the Authorization: header then there will be 
problems.

Preventing proxies from munging headers is still a good idea though.
