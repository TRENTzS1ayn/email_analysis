What with all this talk about round-trip time, folks might want to
look at RFC1644: T/TCP -- TCP Extensions for Transactions Functional
Specification.

Also, even without TCP Extensions, I'm told that it seems to be
possible to open a TCP connection, send some data (e.g., a HTTP
request) and request the close of the connection all in one packet.
Of course, few network implementations support this from the sender
size.

================================================================
rom the intro of RFC1644:

   TCP was designed to around the virtual circuit model, to support
   streaming of data.  Another common mode of communication is a
   client-server interaction, a request message followed by a response
   message.  The request/response paradigm is used by application-layer
   protocols that implement transaction processing or remote procedure
   calls, as well as by a number of network control and management
   protocols (e.g., DNS and SNMP).  Currently, many Internet user
   programs that need request/response communication use UDP, and when
   they require transport protocol functions such as reliable delivery
   they must effectively build their own private transport protocol at
   the application layer.

   Request/response, or "transaction-oriented", communication has the
   following features:

   (a)  The fundamental interaction is a request followed by a response.

   (b)  An explicit open or close phase may impose excessive overhead.

   (c)  At-most-once semantics is required; that is, a transaction must
        not be "replayed" as the result of a duplicate request packet.

   (d)  The minimum transaction latency for a client should be RTT +
        SPT, where RTT is the round-trip time and SPT is the server
        processing time.

   (e)  In favorable circumstances, a reliable request/response
        handshake should be achievable with exactly one packet in each
        direction.

   This memo concerns T/TCP, an backwards-compatible extension of TCP to
   provide efficient transaction-oriented service in addition to
   virtual-circuit service.  T/TCP provides all the features listed
   above, except for (e); the minimum exchange for T/TCP is three
   segments.
