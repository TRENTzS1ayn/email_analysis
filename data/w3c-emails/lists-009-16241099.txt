Given that a Variant ID also needs a Validator in order to be useful,
wouldn't it make more sense just to require that the validator contain
the equivalent of a Variant ID when variants are present?

Combined with my other suggestion (to make validators a change indicator),
we could considerably reduce the number of additional header fields
sent on these requests and responses.

In other words, this is the same as my IF-ID/Unless-ID/Content-ID
proposal but without the "world uniqueness" and usage of the <mailbox>
format.
