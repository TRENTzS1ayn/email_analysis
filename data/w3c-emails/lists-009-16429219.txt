  Hi -
   I think we're converging enough on models of caching theory in the
face of content negotiation to ask folks to try to
actually propose wording for use in the sections
for  content negotiation and caching. I think the discussions
about  vary and content-ID is interesting, and seems to
be  converging enough for us to to be talking about the
the words. Not just concepts. OK?
