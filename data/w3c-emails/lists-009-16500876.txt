This does not work because there are still a large number of clients which 
read until the close of connection. Footers can incorporate whitespace but text 
characters would appear en-screen.

I would like to see footers on all messages but I think that this is only 
currently practical with chunked :-(

Perhaps we simply define messages as having optional CRLF sequences for the time 
being.
