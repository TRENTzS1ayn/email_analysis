I was asked to assert that the working group charter was up to date.
Since we've changed the schedule somewhat, I've prepared the following
proposed revised charter, which I hope will be accepted without
objections. (Current official charter
http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/html.charters/http-charter.html).

DESCRIPTION OF WORKING GROUP

Note: This working group is jointly chartered by the Applications Area
and the Transport Services Area.

The HTTP Working Group will work on the specification of the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is a data access protocol currently run
over TCP and is the basis of the World Wide Web. The initial work has
been to document existing practice and short-term extensions. Current
work is to clarify, extend and revise the protocol. Directions which
have already been mentioned include: improved efficiency, extended
operations, extended negotiation, richer metainformation, and ties
with security protocols.

Note: the HTTP working group will not address HTTP security extensions as these are
expected to be the topic of another working group.

Background information

The initial specification of the HTTP protocol was kept in hypertext
form and a snapshot circulated as an Internet draft between 11/93 and
5/94. A revision of the specification by Berners-Lee, Fielding and
Frystyk Nielsen has been circulated as an Internet draft between 11/94
and 5/95. An overview of the state of the specifications and a
repository of pointers to HTTP resources may be found at

http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/Overview.html

A description of HTTP/1.0 as it is generally practiced currently on
the Internet has been submitted to become an Informational RFC.  The
working group is considering enhancements/restrictions to the current
practice in order to form a specification of the HTTP protocol
suitable for eventual consideration as a proposed standard.

GOALS AND MILESTONES

      behavior; content negotiation; authentication;state
      management;range retrievals; extension mechanisms; other new
      methods and header features.

   Apr 96
