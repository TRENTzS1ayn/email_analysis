yes, I was thinking about it. The problem is how a server can extract this meta info??
doing a full text parsing? isn't it too heavy??
A robot could have many advantages using only HEAD request to retrieve all the meta
info related to an html file...but which server handle this kind of info??
Why don't insert among the entity header fields the content of the META HTTP-EQUIV
tag???
