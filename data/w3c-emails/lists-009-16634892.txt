I have *code* which *runs* which covers item 2.

Remember you are suggesting taking the current 1.1 spec and changing it.

Nobody has provided any reason why this should either:-

1) Be any simpler to implement.

2) Allow aggrement to be reached in a shorter time frame.

If people don't want to have a large burden writing code for 1.1 then what is 
wrong with simply specifying a footer but defining no valid entity-footers for 
use in it except for extension-tag?

What is the reason for introducing a broken version of chunked in the 1.1 spec 
simply so that we can fix it in 1.2? That will involve a lot more code and it 
will mean that 1.1 compliant caches and gateways will not know how to interact 
with 1.2 messages.


Why can't people simply agree with *me* in order to move the spec forward?

I generally think that the best specs are those which anticipate the next 
revision. That is all I am saying we should do. 

I'm willing to hear a technical argument. Simply asking me to go along with
a *CHANGE* to the spec for the *WORSE* makes absolutely no *SENSE* to me.


Ted, please at the very least acknowledge that you are the one who is proposing 
a change.
