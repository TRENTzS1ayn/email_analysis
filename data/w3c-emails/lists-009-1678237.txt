Actually, I have not yet proposed any meaningful semantics for a SESSION
method other than it cannot be forwarded.

However, it is natural to assume that it would have similar semantics
to the discussion we had at the HTTP BOF, and thus I should probably give
you a straight answer anyway.  The answer is no, since that would require
tagging each request with synchronization info and would make it vastly
more complicated to implement.  Besides, we have to leave something fancy
for HTTP-NG to implement.  ;-)
