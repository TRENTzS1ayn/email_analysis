A revised draft of the HTTP/1.0 specification is now available from

    http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/
     ftp://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/
and 
    http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/Overview.html

and will eventually be available at an IETF shadow directory near you.

It includes roughly 60% of the changes requested from draft 00 -- we would
have done (and will do) more, but the holidays are upon us.

Happy reading,
