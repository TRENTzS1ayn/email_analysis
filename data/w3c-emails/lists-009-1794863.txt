I think your remarks are a response to something I wrote, but I'm not sure
what.  One concern I mentioned was that a server might want to initiate a
session, something the client wouldn't have known about when it made its
original request.

Consider Basic authentication as an example (ONLY as an example, not
necessarily a good one):
1) Client issues GET
2) Server says, "No, authentication needed".
3) Client issues another GET, this time with authentication
4) Server responds with object.

If the server knew, at step 2, that the client would tolerate a session,
it (server) wouldn't have to close the connection.  The client could do
the GET again on the same session.
