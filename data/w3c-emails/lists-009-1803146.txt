The following section from Draft 01 seems odd.

>6.4.2 WWW-Authenticate

>   response if the server sends back a "401 Unauthorized" Status-Code

I'm not aware that people generally use the realm as a comma separated
list of URIs.  I remember hearing someone say at the BOF that it would
be nice to be able to specify that URIs on other machines can be accessed
as part of the same realm.  Perhaps this section has been phrased
accordingly?

Was this section written to reflect current practice, or was it written to
be better than current practice?
