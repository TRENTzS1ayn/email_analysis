I noticed.  This makes it difficult to compare to an MGET proposal.  I am
eagerly awaiting some description of how SESSION and Connection headers are
going to achieve the same user perceived performance as multiple connections.

I don't mean to be impolite, but I haven't seen much evidence of thought being
given to the issue doing something in HTTP1.1 that can eliminate the
need for multiple connections.  Temper tantrums directed at Netscape don't
count. :)
