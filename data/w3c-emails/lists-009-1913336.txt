I think Henrik got a little carried-away here -- it was a last minute
change prompted by a very good idea, yet I believe it to be in conflict
with current practice (and prior specs) and thus will remove it on the
next draft.

It will probably be proposed for HTTP/1.1.

BTW, if anyone sees something which is in the 1.0 spec, but which
conflicts with current practice in a way that cannot be described
as a "bug" in the implementation, please bring it to the attention of
the list.
