I have no problem at all ... consider the connection is between a proxy
and a client.  It could be quite appropriate for that connection to remain
open for extended periods of time ... that should be a client/proxy
decision.  As this support becomes available, it is important that
the parameters be quite tunable.  For some smart proxies with the 
ability to utilize sessions between themselves and servers to
support multiple clients it is quite possible that multiple
transactions could be intermixed.  Why limit what can be done.

Finally, my experience over many years suggests that the ultimate users
will utilize the facilities we design and implement in ways we have
not conceived of.  Lets not avoid reasonable features because we don't 
know how we would utilize the function.
