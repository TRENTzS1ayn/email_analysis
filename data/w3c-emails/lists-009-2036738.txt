The BNF for Accept (Section 5.5.8) includes *(";" parameter):

       Accept         = "Accept" ":" 1#(
                             ("*" | type) "/" ("*" | subtype)
                            *(";" parameter)
                             [ ";" "q" "=" ( "0" | "1" | float ) ]
                             [ ";" "mxb" "=" 1*DIGIT ] )

though I neglected to add an explanation of why it is there and
an example of how it would be used.  It's also a bit ambiguous,
but I can fix that.  "parameter" is defined under media types.

I will try to clarify that.
