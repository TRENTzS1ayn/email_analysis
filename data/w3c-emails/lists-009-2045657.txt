This is a very good proposal and should be included as part of HTTP1.1.


There are a couple of things I would like to clarify though.

Does this mean the following?

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized<CRLF>
WWW-Authenticate: SimpleMD5 realm="<realm>", domain="<domain>",\\
nonce="<nonce>", opaque="<opaque>", oldNonce="<true | false>"<CRLF>


I.e. should the WWW-Authenticate header be a single line of ',' separated
key-value pairs terminated by <CRLF>?  Is whitespace also ok between
key-value pairs?

Presumably the same format would apply to this:
> 
> Authorization: SimpleMD5        username="<username>",
>                                                         realm="<realm>",
>                                                         nonce="<nonce>",
> 
> response="<MD5response>",
>                                                         opaque="<opaque>"


Another question:

>       <response>
>          The MD5 encoding of "<nonce> <password>".  The resulting string
>          should be a 32 digit hexadecimal string.



Is there a space between <nonce> and <password> that gets encoded?  If
so that should be explicitly stated.  It might be better to use a
visible character there, e.g.  make response be the MD5 encoding of
"<nonce>:<password>".


Finally, what is the intended function (or functions) of opaque?  
It might be nice to have a sentence like "Possible uses of the 
<opaque> string include..."   Things like an encoded timestamp or
for nonce aging or encoded IP address of the client come to mind,
but there are likely other potential uses.
