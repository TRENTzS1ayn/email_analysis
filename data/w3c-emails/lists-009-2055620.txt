If we go with something like an HTTP-based image hinting scheme, I don't
think the rate of adoption is a big an issue as you imply.  A browser like
Netscape could continue to have multiple parallel connections to older
servers if it wanted to.  Path (1) as you've described is really not a path
at all - it's just staying with the limits of what we have today.

I think the most important point you make is that an image hinting approach
will have a greatly higher UPP than a parallel connection scheme, especially
over very slow connections.  The way I see it, there are two main goals:

1) Have the formatted text appear as quickly as possible.
2) Have the entire document with pictures appear as quickly as possible.

Every image that's being downloaded takes away bandwidth from the text.  For
the first goal, image hinting on a single connection clearly wins over
parallel connections.

The parallel connection scheme helps somewhat with the second goal, since
the RTTs are occuring simultaneously.  However, keeping the connection alive
and using an MGET for the retrieval would remove most of the RTT penalty
anyway.  Again, even if the adoption of these enhancements were slow, a
client would still have the option of multiple connections.

Also, my belief is that defining the extensions and getting them into
browsers will propel server authors to add them fairly quickly.  The high
resource utilization of an http server being subjected to parallel
connection clients have been discussed in some depth on c.i.w.providers.
Many providers would jump on a single-connection approach just for server
efficiency reasons.
