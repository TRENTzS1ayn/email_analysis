I see a lot of work has gone into the new draft; it's looking good (but
there do seem to be some surprising additions, such as 'Mandatory'!).

One question which I don't think is covered: if a client sends a
header with more than one Content-Length line, should the server
return an error, use the first (or last) Content-Length encountered,
or just ignore all the Content-Length lines?
