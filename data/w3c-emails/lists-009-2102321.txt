For http hinting to achieve the generally accepted goals, the information
would have to be provided when the rendering engine needs it.  That could
imply that the http server actually analyze the html document for <img>
references or have the reference analysis preformed in advance and stored
in some form so that the http server can anticipate and provide the
information.  If we are in the http-ng timeframe with multiple logical
streams on the connection then of course this is moot but otherwise a
fair compromise might be for a browser to open 1 additional connection for
the purpose of requesting image shape information while the primary
file is transfered.  While some of the costs exists they would be minimzed
compared with four or more images actually flowing concurrently.
