It may get taken out and postponed until 1.1, unless there is a great
cry to leave it in.  It seemed like a good idea at the time ...

Good question -- I'm not sure.  My gut feeling is that if it is received
by the server (in a POST), the server should return a bad request error
unless the lengths are identical.  For clients receiving it from a server,
I would think the client should use the last one encountered.
Does that sound reasonable?
