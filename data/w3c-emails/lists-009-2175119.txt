I would like to see it in there, but II will leave the reasoning
until I send out my paperr.

The last sentence I can agree with. Hence I will not push strongly
for Accept-charset: until it actually appears to be needed. Until
then, the charset parameter will suffice.

I'm *very* glad that content parsing is now a function of
the character encoding system. This will simplify many things.
