Well, my server currently implements 'lazy receive' -- that is, it
only receives data that's actually needed by the script or filter.
For example, if the URI has a syntax error, the script may never do
anything that needs information from the header, and in that case the
header is not received at all.

Similarly, if the script asks for the Content-length, only
enough of the header is received and parsed to find the first
"Content-Length: xxx" line.  If the body data is requested, all the
header is received, of course, but parsing of the header can stop
when the length has been determined.

Hence from a pure efficiency/server point of view, I suppose I'd be
happiest if either the only the first was used, or the state was
(explicitly) undefined if more than one "Content-Length:"  were
specified.  Similar arguments apply to any Request Header fields that
are normally expected only once (such as "If-Modified-Since").  And
clients connecting to my server will get a slightly faster response if
any 'must be parsed for this request' fields are near the top of the
header.
