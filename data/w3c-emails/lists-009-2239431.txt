I'd suggest that (to interoperate well with the MIME software community)
HTTP should allow the same ISO-8859-X codes as MIME (as I recall, X=1 to 9).

Still, advocating something like UTF8 as a preferred transport for
stuff that would otherwise be in multiple character sets seems
reasonable. (I get the impression that Unicode is not universally
loved ... would anyone care to comment more on the down side?)

At what point do char set issues get handed off to the HTML standard?

It seems like some of the alternative glyph rendering issues
could get mixed in with things like font changes and presentation
control (which are possible, though controversial, issues for HTML).

Of course text/html is not the only text/* type we might have to
transport....
