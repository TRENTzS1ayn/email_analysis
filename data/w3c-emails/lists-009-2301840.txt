I certainly agree that Unicode has to win on its own merits, rather than
being stuffed down people's throats, but I think one of those merits is its
ability to act as a character set "hub" for translation. In that way, it
can be used for HTTP without either the content on the server, or the
display end on the client, having to know anything about Unicode. This use
of Unicode is transparent to end users and suppliers of content, and so is
really an internal implementation detail of the client/server protocol.

UTF-7 doesn't strike me as being appropriate for HTTP, since that's a
guaranteed 8-bit protocol. It seems like UTF-8 or UCS-2 would be more
appropriate. I realize people are just using it as an example now, but I
thought I'd point this out.

This actually comes from an Internet draft, not a document circulating on
the mail extensions working group, and this is the next draft of the MIME
spec, so while what you say is literally true, unless the draft is changed
this is what's going to be in the MIME spec in its next edition.
