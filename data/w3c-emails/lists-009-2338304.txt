Well, apart from the various Accept: proposals, not much. Still,
the discussion is broader than HTML, and HTTP must be at least 
a little sensitive to the expected content (or we would not
even have Accept-language:). Nothing lives in a vacuum.

If people generally feel this is not an appropriate place to conduct
these discussions, I would be happy to desist.
