I've produced a new version of my proposal for an HTTP extensions
mechanism.  The easiest way to get to it is through
http://www.research.att.com/~dmk/extend.txt
which will provide pointers to the old proposal and the new one
(.txt and .ps forms).

The new version includes more introductory material to motivate the
proposal and more examples.

The documents have also been submitted as Internet Drafts.

I welcome your comments.
