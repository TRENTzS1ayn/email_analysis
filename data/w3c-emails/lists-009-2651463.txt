Eric from Spyglass posted to www-talk a proposal for using MD5 encryption 
in a system like this a few weeks ago - it looked solid, and I'm waiting 
for a server and a browser to implement it (WN and Arena maybe?) so I can 
set it up for HotWired.

Only until 1997!  :)

rom a quick glance at the list of browsers used on our site, less than 
%2 are more than 4 months behind the current rev of their browser, so I 
don't see that as a huge issue.  However the above statement implies that a 
server can negotiate which type of authentication can be used:

S: Here's a challenge.  Encrypt it.
C: Huh?  
S: oh, nevermind.  Send me your uuencoded password.
C: okay, here goes....

...which doesn't seem to be in the specs anywhere.  I'd prefer not to 
have two separate URL's for different authentication schemes, though I 
could hack around that by keeping around a list of browsers implementing 
challenge-response.
