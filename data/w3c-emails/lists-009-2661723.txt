This does look like a good idea. My one concern is that we'd want to make
sure various extension mechanisms could live together before standardizing
an Extension: header, but they seem to think this is not essential to make
the protocol work.

(Is there any other MD5 PW authentication proposals for WWW lurking around
in draft form? I think I've seen this before, but I'm not sure, and I think
it's been done lately for other protocols, too.)
