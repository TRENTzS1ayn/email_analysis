Is such a definition available for image/*?  Personally, I'd rather avoid
the whole issue, because the next thing someone is going to ask for is:

    Accept-font: YIKES

Pre-emptive content negotiation just doesn't work.  Perhaps we should try
to define a matrix of common client characteristics/behavior, and just
provide a header for that.  E.g. one of

    Agent-profile: graphic, color=24, xwin
    Agent-profile: graphic, grey=8, mwin, unicode
    Agent-profile: graphic, bw, xwin
    Agent-profile: text
    Agent-profile: braille

or maybe not.  I don't see any good way to go about it.
