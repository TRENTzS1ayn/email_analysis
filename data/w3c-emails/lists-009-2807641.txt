The current HTTP draft spec *does* specifically
interpret "Expires:" as a client directive to
automatically reload the data at that time -- i.e. expiry
interpreted as "data expiry".

However, along with Dan Connolly, and others that Bill
Allocca mentions, I also originally interpreted
Expires as a server guarantee to deliver constant data up
to that time -- i.e. expiry interpreted as "URL expiry".

My own example of "URL expiry" without "data expiry" was
that of custom inline images inside FORM-generated
documents, which get deleted from the server
immediately upon retrieval.  According to the HTTP draft
spec, I should not tell the client to "expire" these
images.

Since, "data expiry" and "URL expiry" are independent
issues, as the examples have shown, it seems like we
really need two independent time headers, say
"Data-Expires:" and "URI-Expires:".

According to the current HTTP spec draft, "Expires:" means
"Data-Expires:", and this does seem like the more generally
useful one.
