I think allowing documents to be in a single character set from:
ISO-8859-X for the same values of "X" allowed in MIME is a fairly
non-controversial extension to HTML/HTTP. (Not for HTML 2.0, but HTML 2.x)

Can we cite some outside source for additional character sets names that
will include Unicode and a reasonable assortment of other national
character encodings not covered by ISO-8859-X,  like ISO-2022-JP so we
don't have to act as the body to pick allowed charater sets and wind up
with yet another WWW -specific variation?

It's more important to pick a well-defined name space  than to have all
browsers support everything.

I'm not totally convinced that transferring a whole document in a single
encoding, a la Unicode, is the _only_ way to handle multi-lingual
documents, though I'm not an SGML expert and could use some discussion on
this. At least the characters used in tagging need to be mapping in a
single character set before parsing. (This would seem easier in codes that
have US-ASCII as a proper subset.)

Another possiblity would be to define a meta-encoding for multiple
character sets, where the escape codes to shift character sets would not be
represented in _any_ of the character sets. It would then be up to a
multi-lingual HTML implementer to provide a pre-processor to get this
information into a form an SGML parser could deal with (maybe by
normalizing to a combined  character set, maybe by adding extra markup)
This does sound less elegant than Unicode, but I'd like to hear more about
why it won't work before ruling it out.
