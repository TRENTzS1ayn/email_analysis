Yes, and for charsets we think are needed, but are not within this
namespace, standardisation must be begun.

There is no need for them to be *transferred* as a single character
set, but they must be *converted into* a single character set before
the parser sees the character stream. Why not therefore save the time
and simply transfer it as a single character set in the first place?

Sounds much like ISO-2022... and provided the data is normalised
before the parser ever sees the data, it will work. However, you will
have to convert the data into something the parser understands. What?
What character sets support multiple languages? Then ask yourself: "why
not simply convert to one of those"?

I have never said Unicode must be the *only* character set, only the
*commonly understood* character set....
