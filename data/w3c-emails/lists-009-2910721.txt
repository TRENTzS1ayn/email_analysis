I can live with 

        User-Agent      = "User-Agent" ":" 1*( product )
        product         = token ["/" product-version]
        product-version = token

Note, however, that token has a restricted set of allowed characters
as specified in the BNF.  The reason product-version is separate is
so that I can explicitly state what is not allowed in the version from
a semantic point-of-view.

None of the above.  The HTTP protocol will assume that client authors
will want to give their products suitable product tokens.  Requiring a
registry will not work due to the overhead and market considerations.
However, it would be nice if W3C set up a voluntary registry.

Nope.  This string is explicitly not intended for human readability.
