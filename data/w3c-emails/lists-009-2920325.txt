This has already happened to a degree: information from Japan seldom
leaks out in anything other than English, and that is but the tip of a
growing iceburg. Unicode provides a good common ground.

Yes, and I am very hesitant to suggest using any special purpose
codes. The problem is that there does need to be some standard (low
level) way of saying that some text is in Japanese, and some text is
in Chinese. Now, the real debate is how to represent this, and I think
the recent idea I proposed is not bad.

We *could* say that these codes are simply an artifact of the encoding
(ie. this is UCS-2-HINTED encoding), and say that they *should* be
removed from the data stream once it's received... or we can say they
are STAGO and STAGC for a high-level tag. 

Do you have any complaints about including hints in a transfer
encoding?
