This is certainly possible, and after a certain amount of time, good
caching clients will build up a "working set" of glyphs. In the Plan 9
documentation, they mention that this working set is generally not
large. 

Of course, once free Unicode fonts become available, this will not be
needed (except in cases where we specifically want to use different
glyph images).
