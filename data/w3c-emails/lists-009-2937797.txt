Some browser authors (Netscape, Spyglass) seem to be using 
"product/product-version (platform)" which has the advantage of 
distinguishing between, say, NCSA Mosaic/2.0a8 (Windows) and
NCSA Mosaic/2.0a8 (Macintosh), two distinct User-Agents.  Would it be too 
restrictive to expand "product-version = token" so that it includes some 
reference to OS/platform?
