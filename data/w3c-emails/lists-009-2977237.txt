In this connection, the www-security list may be the correct forum
to talk about the security aspects. It seems to me that it would
help to also spell out to the HTTP list what basic set of headers need to be 
used to negotate the use of this scheme and maintain upward compatibility
with S-HTTP.  

Discussion may have started on the HTTP list because of its readership
or because it has been more active lately...
