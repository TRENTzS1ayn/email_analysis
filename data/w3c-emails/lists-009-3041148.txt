Funny that...I just added a "305 Multiple Choices" to the 1.1 spec last
night for the same purpose, but for handling redirection with URC sets.
The response would be a document, either text/html or urc/*, from 
which the choice can be selected manually or automatically.  Possible
media subtypes for urc would include

    urc/http       HTTP headers
    urc/usmarc     US-MARC data set
    urc/iafa       IAFA template
    urc/tei        TEI SGML header elements
    ...

I can think of many possiblities (some good, some bad), but this way
the URC can be protocol-independent and we can let the market decide
which is the "best" format.
