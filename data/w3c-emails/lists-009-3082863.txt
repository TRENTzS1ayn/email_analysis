I suggested having an encoded (encrypted) password in the server-side
password file.

I certainly agree, and I don't want to imply that I believe this is
bullet-proof security.  The point, though, is that if I grabbed a
password from the server-side file, I could masquerade as a user by
simply entering that user's password to my favorite browser.  If the
password is encoded, I have to go to some more trouble to spoof the
user, because I can't simply supply the encoded value to the browser.
