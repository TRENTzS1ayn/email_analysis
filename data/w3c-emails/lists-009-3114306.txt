They are not the same thing.   HTTP/1.1 is what is being called the set 
of extensions to the HTTP/1.0 protocol which are known to be desirable
for HTTP1 applications but cannot be implemented properly without some
indication that both sides understand the extension.  Some of these
extensions are already listed in the published 1.0 draft -- they will
be split off into a separate specification for the next draft.
NOTE: these are protocol extensions, not server-feature extensions.
