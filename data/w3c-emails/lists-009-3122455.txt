This has been changed for HTTP/1.0.  We will now be using the language tag
defined in <draft-ietf-mailext-lang-tag-02.txt> which will (hopefully) soon
be an RFC.  A full URL is
<http://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mailext-lang-tag-02.txt>
Since it uses ISO 639 as primary tags, it should be compatible with current
usage of language names.
