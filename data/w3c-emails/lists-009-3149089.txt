It is a solution, but not for "most platforms" (I've seen enough
people hunting for appropriate patches to doubt they are
universally available for all forms of Unix.) Then there are Macs
and PCs. (It works with ifconfig derived from recent BSD stuff.)

If we could find a way to do it that would not break existing
stuff, that would be nice. Putting the full URI in a seperate
request header would be safer than putting it on the GET,
but would be redundant.
