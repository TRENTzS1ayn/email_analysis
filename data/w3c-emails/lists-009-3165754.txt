Including the whole URI in the GET would be cleaner except, of course, if you
have an old server.

A new request header would only be redundant if the whole URI were included.
All you would need to do to send the complete information describing the
requested URI would be to send the target hostname or alias in its own request
header field.

Don't muck with the request line, put the hostname in a header.
