Time for $.02 from the peanut gallery. The benefits are not terribly
overwhelming, it serves only a few specific purposes, and it involves the
addition of a single request header. Given that this has been discussed and
requested and discussed again for the past 6 months, why not mollify the
people who want this feature and simply add it to the spec?

Rather than continuing to thrash this around repeatedly in e-mail, just
write the paragraph about it in the standard and let the standards process
finish off the discussion. One of the complaints many have about HTML and
HTTP is that the standards process is creeping at a snail's pace, forcing
commercial developers to strike out on their own when the standards
"keepers" ignore or discard their requests for feature incorporation into
the DRAFT standards.

In the grand scheme of things, this feature requires NO modifications to
existing servers and about a 2 line modification to clients that want to be
compliant. Let's stop talking about it and put a strawman in the standard!
If it turns out to be a bad idea, we can delete it. That's been done
before. In the meantime, it'll stop complaints that the standards process
isn't responsive and accomodate the people who want this feature.
