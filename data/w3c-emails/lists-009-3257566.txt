I suspect that the ability to customize the default page based on 
hostname part of the URL is the single most requested feature from
server maintainers.  I doubt that a week goes by without a thread on
this subject in c.i.w.providers.  The practice of using multiple IP
addresses on a single host for the sole purpose of working around this
deficiency in the protocol is becoming increasingly common. 

Those who are critical of adding a new HTTP header just for "vanity
addresses" should keep in mind that the likely alternative is the
wasteful use of IP addresses just for vanity addresses.
