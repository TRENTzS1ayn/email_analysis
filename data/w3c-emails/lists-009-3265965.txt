Though I can't find it right now, there is actually a web page/tutorial
devoted to using multiple IP addresses on one network interface for this
purpose.

Not only is it likely, it is happening quite a bit.  There are plenty of
businesses buying machines and connections exclusively to put up web
servers, and they often want to split costs with other businesses.

I agree with Roy that some protocol enhancement should drive the addition
of a Host: header.  It is currently possible to put more than one server at
one address by assigning one of them a non-standard port number
(http://www.name.dom/ and http://www.name.dom:8080/).  A Host: header could
provide the same functionality in a transparent manner.  As Chuck Shotton
mentioned, this addition would require no change to servers.  The benefit
-- allowing providers to seperate offerings into categories without making
the user choose from a home page menu -- seems worthwhile.  Not just to
businesses.
