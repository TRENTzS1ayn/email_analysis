While we can imagine changing HTTP's GET to include the full URL or to
ask browsers to include the full URL in the header, fixing it in HTTP
at this point will not have the desired effect of allowing service
providers to avoid allocating two IP addresses to the same host.

In order for this change to be effective, it would have to make its
way into almost all web browsers. I think that's a latency of at least
a year or two now.

Yes, we know net addresses are currently a scarce resource, but trying
to fix this with HTTP at this point just isn't going to work.

I think this should probably be a requirement for HTTP 2.0, but there
is no migration strategy that will make this work for HTTP 1.0.
