Fortunately, the changes on each side are really minor.  In fact there 
are no changes required on the server side if the request is funneled to 
a CGI script (where one would look for the "HTTP_HOST" environment 
variable).

So, client folk, it's up to you.... do I hear any takers?

It seems to me to be the *definition* of something easy to add - if
semantically or systemically there are no objections to it, then browser
authors should be encouraged to take 10 minutes to add it.  In fact, I
don't even see a terrible upgrade issue - if there's a host with multiple 
vanity hostnames going to it, and it doesn't get a Host: header, it can 
give a default page with a list of all pages, whereas if it does get a 
Host: header it can give the appropriate vanity home page.  

In some respects this gets into the need for an HTTP user agent 
definition, possibly even a numbered-level classification scheme.

Agreed.  Now if only I could find my way around X Mosaic source code...
