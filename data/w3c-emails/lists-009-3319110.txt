I think this could be made to work, by a combination of client and server
strategy.

If we assume an intermediate state where half the clients support a full
URL in the request, and others only do a partial, then a upgraded server
receiving a full URL knows what to return, for a partial URL it puts up a
single page advertising the different top level URLs it knows about, and -
as with the migration strategy for form support - URLs of up-to-date
browsers.
