and went on to elaborate on this scheme.

I stand corrected; there is a migration strategy. Now the main
question is whether you want to change GET to reference the entire
URL, ask for a "Hostname:" or ask for a "Full-URL:" in the header with
the entire reference (including, for example, original base URL and
relative address, or # anchor references).

The migration strategy for modifying "GET" doesn't look good, though.
