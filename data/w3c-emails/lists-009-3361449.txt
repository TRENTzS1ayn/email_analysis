A couple of people have pointed out offline that 'Full-URI' is a bad
name for this concept, for sundry reasons (notably, valid translations
by a proxy, such as on an incoming firewall).  A better name, perhaps,
might be "Original-URI".  That is, the full URI that the original user
or agent requested, as distinct from the URI, partial URI, and/or port
that the end-server detected.
