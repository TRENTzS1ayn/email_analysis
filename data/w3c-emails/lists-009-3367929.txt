Well, after reading all the comments, I have come to the following
conclusions:

   1) Too many web developers work on the weekends;
   2) Marketing has too much influence on web technology; and,
   3) There's not much I can do about either one. 

So, which one should we include in the 1.1 specification:

   Host: foo.bar.com

or

   Orig-URI: http//foo.bar.com:8001/home/is/where/the/wallet/is.html

Also, should it be:

   a) recommended for all requests
   b) recommended only for requests to standard URLs like / and /site.idx

I am assuming that it will not be recommended for requests that already
use the full URI, and that will remain the goal for 2.0.  One of the things
that we intend to require for 1.1 is that servers know their own set
of hostnames and do the right thing if they receive a full-URI using one
of those hostnames.  That would not mean that 1.1 clients would send
full-URIs, only that we would have some reasonable hope of doing so for 2.0.
