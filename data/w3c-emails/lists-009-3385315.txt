Faulty assumption #1. Not all Web servers run on Unix. And as time goes on,
Unix will definitely be a minority platform for Web services, just like it
is for all other applications. Relying on Unix-specific abilities to
accomodate a cross-platform need is inappropriate.

Some people don't have $2k to spare. Why should a slow, balky standards
process refuse a specific feature request from thousands of users, just
because a few individuals writing the standard perceive that $2k isn't too
much to spend for a unique hardware platform?

Hello!?! Why are we wasting IP addresses for vanity WWW names? I wish
people would stop trying to engineer some duct tape and bailing wire
solution using multiple addresses and just do the right thing. Add the damn
host name to the HTTP request as a standard field and stop this
interminable e-mail and news discussion.

Given the number of people who have requested this capability, adding it to
the standard would give them a new target for their frustrations - client
and server authors. Their repeated whinings would insure quick acceptance
of this addition across all client and server apps, so we needn't worry
about it being implemented in a timely fashion. The HTTP standards people
have a great resource here if they'd just elect to use it. Give users a
standard that does what they want and let the "marketplace" take care of
the implementation details. It will.

Sure, and a large service provider could easily eat up an entire class C
address on a single server using your scheme. In case you haven't read the
news lately, address space is running out and this is a poor solution.

What you missed were the compelling reasons for it to be a standards issue.
Hacking around with an address-based solution is not robust, not
cross-platform, not economical, and not a wise use of address space.
