Disagree! You're working very hard to put together a good standard. If it
meets the needs of developers and users and gets accepted in a timely
fashion, this will have much more influence on the WWW than rogue
commercial development organizations.

As you mentioned earlier, this is all that is *required*, since everything
else should be in the URL as received. It is certainly is easier to
implement because no parsing is required to extract this info.

On the other hand, this format is a little more work to parse, but contains
valuable information that is often lost or munged when data passes through
proxies, etc. Looking at just long-term usefulness, this version seems to
have a greater chance at being able to support multiple, unforeseen uses.
(it certainly makes implementing proxy servers easier...)

Yes!

No!

Why not be consistent? Proxies can still munge a full URI as easily as they
can mangle a current version. Might as well maintain it unscathed in the
header field where the real server can grab it.
