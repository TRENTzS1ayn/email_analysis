In the draft for HTTP/1.0, in section 5.2.3, it is written that POST could
be used to extend a document during authorship.

I have two doubts:
- does any standard (maybe HTML) talk about "authorship"?
- how could this extension cope with the fact that POST creates a 
subordinate document?

ciao, .mau.
