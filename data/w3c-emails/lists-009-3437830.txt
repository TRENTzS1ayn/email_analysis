It is intended for situations where a server allows clients to
append information to an existing resource.  A close analogy is the
notion of a guestbook, where a GET retrieves the current book and/or
form and a POST adds what was posted to the book.  The entry posted
is subordinate to the book, even though it may not have its own URI.
