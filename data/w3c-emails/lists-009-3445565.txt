I am sorry to peruse this list (and Roy time!), but is seems that 
www-talk is down - and yes, I am subscribed to it.

Am I correct in inferring that the only difference between a (generic) client
and a user agent, as far as is concerned in HTTP specifics, is that the 
latter is *your* client which is making requests (or maybe just the part of
the application devoted to this)?

If not, I'd be grateful if someone could show me the difference. I am 
often really dumb :-)

ciao, .mau.
