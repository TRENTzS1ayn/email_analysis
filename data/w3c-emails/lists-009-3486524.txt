The Internet-Draft for SimpleMD5 needs another revision to incorporate
changes resulting from feedback.  The change you mentioned has already been
addressed, we just haven't had time to put out the new draft.

BTW, it never was a *real* Internet-Draft, since I never submitted it to
the IETF yet.  We will.
