Some of the capability you discusss has been in the WN server since its
beginning and in it predecessor GN.  With the WN server, for example, the
URLs

http://host/dir/foo;bytes=15000-25000
and

http://host/dir/foo;lines=256-1024

request the corresponding byte and line ranges of file foo.  The lines
version is only allowed for files of type text/*.  The content-type is
often changed.  E.g. a line range from a text/html file is given
content type text/plain.

This has more uses than you might expect, primarily with text/plain files.
