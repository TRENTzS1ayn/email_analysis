A revised draft of the HTTP/1.0 specification is now available from

    http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/
     ftp://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/
and 
    http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/Overview.html

and will eventually be available at an IETF shadow directory near you called
    draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-00.{txt,ps}
You can tell if you have the right draft by looking in the upper-left
corner of the first page for the filename.

It includes all of the requested changes from prior drafts and is
almost complete (only missing a description of URI and a couple
appendices.

No diffs are providided, since almost all lines have changed.
This would be a good time to read it very carefully and send comments
to <http-wg@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com>.

Happy reading,
