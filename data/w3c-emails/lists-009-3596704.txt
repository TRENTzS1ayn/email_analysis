HTTP-NG and HTTP 1.1 are different;

HTTP 1.1 is a collection of minor modifications to HTTP 1.0 that are 
mostly backwards compatible, but which are too major to make into into the
HTTP 1.0 spec. 

HTTP-NG is rather more distant from HTTP 1.0 in syntax; it is a binary 
protocol designed for higher performance and better integration with 
security and payment schemes. A more detailed draft of HTTP-NG is currently
under preparation for Danvers (Dave Raggett will be translating from 
Simonese to English).
