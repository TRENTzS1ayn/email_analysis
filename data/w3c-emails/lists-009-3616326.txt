Partial document retrieval based on the original URL is not consistent
with the semantics of HTTP URLs, where the data returned is not at all
required to be idempotent with the original data.

FTP has the same flaw: the file being FTPed could have changed without
your knowing it.

I suggest if you want to do this that (a) HTTP GET should return
(optionally, of course) a unique ID for the actual content. (MD5
signature, or at least name & date). (b) any attempt to GET_PARTIAL
take the ID rather than the rest of the URL.
