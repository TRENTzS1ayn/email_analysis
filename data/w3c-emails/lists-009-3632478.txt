I think this should only be a transport issue, not a document issue.

Thus I think it is inappropriate to put bytes ranges into the URI.
If you do put byte ranges in the URI, then you are trying to identify
part of a resource; as Owen Rees said:

Whereas a transport protocol feature that allows partial document retrieval
is not attempting to name parts of resources. It's up to the client to
decide whether the data it was sent makes any sense in the context of earlier
retrievals. Obviously you would want the server to add object-body headers
to help the client, such as unique resource ids, last-modified dates etc.
