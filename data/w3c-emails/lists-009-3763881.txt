Paul...

I suspect that this message would be best dealt with on the HTML mailing 
list - anyone have the address handy ?

As regards your tag, I would have my doubts about the partition of documents 
based on the speed of network connections --- I reckon that the encoding 
of a document should be as independent as possible of its storage and its 
transmission. Maybe if you had some other rationale for the 
partitioning of documents....

Besides, I think authoring is such a problem in W3 already, that 
allowing 3 sub-documents within one document is only going 
to mean messier documents and much increased workloads for document 
authors and maintainers.

What about a special summary tag ?
Doesn't the latest version of HTML have provision for this sort of thing ?
