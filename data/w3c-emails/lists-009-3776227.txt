Yes, you missed it.

Of course not.  What was under discussion was a feature to add to HTTP/1.1.
<http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/current/0089.html>
Note, however, that there was no consensus on the name or the contents
of the header.

I'd like to strongly encourage everyone to pore through the HTTP/1.0
specification FIRST and send in their comments (if any) before getting
into a discussion about 1.1 features.  Sometime this week, Henrik and I
will produce a draft for HTTP/1.1 which will be a basis for discussion
at the IETF meeting and (hopefully) will allow us to focus some of the
discussions on this mailing list.  It will include an Orig-URI: request
header.
