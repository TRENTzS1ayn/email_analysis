Since many browsers display parts of a document in the order they
arrive over the net, implementing faster display of one part
of the document might require messing with HTTP transport based
in the HTML markup, to send subsections in a new order (ick).

In addition this might require both the client and server to
pre-parse the document for this tag before display and transport
respectively.

The overhead involved in departing from a simple linear processing
order could produce an actual performance loss.
