Discussion of this sort of thing belongs on <www-html@www10.w3.org>, rather 
than the IETF HTML WG list <html-wg@oclc.org>.

The idea looks like Ted Nelson's "Stretch Text" which goes back to 1975! See 
<URL:http://fire.clarkson.edu/deuelpm/Stretch/intro.html> for ideas on 
verbosity level based on reader interest.

There is an interesting question if resources can be delivered at different 
verbosity levels. Is this an issue of naming best handled in the URI, or is is 
a matter for the protocol? Note the similarity to the question of delivering 
partial documents. Suppose I have retrieved something at verbosity 50% and I 
want to increase this to 70%. Can I retrieve the difference and merge it, and 
what impact would this have on the names, the retrieval protocol, and the 
representation of the resource?

I think this is an interesting idea but I don't have time to pursue it at the 
moment.
