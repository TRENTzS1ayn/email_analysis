>1) Should the server use the header's "uri" value when it calculates A2?
No, the value used must be the one given in the authorisation line. The other
value may get changed by intermediate proxies.

Yes.

Dosen't matter.

It can't be defined for all sites in the RFC. An indvidual site should have no 
difficulty determining what their policy is however. then it is a matter for 
server designers to be smart and work out how to be very flexible.

No, the server simply needs a set of translation rules for the URL. This should 
be the complete set of translation rules which it has knowledge of. The URL is 
then translated according to these rules and compared to the cannonical form of 
the header URL.

MASSIVE KLUDGE ==>> 
Sounds difficult? Not really, very few people have translating proxies 
and those who do can probably perform the authentication at the first proxy and 
attach a secondary authentication. The sort of situations where this would be 
used would be a main server with an auilliary backup such as an intelligent 
search engine which is only occasionaly referred to.

In other words this is pretty much a theoretical issue at this moment. 
But for a very limited number of people it is not. That is why the specification 
is the way it is.

Its worth pointing out that in the original specification the URI was 
not even present...

This is true but unhelpfull...

The problem is not just that the information is passed en-clair. Mallet is able 
to bypass the authentication system so that he has greater access than that of a 
pure passive lisner.

Personally I would prefer to encrypt the content using the shared secret 
(modified in some manner) and DES or IDEA. I did think of suggesting this at the 
time but then of course we are into massive ITAR problems :-( But no patent
problems :-)

 
We should probably have a bridge note written since S-HTTP has lots of shared 
secret mechanisms. Since we now have a shared secret we should employ it...

The simplest mode would be to take the shared secret key  [MD5 (password, 
domain, username)] and XOR it with some random 128 bits. Then use the first 64 
bits for the key and the other 64 bits for the IV of the cipher. (PKCS #5). The 
random bitstring is needed because one should attempt to limit the quantities of 
ciphertext sent under the same key.
