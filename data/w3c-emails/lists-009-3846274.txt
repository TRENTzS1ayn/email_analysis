Thanks for the pointer! It seems the threading on the mail archive is a bit
funky. The "next in thread" link from your message (0089) leads to Chuck's
message (0072), which I got to from somewhere else. Unfortuantely, neither
of the back-pointing links in 0072 points to 0089, so I never saw your
message.

Folks traversing the archives by thread, beware.
