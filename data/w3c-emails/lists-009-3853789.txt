1) Intelligent servers should be able to break up long documents as
necessary (though lack of HTML structure makes it more
difficult). This is more a question of how to send the data, rather
than how to mark it up. DynaWeb does this with large SGML documents.

2) Given <DIV> and the CLASS attribute, it seems quite possible to do
much the same thing by hiding an element and all of it's children
based on some condition.

3) Your proposal still requires the data to be sent to the client, or
the server to parse the data and send only the higher priority
items. You do not specify a way of stating a preference to the server,
and besides, if you parse the document, you should also be able to
break it into pieces, bringing us back to comment 1.
