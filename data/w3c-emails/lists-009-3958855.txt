An "include" capability could provide other benefits. For instance,
only the parts of a document that the user is allowed to see can be
returned, and reconstituted as a single logical view. This would allow
sites that currently support both an internal and an external home
page to have just one home page.

I thought I stumbled across a server once that was supporting an
include capability, but I no longer remember what it was. Anyone else
have a pointer?
