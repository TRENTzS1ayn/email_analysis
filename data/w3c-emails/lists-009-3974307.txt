Earlier I raised a concern about MD5 and the case (upper or lower) used
for the hex output.  There's a more fundamental problem.  I believe MD5
defines how to get a 128 bit digest of a message.  WE have to define
how such a string of bits gets converted to ASCII characters:  byte
(and nibble) order, prefixes (0x?) or suffixes, and case.  "It;s
obvious is an unacceptable answer when you're defining
inter-operability standards.

The case problem (is it 789ABCDEF or 789abcdef?) is important because
digests of A1 and A2 themselves get digested in <digest>.  Clearly a
digest of 789ABCDEF is different from a digest of 789abcdef.

Here are some proposed words:

1.3, MD5 Digest

For the purposes of this Standard, an MD5 digest of 128 bits is
represented as 32 ASCII printable characters.  The bits in the 128 bit
digest are converted from most significant to least significant bit,
four bits at a time to their ASCII presentation as follows.  Each four
bits is represented by its familiar hexadecimal notation from the
characters 0123456789abcdef.  That is binary 0000 gets represented by
the character '0', 0001, by '1', and so on up to the representation of
1111 as 'f'.
