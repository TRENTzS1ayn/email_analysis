If we extend Digest authentication to support encryption, then it becomes
Something Else.  This newly created Something Else may be a really good
thing to have around, but it will indeed have "massive ITAR problems".
Digest Authentication is being proposed for inclusion in HTTP/1.1.  I don't
think we should make ITAR an issue in HTTP/1.1.
