Some notes on current practice (from the latest versions I've seen):

* Sends Accept: with at least one q value --
Spyglass 2.00a1, OmniWeb/0.7.5.5, ATSON-W3LM/1.0 beta

* Sends a list of accepted types, including */* but without q values --
Lynx 2.3.7, WinMosaic 2.0a8, NCSA Mosaic for X 2.5b4, AIR_Mosaic
3.07.04.02, GWHIS/110, Netscape 1.0

* Sends just a list of accepted types, without */* or q values --
MacMosaic 2.0.0a17, Netcruiser 1.10 beta, MidasWWW 2.2, EI*Net/0.1

In addition, Emacs-W3 sends a list with some subtypes wildcarded, but 
does not list */* (yay Bill); and Chimera 1.0 just sends */*.  Lynx and 
Emacs-W3 (at least -- probably others as well) modify the Accept: list 
based on your preferences.

[Of those that send q values, ATSON-W3LM and Spyglass 1.x appear to use 
them correctly.  OmniWeb sends '*; q=0.500', omitting the wildcard for 
subtype.  Spyglass 2.00a1 (Win32) sends '*/*, q=0.300', using a comma 
instead of a semi-colon, but presumably I have old information on that 
count.]
