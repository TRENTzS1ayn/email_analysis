This is known as "folding" on some editing/hypertext systems. 

If we are only interested in folding as a means to allow readers to skim 
through text and selectively reveal interesting bits, then this just 
requires a new tag in HTML and browsers that will fold/unfold text in 
response to this tag. 
Aside: Should a recursive fold be allowed ?

However, if we are interested in folding as a means to reduce network 
traffic, then things get somewhat more complex as has already been 
suggested by others.
