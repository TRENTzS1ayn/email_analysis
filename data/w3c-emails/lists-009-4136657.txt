I disagree.  I think the choice of base64 vs. base16 is purely arbitrary,
since the space savings is hardly significant.  John Franks has already
implemented Digest using base16 in his WN server.  Spyglass has already
implemented Digest using base16 in our client, which is shipping.  My
understanding is that Netscape has implemented Digest using base16 for a
future release of their server.

I see no compelling reason to change to base64.
