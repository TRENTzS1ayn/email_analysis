Section 8.1.1 of the current draft says:

   HTTP does not require that the character set of an entity body be 
   labelled as the lowest common denominator of the character codes 
   used within a document.

I suggest you change this into

It is recommended but not required that ...

because otherwise you encourage people to send something like

Content-Type: text/html; charset=KOI8-R

and have me change my font even if the message is plain ASCII.
