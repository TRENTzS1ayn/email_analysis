Another way of doing it, obtaning good sides of both approaches 
is to use the "lines" query approach found in servers such as GN.
In this way you can have a small file with the table of contents
and then refer to the specific parts of a big .htlm document
by line references. This caters for the guy with the small bandwidth.
As it is still one monolitic document, document-wide searches can
still be done conveniently.
