Would this be different from the current header

Link: <mailto:e-mail_address>; REL="made"

Many people find the Link header cryptic, perhaps because of its
generality, but I think it supplies the information you want.  I
don't know if this is widely used, but it is used by the WN server
(by default for all files -- even non-HTML files).
