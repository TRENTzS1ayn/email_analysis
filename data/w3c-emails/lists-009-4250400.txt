The problem with flattening is that you can drag in all kinds of
things you don't want, and what happens if it said "flatten 1000"!

DynaWeb has a parameter on the URL called MAXBYTES. Once the data size
exceeds this, it tries to generate a TOC. By setting MAXBYTES to some
large number, you can retrieve entire documents. No browser changes
needed.
