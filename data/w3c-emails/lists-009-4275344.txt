I recently came upon this question while moving a web server from one machine
to another. The need was to keep some executables and cgi scripts on the 
original machine. 

What appears to happen when a POST is redirected is the client attempts a
GET at the new URL so that the user can fill-in the form again (it may have
changed when it moved)

Is this "correct" handling? (It seems reasonable but the specification doesn't
say what the browser is expected to do)
