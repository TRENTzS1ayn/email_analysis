What's more, HTTP should be considered transport independent. Relying on
something as cheesey as twaddling the underlying protocol to do something
that should be under conscious control between the client and server is a
gross hack. Either build the mechanism into HTTP or live without it.
Hacking the transport layer as a means to this end is a recipe for wreck
and ruin the minute someone sticks this protocol on top of something
besides TCP/IP. Remember, WWW != Unix and HTTP != TCP/IP.
