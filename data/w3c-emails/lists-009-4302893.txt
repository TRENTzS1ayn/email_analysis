That sounds broken, IMHO.  The source of the form has nothing to do
with the Action method of it.  For example, I frequently use a small
form which I took from http://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/archieplexform.html,
trimmed, and embedded in my home page.  When I submit the form, it
posts it to src.doc.ic.ac.uk via http.  If the redirect meant I had to
fill in the form again, I wouldn't be happy at all.

Or maybe this is a psychological tactic, to encourage users to update
permanently moved links...

For temporary redirects, it's definitely wrong (for example, the redirect
may depend on the form data).
