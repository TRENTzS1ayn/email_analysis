No, not at all.  On Unix, every file already has an owner, and I could

The response From: could and should be optional as the request From:

> Link: <mailto:e-mail_address>; REL="made"

This would have to be REV="made", not REL.

From: would provide better compatibility with the existing tools for
rfc822 messages than Link.
