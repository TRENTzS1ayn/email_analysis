In real life the Unix UID that "owns" a document may have nothing to do
with the author,  for example on a CWIS where everything is posted by a few
people.

There are already HTML solutions in wide use for indicating/contacting the
author of HTML docs, including <LINK REV="made" HREF="mailto:..."> and
mailto: HREFs in the body of the document. It's not worth messing with the
HTTP protocol to add another, IMHO.
