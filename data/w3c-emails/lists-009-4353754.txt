Further, for security, many systems have the owners of many or all
documents have "noshell" login accounts where mail would go and probably
either never be read or get forwarded to someone who knows nothing about
the content of the file.

The return email address is much more likely to be useful if it is part of
the content of the document, not generated automatically by the server.
