There are several pages on the Web ("The Revolving Door" comes to mind)
which, on the basis of form input, redirect you to one of a number of
different pages.  These pages then need to be retrieved using GET.  This
usage appears to be much more common than a redirect where the client is
supposed to POST again on the target system.

At a very early stage of development, Enhanced Mosaic would actually do
another POST after a redirect.  In every case that this happened, it
generated incorrect results (like an "Action not allowed" response).  I
think that switching to GET after a redirect is current practice for most
browsers.
