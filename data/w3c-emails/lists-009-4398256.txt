RFC1738 is not yet a standard, but it will indeed be referenced in that
section.  RFC1738 does not fully define http URLs -- it assumes that
they will be defined within the HTTP specification.

I have received two comments to that effect.  Since HTTP has never allowed
"+0000" and no application uses it, I will not put it in the HTTP/1.0 spec.
However, we can talk about it for 1.1.

okay

No it would not.  There is only one message in that case.  This situation
is identical to the handling of messages by proxies.

It can if the HTTP server is a gateway to Mail/News/etc.

It has nothing to do with the entity -- only the message syntax.

Unless it is included in a PUT or POST of a new resource.

It should be interpreted as the suggested version of the entity.
The above quoted sentence will be changed to refer only to non-content
requests.
