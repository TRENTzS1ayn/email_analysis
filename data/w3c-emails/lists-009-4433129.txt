The applications I have in mind are bulletin board or bug-tracking systems.
Individual files contain messages from users, stamped with dates/times in
either server time or GMT, which is no problem. However, I also provide an
'index' of recent messages sorted by date, so the users can check for any
updates since they last read the messages. Having that list presented in the
user's local timezone would make it much more intelligable; otherwise they
would have try to figure out whether they have already seen a posting
at '13:25 CET' when they know they last checked the system at 5:15 PST.

I think you are assuming some penalty value for error which may not apply
in my applications. And I don't believe that _all_ time information would
suffer from an attempt at presenting it in the users timezone. I certainly
wasn't suggesting that use of the Timezone information be mandatory.
