This is protocol "candy". If you need to know the user's timezone for your
BBS application, why don't you ask for it when you collect their name,
address, etc.? There are plenty of message oriented systems on the Internet
today that do not have synchronized time bases, yet are able to present
users with messages sorted by date. And the users seem to be able to figure
out which messages have been read or not.

Two particular systems that work this way spring to mind -- SMTP E-Mail and
UseNet News.

And if you REALLY have to know the user's timezone without asking, how do
you expect to accomodate users with machines in more than one location, or
users with portable computers? Your best bet is to build a Whois look-up
into your BBS application and find the physical location of the server,
rather than complicating the date information in HTTP by adding local
timezone info which would diminish the standard time base we have with GMT.
