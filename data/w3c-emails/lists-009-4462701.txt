  Shouldn't the User-Agent field follow 'normal' specs for headers and do
something like:

User-Agent: agent=NCSA Mosaic/2.0.0b1 ; platform=Macintosh/680x0
            library=WWWLib/3.0.x ; other=Whatever

  This would make it a little easier for people like Dave to parse the
string, without having to worry about order of the arguments, etc.  Plus
this would allow whitespace (but not ;) in the specifier.
