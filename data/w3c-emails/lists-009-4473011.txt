Yes, I like Bill's proposal and I've suggested platform in the user-agent 
field before.  This would, however, completely break current systems 
(which tend to look for the text before the first / as user-agent name, 
and can survive miscreant whitespace) that currently work with HTTP/1.0 
requests.  Can we defer this to 1.1?
