Since several people have asked us for this, we have finally released
our modified NCSA Mosaic and NCSA httpd sources, implementing an
experimental persistent-connection version of HTTP.  

These modifications are for non-commercial use, and should in any
case be considered experimental and unsupported.  We don't promise
to fix anything.

The files are in
        ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/net/phttp.tar.Z

Please carefully note the copyright terms.

for more details.
