  Perhaps we could combine the two?

User-Agent: NCSA Mosaic/2.0.0b1 ; platform=Macintosh/680x0 ;
            library=WWWLib/3.0.x ; other=Whatever

  This would still let old services that look for whatever is before the
first / to still get the same results.  And actually is more MIME-y than my
first one, since the platform=xxxx, can now be considered
parameters/extensions to the base 'NCSA Mosaic' value.
