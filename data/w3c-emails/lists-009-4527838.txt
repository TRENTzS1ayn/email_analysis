I think I should have said "The credentials contain authorization
information" (rather than "are"). draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-00 says
"credentials containing the authentication information" (in 5.4.5 and
10), and I would argue that in both the Basic and Digest schemes, the
credentials contain information used both in authentication and in
authorization, but not all of the information used in either
process.

Since the credentials contain information used for both purposes, it
might be better to include the syntax rule for the Authorization
header in digest-aa so that "<credentials>" can be used to replace
"Authorization" in various places. I think I was probably reading the
capitalised word as an arbitrary token naming the header containg the
credentials, without thinking how it would read if the capitalisation
were removed or ignored.
