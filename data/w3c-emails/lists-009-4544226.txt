Yes, but only in short spurts of time.  Cleaning up the HTML spec
(and then handing it off to Dan) will only take a couple days, and
doing it is the only way I can see that it will be acceptable to the
IESG within our current window-of-opportunity.

I am not, however, planning to finalize HTTP/1.0 before tomorrow!
Although it does seem close to being done, it needs some additional
work (on the URI section, for instance) and the appendices regarding
"minimum compliance" will likely be a testy subject.  Fortunately,
the majority of the spec seems to be acceptable to the WG.  Hopefully,
we will be able to submit it to the IESG within days after Danvers.

I was planning to put together a pre-draft of all the issues discussed
regarding what should be in HTTP/1.1 before tonight, but that didn't
happen due to unrelated stuff at UCI this week.  So, I'll do that Monday 
and advertize it broadly enough so that the attendees at Danvers will
have a chance to print it out before the meeting; it will not be a long
document, just a guide for discussion.

So, I haven't gone completely off my rocker -- just balancing on that
edge between stability and chaos. ;-)
