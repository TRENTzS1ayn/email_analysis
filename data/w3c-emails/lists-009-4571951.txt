But those few people will have the write permission on the documents
and know who to forward the criticism to.

What do you do about non-HTML documents served on HTTP?  Do you put
comments on all of your GIFs?

Assuming that an optional header cannot be generated on all machines
is not a valid reason to rule it out for those who could.

For the documents at our server, there is a very strong correlation.

As I said, I was asking for the From: in the response to be as
optional as the From: in the request.

LINK REV="made" is not required either and still it is very valuable
in the documents that provide it.

I find it very convenient that my RFC822 mail transport automatically
places my name in the header so I don't have to type it into every
message.  I am envisioning the same convenience for HTTP.

First thing that I do when I want to debug an URL is to look at the
HTTP header.  It contains all the MIME typing and date information.

I would configure my httpd with MailExchange @cs.tu-berlin.de to have
the mail routed to the mailhost.

I am not arguing that it should vanish from the contents.  I just want
a default place to look at if the document did not provide the address
like I can look at Last-Modified if the contents wasn't dated.


I suggest the following amendment:

7.1.15 From

The From field provides an email address to contact for
changes to the Entity-Body.

From = "From" ":" 1#mailbox

Server administrators may choose to send their own, the file
owners', or no addresses at all with each document.
