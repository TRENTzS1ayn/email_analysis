The problem is that the number of UNIX machines is now a very small proportion
of the Web. The majority of clients connecting to the Whitehouse server are 
Windows. There are as many Macs as UNIX boxes. On the server side there is 
probably a majority of UNIX servers still but we know of a Windows server with 
tens of thousands of installations.

Even if one has a UNIX box the proposed scheme still makes a considerable number 
of assumptions as to the layout and administration of the server. A large number 
of servers ar now run as separate machines and are not simply serving the 
filespace of the users direct. For such machines every document is owned by the 
same userid.

Unless a mailto feature was likely to be reliable it should not be implemented. 
By reliable I mean that the mails should be read. It is a simple enough matter 
to add a `webmaster' line to the bottom of a document with a Perl script. Those 
sites who want such a feature are also likely to want that type of control. A 
from line would not be recognised by every browser so most sites would have to 
also add a webmaster line. This would then generate confusion since the two 
would have to match.
