This is BOGUS. It makes this feature of NO value. Suppose "bin" owns all
WWW documents? Do you think a system admin wants to spend all day
forwarding stuff to the appropriate person? Using the group or owner is
simply a hack that only works in *some* situations on *some* hosts running
*some* operating systems. It is an implementation detail of a protocol that
should be implementation independent.

No, that is what copyright notices and artist/photographer attributions are
for. There are mechanisms in HTML 3.0 for doing this, and that is why I
pointed this out as a bad thing for HTTP to worry about.

I didn't say it might not be a good idea. I said that it couldn't be
implemented in an efficient, usable fashion across multiple platforms. The
proposed "technique" was a hack and it didn't even meet the needs of all
Unix users. HTTP servers ultimately need to sit on databases (object
bases), not file systems. When this happens, things like this will be easy
to implement. In the meantime, the value of such protocol candy is minimal
when other, better techniques exist in HTML for doing the same thing.

But not at mine. Now, whose site is "right"? Extrapolating that all sites
must be like your site is faulty logic...

If it is optional, then it is useless. And if it is required, then it is an
unreasonable invasion of privacy for authors that require or desire
anonymity. You need to understand that there are better mechanisms for
representing authorship via WWW than a header field in the HTTP protocol.
Please read through the URI/URN standards and the HTML 3.0 standard and I
think you'll find plenty of stuff to sate your appetite for features.

"in the documents!!!" Not "in the protocol."

E-mail is for person to person communication. Of course you want to know
where the message came from. WWW is for anonymous publisher to anonymous
reader communication. See the difference? (PLEASE read the proposals for
the URN stuff. It is the appropriate mechanism for doing what you desire.)
