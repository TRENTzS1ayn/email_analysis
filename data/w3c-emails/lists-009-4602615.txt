There is already an HTTP header which has the function you want.
Here is an example from the HTTP spec:

  Link: <mailto:timbl@w3.org>; rev="Made"; title="Tim Berners-Lee"

The question of where the information that goes into this header comes
from is a server implementation issue.  Right now I don't think many
servers implement this.  I know that WN does, but only on a directory
basis (i.e. all files in a given directory have the same mailto.)

Instead of trying to persuade the HTTP community to add an additional
header, why not try to persuade your server writer to implement this
header and to get the information automatically in the way you want.

It really is a shame that this header and others like Expires and
Keywords aren't more widely implemented.  It is even more of a shame
that browsers for the most part completely ignore most header lines.
It wouldn't be that hard to let the user *see* the header lines.
