I tried to read it, but had some difficulty.  The HTML seems to be
screwed up: The table of contents appears like a staircase, the fonts
are extra-large (like everything's a header) and for some reason the
browser won't let me look at the source.

I tried to print it to read it at leisure on the plane to WWW'95, but
only obtained a mess with multiple pages printed on the same sheet.

Something's wrong I'm afraid, please fix it as I am really really
interested in your work.

Cordially,
