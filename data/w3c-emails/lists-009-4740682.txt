Two issues:

1) I've seen other situations where "double-authentication" for a given 
object could be desired - consider it analogous to having two dead-bolt 
locks on your front door.  I'd support some way of doing this that can be 
applied for any new form of authentication we dream up (MD5 digesting, 
SHTTP, etc).

2) If root, directory1, and directory2 were all separate Realms with 
separate password files, then essentially you want all authentication 
info up front (if starting at directory 2 and working back) rather than 
only getting the pair at each level.  I could see this as a security hole 
for the Basic scheme at least, given that people in one Realm shouldn't 
be given the authentication information that another Realm needs.

p.s. - in the future, name/password combos will be stored in encrypted 
form on your Digicash Smart Card which you always keep with you, so you 
may never need to type your password ever more than once.  Wheee!
