A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
Working Group of the IETF.                                                 

       Title     : Mediated Digest Authentication                          
       Author(s) : D. Raggett
       Filename  : draft-ietf-http-mda-00.txt
       Pages     : 12

As the number of commercial services on the world wide web increases 
rapidly, the need arises for a means for these services to authenticate 
clients, and vice versa. A simple scheme can be based on keyed hash 
functions with a shared secret key for each client/server pair. Key 
management becomes impractical for both clients and servers when the number
of participants is scaled up. This document describes a efficient scheme 
for using mutually trusted third parties to mediate authentication, as a 
direct extension of the digest access authentication scheme. The scheme is 
based upon public domain algorithms, and unlike encryption software, isn't 
subject to export restrictions. The main benefits to users include: 
avoiding having to enter separate user names and passwords for each 
service, and an ability to authenticate servers. It is proposed that the 
mediated digest authentication scheme be included in the proposed 
HTTP/1.1 specification.

Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-mda-00.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.

For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@cnri.reston.va.us.

implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
