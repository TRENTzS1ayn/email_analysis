Pain yes, ill-specified no.

Yep.  When I wrote the initial specification of headers and comments,
I decided that allowing \ to mean escape would break too many existing
parsers.  This is still my opinion, though if a consensus says otherwise
I will change the draft.

Meaning what?  Only an *empty line* ends the headers of a message,
and an empty line is not allowed in a comment.  A line containing
space or HTAB is not an empty line.

p.s.: Conference Hell is upon us all -- I am just now getting through the
      mail amassed during the IETF trip, and am now about to embark on a
      two-week trip through California, Oregon and Washington
      (WebWorld and ICSE-17).  Henrik is in Denmark as well, so don't be
      surprised if mail goes unanswered for a while.
