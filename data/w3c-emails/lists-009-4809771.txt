Usenet doesn't allow the full glory of 822 either.  In general, Usenet
doesn't allow comments except in a particular format for From lines,
and *sort of* single-word unknown timezones.

I'd drop comment support unless you use a really limited subset of what 822
allows.  Doing this still allows you to re-use all that wonderful existing
822-parsing code, but makes it easier on those writing from scratch.
