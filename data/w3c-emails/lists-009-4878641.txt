On the contrary -- it works just fine, sortof :-).  I did forget to mention
that this particular server requires the Extension: Security/Digest header,
as mentioned in the draft.  If you send that header along, it will function
correctly.  It's behavior without the header is kind of questionable.  This
is just a copy of NCSA httpd 1.3 which I hacked to support Digest.
