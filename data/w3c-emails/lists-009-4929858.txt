I have to disagree:
1) Only a few headers need opaque.  We're not burdening all, or anywhere
close to all, of them.

2) It's a nuisance for the server to have to collate information from
two different headers.  In particular, if Opaque: has pieces that are
labeled for different other headers (if I understand what you're
proposing), then a server must, for example, parse both the Session-ID
and Opaque headers to figure out what's going on.  It's much simpler to
keep all the information together and parse a single header.

If you're assuming that there's a relationship between the value of
Opaque for Session-ID and the value for WWW-Authenticate, I think
you're wrong:  I don't think they have any connection.  Certainly
there's no obligatory connection.
