Of course, but once one adds a special opaque field then everyone who
'owns' a header will add their own, too, citing the precedent.  I'm
looking long-term, here, and seeing (from bitter experience) the thin
edge of a combinatorial wedge, where every header has every possible
combination of attribute from every other header.

Not necessarily.  Most servers have to handle several headers already
(Last-Modified-Since, Content-Type, Content-Length, etc.)  Assuming
there's a reasonable internal lookup-by-name
