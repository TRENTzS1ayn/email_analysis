Of course, but once one header adds a special opaque field then
everyone who 'owns' a header will add their own, too, citing the
precedent.  I'm looking long-term, here, and seeing (from bitter
experience) the thin edge of a combinatorial wedge, where every header
has every possible combination of attribute from every other header.

Not really.  Most servers have to handle several headers already
(Last-Modified-Since, Content-Type, Content-Length, etc.)  Assuming
there's a reasonable internal lookup-by-name routine, it's no more
expensive to look up a separate header than to look up a field within
a header.

You're right for special-case parsing code, but that doesn't work, long
term, or help much if you're asking a script-writer to handle new
headers.

I think the value of Opaque -- due to its generality -- rather outweighs
its value for either of those specific uses.  At present, I'm adding
hidden fields in fake forms in documents (which have no forms otherwise)
simply to achieve the Opaque effect.  I'd much rather do that at the HTTP
level, where it belongs.
