One further comment on HTTP's state(less/full)ness.

If retrieval is truly a stateless process, then the probability of a an 
object being requested will be independent of any previous object 
requests. Any perusal of activity logs will show that this is clearly not 
the case- if a page with links is requested, any links on that page will 
have a higher probability of being requested than if the page that links 
to them had not been fetched.
