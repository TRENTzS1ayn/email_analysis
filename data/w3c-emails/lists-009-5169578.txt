Unfortunately, I can't make it to Stockholm to chair the IETF HTTP working
group meeting, but Dan Connolly has agreed to chair the meeting in my
absence.

Can those of you planning on attending the meeting, please post your
suggestions for agenda items to the http-wg mailing list.

I am almost back online following my relocation to MIT and will be
working away at my email backlog as fast as possible ...
