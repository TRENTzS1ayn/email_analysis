Many servers are now incorporating internal metrics, and the server can
decide how long to hold open a connection based on some (hopefully correct)
internal measurement. Even a guess of 5 or 10 seconds seems reasonable for
most sensible cases.

I imagine that all servers will allow these timings to be specified in a
configuration file.
