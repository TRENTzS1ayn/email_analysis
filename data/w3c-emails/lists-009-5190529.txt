I'm glad to see that you are considering digest authorization 
for HTTP.  I noticed a few security holes that may be of
concern:

- the server's digest database of H(<username> : <realm> : <password>) should
receive highest security.  To the knowledgeable user, it is the same as 
storing passwords in the clear.  This is a weakness of the digest
method.  The passwd file in UNIX that is used for "basic" authorization
may be released without compromising strong passwords.

- the reuse of stale nonces is a convenience that allows a user to
act as another user.  The server should at least require that the return
IP address be the same as before.

- the <message-digest> places the nonce before the <message-body>.  
Cheswick & Bellovin '94 [Firewalls and Internet Security p.222]
report a security hole noticed by Tsudik '92 [IEEE Infocom].  They
recommend placing the nonce after the message.
