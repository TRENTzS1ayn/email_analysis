That helps, but I have a quibble.  I would prefer not to tie the username
and password so strongly to a particular realm, because:
    1) I might like to change the name of the realm (if only slightly).
    2) I might like to use the same password file for more than one realm.
Each of these is impossible if the information in the password file
has the realm embedded in it.

While I have the floor (:-), I'll reiterate my standard quibble about
realms and prompts.  Currently they are identical.  That is, if I tell
a browser that the protection realm is "foo", the browser asks for a
name and password for "foo".  I would prefer to be able to specify the
prompt separately.  So, the prompt for realm "foo" could be "World War
II Euphemism".  I think the name of the realm is a denotational matter
between the client and server, whereas the prompt is something the
browser shows the user.
