I have to agree with this first quibble quite a bit. In an actual product
implementation of message digest we have had some issues arrise because if
the server operator wants to change their realm, their entire user/password
database suddently becomes inoperative.

Any chance that we could (if there is some move to change the digest draft,
for example to move the location of the nonce), change the inclusion of the
realm in there with the username and password (The A1 substring)?
