Fair enough.  How about using the server-name in place of realm, then?
(After all, it's possible two webmasters might choose the same realm
name on different servers, isn't it!) That would render the same
username/password combination unique on different machines.  So the
stored hash would be:
H(<username> : <server-domain-name> : <password>)
