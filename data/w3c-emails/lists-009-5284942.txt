This would mean that only one hostname could be used in the URL.  I.e.
even though host.com and www.host.com are the same host, one of the URLs

http://host.com/secret.doc
and
http://www.host.com/secret.doc

would have to fail even when the user supplied a valid username/password.
This would be a serious flaw.

Keep in mind that the realm can be any (reasonable sized) string supplied by
the server maintainer.  Thus choosing a realm like

myrealm@www.myplace.com

is probably a good idea.  This would prevent another server maintainer
accidentally choosing the same realm.  If another server maintainer 
maliciously chooses the same realm, at least that fact is displayed
to the client each time access is requested.  If you connect to 
www.myplace.com and see a realm with somewhere.else.com in it you 
should be very suspicious.
