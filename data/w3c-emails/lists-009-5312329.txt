I disagree with the premise.  I wouldn't encode the domain name that
the user accessed to reach my server.  I would encode the name that the
server uses for itself, for example the name set by NCSA HTTPD
ServerName directive.

Thank you for motivating my second quibble, namely:  I want to be able
to specify a (user/password) prompt independent of the realm.  I don't
think much of a realm named "myrealm@www.myplace.com", but maybe I'm
perverse.  I prefer
Enter username for [prompt that I specify] at www.research.att.com:
to
Enter username for myrealm@www.myplace.com at www.myplace.com

Evidently (sigh) I'm the only person in the world who feels this way.
