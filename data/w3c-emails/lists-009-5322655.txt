How is the client supposed to know this?  You'll have to make further
additions to the protocol.  Maybe I am confusing who said what but
didn't you also complain that encoding the hostname would make it
impossible to move the password file to a new host?  This is a good
point and suggests a realm containing the enterprise name, but not the
host name -- something like "group@Enterprise_Name" e.g.
"Engineering@ATT_Bell_Labs".

The prompt displayed is entirely up to the browser.  Different
browsers will do it differently with different kinds of dialog boxes.
They seem to all display the realm.  If you want to get them all to
agree to let the server supply the prompt you have a tough task.

There may also be security issues since I could display a prompt 
concealing the fact that I am using a realm identical to someone elses.
Displaying a prompt and a realm would be too much.

This discussion has highlighted the importance of displaying the
realm and users not entering a password unless the realm agrees with
enterprise they are accessing!
