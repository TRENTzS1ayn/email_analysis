  PROBLEMS WITH THE EXPIRES HEADER

  Dynamic documents vs. history functions

SUMMARY

Developments in the implementation of browser history functions
prevent the HTTP Expires header from becoming the standard, generally
usable mechanism for controlling the behavior of caches.

To allow all types of dynamic services, which by their nature need to
restrict caching, to be implemented in a simple, reliable, and efficient
way, the HTTP specification must be extended.  We will propose several
alternative solutions.

Some of the proposed HTTP extensions would not only fix problems of
cache control, but their acceptance would also add a means of
controlling the contents of browser history lists.  Better control
over history list contents is needed for some types of dynamic
services.


AUDIENCE

This report discusses problems concerning cache control mechanisms
that are relevant to browser authors, the authors of dynamic web
services, and everyone contributing to the future development of HTTP.

We will present several alternative proposals for extensions to the
HTTP specification that solve the discussed cache control problems.
We hope that this report will generate a discussion leading to a
consensus about which alternative is best.
