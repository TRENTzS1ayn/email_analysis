>***The 406 None Acceptable response

This was discussed at the Danvers IETF, and will be in the next version
of the spec.

The 406 response will be changed to return content, in which the
available variants are described, preferably in a format that can
be used by a browser to select the appropriate choice.

In other words, a URC in HTML format.
