That is an "or", as in we could send the number using a binary integer
if the integer was restricted to network-byte-order interpretation, but
implementations are notorious for screwing that up in spite of the specs.

That is a useful comparison for data transfer overhead (thanks),
but what we really need is a comparison of processing overhead,
taking into account the vagaries of TCP socket reads/writes.

Keep it coming ....
