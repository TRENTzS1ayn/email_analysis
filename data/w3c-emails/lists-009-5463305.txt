No, there will be only one packetized 8bit-clean CTE that will be
required for HTTP/1.1 compliance.  That is why we are having this
discussion now, instead of after a full draft is produced.

Folks, I am getting a little tired of this line of response
without any thought behind it.  There is absolutely nothing
platform-specific about preferring 1 read over two reads.
If you have a technical disagreement, fine, but the next person
who cries "platform specific" better damn well include at least
one concrete example wherein the protocol prefers one platform over
another, and not just because of differring TCP implementation bugs.
