A "Last-modified" header currently exists to provide information on the 
modification of a file.  However, this information can be inaccurate if 
the document is produced periodically by an automatic generator, as in 
the case of user's homepages.  Simple file length may not suffice, so it 
would be better to determine the checksum.  Although the client could 
calculate this, it makes more sense to do so on the server side, to 
preserve bandwidth.

This "ckecksum" information could be implemented either as a header to be 
provided by the GET and HEAD methods.  However, since few clients would 
require such information, it makes more sense to restrict it to special 
methods:  either HEAD, which anyway exists for such purposes, or perhaps 
some new method.
