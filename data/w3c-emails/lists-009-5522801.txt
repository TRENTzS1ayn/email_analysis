In fact, the "--xxxxxx--" does not necessarily end the multipart
body, it is just the end of the interesting stuff.  Without additional
contraints on accuracy, multipart is worthless as a size delimiter.
In addition, it requires the receiver to scan the entire message
body for the delimiter, which has proven to be contrary to the design
goals of HTTP.
