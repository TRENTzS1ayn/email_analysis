In fact, it would seem like this would be the preferable way to do 
content negotiation without requiring hundreds of bytes of Accept: 
headers.  A browser sends a small set of types it knows it can handle 
(html, gif, mpeg, etc), and if there are None Acceptible, it can select 
from the list of representations returned in the 406 response (by 
resending a request with just the content-type they want in the Accept:)

Take that, lazy browser writers :)
