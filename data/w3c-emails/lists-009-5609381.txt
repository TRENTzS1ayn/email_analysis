I'm obviously missing something here concerning realms.  I've seen realms
used:
1) As a name in Web servers, to distinguish separately protected domains
of information.
2) As a component of the WWW-Authenticate response header.
3) As the prompt from a Web broswer for a user to authenticate him/herself.

I've argued (unsuccessfully, so far) that (1) and (3) should be separated.

Now Phillip seems to suggest that the realm should be something the
INTERNIC registers.  I don't understand why.  The client knows the
server it connected to, so presumably it can distinguish realm R on
server S1 from realm R on server S2.  If he's arguing that the server
name should be incorporated in the Digest method hash, in addition to
the realm, that's reasonable, provided both client and server agree on
what that name is.
