Yes, this makes sense.  Inventing YApacketization scheme seems silly unless
we really feel all existing ones are clearly unsuitable.

?  Not sure what you're hinting at here...

I see this as a problem unrelated to packetizing data so you can tell where
the end is.

I'd like to see arbitrary limits removed to the extent that it's possible;
that's one of the things I dislike most about SSL's record layer
(particularly since SSL adds so much per-record overhead) and I'd like to
see that mistake not get repeated.
