Content-transfer-encodings generally stay with the message in store,
and are not used to find the end of a message, but to protect the content.

The "packet" encoding's primary purpose is to locate the end of the
message without requiring scanning for special strings or knowing the
complete length before starting transmission.

Note that an almost identical mechanism was proposed for SMTP - I think
it is still one of the "draft-ietf-mailext" drafts.
