Yep, and the above two paragraphs are equivalent under HTTP.  The
packetized CTE would stay with the message (until it was removed),
and its purpose is to protect the content from a premature closure
of the connection (i.e., it allows the recipient to know if it got
the whole thing, and it allows the sender to apply a signature to
the whole thing).

Yes, I am aware of <draft-ietf-mailext-smtp-binary-07.txt>.  That mechanism
uses a series of separate messages (each message given a 1*DIGIT length)
to send the binary data.  In other words, it is a stateful message sequence,
which is something HTTP doesn't do.  It does demonstrate that both protocols
need such a thing, and conversion between the two methods would be trivial.
