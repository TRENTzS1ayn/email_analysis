Could please clarify what you mean by 'series of separate messages' since 
this terminology doesn't fit my understanding of SMTP chunking. The BDAT 
command doesn't in any way change data content in the pipe. It's also 
streamable in the sense that you can have more than on outstanding BDAT 
chunk pending on the connection.
