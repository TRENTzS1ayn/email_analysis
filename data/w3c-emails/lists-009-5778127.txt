C-T-E is a really gross but essential bit of cruft. Creating something 
similar but with elegant purpose should imply a new name. The MIME 
spec. expressly closes the category off for extension anyhow and it's a 
gesture that should be respected.

I think it's essential not just worthwhile, but I suppose it can wait 'til 
HTTP-NG if necessary. Being able to start sending a stream before having 
the full wad in hand has too many applications to ignore support for it, 
particularly since we've got a functioning model, that's proven to work 
well, available to clone.
