Greetings. Version 2.4 of the WWW Servers Comparison Chart is now available from
<http://www.proper.com/www/servers-chart.html>.

New in version 2.4:
- Added CL-HTTP (listed as CL), a Web server that runs under CommonLISP.
- Changed the name and company of the "NM" entry from "NetWalla Web Server
from NetMagic" to "Communications Builder from The Internet Factory".
- Removed the list of servers for which I have received no information.
- Added phttpd, a minimal HTTP server written in Perl, to the tools section.
- Duplicated the headers within the table to make it easier to follow,
based on a suggestion from a reader.
- Fixed a few more typos contributed by readers. (It is worth noting here
that Netscape is much more forgiving of typos than other Web clients.)
