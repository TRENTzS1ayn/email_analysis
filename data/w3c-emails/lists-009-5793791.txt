I would like to ask whether there are already any efforts to define a
API for a HTTP retrieval engine? (I apologize if this was already
discussed earlier, I have just subscribed to these mailing lists.)

This would allow to separate the development of WWW Browsers and HTML
interpreters from the development of secure protocols. Browsers may be
created (and sold) with a standard library without security. They
could be linked together (perhaps at run time by using dynamic
linking) with libraries implementing secure retrieval methods as a
"black box".

As a first idea such a library could use the method given in a url to
do a lookup in a system table to find an engine implementing this
protocol, e.g. for http, ftp, shttp etc.

Any opinions?
