It is my current understanding that arbitrary bytes can be encoded in URLs.
This provide a means for an HTML UA to formulate a response to a form
submission for arbitrary character encodings. However, I do have one important
question:  how does an HTTP server identify the encoding of such bytes (i.e.,
the CHARSET) and communicate that encoding to the consumer of this data (e.g.,
a CGI script)?
