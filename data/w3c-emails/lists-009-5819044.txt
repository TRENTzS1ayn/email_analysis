Dan, the file upload proposal includes a complete specification for
'multipart/form-data' which is intended as a general purpose
replacement for application/x-www-form-urlencoded. We went through
multiple iterations both in the HTML working group and also as a
result of the review given by the folks reviewing new media type
registration. multipart/form-data is completely capable of dealing
with multiple character sets, unicode, or whatever coming back as the
result of filling out a form.
