Well, this is where we disagree. I think there should be a *standard*
way to send this information, so as such, the *standard* does require
changing. I don't mind where the information is put, but one reason
for preferring:

     http:[EUC]//www.jacme.co.jp/%B0%F5%BA%FE.html

over

     http://www.jacme.co.jp/[EUC]%B0%F5%BA%FE.html

is that the latter could very will be a legal name within the system,
leading to ambiguity. In other words, the information about coded
character set and encoding must be separated from the name itself,
because *any* representation of the information could be legal in the
context of a name (as you mention, anything is legal here).
