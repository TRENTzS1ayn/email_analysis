But surely the character set in use is a server issue and thus should be
in the opaque data portion of the URL?  The second scheme will be
understood by server for which that is the correct URL and can be handled
with current browsers, whereas the first version will probably cause most
current browsers severe stomach cramps even if the server understood it. 
If the URL is valid for the server its pointing to there shouldn't be any
ambiguity with legal names in the system as the server will be expecting
the [EUC] or whatever.

However, I'd rather see something tacked onto the _end_ of the URL rather
than at the start of the opaque data section.  Maybe something like: 

      http://www.jacme.co.jp/%B0%F5%BA%FE.html;charset=EUC

It just seems more inkeeping with other things I've seen suggested in the 
past.
