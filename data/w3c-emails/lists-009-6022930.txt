Sorry for the delay in responding -- all three of the machines I was
using died on Aug 1 due to separate hardware failures.  Personally, I
think it was a curse brought on by the WG minutes ...

Ooops, confusing terminology.  SMTP involves sending a series of commands
and getting a series of responses, with many commands per mail message.

HTTP sends one "command" in the form of a message, and gets one response.
So, while the concept is similar (and easily translatable for an
HTTP<->SMTP gateway), they are not "almost identical".
