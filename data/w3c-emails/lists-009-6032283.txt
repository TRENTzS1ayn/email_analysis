Various Session ID schemes that would allow a server to establish some
kind of state (akin to Netscape cookies) have been discussed here
recently.  I've gathered my thoughts and earlier comments together into
an Internet non-draft (as yet) for your perusal and comment.  If
there's enough positive feedback, I will submit the proposal as a real
Internet Draft (Internet genuine draft? :-).
