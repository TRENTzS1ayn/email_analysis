No.  In section 2.3 I said:
    Similarly, a caching proxy must pass back to the requestor any
    Session-ID response header it receives, but it must not cache that
    header as part of its cache state.

That's probably true short-term.  As you say, the result is unreliable
stateful dialogs if caching proxies don't pass Session-IDs in both
directions.
