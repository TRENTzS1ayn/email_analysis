Ah, sorry, I misunderstood.  The answer is still no, since all three
dates are still valid in HTTP/1.0 messages.  The requirement that one
not be generated is separate from the field syntax.

I also forgot to include that all three formats are only required to
be understood by those applications which parse the contents of the
date field.
