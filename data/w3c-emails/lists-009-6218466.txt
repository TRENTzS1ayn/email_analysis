This attitude is offensive.  We are not the huddled tribes waiting for
stone tablets to come down from above.  The members of this mailing list
are those people who expect to be involved in the definition of the HTTP
protocol.  At least now I understand why a 500-line detailed commentary on
v10-spec that I sent to this list at the end of May got no reaction.

This is not the way the IETF works.  At the very least, an apology is
called for.  More likely, a major procedure reset probably needs to be done
by the Area Director (e.g., replace the current editor).
