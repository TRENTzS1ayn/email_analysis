And you are. There's a draft, if you want something changed, get it changed
by discussing it in the group.

I don't, and it's a separate issue.

I don't think an apology is called for, neither is your aggresive reaction.

Personally I'm glad Roy has provided a solid basis to discuss, rather than
a lot of talking happening without result (that's what www-talk is for,
right? Joke! Joke, sorry... :-)

I too would like to (have) see(n) a faster turnaround time on the draft,
but that's always easy when you're not the one doing the work :-)

Enough soapbox as far as I'm concerned, now where did I put that draft...
