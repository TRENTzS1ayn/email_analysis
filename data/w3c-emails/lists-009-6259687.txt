What is the best way for a http client to find out which
protocols a certain server is able to understand.

A server may be able to speak several protocols as
http/0.9, http/1.0 , shttp/1.1, crypto-http/33.3, 
super-http/0.35, extra-http/3.9 and other phantastic protocols.

Shouldn't there be a protocol independent command to retrieve a list of
the protocols the server is able to understand?
