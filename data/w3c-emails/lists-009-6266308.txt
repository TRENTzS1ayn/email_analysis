Because I have Save As and an old browser I like sanskrit as much as I like
us-ascii?  I can see the point of a change from 0 encoding and/or charset
quality (on lack of the header) to a positive encoding and/or charset
quality, but all the way to 1?  .001 seems infinitely more appropriate.

I'm sure our server is immune, but I can sympathize with the idea that
others might break given this previously unexistant construct (valid headers
that have no body) being introduced.

I'm beginning to wonder if a construct like */* and q aren't needed for all
the Accept-Foo: headers. As in "Accept-Encoding: *;q=0.0".  Of course, then
you'll have to explicitly outlaw "Accept-Charset: iso-8859-1;q=0.0" or
similar special cases.  If we decide we really want to handle every special
case, we should also give someone the ability to indicate that they *only*
take zipped files or sanskrit files.  More work for me, but I'd rather have
a sped'c way of doing everything for completeness' sake.  Anything less
would be uncivilized.

Not having any way to indicate "effective quality zero" on charsets and
encodings seems like a soundly bad idea.  Why give the user-agent the abilty
to refuse text/plain, but not refuse unicode or ARCed files? (remember ARC,
good luck finding a deARCer nowadays).

I can't imagine anyone being satisfied with the current content negotiation
scheme.
