I have to disagree with the current approach if there are going to be 5
month periods between drafts.  Given that many people are already deploying
HTTP applications, and have only the I-Ds to go by, having major changes
like this appear without warning is, IMHO, unacceptible.

I don't have a problem with the idea of having a small group come up with a
proposal for discussion.  But couldn't those proposals be discussed on the
list as they are formed, rather than waiting months for an I-D?

I just read the Danvers minutes, and I didn't see this discussed.  When you
say "decided just before Danvers" do you mean it was discussed here?  If so,
could you point me to it in the archives so I can get up to speed on the
discussion that occured at the time?

This isn't true.  There are several browsers which will break if, for
example, they get an encoded file (because they don't parse
Content-Encoding).  By this logic, we should also have q default to a
non-zero value for those browsers which don't include */* in their Accept
field (of which there are some).

Also, as I pointed out in item 5 of my last note, not all HTTP clients are
browsers.  An automated WWW searching tool (for example) won't have a Save
As option.  A kiosk-based browser likely wouldn't have a Save As option.
They would just break under this change.  Also, under the new draft, there's
absolutely no way for these types of applications to say that they won't
accept certain encodings and charsets, since even including the headers they
can only get qe and qc down to 0.001.

Having it mean no MIME type is acceptible might be useful as a way to force
a 406 response.  That could provide a consistent way for a client to get a
list of varients for a URI.  If we decide this is desirable, it should be
made explicit.
