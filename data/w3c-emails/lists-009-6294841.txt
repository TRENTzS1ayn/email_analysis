Yeah, I noticed in the course I was giving today on CGI, when the URL 
printed in the exercises (and checked then)  did not work ;-)       

Is there any particular reason the HTML version has gone from a nicely 
chunked set of pages to one massive document? Pulling over several hundred K 
of html just becuase I forgot what a 406 response code was seems less than 
desirable.

Could I ask for a chunked version (again) please?
