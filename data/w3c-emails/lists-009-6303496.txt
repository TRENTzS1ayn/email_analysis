Maybe I'm incredibly dense (I see those heads nodding :-), but I found
Sect. 8.28 a bit confusing.  What would have helped me is for there to
be an explicit statement that particular vary-dimension's correspond
exactly to specific HTTP headers, e.g.,
typeAccept
charsetAccept-Charset
languageAccept-Language
encodingAccept-Encoding
user-agentUser-Agent
version??
The examples imply the correspondence but there's no explicit statement
of correlation.

What, exactly, is "version"?  Where is the version specified in the URI?

How does a caching intermediary handle a vary-dimension of <token>?
That is, if you can't specify the dimensions in advance, how can the
intermediary figure out what the semantics for such an unspecified
dimension are?  (If <token> is just meant as a place-holder for future
expansion, let's say so.)
