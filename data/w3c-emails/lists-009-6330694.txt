I agree, which is why I proposed a 2-week review cycle before the next
draft is produced.

Yes, provided that they are not made by the author (me).  My proposals
are made in the form of a new draft -- doing otherwise just increases
the delay between drafts.  I do make mini-proposals during commentary,
but some proposals require more thought.

Yes, it was discussed there.  The point was made, by both Henrik and
Dave Kristol, that existing software (XMosaic) did not send an Accept-Encoding
field even when they do accept gzip and compress.  Therefore, the default
should be accept-all.  There were no objections raised at the meeting,
so I recorded it as one of the changes for the next draft, and duly made
that change as soon as I could.  It should also be in the minutes, but
I did not get a chance to review the minutes for accuracy and completeness.

Define "break" in a useful manner.  Better, tell me what the draft needs
to say to fix this situation.  If the WG agrees, I *will* change the draft.

Right.  So we need to define those semantics.  I suggest that we allow
inclusion of the default charsets, such that

   Accept-Charset: iso-8859-1

implies acceptance of only that charset and US-ASCII (which would always
be implied).  No accept-charset would be the same as accepting all, and
given an accept-charset, unlisted charsets would be qc=0.

Yes, I agree.
