The only thing is that I have been seeing multiple WWW-Authenticate: fields
all over the net. If a server wants to inform clients that it will accept
multiple authorization schemes for a resources, it really seems to be
"current pratice" that the server include multiple WWW-Authenticate fields
rather than one WWW-Authenticate with several semicolon separated entries.

Does anyone else have any ideas about the WWW-Authenticate problem? I
believe that this is a key issue if we want to see DIGEST authentication
deployed.
