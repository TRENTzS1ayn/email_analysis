Who said "like to" had to be realistic?

Keep in mind that existing clients will not recognize the new header.
That may not be a problem if both are provided, but will remain a problem
for the Authorization field.

Another alternative would be to forbid multiple schemes per resource,
or require that applications parse the AA fields such that they can
recover gracefully from unexpected folding.

Perhaps the latter would be best for 1.0?
