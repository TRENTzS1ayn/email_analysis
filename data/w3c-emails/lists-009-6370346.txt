Almost right.  The working group mailing list is the only place where
we are allowed to poll for rough consensus (i.e., rough consensus at a
meeting has no meaning unless it is also affirmed on the list).  It is
impossible for all face-to-face discussions to be reflected back to the
mailing list -- the bandwidth simply isn't there, and I'm too slow a
typist to do it myself.  Therefore, the input is reflected in the next
draft and the WG is then polled for consensus.  It only seems wrong because
it took so bloody long for me to finish the draft, for which I apologize
again.

Identity encoding won't exist if we get rid of CTE.

Yes, that is what I was saying (it is a return to what I had prior to
Danvers, with some additional explanation).

If anyone in the WG disagrees, this is the time to voice your opinion.  
Please site specific examples of why you disagree, so that the WG can
judge which solution is the best given our constraints.
