No, not dense, that was the last section added in response to Jim's
earlier comments that the URI header was insufficient for caching.
This is the first time the text has been reviewed by anybody other than me.

Yep, will do.

>What, exactly, is "version"?  Where is the version specified in the URI?

Ooops, that's a leftover -- version is not necessary and will be deleted.
Versions are specified by different URIs.

Actually, I was going to remove token altogether, since these things
can't be extended without changing the protocol version.
