Yes, and that is stated clearly in the section on 200.

   If the entity corresponds to a resource, the response may include a 
   Location header field giving the actual location of that specific 
   resource for later reference.

????? You mean, more explicit than [e.g., 302]

   If the new URI is a single location, its URL must be given by the 
   Location field in the response. If more than one URI exists for the 
   resource, the primary URL should be given in the Location field and 
   the other URIs given in one or more URI-header fields. The Entity-
   Body of the response should contain a short hypertext note with a 
   hyperlink to the new URI(s).

How is that not sufficient?

I tried several such mechanisms, none of which worked.  The spec cannot
be simpler than the protocol and still remain correct.
