At Roy Fielding's prodding, I have aligned the terminology of my
Session-ID pre-proposal to match the HTTP draft.  I also changed
the name of the header (but not the URL) from Session-ID to
State-Info.

Further comments are welcome.  Documents at

Because the server initiates the session, I felt it was appropriate for
the server to decide when a Session-ID was no longer appropriate.  In
Netscape's cookies, the user agent examines the cookie and can decide
whether it had expired.

The user agent always returns the ID.  The server can decide whether
it's relevant to a particular request.

They behave like a single-window client.

I wanted the client's role to be very simple.  With Session-ID ("State-Info"
imminently), the client never examines the content of the ID; it just sends
it along.  Having the client act on the URL may have advantages.  (I'd
like a proponent to give them.)

That's essentially what I've proposed.

www-talk (or was it http-wg?) discussed this recently.  People expressed
concerns about privacy and the ability to correlate visits to multiple
servers.
