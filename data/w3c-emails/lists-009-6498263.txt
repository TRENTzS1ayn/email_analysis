I don't want to turn this list into a DCE battle, and I apologize
for distracting people when they should be reading Roy's draft.

Everything Jeff and Jim wrote seems more-or-less right on target to me.

I'll gladly answer DCE questions in email (or comp.soft-sys.dce), or
even on this list if there are no other options.

Nothing.  It should probably send an advisory status code up to the
application recommending use of the ncacn_ip_tcp protocol sequence:)
