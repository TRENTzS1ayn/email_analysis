However, please note that the "side channel" of state information that
flows both directions and bypasses proxy and user-agent caches, even
if the resources themselves are cached, is not cheap.  Setting up and
tearing down the TCP connections is a nontrivial fraction of the cost
of retrieving a small resource (but I admit: I don't have numbers) --
especially html files, as opposed to large graphics or audio media files.
And those media files are typically cacheable anyhow.  Even on systems
where URLs contain session-IDs, the URLs for the media files usually
need not, and so they're cacheable.
