Another approach which I've seen suggested would be to have multiple 
HREFs in an HTML anchor.  This would be nice, in the sense that it 
would drop straight through the HTTP layer...  Would it be kosher 
SGML, though ?

Are there any plans to further develop the existing HTML & HTTP 
"HEAD" mechanisms for passing meta-information ?  Methinks it would 
be good to have something along the lines of the "Dublin Core" 
element set [1] in there.  Who knows, this approach might just make 
URCs redundant! :-)

The client could ping the servers and choose the one with the shortest round-trip-time ?
