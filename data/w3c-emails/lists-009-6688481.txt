I like it -- it would be nice to have a good spec for what to do to 
interoperate with the current deployed browsers/servers (warts and all...).

I'd have second thoughts if you said it would take a long time, but if 
it can really be accomplished in a few days, and you're willing to do 
the work, I'd concur.

]
] I have had several comments sent to me (most off the list) along the
] lines of "how can we keep changing 1.0 when there are deployed apps?"
] and "how can I know whether a server supports the standard or not if
] we continue to use the same version number?", etc.
]
] As we mentioned back in San Jose, we have a choice as to whether
] we try to standardize 1.0, or release a current-practice document on
] 1.0 and move our standard to HTTP/1.1 (which in turn would mean that
] what we are currently calling 1.1 features would be in HTTP/1.2).
]
] Since the IETF recently created the BCP ("Best Current Practice")
] series, we can actually do this now within a reasonable framework.
]
] The action required would be for Henrik and I to create a stripped-down
] HTTP/1.0 document and release it along with the current draft renamed
] as HTTP/1.1.  This will take three days for us to accomplish, but may
] be worth the saving in confusion and aggravation.
]
] Does the WG want to do this?
