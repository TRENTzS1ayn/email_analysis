I have had several comments sent to me (most off the list) along the
lines of "how can we keep changing 1.0 when there are deployed apps?"
and "how can I know whether a server supports the standard or not if
we continue to use the same version number?", etc.

As we mentioned back in San Jose, we have a choice as to whether
we try to standardize 1.0, or release a current-practice document on
1.0 and move our standard to HTTP/1.1 (which in turn would mean that 
what we are currently calling 1.1 features would be in HTTP/1.2).

Since the IETF recently created the BCP ("Best Current Practice")
series, we can actually do this now within a reasonable framework.

The action required would be for Henrik and I to create a stripped-down
HTTP/1.0 document and release it along with the current draft renamed
as HTTP/1.1.  This will take three days for us to accomplish, but may
be worth the saving in confusion and aggravation.

Does the WG want to do this?
