Request: I suspect there is no need to post anything to both www-talk
and http-wg.  I suspect that everyone who reads http-wg also reads 
www-talk.  I am posting this to both lists in case this is not true --
then someone can flame me down.

In any case, I see no reason why anything needs to go to both lists.
If nobody objects too strenuously, let's save each other some time by
avoiding this.
