Finding this common ground is the crucial point.  Could you perhaps  
whittle your "wish list" of reporting information down to a  
"requirements list" or even a "prevention of open rebellion list"?

My main point is that there _is_ a way to start a positive feedback  
loop and get out of this prisoners' dilemma ("who's more selfish"):

  (1) merge reporting into the ordinary, profit-making operations
      of the proxy (by forwarding "bundled" requests).

  (2) make sure adoption of such reporting by major proxies will act
      as a positive incentive for servers to start using Expires
      correctly (if you use Expires right you get periodic reports
      automatically, while if you don't you get blocked!).

I put forward the simplest possible backwards-compatible scheme of  
this sort, in the hopes of getting _something_ started.  But if the  
"open rebellion list" includes more than hit counts, we will  
probably need to include some additional "bundled reporting"  
features.

I don't get it....isn't the point of electronic commerce to break  
out of the constraints of space and time that limit ordinary  
commerce?
