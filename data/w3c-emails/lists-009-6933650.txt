Actually, it doesn't say that, but it should.  I have added it to draft 02.
Anything that involves authentication in "current practice" also
implies exclusion of those not authenticated.  Since the proxy cannot
duplicate the server's authorization capability, it must not deliver
the response to anyone but the client requesting it (and only for that
particular request), and therefore should never cache such responses.
