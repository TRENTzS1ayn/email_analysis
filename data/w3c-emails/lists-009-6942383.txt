In regard to the proxy passing logfile info to servers, I do hope
people discussing these issues have looked at the Security section
of the HTTP spec.  Some of the suggestions would be a direct
violation of those recommendations.

Servers have a right to know

    # individuals
    # hits
    hit times
    domains serviced

per URL, but not e-mail addresses, machine names, or any other data
that could be used to identify an individual.  Referer data must also]
be optional.

Like Andrew mentioned, this is best done by passing a URL to the
origin server that tells it where it may retrieve a sanitized summary
of the data.
