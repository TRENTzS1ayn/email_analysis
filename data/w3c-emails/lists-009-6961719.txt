Sorry, I'm getting confused about terminology.  Please verify or
correct this summary of the current set of official terminology.

- HTTP/1.0 now refers to "current practice", sort of.
- HTTP/1.1 now refers to what current practice should be, without
significant feature additions other than Digest AA and Proxy Auth.
- HTTP/1.2 refers to the HTTP/1.1 of a week or two ago?  (You don't
mention HTTP/1.2 here.)
