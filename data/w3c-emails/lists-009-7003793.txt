Are you suggesting that servers only have a right to see aggregate 
statistics, and not per-request lists?  (i.e. "32 access of this url by 
23 different hosts", not "hosta, timestampa; hostb, timestampB;"... etc?
Also, how does the proxy determine "# individuals", or did you mean "# of 
different IP addresses serviced"?

I much prefer Buchard's model of sending it with the refresh request 
rather than forcing a separate transaction for the data.  If a separate 
request were made, the proxy not only has to make that data 
HTTP-accessible to the outside world (a problem for proxies behind 
firewalls) but also has to have some heuristics as to how long that data 
is around.  With compression it should not add significantly to the size 
of the request.
