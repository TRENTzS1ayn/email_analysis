Yes.  If you are not given the machine name, matching it with
timestamps isn't worth the bother.

The former, using the same methods the server would.  The proxy may
know a lot more information about each user than it is willing to pass on.

Except for the minor detail that the last action taken by a cache
is to throw away the cached document, not make a new request on it.
There is no reason to require the proxy to make a new request just
to inform the server (which in most cases doesn't care anyway) of
the last batch of saved hit info.

Note also that the URL for where to retrieve the summaries need
not be the same as the proxy sending it.  Of course, proxies behind
secure firewalls won't be sending you any data in any case.
