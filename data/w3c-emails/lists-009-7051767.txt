I agree with Lou's proposal. Regarding Simon's suggestion that we also
provide a simple checksum, I don't think that would really be a great
benifit. The overhead of simply opening a file and scanning through its
contents strikes me as greater than that of the MD5 ifself. So personally I
would either want an extremely fast mechanism such as the file size & date,
or else go for the real MD5.
