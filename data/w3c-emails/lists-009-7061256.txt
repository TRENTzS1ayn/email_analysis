Why would a server pumping out bogus last-modified headers act appropriately
to another type of check?  Adding something to the protocol just because
another part is not being used properly seems a bit weird.  If I'm 
understanding the problem correctly.

Will the "size" be determined from the Content-length header or the size on
the cache's disk?  If the former, documents with incorrect content-length
headers are essentially uncacheable, as are results from CGI scripts which
generally don't have content-length headers.  If the latter, could there 
be encoding problems?
