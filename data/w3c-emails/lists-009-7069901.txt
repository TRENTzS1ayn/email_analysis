The problems currently encountered are mostly caused by the date comparisons
done by most HTTP servers when dealing with If-modified-since requests.
Most servers assume that as long as the If-modified-since date is equal to
or AFTER the current modification date of the document then it is unchanged.

This is a problem because people screw up the dates on their files and
sometimes give them dates far into the future.  When they fix the
dates of the files to correspond to the current date, caches never
get updated.

In addition to supporting size=SIZE I encourage other server authors to
do an _equals_ comparison rather than a greater than or equal comparison
of the two dates.

The size is determined by taking the current length of the document in the
cache.  The content-length of the transfer is discarded, so encodings
should have no effect.
