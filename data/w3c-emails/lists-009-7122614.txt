It seems like the correct solution is to eliminate the problem with
corrupted caches rather than tweaking the standard yet another time.

This will break MacHTTP and WebSTAR. According to the last published
"standard", the if-modified-since header field's argument (the date) is
terminated with an end of line sequence. This is how it's currently parsed
in both of those servers. Given the large installed base of these servers,
it'd be nice to find an alternate solution.
