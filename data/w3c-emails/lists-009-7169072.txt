Can't cache algorithms be modified so that if they spot a timestamp
that is more than say half a day into the future (all GMT), then it
can safely assume the date is garbage and not trust it for caching ?

It'd be better to "punish" the folks who send out garbage. Sooner or
later someone will complain to them and ask for it to be fixed.
