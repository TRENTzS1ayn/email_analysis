A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
Working Group of the IETF.                                                 

       Title     : Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol 
with the lightness and speed necessary for distributed, collaborative, 
hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, object-oriented
protocol which can be used for many tasks, such as name servers and 
distributed object management systems, through extension of its request 
methods (commands). A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data
representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data 
being transferred.                               

HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative 
since 1990. This specification reflects preferred usage of the protocol 
referred to as "HTTP/1.0".

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-02.txt".
 Or 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-02.ps".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.

For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@cnri.reston.va.us.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
