Roy's point is that Netscape also sends IMS along with *all* cached requests.
That's what's causing so many Netscape caches to get stuck with junk
which the user cannot refresh, and the only solution is to clear your
entire Netscape cache.

"Pragma: no-cache" is not aimed at end servers (only proxies in between),
so the end servers are always asked to respond "304 Not Modified".

As Roy says, fix that and most of the problems will go away.
