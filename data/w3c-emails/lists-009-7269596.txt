Are you sure it will break MacHTTP and WebSTAR, or do you just assume it
will?  If it does, these servers are not following the spec.  HTTP
headers are MIME headers, and MIME headers can always be followed by
a semi-colon and additional attributes.  If they do break with the
new header then we will need to figure out how many are out there and
weather there are enough to make a significant difference in the
decision.
