Er, well, no, that is only true of headers which contain

   *(";" parameter)

as part of the definition.  Each known header's field value is defined
according to the specific BNF for that header -- the generic header parsing
BNF only applies when the header name is unknown or when the parser
is not looking inside the field value.

However, it is a good rule to follow for robust implementations,
and we are not talking about a change to HTTP/1.0, but rather HTTP/1.1,
where we are able to change specific header-parsing within reason.
