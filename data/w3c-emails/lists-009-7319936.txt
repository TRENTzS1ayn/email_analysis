no no no no no. Let the user *choose* to override the sending of
"if-modified-since".

Which is the bigger bandwidth waste ... discarding 5Mb of disk cache
or not sending if i-m-s for a request the user has realised is cached
incorrectly ?

We're not alking about having it as a default action, just an option
for users to refresh bad cache entries. 

Presumably the people sending you "bug" reports are doing so because
they see junk in their caches and can't get rid of it. Your users will
still have the same problem with URLs which don't have checksums, and 
that's going to be the norm for a long time to come.
