Browser semantics -- not defined by any spec, but well known enough
that I can say with absolute certainty that this is a bug in Navigator.

If the user requests a "Reload" operation, they are asking for a
new copy of the resource from its origin.

Sending IMS prevents a new copy being generated by the origin server.

So, don't send IMS when the user hits the Reload button! 

Believe me, nobody is more concerned about network bandwidth and
caching than I am.  However, caching only works if the user is
in control of the cache, not the other way around.  This has
less significant impact on bandwidth than do the thousands of hopeless
attempts to override this behavior by current Navigator users.
