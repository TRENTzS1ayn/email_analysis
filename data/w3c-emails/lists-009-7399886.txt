This is a case where it doesn't pay to be too clever.

If everything works perfectly, there is seldom a reason for
people to use "reload". The two cases I use it are when I have
a document that looks like it was corrupted by a transmission
error or when I have outside information that a document *has*
changed (usually because I'm editing it.)

In neither case do I want a local or remote cache be in the picture.
