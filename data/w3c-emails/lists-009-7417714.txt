I recently changed netscape to interpret "Pragma: no-cache" and not
cache the object.  This is slightly different than a "Expires" header
because the object will not even be cached for history navigation.
(Documents that are expired are still shown when traversing the session
history).  Haveing the client interpret "Pragma: no-cache" lets servers
tell the client that this information is highly sensitive or volitile
and should not be cached in any way.
