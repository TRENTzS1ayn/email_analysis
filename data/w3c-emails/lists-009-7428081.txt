Well, I find this reasonable.  But, I believe that the latest version of
the spec says the client should ignore Pragma: no-cache.  What I think
is important is that there be some way to stop the client from caching
-- as apparently there now is with Netscape. :)

I don't care if it is Pragma: no-cache or if there is a separate way
(Pragma: no-local-cache ?) but apparently someone does since the spec
wants the client to ignore Pragma: no-cache.  Could someone  explain
the rationale for this?
