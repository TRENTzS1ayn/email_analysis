It is an interesting question: there are any good reasons to forbid
clients to cache documents in its non-shared cache? Doubtful, I think.
But if anybody can give good examples explaining the need for this,
then we shall consider adding the function proposed by "Pragma: no-local-cache",
but (see later)

Oops! The draft-02 states: (in section 8.13)
   Pragma directives do not apply to the end-points of a 
   request/response chain. For example, a user agent's internal
   (non-shared) cache and/or history mechanism should ignore all 
   pragma directives in received messages. Similarly, pragma 
   directives are not applicable to the origin of a resource, though 
   they may be applicable to a server's internal response cache.
Your change is a non-conformance!
(continuing on "Pragma: no-local-cache") but we should do this using some
other machanism, not a pragma!
