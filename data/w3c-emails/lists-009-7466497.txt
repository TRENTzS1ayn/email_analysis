I use Lynx, Netscape and sometimes Mosaic.
All of them has a refresh function - e.g. screen refresh -
I quesst, normally this shouldn't involve any http action, using local cached
copy of the document.
I just now realised, that the "Pragma: no-local-cache" proposed by John Franks
can prevent this. <em> I dont want http actions to refresh my lynx screen when
it's garbled by talkd or write! </em>
The reload funtion, on contrary does start a http action, but which action it
really does, I not investigated till now.
My expectations to the "reload" function are:
re-check the status of the document, and reflect changes in case it's changed.
This should be done using HEAD method (HTTP/0.9 clients) or
GET/If-Modified-Since (HTTP/1.x clients).
If I am not satisfyed with the result - (I expected a new version, 
I'm sure that the document changed), I will request a reload again.
In this case, a good client may issue a plain GET, if it knows, that is
talking to the origin server directly, or a GET/no-cache if knows, that
there is some intermediate proxy. While pragmas have effect only on
intermediates (and I don't want changes in this), it's safe to add the no-cache
pragma, when no-intermediate proxies are involved in the action.
Can we agree on this approach?
