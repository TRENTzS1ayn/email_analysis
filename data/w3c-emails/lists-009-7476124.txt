I agree, 'refresh' does sound like a more appropriate word.  I'll
pass that along to our UI persons.

I'm currently attempting to change the netscape UI to allow both 
refresh and what I call "Super Reload" (Retransfer everything).
"Refresh", as you call it, will continue to be the default.
As others have pointed out, if the cacheing scheme is perfect,
"Super Reload" would never be necessary.  Adding size=SIZE or
length=SIZE gets us a little closer and if necessary we could
move to MD5.  

Hoping for a perfect caching world,
