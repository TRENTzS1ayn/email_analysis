No, Last-Modified: <date in 2010> means "I am broken, please notify my
webmaster to fix my clock". (Unless it's already 2010, I suppose.) 

I don't think we can possibly design a protocol that can resist the
determined attempts to abuse it, and I don't think we should.

As you point out, 'Expires' is the right way to handle this.

Why are such 'expires' dates fictitious? Why do you think people would
not overload 'Expires' but would overload 'Last-Modified'.

This is a nice thought experiment, but I'm baffled about how you
expect caches to behave in such a situation other than they would with
a straightforward application of 'Last-Modified' (date quote was made)
and 'Expires' (date when quote is no longer valid).

Besides, none of this has to do with adding a 'size' or 'length'
attribute, which was the original proposal that started this thread.
