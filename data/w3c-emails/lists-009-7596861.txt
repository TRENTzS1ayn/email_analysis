Such another way is not absent.  Expires: <yesterday> is another way, and it
isn't a de facto way either.  It is in the draft standard, and has been in
the draft standard for some time.  From draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-02.html:

|8.7 Expires
|
|The Expires field gives the date/time after which the entity should be
|considered stale. This allows information providers to suggest the
|volatility of the resource. Caching clients, including proxies, must not
|cache this copy of the resource beyond the date given, unless its status has
|been updated by a later check of the origin server

Also, I think that Expires: <date in 1990> is much cleaner than
Last-modified: <date in 2010>.
