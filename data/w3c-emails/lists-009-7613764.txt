 > Koen and I suggested that this behavior be at least mentioned
somewhere in the spec as "current practice", since some current
services depend on it, especially in the current world where you can't
really use Expires to suppress caching (because of history list
problems).  If this behavior (not caching documents that omit
last-modified) were to suddenly change, I suspect there would be a lot
of unhappy service operators out there...
