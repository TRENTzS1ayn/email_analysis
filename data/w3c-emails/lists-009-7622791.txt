Section 8.7 of draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-01.ps says:

If multiple encodings have been applied to a resource, the
encoding-mechanisms must be listed in the order in which they
were applied.

I think this is backward.  I think they should be listed in the order
in which they must be applied by the client in the order they're listed.
      ==== ==

Consider foo.gz.Z.  Gzip was applied first, then compress.  NCSA HTTP
1.3 produces this header:
Content-Encoding: x-compress, x-gzip
(It looks like the old CERN code I have doesn't support multiple
encodings.)
