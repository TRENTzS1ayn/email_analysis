I agree, this is the right approach. According to this, I change my statement
on 'Pragma: no-local-cache' from doubtful to useless.
I has experience with client cache only using netscape 1.1N.
Netscape has 3 options on contolling local cache freshness:
a) re-check on every access.
b) re-check once per execution.
c) never.
I preferred the b) variant normally, and c) every time when I worked off-line
and never choosed a).
When I follow a link in a not fully readed document, I want to go back into
the same document, preferably into same position where I left - when I'm done
with the followed link. Now I'm reading web documents this way, and netscape
supperts me in doing this.
I'll be worried, if I can't do the same in the future.
Or somebody in the WG prefers to see a changed document when returns back from
a link to the original, not yet completely read document? I will be suprised if
somebody says yes!
