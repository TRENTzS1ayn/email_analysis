Yes, sure, I agree.

Let me expand on my retracted retraction.

Proxies should just use the claimed mod date on resources they fetch
and use that date when doing GET if-modified-since afterwards.  They
may also, of course, want to occasionally just get a new copy of
something.  For example, one way to manage this is to keep track of
the LOCAL time when a document was last fetched.  The point is that
the origin-server's claimed modification time should never be relevant
to any proxy cache along the line, except as a stored "cookie"-like
thing that can be passed back in GET if-modified-since.  So if some
origin server claims a document was modified on Stardate 7239.64, a
proxy ought to just hold on to that, ignore what it means, and pass it
back to the origin server when it does a GET if-modified-since.
