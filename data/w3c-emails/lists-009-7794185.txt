Yes, and I'll update the specs [I wish we had this discussion before
I split them in two].

Yikes!  Then we have to define "level of privacy" first, and I
don't think this belongs in a Pragma header anyway.

The W3C security people have been working on a generic extension
mechanism for this purpose (and a few others) which should be
a proposal for HTTP/1.2 once the documentation is complete.

I'd like to get 1.0 set in stone first, before we open the mondo
can-o-worms that generic extensions will entail.
