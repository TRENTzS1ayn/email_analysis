Pardon my density.  I've been following this discussion, but I've never
understood the argument about bad dates.  I would appreciate an
example.

I can imagine deliberately setting a specific file date, although I
don't understand the purpose.  Are there also systems where there's no
useful modification date, so a server cannot detect changes by checking
the file date?
