These problems happen, but they often happen in ways that preserve
length. If you want something stronger than date, then use a checksum;
if you're going to use a checksum, you might as well use MD5 or SHA.

Checksums can be pre-computed by the server and periodically
recomputed by them as well, sent along as content-md5 headers and just
sent back in HTTP/1.1 get-if-not-content-MD5 request.
