I think this is a limited view of the world. The way that I have implemented 
it (yesterday, that is) is to let it be up to the user to choose what action 
to be taken if an expired history object is encountered:

1) Do nothing at all and show the document

2) Notify the user that the document is stale but do not refresh it

3) Do an automatic reload when the document becomes active (visible) to    
the user.

This looks like a nice "option menu" to me!
