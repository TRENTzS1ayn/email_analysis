Sorry to be sending so much mail today -- but somehow the discussion
seems to have come close to certain areas of interest, so...

I agree that origin-servers should behave this way, and should log
such errors so the operators can correct the situation.  However I
think that intermediate proxies should simply pass on what they get
from the origin server, since *it need not matter to them*.  They also
should also save whatever date the upstream server says.  Furthermore,
when they issue a GET-IMS, they'd better use the date the upstream
server last claimed, even if it was in "the future" according to the
downstream server, or else they might not get the appropriate 304 they
could otherwise reasonably expect to get. Since downstream clients may
also wish to use last-modified dates to generate GET-IMS requests of
their own, that is why it should be passed on.  Expecting all servers
to be within .0000X seconds of UTC seems just a bit Draconian to me.
(Are there even NTP implementations for Mac and Windows? If so, how
many Mac or PC based web sites run them?) Building in magic time
thresholds that are "close enough" seems like a kluge.  And if a
server is just way off and can't interpret GET-IMS requests correctly
because of its own error generating last-modified, that's a local
problem.  Server software should, however, log GET-IMS requests where
the date is in *its* future, as it probably indicates a problem.

Date errors are the server's to fix, but I don't agree that clock
drift should be punished.

Agreed.

Disagree. Same reasons as above.
