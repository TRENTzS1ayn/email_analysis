I found the Draft 01 concerning Pragma: no-cache in particular
and pragmas in general acceptable. I vote for no change. Otherwise
why to introduce pragmas at all. (there wolud be no differenc between 
pragmas and request/response headers.)

But what is the difference between the Pragma: no-cache and Pragma: private?
I see only formal difference, but no semanthical.
