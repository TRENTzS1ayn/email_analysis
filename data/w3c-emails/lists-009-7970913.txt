This solution is too costly to implement in existing servers,
on the other hand, size checksums are easy to add to most servers.
I seriously doubt any server will keep a record of screwups
and fix them automatically, so this is a completely impractical solution.

Your "solution" also fails when the file has been modified but
has the same date.
