RealTimeServerTimeAction

12:0012:01C: GET /this-dynamic-object
S: 200 Ok
   Last-Modified: some-old-time

   (some-old-time calculated by determining age
   of the data it assembles to produce the page)

12:0512:06C: GET /this-dynamic-object
   If-modified-since: some-old-time
S: 304 Not Modified

   (the calculation to check last_modified of
   the data is much faster than assembling the
   whole page)

12:0712:08(some data changes on the server which 
affects this-dynamic-object)

12:0812:09C: GET /this-dynamic-object
   IMS: some-old-time
S: 200 Ok
   Last-Modified: 12:08

Only objects which truly change with every minute (i.e., the data used to
determine what the page looks like) need be uncacheable.
