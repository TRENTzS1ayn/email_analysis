Of course your example is right.

The questionable area is whether it is reasonable to expect
servers to set last-modified = the date of the last modification
to the data that went into producing the dynamic document in question,
or whether it is legit for them to say last-modified = date of production
of the actual document that is transmitted.

My entire argument rests on the assumption that the latter will be done.
If that isn't going to work, I recommend it be made explicit somewhere,
as the failure mode will be subtle -- just a lot of mysteriously 
uncacheable documents.
