I remember you (and/or Rob McCool) proposed just doing a straight string
compare of the LM and IMS (LM = IMS), which is *different* than LM < IMS <
CURRTIME.  If you implemented the latter in the Netsite, the Apache group
will put it in Apache, I bet Chuck would put it in Webstar and Henrik would
put it in CERN and Brandon would put it in NCSA.  Deal?  I honestly think we
would address the most serious aspects of the incorrect-time problem without
forcing a change to the HTTP protocol by doing this.

Okay, howbout

If-Different: Date > DATE; Content-length != SIZE; Content-type != text/html;

where the conditions are OR'd, and quantities are compared (so we can 
still have the functionality of IMS  where LM < IMS < CURRTIME).  
Hopefully the syntax could allow queries like "give it to me if it's a 
larger file" or "give it to me if it's a higher level of HTML" or 
something.  Thoughts?  This could even be really powerful on arbitrary 
HTTP headers.... and open to abuse of course.
