The if-different header would occomplish this, but still think it's
wasteful.  We should try and use the existing IMS header if
possible.  If it turns out not to be possible then we should add
to the future specification that all http headers can be followed
by one or more arguments delimited by semi-colons.  This will
keep this lossage from happening in the future.

Other than that I'm happy with this proposal.  Let's keep the
names short and get this into some form of a spec so that we
can get on with life.  (not that it hasn't been fun arguing)
