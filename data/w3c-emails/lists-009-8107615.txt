I quote myself:

maybe it's saving the Last-Modifed-Date: like everyone here says it
"should."  Maybe not.  It's not the server's place to force the client to
store that information.  The construct as it is simple.  Has this URL
changed since X.  And as Roy pointed out, this construct also had in mind
the idea of functionality to say: "give me something if it less than 15
minutes old".  If-Modifed-SINCE really does mean If-Modified-SINCE.

Where's that darn sledgehammer?  I need to swat this fly.
