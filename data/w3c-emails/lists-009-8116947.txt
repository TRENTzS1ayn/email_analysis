I think this *is* forcing a change in the HTTP protocol.  On the other
hand I agree it is a good idea and it will go a long way toward solving
the problems discussed here.

It might be even better if the "date" of the IMS is an opaque string
so it could be "<date>;length=<number>" or "<date>;md5=<md5digest>" or
whatever.  The only limitation is that it can't be recreated by the
client, but I think that is unrealistic anyway.
