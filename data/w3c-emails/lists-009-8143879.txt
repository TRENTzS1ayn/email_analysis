YES! Shopping basket applications and highly dynamic documents *require* 
total defeating of caches at every stage. The results otherwise are 
extremely ugly as the user's idea of what is going on becomes radically 
unsynchronized from what the server thinks is going on. Believe me - 
Expires: does not cut it at all. Too many browsers have either truely 
broken implementations or no implementation at all. Mosaic is a particular 
offender on that front.

The cleanest solution to the whole problem is no-cache.
