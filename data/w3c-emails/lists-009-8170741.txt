NCSA sends 401.  That's also what my server does.  403, according to the
draft, means "Authorization will not help", so that's wrong.

Do you mean "include" as part of WWW-Authenticate, or as part of an
entity.  I would be leery of the latter, for the same reason that the
Unix login program doesn't tell you what went wrong:  you don't want to
say whether it was a bad user-id, a bad password, or other.

Well, for Basic there's really no choice to the challenge, is there?
So the challenge will certainly be the same.

As I said above, 403 is the wrong response, according to the words in
the draft (v10-spec-01).

If you said that, you would preclude the server's returning the same
challenge and letting the client have another guess at the correct
value.  Then again, if that happened, the user could try the same link
again, the client would send no Authorization header, the server would
return a challenge, and the user could try again.

That's why I asked for clarification.  My gut tells me there's a use
for 411, but I don't see it yet.
