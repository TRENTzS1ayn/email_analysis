Roy,

Please correct me if I miss your point... What do we gain by having both a
'no-cache' and a 'private' Pragma in terms of functionality ? A 'shared
response cache' is basically a proxy/cache, and Pragma is meaningful to
proxies only, not to user agents. So both headers really mean "don't cache
this response in a proxy/cache", and both let a user-agent local cache free
to cache the response or not.

What's the point of adding 'private' then ? I would understand it if
'non-shared response proxy/caches' were a reality, but AFAIK, they are not !

I think both cases you described above should use 'Pragma: no-cache'.

Jean-Philippe
