Pragma: private would instruct a user agent not to cache the response if its
cache memory (say part of a harddisk in an MS-DOS pc in a university PC lab)
is publicly accessible.  This is particularly important for user agents that
do not clear their caches at the end of the session.

Of course, the user agent needs to be configured to know that its cache is
publicly accessible, one could have a configuration option like `cache
private responses on local disk?'.
