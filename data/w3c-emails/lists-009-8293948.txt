Pragma is transparent to a user agent. From
<URL:http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP1.0/draft-ietf-http-spec.html#Pragma>:

    Pragma directives do not apply to the end-points of a request/response
    chain. For example, a user agent's internal (non-shared) cache and/or
    history mechanism should ignore all pragma directives in received
    messages. Similarly, pragma directives are not applicable to the origin
    of a resource, though they may be applicable to a server's internal
    response cache.

You have a point though, and maybe there ought to be another header telling
the user agent that this information is private, and that it should make all
possible efforts (very platform specific) to keep it private. But that
wouldn't be achieved with a Pragma header field.
