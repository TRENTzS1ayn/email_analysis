Instead of "recipients", I would prefer "proxies". "Recipients", which isn't
defined in section 1.3 of draft-ietf-http-spec.html, encompasses the proxies
and the user agent in my view, whereas the Pragma header field is not
destined for the user agent.

This somewhat changes the scope of Pragma, which is no longer restricted to
proxies in the new paragraph.

I think the name "Pragma" confuses a number of people (cf Lou's initial
interpretation), and it's not clear to all whether a Pragma header field is
destined for proxies only, or for proxies and user agents. Based on the fact
that not so many WWW clients and servers already implement Pragma, I propose
that we replace the name "Pragma" with the name "Proxy". Maybe in HTTP/1.1
specs ? It would be crystal clear that 'Proxy: no-cache' is not destined for
user agents.
