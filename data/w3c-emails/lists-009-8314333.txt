When I say the "Pragma" header orginially, my first throught was #pragma
in ANSI C: an escape hatch to provide implementation-specific information.

Now, this was added originally for the benifit of the CERN proxy server,
and the language of the specs reflect this, but I'm not sure we need
to stick with this if we can be clear what the scope of particular
Pragmas is... the nature of this sort of thing is that implementations
will (and usually should) ignore/discard unknown pragmas.

I _would_ like us to use some kind of current-practice or best-current-practice
interpretation of Pragma: no-cache and If-Modified-Since: rather
than redefining them in some more complicated/tricky way: thus I
tend to favor the suggestions that add new headers/pragmas to offer
new semantics.

(Should any of this discussion go to www-proxy or is that a dead list?)
