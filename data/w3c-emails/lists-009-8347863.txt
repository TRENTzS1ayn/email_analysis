I don't like answering questions -- questioning answers is much easier.  ;-)

It will state when a length (chunked or CL) must be given, yes.

Only when talking to a server that it knows will support chunked messages.
If both are given, CL is overridden.

CGI is outside the scope of this list, period.  CGI will have to be updated
no matter what changes are made to HTTP, but that update is an issue for
server developers and the WWW.  CGI is not an IETF protocol; it is a
server-side API.
