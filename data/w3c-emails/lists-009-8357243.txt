I vote for 1), 2) has proved too confusing already. The name will depend on
what you want to achieve:

1) If you want only proxies not to cache, I vote for:
         Proxy: no-cache
  This leaves scope for other proxy-specific directives to be defined
  at a later stage.

2) If you want both proxies and user agents not to cache, you can either do:
         Caching: all=no
         Caching: proxy=no
         Caching: user-agent=no
  or
         Proxy: no-cache
         Expires: now

To choose between these 2, let me quote Shel Kaphan who summarized very well
the 'Pragma: no-cache' vs 'Expires: now' debate on the 16th:

Thus I think there's no need for the 'Caching' solution, and vote for the
'Proxy: no-cache' solution as a replacement for 'Pragma: no-cache'.

From my reading of the different WWW newsgroups this year, I got the opposite
impression: almost nobody has a WWW client or server which uses Pragma. This
is not based on solid stats, though.

Leaves little time for this side of the Atlantic to react ;-)
