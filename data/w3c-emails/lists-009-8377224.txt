Yes.

It means the user may be authenticated by one of the authorization
databases corresponding to those realms.

Nope.

Yes, assuming that the user is capable of being authorized by
at least one.  However, Basic will be deprecated (and thus "less good")
if there are any other alternatives.

That would be up to the browser.
