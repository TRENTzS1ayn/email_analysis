Not supporting HTTP/0.9 would be a mistake.  It's a very useful
protocol but not every servers needs.  Server can advertise the
version they support.  0.9 may be "antique" but about half the
transactions hitting my server are for 0.9.  For our server
I don't expect HTTP/1.2 to be as useful as HTTP/1.0 based on
the recommendations being made.

Maybe HTTP/1.2 = HSBP/1.0 (HyperShoppers Basket Protocol)
