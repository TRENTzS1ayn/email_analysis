Could you summarize why 411 is needed?  If I'm reading draft 01 right,
anytime someone mistypes their username or password for Basic authentication
the server should send back 411.  I know this change will break at least
some of the existing web browsers, since they look for 401 to trigger their
authentication code.  There should be a very compelling reason to make a
major change from current practice, especially since current practice is so
widely implemented.
