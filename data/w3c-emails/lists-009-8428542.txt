This explanation is a little different from others floating around.
The other interpretation is that Private means that no other
user-agent should be allowed to access a cached copy of this document,
which would presumably mean that it should not be cached in any
intermediate proxy (except possibly for use by the originally
requesting user-agent, but that's too hard and not very useful).
