I've put up a server that (I think) understands HTTP/1.2 features
keepalive and Transfer-Encoding.  (Because I haven't seen an official
copy of the forthcoming draft, I can't be sure.)  It's at
http://www.research.att.com:8000/
and serves content identical to the normal www.research.att.com server.

Here's what you can try:

1) If there's a Connection: keepalive request header, the server will
hold the connection open for 10 seconds.

2) If
- there's a Connection: keepalive request header,
- the protocol version in the Full Request line is HTTP/1.2, and
- the request is a GET on a CGI
the server will use Transfer-Encoding: chunked to send the output.  Try
http://www.research.att.com:8000/cgi-bin/test-report

3) The URL http://www.research.att.com:8000/digest-test refers to a
resource that is protected by Digest authentication.  The user is
"protected".  Password is "try-me-out".  The nonce expires after five
minutes.

Try it out.  Bug reports are welcome.
