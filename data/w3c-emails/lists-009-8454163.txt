Well, it seems to me that, thanks to the change in protocal version to 
1.1, this will in fact not break existing browsers. Simply: If the 
request message indicates HTTP/1.0, send 401, if it says HTTP/1.1 or 
later, send 411.

I believe this is consitent with the spec, and seems to work. In fact, 
most of the new features outlined in HTTP 1.1 and 1.2 can work this way.
