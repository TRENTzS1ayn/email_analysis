I just don't think this applies. The 'comparison' I was suggesting was
not an equal, but a 'greater' comparison. For the most part, clock
drift of seconds or even hours doesn't affect it.

And, secondly, I believe it is reasonable at some point to expect HTTP
clients and servers and the proxies in between to have correct clocks.
We're talking about Internet applications now, for machines that are
well connected on the net.

Maybe it would simplify things if HTTP servers and proxies also
offered a time service, and HTTP clients on impoverished platforms had
an option for setting the time?

I'd handle this using well-known URLs for 'get' rather than some
special protocol, though.
