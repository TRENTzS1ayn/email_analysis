I must have missed something ... if I build an application which needs 
session like control, I have a real hard time believing that I would
find any intermediate caching (as in proxy) acceptable. Providing  a
mechanism where any arbitrary user could retrieve information cached
from a session-id based connection seems like an unnecessary exposure
of semi-private information.

Hence, I would contend State-Info will have little impact since
caching would/should be disabled in most contexts where State-Info
applies.
