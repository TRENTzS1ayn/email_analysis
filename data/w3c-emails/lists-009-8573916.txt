% Not supporting HTTP/0.9 would be a mistake.  It's a very useful

What do you mean by saying, "half the transactions are for 0.9"? 
I think that most of the transactions are simple, and they could be
processed with 0.9, but nevertheless they carry a HTTP/1.0 label.
Therefore, a phasing out of 0.9 should not give much problems, at least
IMNSHO.
