As you mentioned in your paper
<http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/IT94/Proceedings/DDay/mogul/HTTPLatency.html>
there are two sources of such requests:  requests for inlined images
and subsequent hits on links by a user.  I'm shooting for the first
batch, I admit.  In the future, with authentication and payment
additions to HTTP, the short keepalive will address a larger proportion
of the same-server traffic.  Do you have any measurements for which of
the two sources produces more of the same-server hits?
