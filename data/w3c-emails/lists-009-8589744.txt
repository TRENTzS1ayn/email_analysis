Yes, you missed some of the discussion on these mailing lists.  I agree
that pages that contain user-specific information, such as the current
contents of a shopping basket, are inherently uncachable.  But I
contend that it's possible to design a cache-friendly application where
most of the pages are cachable, if you accept that State-Info (my
proposal, http://www.research.att.com/~dmk/session.html) is passed
through intermediaries without becoming part of cache state.

The example I use is a shopping basket application.  A vendor shows you
a product description page that has, on the bottom, a link to "My
Current Shopping Basket".  The product description page is generic, if
you assume that the link is really to a CGI that eats the accompanying
State-Info and spits back a display of your current basket.  So the
product description itself can be cached.  Furthermore, because
State-Info should not be cached, the semi-private information is no
more exposed than it otherwise would be for passing through
intermediaries.

One of Jim's objections was to my (erroneous) assumption that caching
proxies routinely do GET I-M-S to the origin server, so sending
State-Info was cheap.  If S-I can't piggy-back with I-M-S, I agree S-I
adds expense.  And because Expires is being sent more often, proxies
send I-M-S less often.

Perhaps.  There's still value in not shipping the entire document,
however.
