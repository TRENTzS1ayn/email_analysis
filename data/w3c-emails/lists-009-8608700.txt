Only some of the pages in a session based application need caching.
(Catalog pages can be cached.  The state of an account cannot be).
Only idempotent methods can cache their results.  So, there is no
reason why state-info needs to be passed through to an origin server
by a cache when the cache contains a cacheable result already.  This is
actually a very important optimization.
