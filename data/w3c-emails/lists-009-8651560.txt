I didn't get much done over the past four days, so I hope people aren't
sitting on their comments until the next round.  I'll try to get both
drafts updated tonight.

Except for the definition of Pragma, I have not had any negative
comments on the content of the HTTP/1.0 BCP draft.  Does that mean
we have reached consensus?
