That would be a 5 dimensional table.  Since I have yet to see a table
format that accomplished this without duplicating every line of the
current spec, I'd be pleasantly surprised if you could do one.

The reason the current specification seems difficult to read 
is because it is a flattened 5 dimensional table in prose.
