I don't think Paul necessarily meant a table.
Think man page per method:

  Method: GET
  Request Headers:
  
      AuthorizationOptional
      FromOptional
      If-Modified-Since         Optional
      Orig-URI                  Optional
      RefererOptional
      User-Agent                Should
  
  Entity Headers
  
  Entity
  
  Possible Status Codes
  
      200 Success, resource included as entity in response
      301 The resource has moved permanently, see Location header
      302 The resource has moved temporarily, See Location header
      304 ...

I approach the spec from the point of view of implementing a
server.  Okay, I need to write the GET code now, what
headers can I expect in legal messages and what do I have to
return in the responses.  I would think client writers would
approach it the same way.  As the spec is currently layed
out, I find getting this information very difficult.

No wonder I've been confused :-)  I think 7 man-like pages
(one per method) would go a long way to helping.
