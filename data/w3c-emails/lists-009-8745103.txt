Howard's interpretation is exactly what I meant. My inclusion of the 
table seems to have confused things. It was actually just the way I was 
personally using to help me summarize the information that I would 
present basically as Howard shows below.

I don't understand Roy's comment about duplicating every line of the 
spec. My intent was that the bulk of the information about each field 
should be where it is in the current spec, and presence in the list of 
fields for each method is really just an indiciation that that info 
applies to that method.

I recognize Roy's dilemma -- if you're really going to be precise, then 
you also have to say what response header fields are appropriate
