IMO, this kind of method is outside HTTP.  I think it is best handled by
(conceptually, at least) an outboard application, as follows:
1)  user agent -> origin server
Request stream entity
2)  origin server -> user agent
Here's identifier for entity
3)  user agent creates (possibly) separate process, handing the
identifier to it
4)  separate process examines identifier, connects to (possibly)
separate entity server
5)  separate process and entity server negotiate bandwidth, etc.
and commence to handle stream

HTTP is not all things to all people, and I think one of the things it
is not is a real-time transport protocol.  It seems to me much better
to segregate such sophisticated real-time processing elsewhere.

Note that, in my description above, there's no requirement for the process
or entity server to be different from the user agent and origin server.
But there's no requirement that they be the same, either.
