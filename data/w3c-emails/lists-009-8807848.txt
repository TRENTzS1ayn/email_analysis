'205 Reset Document', suggested in a followup, would be an explicit request
for this behavior.

The idea was not to give the user another choice, it was to provide a
response that says, "that last one was okay, go ahead with the next one,
and keep using the same form."  The user won't see a different result --
the same resetting can be accomplished, for instance, by resending the
blank form.  The difference would be in the speed of the response.
