A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories.                                                               

       Title     : Proposed HTTP State-Info Mechanism                      
       Author(s) : D. Kristol
       Filename  : draft-kristol-http-state-info-00.txt, .ps
       Pages     : 7
       Date      : 08/23/1995

HTTP, the protocol that underpins the World-Wide Web (WWW), is stateless.  
That is, each request stands on its own; origin servers don't need to 
remember what happened with previous requests to service a new one.  
Statelessness is a mixed blessing, because there are potential WWW 
applications, like ``shopping baskets'' and library browsing, for which the
history of a user's actions is useful or essential.                    

This proposal outlines a way to introduce state into HTTP.  A new 
request/response header, State-Info, carries the state back and forth, thus
relieving the origin server from needing to keep an extensive per-user or 
per-connection database.  The changes required to user agents, origin 
servers, and proxy servers to support State-Info are very modest.          

Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address.  After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
     "get draft-kristol-http-state-info-00.txt".
 Or 
     "get draft-kristol-http-state-info-00.ps".
A URL for the Internet-Draft is:
ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-kristol-http-state-info-00.txt
 
Internet-Drafts directories are located at:

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-kristol-http-state-info-00.txt".
 Or 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-kristol-http-state-info-00.ps".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.

For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@cnri.reston.va.us.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
