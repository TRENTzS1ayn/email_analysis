I like the notion of partial entity transfer. However, I would prefer 
that content-length always refer to the transmitted length of the 
content, for all requests.  Siince you're intorducing new header 
fields, why not add one for the total-length of the entity?

The proposal allows fetch of the tail of a file.  If we go down this 
path, why not generalize it to an arbitrary slice?

Is this makes caches more efficient, why forbid its use by cache servers?

] A suggestion for a new Header field to support partial file transfer. 
In the normal
] use of HTTP with HTML, many (most?) transfer activities are aborted. 
This makes a
] cache much less efficient, as it have to re-start the file transfer from its
] beginning.
