    I understand the advantages of separating the effort for supporting
    PLAY from the HTTP standardization. However, the separation may not
    be as clean as it appears from your example. This is because
    PLAY/GET is a property of the request, not of the item being
    requested (though PLAY may not be relevant to certain item types).

This can be handled by something like:
   <PLAY SRC="imp://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/todays_song.au"
         ALT="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/todays_song.au">
giving the browser a choice of mechanisms.

    For example, caches for the different protocols may wish to share
    data.

It's clearly possible to use one proxy to handle multiple protocols
(HTTP, Gopher, FTP, etc.) so adding one more protocol to the set
should not be impossible.  In other words, my proposal makes it
*possible* to share the cache between HTTP and IMP, just not *required*.

    I also expect any work on a separate protocol to take much longer
    than the inclusion of a minimal version of PLAY in HTTP.

Ever looked at the source code for an HTTP server or proxy?  Some
of them are pretty twisted.  I would bet that you could write a new
IMP server in less time than it would take to understand an existing
HTTP server.

And it will certainly be easier to write separate specs for IMP and
HTTP.  Especially because the working group is unlikely to support
putting an untested design into the HTTP spec.
