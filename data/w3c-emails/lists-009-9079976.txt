Clicktrails were a fallout from the original State-Info proposal, but
they weren't the main focus, and I would be willing to sacrifice them.
I would support a separate mechanism.

Note that clicktrails raise the same objection that State-Info
forwarding raised:  each request to a caching proxy would require a
connection from the proxy to the server, even if the proxy could
satisfy the request.  That's one reason people objected to the
State-Info forwarding.  Other people have been discussing (on
www-talk?) ways for origin servers to request statistics from proxies
regarding (cache) hits for their server.  That may be a more fruitful
approach to gathering the statistics.
