Paul Leech reports:

>Section 5.2.2 on the HEAD method says that HEAD is just like GET, 
>except that the server must not return any Entity-Body in the response. 
>Section 6.2.3 on redirection status codes, 301 and 302 (Moved 
>Permanently and Moved Temporarily ) says that the Entity-Body in the

Ooops, contradiction.

>Presumably, 301 and 302 are reasonable responses for HEAD requests (303

The latter -- I'll fix this in both specs.
