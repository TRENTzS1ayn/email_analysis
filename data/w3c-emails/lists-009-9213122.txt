Just a reminder to folks interested in WWW I18N that there will be an
informal BOF at the upcoming 7th International Unicode Conference at the
San Jose Hyatt on Sept 14 or 15 (exact time and place TBD).

The full agenda and reg. info can be found on the Unicode home page:

Also, for any TeX folks out there, Don Knuth will be giving a plenary talk
entitled: "Experiences getting ready for Unicode."

Regards,
Glenn
