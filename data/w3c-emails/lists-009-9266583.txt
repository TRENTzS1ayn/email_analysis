I claim that any response that originates from an origin server can
legitimately contain a state-info header, and that it's best not to
complicate that.

Suppose that a POST returns the same resource that a later GET
*could* return. The POST's returned resource gets cached, even though the POST
itself could not have been served from a cache.  The POST's response can
legitimately contain state-info.   So, there is no correlation between
responses that can contain state-info and those that can be cached.
Leave cacheability to the already too numerous headers that control that.

  Why the need for extra headers?

There may not be a *need* for it that we can imagine right now, but
there's also no need for restrictions against it.  An origin server
may legitimately and aggressively try to start sessions whenever it can,
including times when it is delivering cacheable, shared resources.
