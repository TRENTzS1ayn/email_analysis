This certainly happens on quite a few servers (including ewse.jrc.it) where
you have forms which either reveal themselves; or act as a 'post' to 
themselves. Seen this quite a few times on other servers as well. Either
for code management/development reasons; or because of referals from other
scripts; it allows you to have central data entry pages.

Yes exactly. We had to deny access to quite a few chaches on the site 
because they just did that.

Yes; but it would be better, imho, to design things decently from
scratch and distinish between *what* is to be chached in its context. If
you look at our experimental ewse.jrc.it server you might see that the
pages seen also depend on the user who sees them. So I might see a different
layout to the shopping mall than you do; even though we use the same url.

This is something which, although ill defined, is happening at quite
a few places with configurable shopping bags and god knows what. And
I personnaly, as a server admin, would hate to block chaching completely.
