The *results* of these operations can be cached.  The expires header
is appropriate.  Requests for these methods must go all the way
through to the origin server, and cannot be served from a cache
themselves.  The results can be identified with the Location header in
such a way that a subsequent GET or HEAD can retrieve *its* results
from the cached resource left in the cache by the POST, PUT, etc.
