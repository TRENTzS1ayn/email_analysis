My operational definition is: GET and HEAD are idempotent.

The `no side-effects' in the spec is also a philosophical statement, see the
last paragraph of the `idempotent methods' section.  A side effect like
incrementing a page counter is allowed.

The philosophical definition of `idempotent' is: if I let my browser issue a
non-idempotent request on an URI, I can expect to get no side effects that
have an unexpected significance to me or others.

What this means is that server administrators may not put scripts that send
mail, post news, cause products to be ordered, cause me to be subscribed to
a mailing list, behind idempotent URI's.  Such scripts should be put behind
non-idempotent URI's.

The main reasoning behind this philosophical definition is:

 If www.blah.com puts an `auto-subscribe to our junkmail list` function
 behind a GET in http://www.blah.com/iwantjunkmail, some joker om foo.edu
 will start putting <img src=http://www.blah.com/iwantjunkmail> on
 a totally unrelated page like http://foo.edu/~joker/barney.html.
