% >Idempotent
% 
% I second the request for a clear definition in the context of this spec.
% Another good reason for this: idempotent is not in any dictionary
% (including my Webster's unabridged) that I could find.

Being a mathematician, my idea of idempotence is a function f such as
f(f(x)) = f(x) . 

Now, I admit it is not something I'll put on the http specs, but what about

"something which does not change if requested twice in rapid succession"?

ciao, .mau.
