How about:

"the results do not change in a way that matters (to the client or 
server) if repeated twice in a row (i.e., with no other intervening methods)"

The reason that GET incrementing a counter can still be idempotent is 
that it doesn't matter to the client or server. (If it did, e.g., 
payment was based on hits, then this arguement wouldn't apply.)

I don't have a position (yet) on whether GET should be required to be 
idempotent. However, if it isn't, then any non-idempotent GET *must* be 
marked non-cacheable.
