Close.

Here are three ways I can think of:

1. A prior POST on the same URI as the subsequent GET can leave
something in a cache.

2. Any prior response that returned a Location header with the same URI
as the subsequent GET, in a 2xx response, can leave something in the
cache.

3. If the cache is a public cache, it might have been
another GET.  The side effect might be one that you want to cause the
first time a given *user* GETs a certain resource, not just the first time
anyone behind a cache requested it.

1. and 2. are extremely useful features, not bugs.
