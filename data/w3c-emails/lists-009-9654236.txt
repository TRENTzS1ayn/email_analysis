rom what are you construing that there would or could be Expires
headers sans the document they correspond to?

This really argues against all such use of the Location header,
doesn't it?   Not just the Expires header that goes along with it?
Location in 2xx responses could be used in just this way
in any case.  Maybe there just needs to be a restriction that Location
in 2xx headers must be on the same server as the request URI. 
(This would be similar to the security precautions in the Netscape
cookie proposal).

Wouldn't we have to *change* it to 'can't cache POST'?  Where is it
written now that POST outputs can't be cached?  And isn't this a
different issue anyhow?

fearing we're all on different wavelengths as usual,
