Proposals for additional language in the HTTP 1.1 spec.

In section 8.19:

To address the security hole that Larry Masinter recognized:

"If a Location response header is returned with a 2xx response,
the location must be on the same server as the request-URI.
If a cache or user agent receives a 2xx response containing a Location
response header with a location on a different server, it should
disregard the Location header."

To inform cache and user agent implementors of the significance of the 
Location header in 2xx responses:

"If a cache or user agent receives a 2xx response containing a
Location header, it should use the location designated by this header
as the cache key for the returned resource, and should not use the
request-URI for this purpose."
