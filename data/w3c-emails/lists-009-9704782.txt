] I don't know -- I think you should look at the uses of "should" in
] 8.19 a little more closely.

I'm not sure what your objection is.  But, if a server doesn't include 
a Location header field in a response to POST, then you're shopping 
basket application won't work, just as you seemed to be complaining 
about.  So it seems to me you should be in favor of a stronger wording.

As to the meaning of should, lots of RFCs use the following definition 
for "should":

              This word or the adjective "RECOMMENDED" means that there
              may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to
              ignore this item, but the full implications should be
              understood and the case carefully weighed before choosing 
to do so.

Thus, "should" shouldn't be used if one of the exceptions is (e.g.) 
"when using POST" -- i.e., a very common thing.
