> Why not use "cacheable" instead of "idempotent"?

No, that doesn't work - "cacheable" refers to the object, "idempotent" refers 
to the method. I would rather say that an idempotent method does not change 
the topology of the Web.

The reason for using "topology" and not "state" is that in some cases, 
idempotent requests can change the state of the web - especially if log files 
are considered as a part of the state of the Web, or for example if a document 
can be accessed 5 times.
