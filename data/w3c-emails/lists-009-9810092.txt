Now you've got me worried.  The example you gave requires that your
"basket" page never be cached, essentially because it is accessed
under different URIs for different request methods, and caches in the
world can't be assumed to be continuously up, robust, and correct.

This then seems to imply a general unpleasant side effect of using
Location URI != request URI.  If any frequently changing responses are
ever sent on a request URI where that URI is also used on some other
response as a Location header URI != its request URI, the response
must be uncacheable.  Otherwise a non-robust cache that fails to
notice the Location header going by may get stuck with an out of date
version of the response.
