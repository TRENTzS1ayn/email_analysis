Yes, 2 is unacceptable.  We'd be breaking the entire universe, or
making an ugly kludge if we then require a retry with 1.0 if and when
the server doesn't accept the 1.1 request.  Furthermore, HTTP/1.x is
defined to be backword and forward compatible with other HTTP/1.x, so
even in that light this would be unacceptable, because a valid
HTTP/1.1 request would not yield a correct response from a HTTP/1.0
server.

Making the Host: header a _required_ header in HTTP/1.1 clearly solves
the problem, and is painless, with no interoperability problems.  How
you choose to enforce it I don't really have a strong opinion about
(error msg vs ignore); I don't think an error response should be
required from servers that don't exploit the Host: header, but it
would be fine for servers that serve multiple domains.
