   #2 (Full URL) may give server admins a real incentive to 
switch over quickly--the impulse to jealously guard bandwidth 
can be powerful. 

   I may have to run a 1.0 and 1.1 server simultaneously on separate 
IP addresses for a while, but I don't think it would take long to 
switch over with that kind of incentive. 

   #4 (Host+Error) doesn't give any such incentive. 

   I vote for #2 (if my vote counts) and I'll recover 6 IP addresses 
that much sooner! ;^)
