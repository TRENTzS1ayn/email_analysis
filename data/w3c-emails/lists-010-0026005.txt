Please be realistic -- full HTTP/1.1 support in a server can't be done
overnight -- and the spec is much less tolerant about non-fully
compliant servers this time.  Hence -- you won't necessarily have your
favorite HTTP/1.1 server available the moment there is a HTTP/1.1
client around, and you have bug reports flowing in because your server
is 'broken' for the new 1.1 client.

In any case -- whether the host is in the URL or the Host: header is a
mere matter of taste.  One of them breaks things, the other doesn't --
so which one do we pick?
