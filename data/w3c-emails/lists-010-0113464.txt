We cannot *guarantee* accurate implementations of anything.

This is what I propose.

Yes, and a simple protocol has the highest change of being implemented
accurately.  Plus, major browsers already do this.

I do not have to prove to you that leaving the request line format as
it is and requiring Host in 1.1 guarantees an accurate implementation.
I can't prove that anyway.  I believe this option gives the best
changes of accurate implementation, though.

I would like to see some arguments from your side on why the
"long-term operability/ survivability of HTTP on the network" depends
on 2, which is requiring the full URI in the 1.1 request line.
Especially because 2 will break the short-term operability.

In my opinion, introducing mass breakage by requiring the full URI in
the 1.1 request line will _not_ make implementations more accurately
follow the 1.1 protocol.  Quite the contrary.

Yes, this is the sticking point.

I don't think it is, but we can have this discussion after may 1.
