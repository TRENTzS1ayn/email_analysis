This looks like a great improvement to me.  The Via header meets my
detectability requirements.  Roy, I will propose some minor edits to
your header text in private e-mail, these edits will not change the
header semantics.

The introduction of Via changes the status of the issue 'Section 3.1:
interoperability between HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1' on the issues list.

Old text:

  KH: Section 3.1: interoperability between HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.

  Do version handling rules for servers and proxies need to be changed?

  Review the whole spec for interoperability problems.

New text:

  KH: Section 3.1: interoperability between HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1. 

  Do version handling rules for servers and proxies need to be changed?

  Status: No, the Via header will make version upgrades and downgrades
  by proxies detectable to parties that need to know.

  Review the whole spec for interoperability problems.

  Status: to be done by the whole http-wg in April.

[Note to Jim Gettys: In the last version of the issues list I have,
the above old text appears twice.  Please delete the first instance.]

Koen.
