I don't see this as an incompatible change, assuming wording is put into
the spec along the lines of the following: "A client may not send request
to an HTTP server using a full URL in the request until it has determined
that the server is compatible with HTTP/1.1 or later."

If it is required that HTTP/1.1 servers support full URL requests, then
once a client has sent a partial URL request to a server, and gotten back
a response tagged with "HTTP/1.1", it seems to me that there is no reason
that the next request to that server cannot be in full URL form.

Am I missing something (most likely)?
