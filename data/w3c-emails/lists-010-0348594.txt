I agree with all of Roy says here, although I believe that we don't need to
use his provocative wording. I propose changing:

>   This allows the origin server or gateway to

>   URL of a server harboring multiple vanity hostnames on a single IP
>   address.

To:

>   This allows the origin server or gateway to
>   differentiate between internally-ambiguous URLs, such as the root "/"
>   URL of a server that serves HTTP for many hostnames on a single IP
>   address.
