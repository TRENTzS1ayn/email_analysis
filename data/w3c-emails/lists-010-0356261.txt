In theory Roy is right, in practice the situation is somewhat easier:
I added the following two lines to my CERN servers config file:

Maphttp://gatekeeper.bne.private**
Maphttp://bne.ind.eunet.hu**

and now the old 1.0 server accepts full URLs.

I guess that the NCSA server can be tricked similarly.
(NCSA gurus, is this true? And other servers can be configured in the same way?)

And going even further:
Passhttp://gatekeeper.bne.private*/var/httpd/htdocs/internal*
Passhttp://bne.ind.eunet.hu*/var/httpd/htdocs/public*
Passhttp://www.CareNet.hu*/var/httpd/htdocs/company*

... and the CERN server goes virtual!

Almost all servers have some mapping rules from web (URL) name space to 
filesystem name space, and using full URLs instead of Host: may give us 
more benefits!
