Because it doesn't gain us anything more than just sending Host on
all HTTP/1.x requests.  If there was something wrong with the Host
solution, then I could understand the desire to do that.  However,
given that there is nothing wrong with the Host solution, and Host
has already been deployed, this all seems like a waste of time.
