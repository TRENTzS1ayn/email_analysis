Just clearing out the tail end of the chain here..

My point: I think that it was a design mistake to link together:
- The thing is identified by a "name-like" thing that starts with HTTP,
  and has a last resort access method using the HTTP protocol
- The fact that we are currently using the HTTP protocol to access it.
Even on the link to the origin server.

But if we all accept that:
- HTTP/1.1 is a stopgap until multiplexed HTTP (2.0) comes along
- HTTP/2.0 will have full URLs and no Host: header
then I don't see any reason to keep on beating this dead horse at this moment.

Is it possible to get this strategy written down in a 4-page "strategy" 
document?
It might be nice to have the words down on phosphor that we agree upon.
(Or I might just have missed the URL of the document, of course....)

Thanks for caring!
