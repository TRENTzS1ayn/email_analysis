A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
Working Group of the IETF.                                                 

       Title     : A Proposed Extension to HTTP : Digest Access 
                   Authentication

The protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.0" includes specification for a Basic 
Access Authentication scheme.  This scheme is not considered to be a secure
method of user authentication, as the user name and password are passed 
over the network in an unencrypted form.  A specification for a new 
authentication scheme is needed for future versions of the HTTP protocol.  
This document provides specification for such a scheme, referred to as 
"Digest Access Authentication".  The encryption method used by default is 
the RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm [2].              

Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address.  After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
     "get draft-ietf-http-digest-aa-03.txt".

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-digest-aa-03.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.

For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@cnri.reston.va.us.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
