I agree with Roy.

Yup, those sites that need it will have deployed the servers that
can handle the host header.  The rest won't care, and the Host header
will have considerably less impact on those other servers than the
full URL will.  The problem is getting the clients that send the Host
header adequately deployed.

Not true, all the NCSA 1.5 servers handle the host header.

I believe Netscape clients already support the host header (but you better
ask someone from Netscape) and the change is already in the pipeline for
the Mosaic clients.  So yes, I'd say the Host header is well on the way
to being supported already.

Yes, Yes!  Additionally, I think that most server sites tend to upgrade
only when they get complaints.  So the previous solutions suggested where
the client silently corrects the URL based on the HTTP version number will
NOT encourage sites to upgrade, they will just increase traffic.
