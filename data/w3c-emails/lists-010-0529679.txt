Eeesh, this is a big, big lose IMHO.  Sending the full URI would mean a 404 
on almost every request for quite some time to come on the Internet.  Jim's 
#4 is the reasonable choice.

BTW, I can testify to the truthfulness of "admins don't change servers until 
the users complain".  That is why I am still running CERN 3.0 on my server, 
and why we ran it on our proxy until recently.  If it has the capabilities 
you need, and it isn't broke, you don't fix it.
