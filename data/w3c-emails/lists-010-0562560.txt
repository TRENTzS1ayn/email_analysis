I would like to see one thing (as discussed at the LA IETF):

I think we should require (MUST) that servers accept full URL's with all
methods in HTTP 1.1. I think this will greatly help our transition strategy
in the future. I do not think that we should have clients sending full URLs
(Maybe unless they already know that a particular server is a HTTP 1.1
server in which case they could omit the Host field and just send the full URL?)
