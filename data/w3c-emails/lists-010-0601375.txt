I still can't imagine any major browser vendor sending the full URL on the
first request right now. At least not unless John Klensin writes me a $5
million contract to provide him with such a browser. But normal users are
just not going to be picking software which is twice as slow at getting the
initial document display on the current installed base of servers.

I do strongly agree with saying that HTTP 1.1 servers MUST recognize both forms.

Well one use of sending method information is for proxy-servers. For example
we use a proxy server which receives HTTP requests with FTP URL's and then
gets the file and returns it in an HTTP response. But then again its normal
to send full URLs to proxies anyway.
