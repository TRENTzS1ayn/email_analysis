    3) Some transport stacks have a more difficult time detecting a
    closed remote connection than a reset one (The reset causes all
    calls to report an error while a close causes many to continue to
    work).
    
Since HTTP/1.0 uses close-of-connection as the end-of-entity-body
indicator, how could such stacks support HTTP/1.0?  This seems
so fundamentally broken that I find it hard to believe we should
warp the protocol to deal with it.
