Jeff, I think you misunderstand what I was saying. I am not suggesting a
reset after the entity-body. I am suggesting allowing a reset _from the
client_ rather than the client sending a subsequent request.

I agree that the server must use a close rather than a reset, unless it is
responding to a network failure, etc.
