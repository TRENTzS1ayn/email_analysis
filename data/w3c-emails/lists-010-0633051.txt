It is as simple as it might seem.

A couple points:

- dns is a real performance pain
- gethostbyname call doesn't give you ttl information back
  So, if a ttl info is needed, you have to basicially integrate all 
  resolver code, talking udp to DNS server. Also server selection, timing out,
  exponential back off and all that. Basically, it is a integration of the whole
  BIND into client/server.
