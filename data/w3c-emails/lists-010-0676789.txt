Note that for DNS security, the prefered interface to the gethostbyname 
functionality needs to change anyway to return an indicator as to whether 
the information has been authenticated, is from an insecure zone so it 
can't be authenticated, etc.  Perhaps while that additional return info 
in being added, adding return of the TTL so an applicaiton could cache 
the data and discard it properly would be reasonable...
