Given the current DNS performance. You don't have a choice if you want  
a decent performance. You just have to cache dns info. 

I think the best you can do without integrating the whole BIND is to integrate
just result interpreter, gethostnamadr.c into your code. So you can get ttl.
and then use res_send call to resolver library. Not to mention to blocking
behavior of res_send, which can block up to 5-10 seconds... It's just really
painful.
