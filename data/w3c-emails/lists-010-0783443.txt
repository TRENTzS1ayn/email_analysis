Agree. We need client side (resolver's client) caching. I think we can't afford
to make a network conversation, even on udp on every single dns lookups. 

Also, if resolver library does a caching/nb-lookup, we can feel more 
comfortable about DNS security. As least we will be using the same algorithm,
not 100 different caching scheme by 100 different implementations/programmers.
