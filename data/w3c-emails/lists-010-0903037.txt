I have some additional ideas. Danzig., et.al (SIGCOMM92 ??) shows that 
NEGATIVE caching DNS will help to reduce DNS traffic quite a bit. 
Negative cache means when DNS lookup fail (may be after 2-3 trails) for
that particular host, we should cache the result (the failure) for a short
time to avoid subsequent look up (which likely to fail again). Say 2 minutes.
