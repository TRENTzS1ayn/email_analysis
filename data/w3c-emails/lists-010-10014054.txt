After some reflection, I realized that this concern might be in the
domain of User Agent Hints as a more general category. So for starters,
I'd suggest;
   UA-Hints: safe=[yes|no]
And then I'd propose adding some server requests re history list
handling:
         history=no : This response SHOULD NOT be included in a UA
                      history list.
         history=noredo:  Show the current response in the history list
                      w/o ever reperforming the request. RELOAD/REFRESH
                      by the user follows safe= semantics.
         history=refresh: Never reshow the current response, rather 
                      repeat the request or at least check it.
         history=replace: The page from which the current response was
                      requested is replaced. This is similar to =no except
                      that =no causes the next page to replace while
                      =replace allows the current response to replace the
                      previous page

The default would be the current haphazzard muddle implemented by the 
individual UAs.

The control these options (including safe=) would greatly improve the
usability of three complex WWW applications I've assisted in the 
development of.
