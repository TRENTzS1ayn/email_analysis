Should content-disposition from RFC 1806 be considered for HTTP?

Try sending 

  Content-type:        application/octet-stream
  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="fname.ext"

HTTP header fields in the response of your script. This
at least works with Netscape Navigator since version 2.0

Although not specified in the HTTP 1.0/1.1 drafts the
the definition of Content-Disposition: can be found in 
http://www.internic.net/rfc/rfc1806.txt
