Yes.  `strongly encouraged' seems to be a HTTP invention.  I don't see
this as a real problem, but it you would rather see SHOULD, that is
fine with me.

Your version looks OK to me.  

I have no real rationale for my XX=10 minutes, other than that it
seemed like a good enough XX to allow load balancing between mirrors
through dynamic DNS remapping.  Too high a value for XX (like the DNS
worst case default, if such a thing exists) would not sufficiently
encourage client authors in making code to get the real TTL.
