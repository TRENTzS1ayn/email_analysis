Yes, that was my main objection.

Nonsense.  Many POST actions are safe by nature, and if POST is to be
used for i18n, many more will be.  Examples are POSTs to search
engines and to HTML checkers with a forms interface.

I care little about the side benefits on the status of Link.  I want
something which promotes i18n, and `safe: yes' is better at that.

I don't think i18n is a lesser issue.

So tell me where to look for the existing definition of `rel=source',
like I asked.  I might even copy it into the `safe: yes' ID.

_Some_ headers can be deployed without IETF action, but `safe: yes' is
not one of them.  As long as `safe: yes' is not approved by the IETF,
any browser which uses it as a license to treat a POST as safe would
be clearly non-conformant to the 1.1 protocol.
