If we waited until everybody had a 'clear role', we'd never get
anything done.  An "Internet Draft" is just a working document, and
the only reason for having one is so that we can have a discussion
where the referent in the discussion is concrete.  Too often there's a
long mail interchange where someone makes a proposal and then changes
it 10 times during the discussion, and then someone else says "I
really like it" and other people don't know which 'it' is really the
final 'it'.  If something is going to happen on this, *someone* must
write an Internet draft describing what that someone wants to have
happen.

We've gone on about this for a long time. I would like to declare this
topic closed until there is a volunteer to write up and submit an
internet draft. If you would like to volunteer, let me know.

Regards,

Larry
