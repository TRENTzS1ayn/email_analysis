I wasn't referring to the bookmark file structure, but to
standards regulating privacy and security issues, beyond safety, per
se, if a server saved the post-content for access via a network URL,
as the "rel=source alternative" would appear to require, if it could
be made workable at all.  This wouldn't be necessary if you contribute
a mini-ID just for the Safe: yes | no header, as I hope you do.
