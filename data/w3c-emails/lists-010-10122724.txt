This is not true.  The only time that web internationalization might
impact the choice of POST vs GET is when it is not known what the input
character set will be *and* it is possible for the user agent to submit
data in some character set other than what is expected *and* the form
does not contain an entry box for the user to select which particular
character set they are using *and* nobody has convinced the browser
community to include a standard hidden form field containing the charset
whenever the charset is not the same as that of the output form.

In other words, i18n has nothing to do with it.
