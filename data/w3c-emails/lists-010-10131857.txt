> Should content-disposition from RFC 1806 be considered for HTTP?

As a MIME entity-header, I already consider it to be in HTTP.
The same goes for content-description (a.k.a. Title).
The real question is whether (or how) it should be described
within the next HTTP spec.

I think it falls into the "damned if we do; damned if we don't" category. ;)
