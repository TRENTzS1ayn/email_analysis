Quoting from section 5.2 of [2] (draft-ietf-html-i18n-05.txt):

   The best solution is to use the "multipart/form-data" media type
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   described in [RFC1867] with the POST method of form submission.
                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Do you disagree with draft-ietf-html-i18n-05.txt, or with my
interpretation of it?  I can't really tell from your comments.

I have not read all of draft-ietf-html-i18n-05.txt, so I may be
missing something, but the quote above seems quite clear.  POSTs are
the route draft-ietf-html-i18n-05.txt seems to be taking, and
draft-ietf-html-i18n-05.txt is approved as a proposed standard.  

My proposal attempts to identify and clear away an obstacle to the
deployment of draft-ietf-html-i18n-05.txt.  If you can convince me it
does not, I will retract my proposal.
