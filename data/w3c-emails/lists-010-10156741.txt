Yes, I disagree with <draft-ietf-html-i18n-05.txt> and I did so
more than once on the HTML WG list.  I'd rather not discuss it again.

For the particular problem they were discussing, yes.  That particular
problem only occurs under ALL of the conditions I described.  What i18n
did was try to find a theoretically cleaner solution to a problem that
has already been solved in a number of ways in practice.  What they should
have done is just recommend using the existing methods of handling
charset-varying input until such time as there was a new method for GET+body.

What obstacle?  Having the user hit the OK button is an inconvenience.
Given that the conditions under which a charset-sensitive input dialog
is needed is ridiculously low (and no, this has nothing to do with
western vs non-western -- it is only when the input text is in a different
charset than what the server would expect, the charset of the form),
I just don't consider it a worthy justification for yet-another HTTP
control field. [And if it was, the browser community would implement it
long before the standards committee, regardless of other HTTP requirements.]

I don't mind the proposal -- just be sure the justification for it
matches the actual need and doesn't invent problems that don't exist.
