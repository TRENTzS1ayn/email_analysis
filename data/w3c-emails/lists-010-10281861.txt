Incorrect. I18N needs message bodies if any one of the following is true.

1) The coded character set or encodiung of transmitted data is
   known and it is anything other than ISO 8859-1.
2) The server indicates that it can accept multiple coded character
   sets and encodings, and one from the list is being used for the
   transmitted data.

>In other words, i18n has nothing to do with it.

I think I18N has everything to do with the choice of using message
bodies or not.
