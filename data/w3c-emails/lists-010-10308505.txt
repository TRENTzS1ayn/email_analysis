Hmm.  Here's some more quibbling about individual words in our
email communications.  The "nothing" and "everything" in those two
sentences make both of them hyperbole.  :) :)

Reason b) in the Safe ID does need a tweak in its wording, and
perhaps some reasons c) and d) need to be added for why POST often is
used despite the Request-URI-plus-subordinate-content being safe.

But it's otherwise an excellent -00 draft. :) :)

Thanks Koen!  You made my day!!!!
