SaiRam!!

Can someone tell me how to make my CGI program redirect to another 
location instead of the one that is executing this script? 

I don't seem to be ablt to do it with just a 
printf(toClient, "Location: http://npac.syr.edu/somepage.html");
and writing toClient to the client.

Do I need to have "Content-type: text/html" also! Can anyone point me to 
some examples of how you achieved redirection using HTTP headers?

Any help is very much appreciated.

SaiRam!
