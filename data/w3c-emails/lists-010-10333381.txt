True, and I did not mean to imply it did.  If I understand the messages in
this thread correctly, the I18N draft make the uses of _method bodies_
necessary, and in current envirionents, that means using POST.

The existing Cache-Control header can already be used to indicate
cache/reuse for a GET-WITH-BODY.  

And if a new GET-WITH-BODY is defined, one would not need the Safe header
anymore, one could simply define GET-WITH-BODY as always safe.  However,
some HTML form hacks would be needed to provide the same level of downwards
compatibility with existing browsers that Safe can provide, for example

  <form action="..." method=post preferred_method=get-with-body>
   ....
  </form>.

So it boils down to cruft in HTTP vs. cruft in HTML.

Koen.
