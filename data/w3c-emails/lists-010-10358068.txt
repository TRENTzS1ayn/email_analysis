That seems general enough, with the right and full semantic
connotations.

In addition to the requirements that it result only in
retrieval and be safe, what about idempotence (as actually defined

That appears to pertain to automatic retries on interrupted
or segmental transmissions between HTTP/1.1 UAs and servers.  How
would the PGET body affect those considerations?
