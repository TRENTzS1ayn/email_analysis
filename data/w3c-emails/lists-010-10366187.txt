When decoding chunked (section 3.6): 
 
1) chunk-size is an arbitrary length hex string; however, it does not 
   say anything about byte order. 
   I presume, since the first digit cannot be zero except for the 
   ending chunk, that it is intended to be little endian? 
 
2) the spec is very vague on chunk-ext: it appears to be an extenstion 
   mechanism; what am I supposed to do if I don't understand it? 
   I presume ignore it. 
 
3) what is the point of the CRLF after the chunk-data?  We already know 
   the size; it is only likely to introduce bugs in implementations 
   that decide (falsely) that it is safe to just scan for CRLF. 
 
(a year too late once again)

Thank You,
