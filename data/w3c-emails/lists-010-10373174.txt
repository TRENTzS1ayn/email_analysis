You're thinking too hard. :-)  It's just a number.  Convert it with
strtol().

It is an extension mechanism.  Yes, ignore what you don't understand.

It makes debugging easier, because each chunk-size begins on a new
line.  It would be reckless to scan for CRLF anyway, because CRLF could
be part of the chunked data.  So you obviously *have* to use the count.
