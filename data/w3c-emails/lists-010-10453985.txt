No.  While exact cache comparison is the most frequent use of IMS,
it is not the only use, and sending an IMS value containing the Date
(instead of the Last-Modified) field value is normal and accepted practice.
The server will not adequately support HTTP clients if it does a strict
equality check.

That is the wrong fix.  The right fix is described under how to deal
with last-mod dates which are later than the server's date (the remote
filesystem problem) and how to interpret IMS dates which are later
than the server's date (the bad clock problem).  Additional opaque
validation can be achieved by using the Etag and If-None-Match header fields.
