The IESG has reviewed the Internet-Draft "Hypertext Transfer Protocol
-- HTTP/1.0" <draft-ietf-http-v10-spec-05.txt, .ps> and recommends that
it be published by the RFC Editor as an Informational RFC, but with the
following IESG Note:

The IESG has concerns about this protocol, and expects this
document to be replaced relatively soon by a standards track
document.

  This document is the product of the HyperText Transfer Protocol
  Working Group. The IESG contact persons are Keith Moore and Harald
  Alvestrand.
