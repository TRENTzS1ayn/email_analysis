Hello

In discussions with colleague of mine about the http and
some ideas for improvements, he directed me to the working group. I have
read the proposed http/1.1 document and cannot find any references to the
changes that I have in mind, nor can I find the archives for this list to
see if this has been proposed before. Could some kind soul contact me
directly and point me to the right forum/protocol for sharing these ideas?

Thanks

-Doug
