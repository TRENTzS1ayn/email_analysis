I will refrain from responding to your various dogmantic and absolutist 
statements other than correcting one clear error.

Not the WTS working group at www-security@nsmx.rutgers.edu, but as I said,
the *TLS* working group, whose mailing list is at ietf-tls@w3.org with
archives at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-tls.  This information
is not obscure but easily findable from the IETF web page. 

(I have not been active in the TLS working group.)
