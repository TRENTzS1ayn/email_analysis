Perhaps we have different ideas of what "transparency" means, but it seems to
me that receiving an entity with an erroneous header is not transparent. It
could certainly lead to undesirable behaviour on the part of downstream 1.1
caches, such as periodically trying to refetch the "stale" entity (and, of
course, getting another stale one).
