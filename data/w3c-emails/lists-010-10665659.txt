I might agree with you that it's undesirable.  But if I was Jeff Mogul I'd
retort lengthily how this insures that users always get the right document.
Then if I was Roy Fielding I'd jump on Jeff for destroying the entire New
Zealand network and making his aunt pay huge network charges.

This analysis is completely correct.  Caches will misbehave on the side of
document accuracy, to a fault.

But given that I've never seen a browser that handles caching/history
buffers the way I'd like (which changes on the situation), I'm not going to
lose sleep over a 1.0 cache that erroneously/needlessly re-requests
documents.  But that's just me.

Larry, it would seem a slight rewording of the warning Note: would be
appropriate given the wording of the definition of semantic transparancy.
