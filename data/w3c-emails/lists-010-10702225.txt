Folks,

I did not mean to start a debate on what the 'real' problem was or the
'most important problem', I just meant to say that 'no coordination'
is a problem.

To make this forward-looking rather than backward-looking, if there's
an ongoing effort to merge SSL and PCT, that's fine, and we don't need
(in HTTP-WG) to be concerned with it.

What I'm concerned about as 'undocumented' is the entire scheme of the
integration of "shttp:" URLs, warnings about secure forms and insecure
forms, interactions with other parts of HTTP and cookies,
etc. Ultimately these are important to document and standardize.

Regards,

Larry
