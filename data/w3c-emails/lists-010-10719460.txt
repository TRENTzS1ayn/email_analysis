In a previous life, I created a distributed web collaboration tool.  I
have seen people collaborate with it.  Trust me, having some forum
space will _not_ get us a complete and coherent list of (calls for)
editorial revisions.  In my opinion, the _only_ way in which we will
get such a list is if one person publicly commits to maintaining it.
