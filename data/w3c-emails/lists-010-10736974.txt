I think (1) is the most acceptable solution of the three.  At some
time, we need to add a note to the spec telling that 1.1 clients
should be aware that 1.0 caches could send erroneous staleness related
Warnings. The note should outline a method to deal with this.

It is not very bad if that method causes a few cache misses.  Even if
chains with 1.0 caches in them will become common, responses with
Warnings won't, so the impact on overall efficiency should be small.
