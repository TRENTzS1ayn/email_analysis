I have seen where groups are publishing specWeb96 numbers approaching 1000 URLs per second.  Using the common log file format and assuming an average entry of 100 bytes this translates to over 8 Gigabytes of data in a 24 hour period.  

Given the importance of tracking hit information with respect to advertising revenue and in some cases user profiling, what are servers doing with the size of this log information?  

Is the hit-metering draft that I have seen reference to going to address this?

Is there a more appropriate forum for a question such as this?
