Only the proxy knows its own configuration, which contributes to the
decision of whether or not the proxy does an up-to-date check or not.
The Warning header is the only means of telling the client of that
fact.

See above.  The proxy has config parameters only known to itself,
which affect the cache control policy.

Not, because HTTP/1.0 doesn't do any of that header wiggling stuff in
the cache.
