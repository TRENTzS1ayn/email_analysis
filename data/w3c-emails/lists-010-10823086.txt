I don't think there is a wording problem here: the spec talks about
_weakening_ the transparency.  I read 

 Warnings are always cachable, because they never weaken the transparency
 of a response.

to mean `.., because they never cause a stale response to be
interpreted as fresh'.

Aside: though I don't think that the sentence is _wrong_, I do think
it is potentially confusing.  I have argued repeatedly in the past
that the term `semantic transparency' is useless for describing HTTP,
and that it should therefore not be used in the draft.  Like
`idempotence', the term `semantic transparency' will haunt us for
years to come.
