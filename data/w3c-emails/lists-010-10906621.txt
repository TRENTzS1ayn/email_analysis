The more essential problem is that there is not enough evidence -- by
the lack of traffic on the list -- that others besides Rohit are
committed to PEP or even care about PEP.

Right now, Rohit's battle plan has Rohit wrangling this problem
alone. I just don't think that's workable.

I'd like to see a small subcommittee of 3-5 people commit to producing
a PEP draft that they agree on, to be produced within a fixed period
of time. If Rohit the appropriate leader for that subcommittee that's
OK with me, but we need some others to explicitly step forward,
identify themselves, commit to working on it, etc.
