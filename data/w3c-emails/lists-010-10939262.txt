By directory, I mean attribute-based searching.  That seems to be both
the past (X.500), the would-be future (XFN), and the fad-of-the-moment (LDAP).

>*much* easier to build and deploy than a searchable directory.

But the latter is where the world is going.  Someone could make a real
name for themselves by publishing a list of OID's, representations,
and semantics for web-page attributes.
