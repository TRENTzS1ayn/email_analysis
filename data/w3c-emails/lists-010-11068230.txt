I don't think this makes sense .... my implemented conclusion has been:

1.  The protocol level returned in the response should declare the level 
    of the response.
2.  The response protocol level from a server should never be higher
    than the request's protocol.
3.  The client must interpret the response based on the response protocol
    level, not the request protocol level.

I believe there is potential breakage otherwise.
