 ^^^^^^^^^^

Well, I think we need to make a separation between 

 1) extensions which offer content rendering facilities and

 2) extensions which offer protocol services.

In my opinion, not making this separation will destroy cachability.

Transparent content negotiation was designed to handle 1) among other
things.  I hope that PEP will handle 2).  If you think that PEP should
be made to handle 1) because nothing else does, we have a big
synchronization problem.
