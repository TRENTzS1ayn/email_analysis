I don't have a strong opinion either.  (b) makes for more interesting
diagnostics, but that is about it.

It is important to note here that, as the 1.1 spec does not tell
whether to do (a) or (b) if the numbers are 1.0 and 1.1, it therefore
allows both.  So if you are implementing a server, pick either one.

If this WG were to make a definitive statement that you must either
pick (a) or (b), that would amount to us updating the 1.1 spec, and we
want to avoid doing that.

Of course, if things break because the spec allows both (a) and (b),
we will have no choice but to update the spec.  We will only find out
about such breakage however if some implementers do (a) while others
do (b)...
