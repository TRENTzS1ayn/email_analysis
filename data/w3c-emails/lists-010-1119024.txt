412 Precondition Failed

    Same as current 412 -- just the reason phrase has changed and
    the explanation associated with the as-yet-undefined precondition
    header field name.  This may end up as "reserved for future use",
    but the code will remain in the spec.

413 Request Entity Too Large  [proposed by Jeff Mogul on http-wg, 07 Dec 1995]

    If the server doesn't want to receive the large body, it
    immediately replies with a 413 response, and
    immediately closes (not resets) the connection.
    
    If the client manages to read the 413 response, it must
    honor it and should reflect it to the user.

    If this restriction is considered temporary, the server may include
    a Retry-After header field to indicate that it is temporary and after
    what time the client may try again.

414 Request-URI Too Large

    The server is refusing to service the request because the
    Request-URI is longer than the server is willing to interpret.
    This rare condition is only likely to occur when a client has
    improperly converted a POST request to a GET request with long query
    info, when the client has descended into a URL "black hole" of
    redirections (e.g., a redirected URL prefix that points to a suffix
    of itself), or when the server is under attack by a client
    attempting to exploit security holes present in some servers using
    fixed-length buffers for reading or manipulating the Request-URI.

415 Unsupported Media Type

    The server is refusing to service the request because the entity
    body of the request is in a format not supported by the requested
    resource for the requested method.
