It was, in earlier drafts, but various people insisted that it be removed.

As of the beginning of last month (when the IESG accepted draft 07 as
an RFC without any major changes).  It is now unlikely that any significant
protocol requirements will be added without a corresponding bump in the
version number, which is my definition of being safe to claim "HTTP/1.1"
compliance, since there *will* be many implementations calling themselves
HTTP/1.1 before the spec can be revised again.
