Section 19.7.1 of the draft says:

When it connects to an origin server, an HTTP client MAY send the Keep-
Alive connection-token in addition to the Persist connection-token:

       Connection: Keep-Alive

What is the "Persist connection-token"?  I couldn't find another
reference to it anywhere.  Is there another document describing
1.0-style keepalives?
