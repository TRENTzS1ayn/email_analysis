That sentence is vestigial, lingering from the time before we made
persistent connections the default.  The example used to read:
Connection: Keep-Alive,Persist

So the wording in the draft should be corrected to:

When it connects to an origin server, an HTTP client MAY send the Keep-
Alive connection-token:

       Connection: Keep-Alive
