Forgive me for asking such a question, but is an experimental 1.1 server
available that will run under Win32? (Windows 95 would be nice.) Better
yet, how about a Java implementation? 

I've been experimenting with the idea of using HTTP/1.1 as a messaging
protocol, and it would be very useful to be able to have a system with
which I could work. Unfortunately, Unix boxes are hard to come by at the
moment.

On a related note when the PEP question was posted I was so swamped with
other things that I really didn't have time to go through the draft and
determine how important these extensions would be for my purposes. Where
does PEP stand?
