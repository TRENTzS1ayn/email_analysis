Maybe I'm being a bit picky here, but it should be made clear that there
are no known plans in the HTTP WG to replace the HTTP/1.0 document, nor to
replace the HTTP/1.0 protocol described in the document in question. There
certainly are plans to come out soon with a *different document*, and that
document will described a *different protocol*, namely HTTP/1.1.

Of course, there are also plans to try to get as much of the world to adopt
the new protocol as soon as we can. However, this is an implementation
issue.
