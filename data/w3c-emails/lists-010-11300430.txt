I think in the current web architecture, the granularity of caching is
exactly 'what can be pointed to by a URL', and if you want to deliver
a database record and cache some parts and not others, what you'd do
is deliver a composite object that explicitly includes the other
parts. If you want to use 'multipart/related' for the container,
that's fine, but you might find each part being delivered as
'message/external-body;access-type=URL".
