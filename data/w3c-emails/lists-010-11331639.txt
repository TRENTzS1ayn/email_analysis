We have just finished draft-ietf-http-feature-reg-00.txt, which
defines feature tag registration procedures.  I have made a copy
available at

<URL:http://gewis.win.tue.nl/~koen/conneg/draft-ietf-http-feature-reg-00.txt>.

The draft is intended as a discussion draft.  It is partly based on
material taken from draft-ietf-822ext-mime-reg-04.txt.

                     Feature Tag Registration Procedures

                      draft-ietf-http-feature-reg-00.txt

 ABSTRACT

   The internet draft draft-holtman-http-negotiation-03.txt
   (Transparent Content Negotiation in HTTP) specifies a `feature
   negotiation' mechanism for negotiation on content characteristics
   other than MIME type, charset, and language.  Feature negotiation
   allows the quick introduction of new dimensions of negotiation
   through the registration of `feature tags'.  A feature tag
   identifies a capability of a user agent or a preference of a user.

   This document discusses considerations related to feature tag
   registration, and contains a proposed definition of a feature tag
   registration procedure.  Feature tag registration is foreseen as an
   ongoing, open process. It should keep pace with the introduction
   of new rendering features by web software vendors, and other
   parties such as standards bodies.

Happy reading!

Koen.
