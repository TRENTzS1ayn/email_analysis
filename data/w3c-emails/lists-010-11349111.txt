 A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
 Working Group of the IETF.                                                

       Title     : Feature Tag Registration Procedures

The internet draft draft-holtman-http-negotiation-03.txt (Transparent 
Content Negotiation in HTTP) specifies a `feature negotiation' mechanism 
for negotiation on content characteristics other than MIME type, charset, 
and language.  Feature negotiation allows the quick introduction of new 
dimensions of negotiation through the registration of `feature tags'.  A 
feature tag identifies a capability of a user agent or a preference of a 
user.    
                                                                  
This document discusses considerations related to feature tag registration,
and contains a proposed definition of a feature tag registration procedure.
Feature tag registration is foreseen as an ongoing, open process. It should
keep pace with the introduction of new rendering features by web software 
vendors, and other parties such as standards bodies.

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-feature-reg-00.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.



Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
