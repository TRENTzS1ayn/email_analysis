I don't think this is a topic for HTTP-WG directly, but we should be
aware of the contexts in which HTTP responses might be encapsulated:

 A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories.                                                              

       Title     : Payload Format for HTTP Encoding in RTP                 
       Author(s) : B. Aboba
       Filename  : draft-aboba-rtp-http-00.txt
       Pages     : 7

This document specifies a payload format for use in encoding HTTP within 
RTP. This payload format can be used for unreliable multicasting of 
resources such as Web pages, stock tickers, etc.  As with other RTP 
applications, receiver feedback and group membership information is 
provided via RTCP.
