For some reason, this appeared Tuesday on the main IETF list, but not on
the HTTP-WG list:

 A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories.                                                              

       Title     : Simple Hit-Metering for HTTP Preliminary Draft          
       Author(s) : J. Mogul, P. Leach
       Filename  : draft-mogul-http-hit-metering-00.txt
       Pages     : 26
       Date      : 10/28/1996

This draft proposes a simple extension to HTTP, using a new ``Meter'' 
header, to permit demographic information to be reported by caches to 
origin servers, and to permit an origin server to control the number of 
times a cache uses a cached response.  It also outlines techniques that 
origin servers can use to capture referral information without 
"cache-busting."

Note that this is NOT the same proposal that Paul and I circulated
at the end of July.  Although the latest proposal has the same goals
and shares some of the same design concepts, we've made several
significant design changes that (we believe) results in a much simpler,
more elegant design with far fewer loose ends.  Please ignore our
previous (July 31) draft!
