This is inconsistent with the latest HTTP 1.1 draft section 14.1, "Accept":

     If an Accept header field is present, and if
     the server cannot send a response which is acceptable according to the
     combined Accept field value, then the server SHOULD send a 406 (not
     acceptable) response.

IMHO, HTTP URN resolvers should follow HTTP 1.1 on use of "Accept:".
