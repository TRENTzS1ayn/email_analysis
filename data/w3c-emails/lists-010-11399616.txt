Hmmm.  This is starting to sound like the use of variant lists in
transparent content negotiation.  What does a `HTTP resolution
protocol' do?

By the way, it is OK for a protocol extension on top of HTTP/1.1 to
extend (i.e. be inconsistent with) the HTTP/1.1 semantics of the
Accept header.  A protocol extended server should however be careful
to avoid that responses inconsistent with HTTP/1.1 end up at plain
HTTP/1.1 clients.  This means in particular that you have to be
careful in making your responses cacheable.
