 A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
 Working Group of the IETF.                                                

Note: This revision reflects comments received during the last call period.

       Title     : HTTP State Management Mechanism                         
       Author(s) : D. Kristol, L. Montulli
       Filename  : draft-ietf-http-state-mgmt-04.txt, .ps
       Pages     : 19
       Date      : 11/04/1996

This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with HTTP 
requests and responses.  It describes two new headers, Cookie and 
Set-Cookie, which carry state information between participating origin 
servers and user agents.  The method described here differs from Netscape's
Cookie proposal, but it can interoperate with HTTP/1.0 user agents that 
use Netscape's method.  (See the HISTORICAL section.)                          

Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username

 Or 
     "get draft-ietf-http-state-mgmt-04.ps".
A URL for the Internet-Draft is:

Internet-Drafts directories are located at:

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-state-mgmt-04.txt".
 Or 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-state-mgmt-04.ps".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.



Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
