I've noticed more and more software vendors using CGI applications to allow
users to download software.  Unfortuately at this time there isn't a way
to tell user-agents to save the code under a name other than the script name.
This problematic especially when there is more than one selection on a form.

I would like to suggest a new header for HTTP/1.1:
Save-As:

A CGI application could return this header with a file name (and possibly
path, although that has security implications - Save-As: /etc/passwd for
instance.  Though it would fail on a well maintained system, it is still a
risk) which would be used by the user agent instead of the script name for
saving.

I would have a number of uses for this tag, and I've seen numerous sites
that have the same aplication.  I think this would be a very useful addition.
