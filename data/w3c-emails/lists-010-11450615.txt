The risk could be minimized by not allowing path information in the
value. The UA would 'know' the root path or prompt the user..

Depending on your server and the ability it may have to map request URLs
to cgi scripts, it may be possible to include a realistic file name
as part of the URL ... for example, we use a url of the form:

   http://xxxx/export/zwexport.zwe

to convince the UA to save the data under the name zwexport.zwe but the
'script name' is 'export' and the remainder of the path is simply
arguments to the script. The server that does this is the user
interface server built into ZooWorks so we own the server and 
the exact options for other servers are not something I've studied.
