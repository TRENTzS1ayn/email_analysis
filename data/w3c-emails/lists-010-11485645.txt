Thank you very much.  I'd done quite a bit of digging and asking around but
never stumbled over this one.  I'd just given up and was ready to write a
new proposal.

Is anyone else interested in reviving RFC1806 for incorporation into HTTP/1.1?
<URL:http://www.internic.net/rfc/rfc1806.txt>

Thanks again.
