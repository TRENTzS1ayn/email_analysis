There is a solution that should already serve your purpose.

The Content-disposition header can contain a "filename"
parameter for naming a file.  When the Navigator sees this
parameter it will use it as a default filename for saving.

The following use should work when returned from a CGI script:

Content-disposition: file; filename=foo.exe

The Navigator only uses the filename parameter, everything
else in the header is currently ignored.

The Content-disposition header is also used in HTTP file upload
and is documented in Larry Masinter's RFC on file upload.
