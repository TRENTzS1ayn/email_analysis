I'm late putting together the schedule for the December IETF; I expect
to put together a draft agenda in the next few days, but if you have
any items you would like to see on the agenda, please let me know.

My guess is that it is the best use of our time to discuss those
Internet Drafts that have been submitted.

Note that there are tentatively two _other_ HTTP-related BOFs
scheduled for this IETF: a joint 'Transport' session on HTTP-NG and a
BOF to discuss the creation of a Distributed Authoring and Versioning
working group.
