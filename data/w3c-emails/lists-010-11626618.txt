While it seems safer to state support for a bounded interval, it seems
likely that some will wish to state support for 101 --> oo
because of a significant change in 101. Probably better to
say x_version >=101 and x_version <= 200 but until a conflict on the
upside is known, x_version>=101 would work. But I may also wish to
say I support colors >= 256, etc.
