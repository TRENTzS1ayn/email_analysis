I think you make a good case for adding complexity with the `I support
versions 101 -- 200' example.

x_version>=101 would work at first, but it is fundamentally broken.
If 201 is a newer version of x with a significant change, then a
browser which sends only x_version>=101 will choke when getting a 201
version it reported it could handle.  The broad deployment of a
browser which sends only x_version>=101 will thus _prevent_ the smooth
introduction of version 201.  This is the kind of trickiness we are
dealing with.

So I think that if we have ">=", because it is useful in some cases,
we should also make it very easy to say that you support an interval
like 101 -- 200.

We cannot go for the interval notation "x_version=101-200" because we
would get a parsing ambiguity: x_version could also be a non-numeric
tag with the value "101-200".

I guess that adding a notation

  x_version=<101-200>

which allows the shorter versions

  blah=<255->    wox=<-200>

meets all concerns best.  I'll add it in the next version.  If you
know a nicer notation, let me know.

Note that I'll also keep the wox<=200 notation.

I don't know if you would want that for the color case.  If your
screen can show at most 2^8 colors and you say you can handle more,
you run the risk of getting the best variant with 2^24 colors, which
takes twice as long to download and 5 times as long to render in 2^8
colors, instead of the 2^8 color variant the server also had.
