Having negotiated with myself as well as the area directors and the
agenda gods, I wish to announce a schedule change:

*  The HTTP-WG meeting at the December San Jose IETF will end
   35 minutes early on Tuesday. That is, HTTP has
     Mon Dec  9 9:30-11:30
     Tue Dec 10 9:00-10:55
   see ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/masinter/http-wg-agenda.html
   for tentative list of topics.

*  There will be a "URL BOF", in the same room
    Tue Dec 10 11:00-11:30

The agenda of the URL-BOF is:

   -   review status of Internet Drafts intending to
       replace 'generic syntax' in RFC 1738 and RFC 1808

      (I believe this will be 
      draft-ietf-uri-url-syntax-00.txt )

   -  Review current RFCs and Internet drafts
      describing URL schemes (ftp, file, news, telnet
      mailto, vemmi, data, etc.)

   -  Decide on whether there is a need to (re)constitute
      a URL working group to
      - move URL from 'Proposed' to 'Draft' standard status
      - create a BCP for URL registration mechanisms

Regards,

Larry
(off-net for a week starting tomorrow, so don't expect replies.)
