There was only one comment on the draft, from Rich Salz.  I made
a minor edit in response.  Unless further comment is forthcoming,
this will closeout the CONTENT issue.

And to answer his question about whether a IANA registration of
something implies an open specification, the answer is no, not
necessarily.  We must provide guidance to IANA on what/how things
should be registered.  The MIME experience is that making such
a registration dependent on such a specification being available 
can be more trouble than it is worth.  Ergo, we use "should" rather
than "must" for that recommendation.

Proposed Resolution:
====================

Section 3.5:
============
Change:
-------
Content coding values are used to indicate
To:
---
Content coding values indicate


Change:
-------

content-coding= "gzip"|"compress"|token

to:
---
content-coding= "gzip"|"x-gzip"|"compress"|"x-compress"|token


Change:
-------
Gzip is available from the GNU project at 
<URL:ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/>

to:
---
[gzip]


Add to section 3.5 (Content Codings):
-------------------------------------

HTTP defines a registration process which uses the Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority (IANA) as a central registry for content-coding value
!tokens.  Additional content-coding value tokens beyond the four 
!defined in this document (gzip xgzip compress xcompress)
!should be registered with the IANA.
To allow interoperability between clients
and servers, specifications of the content coding algorithms used
to implement a new value should be publically available and 
adaquate for independent implementation, and must conform to 
the purpose of content coding defined in this section.

Add to section 16: (References)
-------------------------------

[gzip] Gzip is available from the GNU project at 
<URL:ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/>, and a
work-in-progress describes the gzip data format
in detail.
