I havne't been following this thread very closely and I don't claim to know
the answers but I can't let that pass.  A lot of people are billing based on
hit count and deliberately disabling caching so as to get that data as well
as other data.  That's was the experts at the W3C sponsored meeting some
months ago in Cambridge Mass (on how to decrease melt-down caused by web
traffic) who had studied the matter had to say.

Perfection is not generally needed for utility.
