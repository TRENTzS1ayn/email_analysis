That is the part of the draft that I really like and appriciate, handing out 
simple counts is OK as long as I preserve the privacy of my users.

The other way to look at that is that I as cachemaster am giving the 
information providers a free ride: they get free diskspace and the illusion of 
good connectivity, for which they should pay me and be grateful since I serve 
_their_ consumers. Demanding hitcounts from me is demanding that I provide 
them with further service for which I get nothing but more network traffic and 
added complexity. There are at least two sides to every coin.

 PS: Until they cull me on my head with something hard, I will argue for web 
caches as pure network buffers; no stealing or illegality in buffering bits.
