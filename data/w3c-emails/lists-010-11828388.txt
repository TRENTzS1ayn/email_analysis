That's how I see caches, too -- I just wanted to add some melodrama.

Your point about caches providing content providers a service by
caching them is true, too.  It's a two-way street -- on the other
hand, the content provider is doing you a favor by providing a service
that your users find useful, so they stay online and use your
services.  There are benefits to both parties, that's why I think it
makes sense to co-operate.
