How about switching: the note will be the definitive text, the paragraph
above it the explanation/motivational note?

I think the explanaority paragraph is useful to relate RFC 1864 to the
HTTP context; if everyone else thinks its redundant, I can be persuaded
to remove it.

Send me private opinions on the utility -- no need to clutter the list:
a one liner with "useful" or "not useful" will do.
