Are you saying there's a way right now with the HTTP to do statistical
sampling?

Or are you implicitly proposing
Cache-control: proxy-revalidate;stale-probability=.01
(where the new directive "stale-probability=.01" (spelled however you
like) means that the cache should make an entry be stale with
probablility .01 at each access; this is combined with the usual meaning
"proxy-revalidate" to pass a random sample of requests along to the
origin server). If so, it's an intriguing idea.

Nonesense. If "people" won't do the first and will do the second, then
getting them to do the second will mean that the community is better off
than if they just remain "scum sucking pigs". Damage to the community as
a whole only follows if proposing the second is the _cause_ of them not
doing the first.
