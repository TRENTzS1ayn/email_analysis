"not as clearly useful" is what has me worried. If it is not needed I do not 
want it.

The default use includes both usage-limiting and hit-metering, servers are 
likely to try to take advantage of the combination. If usage-limiting and 
hit-metering are independent, why have an example that shows how to use 
usage-limiting in combination with hit-metering? If a origin server hands out 
usages only to caches that do hit-metering; and cache-busting documents to the 
rest (I read your draft as suggesting this is a neat way to do it), then the 
combination does influence which parent I fetch documents from. The security 
aspects of this are interesting, because it may force unaware caches to 
channel their traffic through one branch of the mesh (and possibly take down 
the top cache server as it gets overloaded). If the origin server keeps track 
of what usage-limiting happens at different cache servers (as your example 
suggest), this is a bigger problem.

How will this influence load-sharing?
