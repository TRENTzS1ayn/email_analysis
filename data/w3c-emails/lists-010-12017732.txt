Folks,

This is very a minor issue.

Didn't we just go through this with 1.1? I think consistency in the
protocol is an important consideration. Either it should be a human
readable protocol, or a binary machine optimized protocol.. defining
synonyms for terms seems to add nothing but confusion.

I think the abbreviations are un-necessary especially when you
consider the excellent job Jeff and Paul did at making sure that the
default (empty) conditions of meter: are the common cases. Further
condensation seems like a fool-hardy optimization.

While I'm willing to trade simplicity for some reasons, I don't find
the argument compelling enough here.
