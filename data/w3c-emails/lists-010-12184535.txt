Regardless of what it says in the spec, the Age value is not touched
by the cache unless resident_time > 0.  In other words, a cache does
not age a response that it has never had in its possession.  It is only
when resident_time > 0 (the response is coming from the cache and
not from an upstream server) that the cache sets the Age value in
the message.
