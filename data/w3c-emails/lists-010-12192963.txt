Are we making a distinction here between "proxies" and "caches" 
then? It seems the wording in 14.6 still requires caches to 
send the Age header, even if acting more as a proxy. Henrik's code 
that he posted earlier seems to follow this too. 
 
As an implementer, I take the wording to mean calculate the 
Age value and send it everytime even if I've just received the 
response and it's not really in the cache yet. 
 
Putting that aside though, my real question went back to the 
discussion in July between you and Jeff Mogul over the algorithm. I 
guess your point here still reflects that. It does seem the 
algorithm (if all caches send Age) can easily inflate the value. 
More so if there are multiple caches in a chain and the resource 
is kept resident for any length of time in each.
