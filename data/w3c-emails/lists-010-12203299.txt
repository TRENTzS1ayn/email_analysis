By the way: a slightly updated safe internet draft was submitted
yesterday.  See

  http://gewis.win.tue.nl/~koen/draft-holtman-http-safe-01.txt 

for a copy.

The main new message in the draft is: we have to solve the
`unnecessary confirmation dialog' problem, and work on other solutions
being absent, we have to solve it with the Safe header.  I put this
message in the draft because I won't be there to say it in person.

Koen.
