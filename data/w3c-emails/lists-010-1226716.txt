This message reflects my understanding of consensus on the Via header
field as a replacement for the Forwarded header field present in draft 01.

===================================================================

10.xx  Via

   The Via general-header field must be used by gateways and proxies to
   indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients between the user
   agent and the server on requests, and between the origin server and
   the client on responses. It is analogous to the "Received" field of
   RFC 822 [9] and is intended to be used for tracking message forwards,
   avoiding request loops, and identifying the protocol capabilities of
   all senders along the request/response chain.

      Via   =   "Via" ":" 1#( received-protocol received-by [ comment ] )

      received-protocol = [ protocol-name "/" ] protocol-version
      protocol-name     = token
      protocol-version  = token

      received-by       = ( host [ ":" port ] ) | pseudonym )
      pseudonym         = token

   The received-protocol indicates the protocol version of the message
   received by the server or client along each segment of the
   request/response chain.  The received-protocol version is appended to
   the Via field value when the message is forwarded so that information
   about the protocol capabilities of upstream applications remains
   visible to all recipients.

   The protocol-name is optional if and only if it would be "HTTP".  The
   received-by field is normally the host and optional port number of
   a recipient server or client that subsequently forwarded the message.
   However, if the real host is considered to be sensitive information,
   it may be replaced by a pseudonym.  If the port is not given, it may
   be assumed to be the default port of the received-protocol.

   Multiple Via field values represent each proxy or gateway that has
   forwarded the message.  Each recipient must append their information
   such that the end result is ordered according to the sequence of
   forwarding applications.

   Comments may be used in the Via header field to identify the software
   of the recipient proxy or gateway, analogous to the User-Agent and
   Server header fields.  However, all comments in the Via field are
   optional and may be removed by any recipient prior to forwarding the
   message.

   For example, a request message could be sent from an HTTP/1.0 user
   agent to an internal proxy code-named "fred", which uses HTTP/1.1
   to forward the request to a public proxy at nowhere.com, which
   completes the request by forwarding it to the origin server at
   www.ics.uci.edu.  The request received by www.ics.uci.edu would then
   have the following Via header field:

      Via: 1.0 fred, 1.1 nowhere.com (Apache/1.1)

   Proxies and gateways used as a portal through a network firewall
   should not, by default, forward the names and ports of hosts
   within the firewall region. This information should only be
   propagated if explicitly enabled. If not enabled, the received-by
   host of any host behind the firewall should be replaced by an
   appropriate pseudonym for that host.

   For organizations that have strong privacy requirements for hiding
   internal structures, a proxy may combine an ordered subsequence of
   Via header field entries with identical received-protocol values into
   a single such entry.  For example,

      Via: 1.0 ricky, 1.1 ethel, 1.1 fred, 1.0 lucy

   could be collapsed to

        Via: 1.0 ricky, 1.1 mertz, 1.0 lucy

   Applications should not combine multiple entries unless they are all
   under the same organizational control and the hosts have already been
   replaced by pseudoynms.  Applications must not combine entries which
   have different received-protocol values.

      Note: The Via header field replaces the Forwarded header field
      which was present in earlier drafts of this specification.

- 10.20  Forwarded
- 
-    The Forwarded general-header field is to be used by gateways and 
-    proxies to indicate the intermediate steps between the user agent 
-    and the server on requests, and between the origin server and the 
-    client on responses. It is analogous to the "Received" field of RFC 
-    822 [9] and is intended to be used for tracing transport problems 
-    and avoiding request loops.
- 
-        Forwarded      = "Forwarded" ":" #( "by" URI [ "(" product ")" ]
-                         [ "for" FQDN ] )
- 
-        FQDN           = <Fully-Qualified Domain Name>
- 
-    For example, a message could be sent from a client on 
-    ptsun00.cern.ch to a server at www.ics.uci.edu port 80, via an 
-    intermediate HTTP proxy at info.cern.ch port 8000. The request 
-    received by the server at www.ics.uci.edu would then have the 
-    following Forwarded header field:
- 
-        Forwarded: by http://info.cern.ch:8000/ for ptsun00.cern.ch
- 
-    Multiple Forwarded header fields are allowed and should represent 
-    each proxy/gateway that has forwarded the message. It is strongly 
-    recommended that proxies/gateways used as a portal through a 
-    network firewall do not, by default, send out information about the 
-    internal hosts within the firewall region. This information should 
-    only be propagated if explicitly enabled. If not enabled, the for 
-    token and FQDN should not be included in the field value, and any 
-    Forwarded headers already present in the message (those added 
-    behind the firewall) should be removed.
