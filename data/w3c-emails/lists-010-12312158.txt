This satisfies my interest in the matter. The only point I might
question in the fact that we have lost the use/re-use granularity in
this response-directive that is maintained elsewhere throughout the
proposal. This breaks that pattern relying on aggregates instead, but
I can't see an alternative short of 3 different directives
(report-use-count, report-reuse-count, report-aggregate-count) and I
don't really like that as an option.

I'm convinced on this issue. The above mechanism should be sufficient
anyhow.
