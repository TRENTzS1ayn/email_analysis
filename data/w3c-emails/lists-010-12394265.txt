Give it up Roy. You have been trying to push your personal belief on this
for months. The most that can be *accurately* said is that you object to
the clear statement in the specification. You have no special 'rights' -
the spec is the *consensus* of the HTTP WG, not your personal spec.  That
you do not *LIKE* the final spec is not a problem with the spec but with
your relationship to it.

Roy - false cachable hits are MUCH worse than false uncachable hits. Your
'doomsday scenario' of network meltdown because of the extra hits due to
pre-maturely expired objects has NOT been demonstrated and some people
pointed out that your prefered scheme potentially results in stale objects
being served as fresh - which is utterly unacceptable under any
circumstances. Caches *should* be ultra-conservative with regard to Age.

The published proposed standard is correct. Your position is not. Please
quit trying to express an ownership of the standard - it is not "Roy
Fielding's Proposed HTTP Standard". It is the IETF's proposed standard
and the result of the consenus of the WG.
