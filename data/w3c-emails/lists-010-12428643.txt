I've been informed that a recent reorganization of IETF areas has
merged applications and application-specific network management, and
thus that HTTP-WG is responsible for reviewing proposals for managing
HTTP agents.

We don't have a particular agenda item for
draft-hazewinkel-http-mib-00.txt at the next HTTP working group, but
perhaps you could update the working group as to the status of this
work?

I do have a few minutes on the agenda for "HTTP MIB".

Larry Masinter
Chair, HTTP-WG
