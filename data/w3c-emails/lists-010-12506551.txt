Shel,

Are you saying that none of the current proposals for hit metering
will help with unique-URL cache-busting because they don't actually
address the problem of browser behavior?

# Not to beat a dead horse or anything, but the reason people use these
# techniques is because they are the only way to guarantee some degree
# of control over the user experience.

Don't cookies do the right thing?

# To really beat a _thoroughly_ dead horse, this is the case because
# caches and history mechanisms are improperly conflated in most
# browsers.

Didn't we 'fix' this with HTTP/1.1?

Larry
