Yup. This problem will not clear until the author has the ability to
distinguish between 'This page *MUST NOT* ever be displayed from a
history', 'This page *MAY* be redisplayed from a history but *MUST NOT* be
refetched when displayed from history', 'This page *MAY* be redisplayed
from a history, but *MUST* be refetched first', and 'This page *MAY* be
redisplayed from history, unconditionally.' THe last two cases can be
handled by properly implementing the existing Expires and cache control
directives. But the first two cases cannot be done at all right now - and
are both quite important.
