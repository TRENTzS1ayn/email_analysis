Its worse than that. The world has started using many different TLA
extensions for CGI type stuff. .dll is used on the Microsoft site with a
path segment of 'isapi'. I have also seen .ast, .asm, .asp, .nsf, .exe,
.phtml, and of course .pl, .cgi and even .tcl. TO add to the problems,
some people configure Apache to do server-side parsing on .html files. One
general rule of thumb is 'anything except a widely known file extension in
the standard mime.conf file plus some common others (.mpg, .mov, .fli,
.avi, .wav, .mp2, .mp3, .png, .htm, .pdf, .java, .class) is probably being
generated dynamically'.
