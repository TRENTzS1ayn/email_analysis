Unfortunately, use of server-side-include type schemes (what .shtml is
typically meant to invoke) is not always so easy to detect --- the
Apache web server, for instance, has hooks which allow the same sort
of processing to be applied to *.html files with certain unusual Unix
permission bit settings (XBitHack), and there are people who run the
server configured to treat *all* *.html files as (potentially)
containing server-side includes.  Deliberate cache-busting (e.g., to
enable collection of better metrics) may not be the intent of these
setups, but they currently have something of that effect...
