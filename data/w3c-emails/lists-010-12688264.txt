I don't recall whether the following issue was resolved on the mailing list:

What protocol version number should an HTTP/1.1-compliant origin server
send for an HTTP/1.0 request?

There seemed to be two camps:
1) Send HTTP/1.0 as the response to HTTP/1.0 requests (and HTTP/1.1 as the
response to HTTP/1.1 requests).

Pro:HTTP/1.0 clients may only understand HTTP/1.0 responses
Con:a client would never be able to determine whether a server
understands HTTP/1.1

2) Send HTTP/1.1 responses always.

Pro:the server advertises its capability
Con:    because the response (headers) must be HTTP/1.0
compatible, the server is "lying" about the kind of
response and may mislead or confuse the client.

My preference is (1).
