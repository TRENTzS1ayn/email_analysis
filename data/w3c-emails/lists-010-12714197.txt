We've been working with implementation #2 (taking care not to use
any 1.1 mechanisms that would cause problems to a 1.0 client when
the request indicates HTTP/1.0), and have not encountered any 
interoperability issues yet.  I've noticed that www.apache.org is running
a preliminary version of Apache v1.2 that returns HTTP/1.1 in its
responses -- Robert, have you folks gotten any complaints from 
any users?

Has anybody else done any "experimentation"?
