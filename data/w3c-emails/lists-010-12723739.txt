Jigsaw uses (2) to; The proxy had some problems (some old NCSA
servers), but nothing really ennoying. My idea was to send the highest
minor number within the match of the major number of the client. If
major number changes, I would probably have to use (1), though
(another story, anyway, since Upgrade would probably be involved too).
