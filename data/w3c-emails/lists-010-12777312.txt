There are very few clients that do this - probably about the same as
the number of servers that can't understand HTTP/1.1 requests.

IMHO, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 are close enough in form that it is quite
possible to craft a HTTP/1.1 response that is completely compatible
with HTTP/1.0. Apache 1.2 (a public beta of which was just released)
follows this approach.
