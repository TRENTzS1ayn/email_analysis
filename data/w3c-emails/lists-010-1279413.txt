The words were in Koen Holtmann's mailing on content negotiation.  I
agree with your point that Host is always required, so that's an error
in Koen's wording.

But it's the intent of the wording I'm trying to get at.  There will be
other places where someone is trying to say, "the host that appears in
absoluteURI, or, if there is no absoluteURI, the host that appears in
the Host request header."  I want to shorten that locution to
"request-host".
