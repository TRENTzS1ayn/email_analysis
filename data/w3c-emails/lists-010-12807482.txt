My understanding was that this *was* resolved to be 1. 

CL-HTTP was patched from 2 to 1 as a result of the discussions, and
subsequent releases have continued to use 1.

The 1.0 proxy was the critical argument.  Read Henrik's list.

I find it somewhat strange that this issue is still floating around and
that some people have switched positions (!).

Anyway, we need a definitive statement or we're going to continue to see lots of
confusion.
