There are servers you don't have to hack. They were written by hackers.
Phttpd, for example, has this nice thing called URL rewriting. Basicaly,
the first thing the server does is checking if the requested URL is
matched by one of rewriting pattern and if so, it changes it according to
rewriting rule. For example, I can have this pair:

/*/xexe/*.html        /cgi-bin/script/%{-}

which will translate http://my.host/~dave/xexe/cacheme.html to
http://my.host/cgi-bin/script/~dave/xexe/cacheme.html
User agent will always see the URL before rewriting and server will invoke
CGI which will receive original URL via PATH_INFO (and PHTTPD_ORIG_URL as
well :) env variable(s). Phttpd is being run on a little more than 100
hosts, so I suppose you won't encounter this often, but I think that
Apache 1.1 can do crippled version of the magick with Action directive.
