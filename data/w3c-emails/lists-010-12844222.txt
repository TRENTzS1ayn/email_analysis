Comments, suggestions to Larry Masinter


================================================================
Please volunteer to take minutes. (We do better when we have
two people taking notes who then combine them.)

  Minutes need to include the topics discussed, considerations
  raised, and any conclusions, but not a blow-by-blow of who said
  what. If you volunteer to take minutes, I can forward you
  the requirements.
