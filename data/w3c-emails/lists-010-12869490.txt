Shel asked:
   For the etymologists among us, does anyone know where this
   term originated?

The winner (as far as this mailing list goes) appears to be Koen Holtman.

I keep complete logs of my incoming mail, and this was the
earliest reference I found:

    From: koen@win.tue.nl (Koen Holtman)
    Message-Id: <199508191558.RAA17041@wswiop05.win.tue.nl>

    A wasteful provider responding to these warnings by generating
    pages with `one-time-urls' or other cache busters would immediately
    show up on the `wastefulness detector' you assume present: a proxy
    administrator could then decide to stop talking to the provider
    altogether.

P.S.: I didn't find another use of the term until your own message
of Fri, 5 Jan 1996 12:56:00.
