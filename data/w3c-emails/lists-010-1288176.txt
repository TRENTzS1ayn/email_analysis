My 2 cents: it soyld be iso-8859-1 that is the default, referring
to previous discussion for that view.

Another suggestion: there should be a quality parameter also with
accept-charset,  a q<1 meaning that the browser may be able to display
in a less readable fashion, for example in mnemonic or 10646 fallback,
or that it need to shift fonts or load a special programme to
dispaly the charset or other impeded things.
