Do you know offhand which proxies currently interpret the
Last-Modified header in a way that would cache CGI/"?" URLs?

The interactive imaging protocol we're currently developing
*should* be cacheable, as the image tiles being sent don't
change, and the initial image view will generally be the same
each time it's requested. It would be nice if we could get
*some* systems to cache something while we work out a better
scheme for making the rest of the tile information cacheable
by proxies.
