I think there are very few existing 1.0 proxies that cache responses without
a Last-Modified header.  Doing would cause problems with a large fraction of
all CGI-based stuff, and this would get noticed very quickly by the cache
maintainer.

I believe the AOL cache does (or did at some point) cache everything for a
few minutes at least, no matter what the headers, but proxies on the `real'
internet generally tend to err on the conservative side.
