Yes, the addition of `(present if...)' seems to be an error in my
wording.  I must be slightly out of sync on the host issue: I thought
that a user agent could omit the Host header when talking to proxies.

I just went through the old 1.1 draft, and there are plenty of other
places where someone is trying to say this.  The current language used
is `the resource identified by the request-URI'.

The root of the problem seems to be that the language `the resource
identified by the request-URI' is inaccurate.  It has always been
inaccurate (the resources identified by http://a.com/index and
http://b.com/index are different, but have the same request-URI in
request messages to origin servers), but this inaccuracy has become
too great to endure in a web where we have vanity hostnames mapping to
the same server.

I do not think that changing

 `the resource identified by the request-URI'

to

 `the resource identified by the request-URI and request-host'

is radical enough.  It has some problems, because sometimes, the
request-host must be ignored.  After a close look at the current 1.1
draft, I have concluded that we can solve the problem by changing all
existing occurrences of

 `the resource identified by the request-URI'

and my new

 `the resource identified by the request-URI and the Host
  request header'

to

 `the resource identified by the request'.

It would also be good to add explicit language about how a request
message identifies a resource to Section 5.1.2.  I have found plenty
of language there on how to make a request message if you have the
full resource URI, but not much about deriving the full resource URI
from an incoming request message.

I would be willing to write language for section 5.1.2, but I think
the Host issue owner is better qualified to do so.
