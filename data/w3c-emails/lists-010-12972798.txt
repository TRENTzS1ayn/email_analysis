Yes.  Consider the above a bad example.  I should have written:

 Accept-Charset: utf-8
 Accept-Features: utf-8-cs="<hebrew>", utf-8-cs="<latin-x>", *

because we are really talking about how the user agent can make its
capabilities known to the server. 

The content-features header is not really useful.  It is only there for
symmetry with Accept-Features.  Even if it is present in a response, it is
not supposed to list all features used by the content, but only the features
that were negotiated on.  You should be able to know which features to use
by looking at the content itself.

Sorry for the confusion,
