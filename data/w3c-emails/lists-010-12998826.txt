You know, you can't register a DNS name until you have a DNS server
that already serves the name. So someone could put up a web server
that does feature negotiation using an unregistered tag just as part
of the registration process, to let those who are reviewing the
registration see just what it is that's being registered.

I wouldn't suggest people run it as their main server on their home
page, but just _somewhere_ that's publicly available. And if you can't
supply URLs, perhaps you could supply just the varying content.

I think the 'mail' context for feature negotiation might be as
multipart/alternative, and inside multipart/alternative,
content-features might make sense.

It might be that we'd want to separate out "features & feature
registration" into one draft outside of the "content negotation"
draft, just in order to support additional applications.

I hope to have a good discussion about features & feature registration
next week at IETF.
