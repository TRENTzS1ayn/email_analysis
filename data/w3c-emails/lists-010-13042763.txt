Oh no, definitely not. Saying you understand UTF-8, or anything else,
means that you can decode and you know which characters you can
render and which not. Just taking arbitrary glyphs for arbitrary
characters, as you would when e.g. renderig EBCDIC with a
ISO-8859-2 font, is absolutely forbidden.
The HTML I18N spec does not exactly specify what you have to
do with charcters you cannot render, but it is clear enough
to say that this should be done in a way that allows the
reader to distinguish between correctly rendered characters
and characters that couldn't be rendered.

It definitely is! Look at RFC 1815 (ignored by everybody) to
see how this can be brought to extremes.
