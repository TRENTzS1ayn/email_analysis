Yes, it will; but the whole point of entity header fields seems to 
be to have essential metainformation available without/before peeking
into the body.

Attempt to define "essential":  Essential metainformation is
metainformation that enables a client to make decisions about what to do
with the content which have to be made (or should be made) before looking
at the content.  Examples for a Web browser: whether to render, or start
a file save dialog, or invoke an external viewer (and which one).

The example given earlier by Larry Masinter, about a browser understanding
HTML 3.5 tables but not the "border" parameter, would not be about
essential information; it is unlikely that a client has different
rendering processes available to choose from, of which one understands 
"border" and the other does not.

Ok but that character (sub-)repertoire would also be useful ("essential"
in many cases) for non-nogotiating clients.  [Of course you may think
there shouldn't be any non-negotiating clients left, but that probably
will take a while.]

That would make Content-Features less useful for carrying additional
information in other protocols, e.g. mail.

I think charset (sub-)repertoire information should be available without
looking at the content.  That may be less of a concern for monolithic
Web browsers prevalent today.  But the protocol shouldn't be restricted
to that paradigm.
