If one were to create a distributed interactive simulation on the Web, 
using Netscape or some other Web browser as an interface, what current methods 
and request headers (GET, POST, etc.) are available for interacting with 
a server?  For example, is it possible to create a SimCity type game 
with an image map as an interface, and clicking different regions of the 
image, representing buildings, countries, or whatever, will send different 
requests to a server, maybe for new images.  Is this possible with current 
HTTP browsers and servers, using HTTP methods and fields?  If not, then is 
Java or some kind of scripting language needed to do this?  Any 
suggestions anyone may have would be appreciated.
