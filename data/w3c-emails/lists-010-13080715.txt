Yes, all characters are acceptable up to the level of acceptability
that the HTML I18N spec requires. Which is not very much.

There is no real need to express subrepertoiries.

The concept of having a different viewer for every "charset" is still
widespread, but rather outdated and doomed. For a network computer
running Java, being able to display all of Unicode/ISO 10646 is
just a must. It might be a pain for older and more expensive
technology to follow, but that's their problem, not ours.
