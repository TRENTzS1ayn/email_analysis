Very well put. The HTML I18N spec does not require to render any
character with an appropriate glyph. It gives even some clues
about what "fail gracefully" might mean or not. Strictly speaking,
if a browser says Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-2, this only means
that it understands how to may these characters to Unicode. It
does not mean that it will be able to render them. It might
have a look at the document, find a lot of e.g. Chinese
numerical character references, and choose a Chinese codepage
instead of the ISO-8859-2 codepage (if it is as old-fashioned
as to need a single codepage for the whole document).
Of course, you are usually safe to assume that ISO-8859-2
can and will indeed be displayed, but the is no absolute
guarantee. The only thing the recipient (browser) should
guarantee is that the reader understands to what extent
the display is a faithful representation of the document.

One big problem advocates of subrepertoire information usually don't
consider in enough detail is how to express all the different
subrepertoires. For a set of N things, there are 2**N subrepertoires.
For Unicode 2.0, N is 38,885. Even if not all of these subrepertoires
are relevant, it is very difficult to design a system that will
allow to designate all useful subrepertoires without either
sending around too much information or having to keep all this
information available (and updated every time a new subrepertoire
is defined) on each client.
