That's all fine and good, but it can't be deployed because it is
a completely incompatible change.  The WG has discussed the issues
involved in changing the authentication syntax and decided that
there was no way to do so in HTTP/1.x.  A far better plan would be
to determine what you need in the abstract and make sure that it is
defined that way for the next *major* version change of HTTP.
