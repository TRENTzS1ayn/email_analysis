Hi,

I was searching through www.metacrawler.com

and was surprised that it reloaded a page without javascript
and that to with different data.

When one preses the search button.. we get a CGI response of the
present status of the search... and when all is done it loads 
a new html file... without any java script.

Infact... I had to struggle to see whether it had javascript 
because the cache always showed me the latest page not the
pre-reload page.

I tried to telnet to port 80 and see what its doing... but it
shuts me out before I send the http request.

Any ideas of how its being done.... BTW OS/2's webexplorer refused
to show me that intermediatory page... I use NETSCAPE other wise to
watch that effect.

I am building a http search server and want help to use this if
http protocol supports this process.
Bye and thanks.
