Based on your comments and those by Albert Lunde, I think the
strongest case is for a change to iso-8859-1.

I will change the draft to say iso-8859-1.  

If anyone disagrees with the change: tell me so in private e-mail
(just say `I do not agree to iso-8859-1', there is no need to supply a
reason).  I will report to the list on the mail I get.  If I get no
comments on this issue in two days, I will do a last call to establish
that we have consensus.

There has been some discussion that just a quality parameter on
accept-charset does not solve all problems, because different MIME
types will be rendered by different helper apps which have different
built-in charset capabilities.  You may be accepting unicode in html
text, but not in postscript text.

But it is clear to me that some people think that a q=.. parameter on
accept-charset would solve at least their problems.  Adding a
q=.. parameter won't introduce any technical problems as far as
content negotiation is concerned, it could even be seen as an obvious
generalization.  One could object to the addition of a q=.. parameter
on the grounds that the HTTP protocol should be kept simple.

Here is what I propose: anyone who wants to have a q= parameter on
accept-charset, sent me private mail saying that you do.  Anyone who
does not want it, send me private mail saying that you do not.  I will
report a count in two days, and will change text depending on the
results.  I then will do a last call to establish that we have
consensus on this issue.
