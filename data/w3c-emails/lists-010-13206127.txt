I don't see how this proposal is completely incompatible. The
challenge is extended, and a new kind of authorization is
expected. Old clients will fail to recognize the new challenge, and so
won't have access. New clients will recognize both.

Old clients will send the old authorization header, which new servers
will either recognize or not.

So what's the breakage?
