IIRC, HTTP is not a MIME compliant protocol.  The spec writers are talking
here about proxies that forward messages to a mail gateway.  (And yeah, a
proxy that has that feature would need to remove Trasnfer-Encoding, since
such a beast will choke any mail software out there.)

Seems to me if you remove the transfer encoding, you would have to add a
Content-Length.  I don't understand why they included that header amongst
those that couldn't be added/modified couldn't be added.  Let's ask them....

Hey HTTP-WG, why can't proxies modify/change Content-Length on no-transform
responses?
