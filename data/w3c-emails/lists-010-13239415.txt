    Hey HTTP-WG, why can't proxies modify/change Content-Length on
    no-transform responses?

I believe this is because the Digest-Authentication people needed
that.  See 
   http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/draft-ietf-http-digest-aa-05.txt
(but you'll have to ask one of them for a definitive answer).
