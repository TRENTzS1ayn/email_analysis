First let me say I'm not concerned with mail gateways, so I don't want to
get too lost thinking about the implications of such. :)

I understand what you are saying in the first paragraph, and it sounds like
what you are saying applies to Transfer-Encoding as well.  Or are we
presuming that whatever the digest-computation algorithms are in the browser
(and the server as well!) they are both intelligent/aware enough to ignore
the Transfer-Encoding headers in their computations?

If we can't make that assumption (it sounds like a tenuous one), then we
should state somewhere in the HTTP/1.1 spec that proxies are *not* allowed
to remove Transform-Encodings on responses/messages that have a no-transform
Cache-Control directive.

Are there any other implications of this?

Now I think some more about it.... Why are we specifying headers at all?
Why aren't they ALL un-modifiable in face of no-transform and the
possibility of a some-headers-digested situation?
