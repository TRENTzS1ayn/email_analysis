I'll ask again: could you demonstrate two equivalent documents that
you might want to use content negotiation to distinguish between,
where accept-charset (as an expression of capability) and
accept-language (as an expression of language) are inadequate to
distinguish between them?

If no one has any realistic examples, perhaps the issue is moot?
