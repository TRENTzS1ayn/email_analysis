The TEXT encoding was US-ASCII in HTTP/1.0 (RFC1945), but it got changed
into ISO-8859-1 for HTTP/1.1 because HTML uses ISO-8859-1.

The basic choice to replace US-ASCII by ISO-8859-1 was made in April.  See
http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1996q2/0062.html .  The idea
was to sync HTTP with the defaults in HTML, we did not have any i18n
considerations in mind.

As for the Warning header: we did not spend days discussing how to
internationalise the warning text field, this was just a micro-decision made
by one of the editors along the way.  Maybe it was not an optimal decision,
but we did not have the time to spend days optimising every micro-decision.

Sounds good, but you should have told us in April/May, when we were
finishing the draft.  Maybe we could use UTF-8 in HTTP/1.2 or HTTP/2.0.
There is always a next version.

If I understand the IETF process correctly, only very serious bugs can be
fixed at this point.

We cannot reverse decisions like the default charset without doing a last
call again, which would delay the draft by many months.  And we don't want
any delay, it is generally thought that 1.1 is dangerously late already.
