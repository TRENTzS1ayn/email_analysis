This was an excellent message, by the way, and raised the issue in a
way that made the alternatives clear. I don't know whether any of the
others in the WG want to (re)visit the topic of changing the charset
default for messages in HTTP/1.1 warnings, and would appreciate WG
members responding directly as to their interest in pursuing this,
based on your analysis.
