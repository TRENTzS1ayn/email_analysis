Since this goes beyond HTTP or the www, I would be interested to know
where (in which forum) you have made that proposal; and whether it is 
more likely to be considered there. :)

This may be more useful for other protocols (MIME for mail, news etc.)
than HTTP and other formats than HTML, because HTML already implies
that all 10646 characters can occur (according to the i18n draft;
numeric character references to all 10646 characters are valid,
independend from the character encoding used for transfer of a
document; as has recently been pointed out).  But text/plain is also
still part of the Web, IMHO...

Having a way to externally identify character repertoire may lead to
faster acceptance of UTF-8 as character encoding, since one can then
use UTF-8 without losing the repertoire information implied by the
currenlt used charsets.
