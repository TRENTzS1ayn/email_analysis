Sequences of bytes, sequences of characters, and sequences of glyphs
are not the same thing. The charset does not, necessarily, map 1:1 to
the font encoding vector. The characters might not even be displayed
visually - they might be spoken for example.

Not necessarily. It identifies a mapping from  (one or more)
bytes to characters. In the particular case of HTML it does not identify
a repertoire at all. It is possible to write a document that contains the
entire character repertoire of 10646, and have it correctly labelled as
US-ASCII - just using numeric character references.
