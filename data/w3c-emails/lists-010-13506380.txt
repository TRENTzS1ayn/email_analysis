It was for the IAB character set report - the one recommending 10646
as the character set for all internet protocols.

I also saw Martin's remark here, and I am not so sure about it.
My main purpose for proposing a repertoire identifier/header
was from an architectural  point of view, to align with the
concept from ISO on character sets. Of cause it complicates matters
with yet another parameter, but it could help in chosing an
appropiate font, and then it is the right concept.

I note that a MIME charset identifies a repertoire, and you could then
use the mime charsets as also parameters here. From a practical
view there are only a limited set of repertoires, (I don't think
the N*N or maybe N! sets are feasible). Included scould also be
the subrepertoires identified in 10646. Repertoires are also a
key concept for transliteration, which are needed especially when
people want to make something out of a text, but does not understand
the script, eg cyrillic, or indic.
