The Montreal IETF took place *after* the end of the last call.

See for instance the thread about the "charset flap" in
><http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1996q2/thread.html>, with
>the end in Q3
><http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1996q3/thread.html> as well
>as another thread "proposed HTTP changes for charset".

Interesting reading.  I was not present in Montreal, and I did not remember
the resulting thread.  I guess I'm not very qualified as a historian of this
issue.

I don't think you can take advantage of the language above.  The magic words
are "that does not represent a change in overall function of the
specification".  Changing the charset defaults _would_ represent a change in
the overall function of the specification.

Ah, but that text only gets consumed by humans _after_ the user agent has
stripped off the yucky bits.  The complete warning header is never seen by
end users, even if it has the 99 code.
