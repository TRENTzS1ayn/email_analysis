US-ASCII is the bottom line for HTTP/1.0.  I told you before that we
introduced ISO-8859-1 in HTTP/1.1.  Different protocols, different defaults.

I don't think we are allowed to do that.  It would be kind of dishonest
anyway.

Look, it all boils down to procedural matters.  HTTP/1.1 is at a procedural
stage where we do not want to change it anymore.  It does not really matter
that the change would be trivial.  Trivial changes which reverse design
choices are not permitted if delays are to be avoided:  only huge bugs may
be fixed.

We may also add notes like "This Warning header is a very bad example of how
to do i18n; please avoid constructs like this in future protocols, and do X
instead", but we cannot change the mechanisms in the spec itself.

See RFC1602.

The stability of the 1.1 document is important at the current stage.  People
are implementing it now, and we don't want these people to tear up code they
have already written because the document changed.  This is why the
procedure does not allow changes.

No, absolutely not.  I'm against it for 1.1 because of procedural issues.
If people want it in 1.2 or 2.0 or NG or whatever, that would be fine with
me.
