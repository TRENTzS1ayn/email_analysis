RFC 2026 (The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3) contains this text
in section 6.2:

   [...] the standards track.  However, deferral of changes to the next
   standards action on the specification will not always be possible or
   desirable; for example, an important typographical error, or a
   technical error that does not represent a change in overall function
   of the specification, may need to be corrected immediately.  In such
   cases, the IESG or RFC Editor may be asked to republish the RFC (with
   a new number) with corrections, and this will not reset the minimum
   time-at-level clock.

IMHO, the following four points in HTTP/1.1 are in error and could (and
should!) be corrected by taking advantage of that language.  Especially
since RFC publication has not yet occurred.

1) The default charset for text entities is ISO 8859-1.

2) All clients can be assumed to support ISO 8859-1.

3) The default charset for the Warning: header is ISO 8859-1.

4) The default language for the Warning: header is English.

The first two are statements of fact that are demonstarbly wrong on today's
Web.  The last two are obstacles to i18n that are not justified by any
technical requirements.  All four should be modified or deleted.

The text in Warning: headers is meant for human consumption, especially in
the case of a 99 warning.
