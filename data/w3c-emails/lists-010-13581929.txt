Math is a different issue. It was in the HTML 3.0 proposal, and some
people I guess are still working at it. It needs its own special
description. The same applies to music of course. Thinking about a
score as a text doesn't make sense in technical terms.
As for APL, there has been ample work to make sure it is covered.
If you know about something that is not covered, please submit
that to Unicode and your national standard body.
