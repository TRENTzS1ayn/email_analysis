Choosing the right font (or in many cases the right fontS)
is a matter that can be highly complex. For some clues to
what issues are involved, please see
ftp://ftp.ifi.unizh.ch/pub/multilingual/FontComposition.ps.Z
A repertoire is not sufficient for these cases, while having
a look at the document itself will help a lot (and will also
help in the simple cases, as has been pointed out before).

I agree that it's not the worst case of 2**N (much smaller than N!,
but bigger than N*N).

How many are there? And how many "charset"s do we have? My guess
is that altogether, there might be around 500. Because repertories
can be combined, you end up with 2**500, which is around 1E150.
As you can see, we get into pretty large numbers rather quickly.
We can start to try to separate useful and less usefull combinations,
but that will be more work than assuring that all of ISO 10646 can
be displayed somehow.

If you move transliteration to the client side, repertories are
much less of an issue. If you are going for "graphic transliteration",
such as replacing u-umlaut by u", they are not needed. For language-
dependent transliteration (using ue in the above case), language
information is needed, but again no repertoiry.
