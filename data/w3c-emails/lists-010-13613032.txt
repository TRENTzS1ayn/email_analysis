    I can't remember exactly why or when the language-tag and charset
    fields were removed.  However, I do remember that we had a
    moderately long discussion of this issue at the Montreal IETF
    meeting; it was NOT removed by an editor's micro-decision.

Actually, I slightly mis-remembered that.  We did have a discussion
of I18N issues at Montreal, but the discussion that led to the
simplification of the Warning header syntax was held at the
(earlier) Los Angeles IETF.
