Oops, seems you are right.  I distincly remember the IESG itself planning to
end the last call before the Montreal IETF, so I don't know where that date
came from.

These various clients are 1.0 clients.  

The definition of the 1.1 default can't be `plain wrong' because some 1.0
clients use other defaults.  We are dealing with a normative statement for
1.1 here, not with a description of best current practice.  Such a normative
statement can only be wrong if it leads to an internal contradiction in the
draft.

>2) (All clients support Latin-1) This is not true,

Same reply as 1).  Note that 1.1 does not _require_ all 1.1 clients to
implement Latin-1, it only requires them to find it acceptable even if they
only partially implement it.

The text is processed when the 99 code is used, and clients are free to
process the text when seeing other codes as well.  So changing the defaults
does have an impact.

One final remark:  I have the feeling this thread is going in circles.  I'll
try to stop sending responses.
