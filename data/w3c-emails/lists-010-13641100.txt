First, thanks for collecting these examples.

Hm, I would not call this `language carrying implied charset meaning'.  If I
were to make a page like the ones above, I would leave out all mention of
requiring support for the appropriate charset too, because of stylistic
reasons.

I guess this is a case of a CGI programmer making something that is good
enough in the usual case instead of 100% optimal.  How many current user
agents send a (reliable) Accept-Charser header anyway?

So I don't interpret your examples as the Accept-Language/Content-language
headers carrying charset meaning.  Which is good, actually, because if they
had carried charset meaning, that would have created a nasty negotiation
problem.
