An equally backwards-compatible way is to define a new header:
Accept-Meta: header1, header2,...
which could go along with GET, HEAD, etc. requests, and ask that the
info corresponding to those headers be returned, but would be a hint not
to include too much more.

HTTP/1.0 and 1.1 servers that didn't understand Accept-Meta would send
all the entity-headers, but others would returns a more manageable
number.
