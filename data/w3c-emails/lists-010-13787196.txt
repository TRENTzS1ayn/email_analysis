Good point ... actually the right wording, I think, would describe 
not the implementation (end-client vs shared proxy) but more like
"on behalf of a single identified user". It should be considered legal
for a proxy to be shared but be 'end-client' under the current wording
as long as the proxy has identified the user and interprets the caching
rules on a per individual user basis just as if the proxy were not
shared. There are some interesting application and economies of scale
possibilities which I wouldn't want precluded by the letter of the 'law'.

I think the intent is that an individual 'human' receive reliable
delivery of information. I believe automated clients are a subset
of what a human might do in a global information space and such 
clients can be modeled as humans. It would be OK for a single
human to use two different UAs against the same cache for example but
the automated client is probably not going to do that.
