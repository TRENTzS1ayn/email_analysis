I agree that we need to resolve this, but I think that we need to think
about the proxy/cache issue as well.  A server which responds with a
1.1 version advertises its capabilities to both the requesting user agent
and any intervening proxies.  Since many of the 1.1 features have substantial
impact on how a proxy can interact with the origin server, I worry that
by limiting the response we will significantly slow the use of those
features.

I believe that the major/minor numbering scheme has been clear for a
long time.  If it breaks a browser or a script to get a protocol message
which advertises a higher minor version, we need to fix the browsers
and scripts, or we will face this problem every time the minor version
gets rev'ved.
