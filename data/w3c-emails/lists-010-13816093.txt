Dave, what about:

# The protocol version in the response MAY be either HTTP/1.1 or
# HTTP/1.0. The headers in the response MUST be consistent with BOTH the
# protocol version of the response AND the protocol version in the
# request.

I don't know why we have to nail this down. "We MAY not always have to
MUST if we can MAY."
