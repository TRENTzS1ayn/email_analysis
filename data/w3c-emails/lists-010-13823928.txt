I agree with Dave that Case 1 is preferable.  AOL's proxies apparently
started giving users errors this week when a new version of Apache was
released, which responded to 1.0 requests with 1.1 responses (Case 2).  
While this instance will likely be fixed next week, it does indicate how an
HTTP/1.0 client can be confused by an HTTP/1.1 response.
