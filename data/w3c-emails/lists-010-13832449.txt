Well, I agree with Ted.  Do #2 and fix the broken clients/proxies.

The logic case #1 follows doesn't seem any different to me than saying
clients should send 1.0 by default when we find a server that gets confused
by something other than 1.0.

And the capabilities of the server to support 1.1 should be important to
others along the request chain, not just the 1.0 client on the end.
