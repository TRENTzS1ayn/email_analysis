The spec is precise in that it says what the version numbers mean. The
spec just doesn't proscribe behavior.

There are not two views on what the version numbers mean. And there
are more than two views on what servers SHOULD do. You supplied two:

> Case 1 (return HTTP/1.0 to HTTP/1.0 request):
> Case 2 (return HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/1.0 request):

I noted, though, that since we don't outlaw Case 1 (a HTTP/1.0 server
may return HTTP/1.0 to a HTTP/1.0 request!), supporting Case 2 is
really supporting MAY rather than MUST.

A server MAY return HTTP/1.0 to a HTTP/1.0 request
Otherwise:
A server MAY return HTTP/1.1 to a HTTP/1.0 request
Otherwise:
A server MAY return HTTP/1.2 to a HTTP/1.0 request
...
ad infinitum
