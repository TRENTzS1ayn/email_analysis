No, it indicates how a company with little concern for standards can dictate
implementations in other products through technological inertia.  There's
nothing in the 1.1 response which should cause problems with the 1.0 proxy or
1.0 client - section 3.1 of both the 1.0 and 1.1 specs promise this, and (as
best this group can tell) 1.1 fulfills this promise.  

If it becomes common acceptance that 1.0 and 1.1 are incompatible, then no one
will ever upgrade to 1.1.  This is exactly the perception this wg labored long
and hard to prevent.

The big question is, what will happen first: will AOL fix their proxies, or
will Apache users "fix" [hack] their servers?  Client service dictates that
we at Organic hack our servers, but the Apache development group has no such
requirements.
