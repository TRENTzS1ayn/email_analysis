And the content of the response MUST be compatible with the request
version when the version is lower than the response version ...
this I suppose is a side effect of TRANSFER-ENCODING: as a header
not allowed by the above rule but is will surely break a 1.0 client
if it is presumed to ignore unknown headers and is sent a content
body with chunked encoding.

I think that the real issue here is we are using a single value to
accomplish two objectives:

   a.  Label the level of the response
   b.  Declare the capabilities of the server


Perhaps the 'bug' fix is to add a way for the server to declare its
capabilities ? And in the status, label the level of the response.
