That is only true if the user has the choice AND the problem is general.
If the user is using a UA built into an environment, then may not have
the ability to plug in a replacement. 

More important, if the user gets breakage visiting a few sites (and most
users will not understand anything more complex than it didn't work and
that happens a lot for many reasons) they will just consider it a 
feature of the web and will have now reason to upgrade.
