This is not the case. AOL implemented this change in the last few weeks, in
response, they say, to "broken" servers issuing HTTP/1.1 responses. It seems
unfortunate to me that they elected to do this without discussion, either with
the authors of the "broken" servers, or with HTTP-WG.

It also seems to me that the spec is not clear on this issue. There is clear
intent in HTTP/1.1, in that the word "major" was added to the version of
the response, but, AFAICS, no clear requirement to respond either 1.0 or 1.1 to
a 1.0 request. Since a requirement of the spec is to be liberal in what is
accepted, it seems to me that the correct interpretation of the spec is that
a 1.1 reponse to a 1.0 request is permitted.

I forget where we are wrt modifications to the spec. It seems to me that a
modification should be made to clarify this point, whichever way it goes.

Cheers,

Ben.
