I agree with Brian here.  Case 2 is the preferable solution.  For a
start it's the only easy way I can see of allowing my (HTTP/1.1
compliant) browser can establish persistent connections with 1.1 proxies
without requiring an extra request just to test it out.  I am not willing
to rely on some of the more obscure methods (such as OPTIONS) not being
implemented in a 1.0 proxy either.

My browser keeps a list of sites recently visited and their HTTP version
precisely so it can avoid confusing them.

I read the message that the AOL proxy has been issuing that blames the
remote site for the failure (in Apache Week).  It would seem that their
proxy does not implement HTTP/1.0 correctly if it does not accept a
response in the same major version (which is all servers have to provide)
