# If Content-length is present for a body-part of a Multipart, does it
# take precedent over a boundary string?  The section 4.4 'Message Length'
# perhaps implies that it does.

It shouldn't. Content-length is optional, and (on many systems)
unreliable.

# Can a 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked' appear in the header of a body-part
# of a Multipart entity? 

I think so.

# If the answer to both these questions is yes, then I would like more
# explicit wording that the rules for messages applies to nested messages
# in Content-types that have nested entities, such as Multipart content-
# type.

Which rules?

# If the answer is no, then I would like to know if we can change your mind.

Not without supplying convincing reasons.

Regards,

Larry
