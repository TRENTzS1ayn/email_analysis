I think you're perhaps missing or forgetting the point. AOL went out
of its way to cause this problem and has admitted that they did it to
try to FORCE http/1.1 servers (whih means Apache 1.2b to them)
to change their behaviour, such actions should not be tolerated.

It is not unreasonable for AOL to go out of their way to undo the change
now that they have been told that they have nothing to fear from http/1.1

At this stage I will use my veto on the Apache list to prevent the
default Apache configuration being compatible with AOL's sabotage.
That would leave us with tens of thousands of Apache 1.2 servers unable
to use http/1.1 features for 8 million AOL users for some time to come.
It is in AOL's best interest that Apache 1.2 identifies itself correctly.
