Despite all of the mail sent on this topic, there won't be any action
on it until someone has written up an alternative and there is the
appearance of consensus on the mailing list that the alternative is
supported as a replacement for the current text.

Internet drafts can be sent to the Internet Drafts editor. I suggest
the document name:

  draft-ietf-http-charset-flap-00.txt

Please be very clear about what it is you propose changing.

Frankly, I don't believe there is anything close to consensus on this
issue and I have yet to see anyone actually change their mind on this
issue, but I don't want to stop you if you think this a good use of
your time.

Larry
