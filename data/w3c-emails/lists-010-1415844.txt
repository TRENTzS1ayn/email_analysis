But a 0.9 client won't ever see the error status code, so what's the point.
(Haven't people pretty much given up on 0.9 doing anything useful in the
future?  There's too many features you can't have when you don't have headers.)

Neither 501 nor 503 are appropriate.  501 indicates the method is bad, 503
indicates the server is overloaded.  Neither one of those codes should be
overloaded to indicate a protocol version rejection.

If they don't understand 1.1, how would they be able to switch protocol
versions?  There's no 1.05 they could be theoretically upgrading to from 1.0.

The appropriate response to a 505 for a 1.0 client is the same as for a 500:
total failure, report the entity body to the user.  Following the logic of
your line of arguement, we should just get rid of all 5xx codes and have one
500 code.
