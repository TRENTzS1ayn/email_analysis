Nope.

I'm fully aware of this, I read the aol-http web page.

Your conclusion, not mine.  I interpret their action as a mistake, not
as an act of war.  You forget that about half the people on this list
(mis?)interpret the version number requirements of HTTP/1.x in the
same way as AOL does.

Sure, but give them some time.  Do not expect a big organization to be
able to correct its mistakes quickly.

I don't think you should go to war with AOL.  I recommend that you
treat AOL's proxies as inferior 1.0 implementations and work around
their breakage in the Apache configuration files.  I'm not asking you
to change the response version number in the default case, and I'm not
asking you to ever omit HTTP/1.1-specific response headers. Just set
things up so that you can ignore AOL's actions.

If you want to send your users to the trenches over this, that is your
choice.  But don't expect me to stand by the side and cheer.  I worked
very hard in the last 1.5 years to allow for the _smooth_ deployment
of HTTP/1.1.

Koen.

PS: I just read Apache Week 46, and it reports that you _are_ going to
work around AOL's breakage.  So did I misunderstand your comments or
is Apache Week wrong?
