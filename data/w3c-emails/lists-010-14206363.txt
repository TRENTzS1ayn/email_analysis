but did any of them set out to deliberately sabotage the work of others
by silently blocking access ?. AOL's mistake was not approaching Apache
or anyone else to discuss their so called "problem". Instead they chose
to take on Apache and force it to play by AOL rules. They've admitted
that much.

People running Apache 1.2 servers didn't have the luxury of giving AOL
time to make good especially when they showed no signs of doing so, quite
the opposite in fact.

The "war" is over before it started. AOL have now surrendered. An AOL
network director has told me that AOL will undo their HTTP/1.1 blockade.

what new ?  :-)

I haven't looked to see what they wrote but it sounds wrong. We had no
intention of changing Apache to workaround AOL's blockade. We did come
up with some optional and unreleased patches which were being considered
for distribution outside of the main source code.
