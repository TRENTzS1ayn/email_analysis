Geez.  Try to look at it from their side.  AOL thought it was
detecting a new type of protocol error, and decided to let their
proxies report it.  At least that is what I read from their response
to you which is quoted on http://www.apache.org/info/aol-http.html .
I would hardly call what they did deliberate sabotage.  Aggressive
diagnostics maybe.  And I wouldn't call their error message silent.

Also, they did respond to your mail about it, didn't they?

I did not say `start to treat as inferior', I said `treat as
inferior'.
