  Agranat Systems, Inc, producer of the EmWeb Embedded Web server, has
  established a free online interoperability test for browser digest
  authentication at:

    http://digest-test.agranat.com/

  This server provides a series of tests of browser authentication,
  both 'basic' and 'digest' schemes, and of authentication to multiple
  realms (a feature poorly supported in most current browsers).

  In the event of a test failure, the server provides detailed traces
  of the messages between browser and server to help browser authors
  see what has occured.
