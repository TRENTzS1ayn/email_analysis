And, as I said before, that is irrelevant.  There is no legislative
power in any IETF specs, even full standards.  RFC 1945 is not a
proposed standard because we wanted HTTP/1.1 to be the proposed standard
for HTTP, and the IETF has no process for recognizing protocol families.
Nevertheless, the IETF did decide, via both the recommendation of this WG
and the IESG, that RFC 1945 does define HTTP/1.0.  Aside from "Obsolete"
or "Updated", the document status is not relevant to its meaning.
