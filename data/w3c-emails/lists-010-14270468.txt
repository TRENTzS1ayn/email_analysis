I don't have access to the document right now, so this is just from
memory.  The document proposes a change to the challenge syntax
(right?) and that is an incompatible change in the sense that some
clients may not even recognize it as a challenge, may puke, may die, etc.
If you change the challenge syntax, you will also need to change the
field-name of the header carrying the challenge.

Since this is the same change discussed in mid-summer 95 (from memory)
and rejected at that time, it is unlikely to succeed now.  At the very
least, it should be accompanied with extensive compatibility tests.
