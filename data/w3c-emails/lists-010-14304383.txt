But that wasn't known when HTTP/1.0 was made. It also isn't known
whether HTTP/1.2 response headers won't contain anything that causes
problems for HTTP/1.1 clients.

I don't follow this logic. Even if HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 would be
completely imcompatible, as long as HTTP/1.1 servers talk HTTP/1.0 to
HTTP/1.0 clients, there won't be a problem.

I think the problem is more fundamental. If we force HTTP/1.0 clients
to accept HTTP/1.1 reponses, they also have to accept HTTP/1.2,
HTTP/1.7, etc responses. That of course means no HTTP/1.x header can
ever contain something which causes problems with HTTP/1.0 clients.
