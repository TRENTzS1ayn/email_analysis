Your conclusion doesn't follow.  An HTTP/1.x server should be aware of the
version number of the client that it is speaking to, and refrain from using
header information or mechanisms that are not "understood" by that client.
A response from an HTTP/1.1 server can be constructed to be acceptable
to an HTTP/1.0 client, and still be a "legal" HTTP/1.1 response.
