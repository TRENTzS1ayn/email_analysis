Pardon my newness,but why should it not be allowed to respond with an HTTP
header *greater* than the request?  From a system log point of view, the
extra information might be nice to know.  If I see that all my users are
connecting to HTTP/1.1 sites, then I might think about upgrading the browsers
that we use (if I had any users, that is)...

And why is the reverse problem not being discussed?
I guess it must be fairly clear what should happen when a 1.1 client sends
a 1.1 header to a 1.0 server, so why not just follow that procedure for this
situation?
