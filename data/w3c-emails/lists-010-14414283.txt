I'm not sure I agree with your intepretation. My take on the above is that

a) The message (request or response) complies with HTTP/1.1

AND

b) An application is not allowed to claim a version number for a message it
sends unless it is at least conditionally compliant with that version of
the protocol.

It seems to me tht you are interpreting the above paragraph as if though it
said:

Applications MUST send the highest version number with which they are at
least conditionally compliant in each message.

The difference is tht I see this paragraph as a protective measure to
prevent applications from claiming to support a version number with which
they are not at least conditionally compliant, not a requirement that
applications advertise the highest version number with which they are
compliant.

Good example.

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come
to come up with a better one.
