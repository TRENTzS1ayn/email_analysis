It most definately says that, but I feel that it says something more...

Which would seem to be bourne out in a later paragraph of section 3.1

  The HTTP version of an application is the highest HTTP version for which
  the application is at least conditionally compliant.

I see your point, and I agree that there is a measure of protectiveness
about it, but I believe that it can and should serve both purposes.  Why
should we throw away a bit of information which may become useful?

Thanks.  I'd just like to point out a sentence I missed.

  Since the
  protocol version indicates the protocol capability of the sender, ...

This indicates to me that the only proper response a 1.1 compilant server
should send back is HTTP/1.1

Blake.

P.S.  I'm reading the mailing list, and it seems to get here before e-mail
      which is sent directly to me, so I would be as happy not to get two
      copies of any given message, if the rest of you don't mind.  :)
