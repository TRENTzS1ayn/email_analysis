But what is being defined here is the protocol version of an application.
Applications and messages are different things.

Yes, but this is a bit ambiguous. I interpret it to mean that a sender
using a protocl version of 1.x claims conditional compliance with HTTP/1.x.
In other words, the version number indicates the capability of the sencder
in the sense that it guarantees a minimum capability on the part of the
sender. You seem to interpret it as meaning tht the sender is asserting tht
1.x is its maximum capability. Both are valid accorcing to the rules of
English grammar. 


For the record, my understanding is that applications should use the
highest version number they understand unless there is some reason they
have to downgrade (e.g., in a proxy situation), so much of this must sound
rather academic. 

My point is simply that the version number in the response indicates the
version number of the response (not the server). As someone else has
pointed out, it is irrelevant whether a 1.1 response would be legal as a
1.0 response, it is still a 1.1 responsed and properly labeled as such.
Servers should not have to try to determine the minimum protocol level for
which their responses are valid.

Sorry, I was being lazy. When I reply, your address shows up on the To: 
line and the list on the Cc: line. To reply to just the list I need to
either cut and paste the address to the To: line or enter it by hand. I'll
do this is in the future. 

Sorry about the multiple typos. I'm using a telnet proxy that can introduce
delays of multiple seconds at unpredictable times.

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come
to come up with a better one.
