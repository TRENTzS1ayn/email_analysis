This is a red herring. Adding 505 will not confuse correct (and probably
most incorrect) existing clients any more than overloading an existing
code into meaninglessness -- they'll display the entity body.

But making a new error code allows new clients to try and be clever
about how they react. (Ditto with getting people to implement to other
500 series correctly.)

I'm for 505. And meaningful status codes that convey information in a
way that allows programmatic response when appropriate, in general.
