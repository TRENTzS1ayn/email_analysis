This is indeed the design goal; if there are any situations which 
violate this constraint in such a way as to return incorrect results 
without signalling an error,  the specification is in error, and must be 
corrected before being advanced.

If there are such cases, then there needs to be some emergency repairs; 
if there are no such cases, the following is always safe, and will always 
use 1.1 when available:

1) clients which support HTTP/1.1 SHOULD  send 1.1 requests

2) servers should echo the lesser of the request version and the 
   supported protocol version.

Otherwise, I call for a coin flip.
