If the client doesn't unterstands some parts of the response, that doesn't
mean, that others (proxies) doesn't understand them.
(Think of expires/max-age interference in the spec. 1.0 proxies shouldn't
cache pre-expired responses while 1.1 proxies can cache them according to the
max-age.)
I my interpretation
1) true
2) completely wrong. Response headers not understood by older (currently 1.0)
clients/proxies will be treated as entity headers and ignored/passed untouched.
The spec is right, we can add some additional clarifications, if the WG thinks
AOL proxy implementors misinterpreted the spec properly - I mean it isn't
enough clear. (For me it is enough clean. Maybe because I read proxy related
parts with more attention and neglected some other parts.)

I think the advertising function of the native server version in resposes will be
liked by the browser implementors: another possible cause to say 'please upgrade
to the latest version' (I mean when the AVERAGE difference between the server and
client version is  higher than some threshold.) and will somewhat promote technical
progress (replacing historycal software versions).
