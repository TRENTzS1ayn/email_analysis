And I don't think anyone is questioning that this behavior is correct.

I'm a little unsure about this one, but I wouldn't object.


Anyway, my only point has been that the document is ambiguous about the
function of the version number in the response. I also have my doubts as to

servers capabilities--and as I've indicated, this was not my reading of the
spec, but I do admit this is one possible interpretation.
