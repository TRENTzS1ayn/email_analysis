The way GNU E-scape is written right now, it will send an HTTP/1.0 request.
If the first line it gets back contains HTTP/1.0, it treats the response
as an HTTP/1.0 response.  Otherwise, it assumes that it's talking to
an HTTP/0.9 server, and retries the request as HTTP/0.9

I will change it to react correctly to HTTP/1.x responses if that's
what is decided is the correct answer.  I haven't even made a prerelease
available to others yet, so there's plenty of time for the decission
to be made.

Sending HTTP/1.1 responses to HTTP/1.0 requests might speed deployment,
because it might hurt interoperation, and it will be nessisary to
upgrade browsers to keep them interoperable.

There's no reason I see that it's nessisary to send HTTP/1.1 headers
in response to HTTP/1.0 requests.
