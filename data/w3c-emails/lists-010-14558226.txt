But that was decided years ago when HTTP/1.0 was first born.
Clients should be testing for "HTTP/1.", not "HTTP/1.0", and until
someday there's a 2.x and it's an issue, retrying as HTTP/0.9.

Clients may be (in fact, are) implementing HTTP/1.1 incrementally,
and thus may support some HTTP/1.1 features, but still be declaring
themselves as HTTP/1.0.  It most certainly is helpful for their
development to receive the HTTP/1.1 headers.  Such clients also may be
sending some of the HTTP/1.1 headers, if they're relevant to the
features they handle, and don't result in things they can't yet handle.
