Then perhaps it's time to be explicit about retiring 0.9.  I find
it useful in my intranet environment but I see no reason this
should burden the Internet.  We could say that "If you use 0.9 in
an Intranet environment, then this environment should be shielded
from the Internet."  I can't believe I'm the only one still using
0.9, but if so, I'll happily withdraw any request to preserve 0.9
and stuff them in a tiny server behind my firewall and drop any
claim about HTTP.  The same thing might apply to anyone who wants
to stay with HTTP/1.0.
