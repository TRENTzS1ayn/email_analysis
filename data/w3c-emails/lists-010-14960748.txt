Just to clarify, the proposals are to standardize a method
to *allow* proxies to report this kind of data.  Nothing in the
proposals *makes* anyone do anything.  Jeff and Paul
were very clear about that from the beginning, and it
keeps the hit-metering draft out of the scary
"big-brother" category.
