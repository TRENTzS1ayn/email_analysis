I'd like to bring up one another (small) point.

Virtually all banner advertising on the web relies on redirects for
click-throughs so that click rates can be measured.  This means that the
redirection to the advertiser's web site will always be an unverifiable
transaction.

So, when a user visits an advertiser's site directly, cookie assignment on
the home/jump page is possible, whereas when the user visits the page via
an advertisement, it will not be possible.

Designers of web sites (at least the large percentage who will advertise on
the web) will have to take into account that cookie assignments on their
home page may fail a large percentage of the time.  If they wish to measure
number of unique visitors to their site, they will get a highly inaccurate
reading since often multiple cookies will be assignied to a single user
before one "sticks".

This is not a major flaw, but it is inelegant, and I just want to make sure
everyone has considered this.

Dwight
