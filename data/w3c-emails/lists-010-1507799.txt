Regarding support for HTTP 0.9, I'd note that another little thing that
keeps it "alive" at a very low level is hacks to interoperate with gopher.

In particular, a gopher server can serve up a link to a text HTML page,
that some WWW clients are able to follow. This has helped some sites do
a gopher/web transition.

But this is hardly a compelling reason to keep 0.9 alive in the long term.
