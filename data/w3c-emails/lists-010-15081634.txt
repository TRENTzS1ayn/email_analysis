 OK, I can understand this; I can certainly see problems with this when using
older proxies like CERN httpd. To ask the question differently, though, what's
current practice? What do existing proxy servers do? If you'd like, e-mail to
mpresler@us.ibm.com, and I'll summarize.

 IBM's proxy product does not support Keep-Alives from HTTP/1.0 clients. Our
content (origin) server does support them.
