Concerning the State Mgmt RFC (2109), my plans are:

- to withdraw draft-ietf-http-state-mgmt-errata-00.txt
- to submit draft-ietf-http-state-mgmt-06.txt

The second is a version of RFC 2109 that incorporates the renaming of
Set-Cookie to Set-Cookie2, details of how to handle Set-Cookie and
Set-Cookie2 compatibly, and some minor editorial changes.  I expect to
submit the I-D (which subsumes the errata I-D) today or tomorrow.
