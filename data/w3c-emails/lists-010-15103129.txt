Right on.. and to clarify a little further when serving to a proxy the
origin server is told whether or not the proxy pledges to return this
information at a later date.. if it doesn't they can cache bust.. the
weakest point of the hit-metering draft IMHO is that it doesn't try
and provide any other methods of determing proxy reliability wrt this
pledge to base the "to cache or to bust" decision on..
