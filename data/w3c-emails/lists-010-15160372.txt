IETF working groups are not limited to wire protocols, and the
close relationship in the past between the User Services Directorate
and the Applications Directorate reflects the idea that the use
of the protocols must be taken into account in their design.  Ultimately
it is up to the Area Directors and the IESG to make a call on whether
a particular requirement belongs in a protocol.  By advancing this
proposal, I believe that they have agreed that the requirement belongs.

It is possible, of course, that had they heard this discussion earlier
that they would have had different opinions, but the ability to
time travel is not yet a requirement to become an Area Director.
