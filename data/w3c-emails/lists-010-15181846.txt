I agree with you that UI should not be dictated by this spec.  Lou Montulli
from Netscape agreed with you too (as I understood his position)  and as a
result we tried to remove such dicta from the spec.  Lou's comments
directly resulted in the wording of section 7.1:

We felt it important to give the user control of their cookie database, but
at Lou's behest we did not try to specify a particular UI for this control. 
Instead, we tried to specify requirements for browser capabilities, while
leaving the UI up to the browser vendor. 

If you are arguing that we should not have tried to specify requirements
for browser capabilities at all, on that point I disagree.
