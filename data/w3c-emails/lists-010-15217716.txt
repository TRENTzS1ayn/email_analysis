Absolutely not.  I refuse to write a first draft business plan for the
other methods that would prevent this from being true, but others have
already provided the general idea.  Your assertion is not supportable.

It seems to have worked for television, radio, and many forms of print
media for quite a while.  Somehow, I have confidence that the Web and its
revenue models will survive this RFC.

Again, I think you underestimate the resourcefulness of the marketing
community (of which I am a part!).  This provision of the RFC is trying to
maintain the privacy protections users have come to expect, and alert them
to collection that occurs above and beyond their expectations. 

[Okay, enough from me on this topic.  Further general discussions of the
one-to-one future seem to be out of the scope of this WG and should
probably be redirected to www-talk, unless there really is consensus that
the draft needs revision.  If so, I would suggest we focus on Dan Jaye's
suggestion and my response.]
