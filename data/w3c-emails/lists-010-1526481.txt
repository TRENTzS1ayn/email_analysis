I don't agree with this: let's suppose I want an audio file, but I can
read only .wav and no .au . Should I get the whole .au file and then notice
that it is unreadable for me? It does not seem sensitive, especially
since there is already a default to get any type (namely, no Accept line
at all)

Is it possible at least to state things in such a way that in 1.2 the 
situation will change (I don't know, maybe adding an Accept-Only
header if people believe that my view is stupid)? After all, we have
already a SHOULD, so it should not be that difficult to promote it to
a MUST in the next version...
