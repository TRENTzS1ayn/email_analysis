[BTW, sorry to turn this into a religious debate, but this is an 
extremely important issue.]

I am not against cookies. I am not against advertising using cookies.
Nothing in the draft makes it difficult to implement either. What I
am against is facilitaing the violation of my privacy. Specifically,
I should not be able to visit site X and be unwittingly tracked
by site Y at the same time, unless I have explicitly chosen to allow 
such. I believe the current draft covers this nicely.

- From what basis do you make this claim? I certainly do not recognize
that. This group is not here to cater to the interests of advertisers
because they whine about not being able to implement privacy-crippling
applications simply and easily. The potential misuse of advertising
data is astronomical in proportion, and I as a user should not be
required to be the guinea pig of the ad agency simply by browsing the
web. If I choose to give such data away, that's _my_ choice. We should
not make life difficult for the privacy-concerned user.

How do you define "a violation of privacy"? I would _absolutely_ include
in that definition any knowledge of my activities without my consent.
Whether the consent be given explicitly or by choosing a policy which
allows my user agent to give consent for me. Now obviously by
visiting a site I am in essence giving consent to _that_ site to
know my IP address. I have not agreed to have some other site obtain
that data.

The idea that tracking cookies doesn't give away information is
wrong. I have an IP address. You have logs of my IP address at various
sites around the web. You can quickly begin to identify patterns
of behavior and tendencies without knowing my name. Usually,
learning more about someone is fairly easy based on IP address.

"Logins" are explicitly consented to by the user. They type their
username, password, or whatever. Their personal information is
given away by choice, not by default.

Your definition of anonymous is lacking.

I have no problem giving my information to some sites. If they require
that information, and I choose not to give it, then I can't get in.
Big deal. Again, my choice.

Not so. They can purchase off-the-shelf ad management systems. They
just can't participate easily in giving their ad data away 
automagically without anyone's knowledge. The ad system has to
actually go and give it away behind everyone's back by sending logs
or whatever. At least then it's clear what is being done.

Then I won't subscribe. The bottom line is it's _my_ choice, not theirs.
