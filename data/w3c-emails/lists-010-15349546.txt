It's not about conspiracies. Just because existing systems do not
promote privacy is no reason to continue them, especially in a medium
which _could_ be very conducive to privacy. I'm not willing to
throw privacy out the window because "it's not out there now". We
should be focused on improving matters not maintaining the status quo.

Great. Some systems sacrifice my privacy, so why not let the rest of
them do it too? I do not oppose advertising. I oppose _facilitating
violating a user's privacy without his/her consent_. Period. If they
choose to allow cookies from anywhere at anytime, so be it, I think
that should be an option in user agents.
