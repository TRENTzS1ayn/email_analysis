Just to be clear about point (4):  the cookie spec does not *prevent*
unverifiable transactions (the kind of transaction DoubleClick uses).
The spec says (4.3.5):

    This restriction prevents a malicious service author from using
    unverifiable transactions to induce a user agent to start or continue a
    session with a server in a different domain.  The starting or
    continuation of such sessions could be contrary to the privacy
    expectations of the user, and could also be a security problem.

    User agents may offer configurable options that allow the user agent, or
    any autonomous programs that the user agent executes, to ignore the
    above rule, so long as these override options default to ``off.''

In other words, unverifiable transactions are allowed, but a user has
to take an active step to enable them.
