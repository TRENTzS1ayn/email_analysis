To quote from the current cookie draft:
      * to determine whether a stateful session is in progress.

      * to control the saving of a cookie on the basis of the cookie's
        Domain attribute.

The average user doesn't know about cookies and frankly they don't want
to know about cookies. However browser implementers are now forced to
put UI in front of them to tell them more than they ever cared to know
about cookies. Since the user doesn't know what a cookie is, they are
going to call up to find out what the heck this cookie stuff is about.
Who pays for that call? The browser implementer. So a wire protocol is
taking away browser implementers right to control the experience users
have with the very program the browser implementer is selling.
