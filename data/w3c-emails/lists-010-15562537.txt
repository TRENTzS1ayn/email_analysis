The IETF is not a social engineering organization and its purpose is not
for users to "forcefully indicate their preferences to UA vendors." I
also wasn't aware that "UA publishers have been left with a great deal
of freedom as to how they present the required information to the user."
was a bad thing. I thought this was a free country where UA vendors are
free to produce the product they want and users are free to use it if
they want.

I suppose I should thank you. At least you have publicly admitted that
you are engaged in nothing more than social engineering. You couldn't
get what you wanted through the market so now you will get it through
the standards process. I am sure all the UA vendors will come out with
ringing endorsement of the cookie standard and will fight each other to
prove just how "privacy sensitive" they are. This will be easy because
the cookie standard is, with noted exceptions, a good thing and believe
it or not David, UA vendors really do care about user privacy. I work
for one of those vendors and I know I care. But I also care about the
IETF and the critical role it has to play in the development of the
Internet. What your end run around the market has accomplished is to
convince vendors that the IETF is a dangerous place to create standards.
After all, vendors want to work with an organization where they are
partners in the standards process, not its target.
