The redirection won't be unverifiable if the script which does the counting
and redirection to the page is on the target site already.

Yes, if the script is on the site which served the banner.  But I don't see
this as a big problem.

Some careful design can work around this: suppress assignment of cookie if
the referer field shows that the user comes from the click-through script.

Note however that higly inaccurare readings are almost guaranteed anyway
because many people disable cookies, or have browsers which do not support
them.
