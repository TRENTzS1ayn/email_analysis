Yes, it's pay per impression as with most other advertising on the web.

Indeed.

The DoubleClick ads represent only part of our overal advertising.

The ads are spread out evenly over the day in 'random' places, so there's
no place I can point you.

:-)  now wouldn't that be nice.

Caching ads is very bad news for people selling ads on a per impression
basis. If a content site has to redirect to an ad network then it will
either have to cache bust everything or waive goodbye to 30-50% of their
revenue OR 30-50% of their ad serving capacity.

I can't see network sites trusting the content sites to report accurate
impression counts, so if the network site does all the accounting then
its the content sites that will lose or cache bust everything. Going
from our content site to the DoubleClick network site we cache bust
everything.
