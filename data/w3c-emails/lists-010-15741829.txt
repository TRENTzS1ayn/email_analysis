  I hadn't realised either that this discussion was taking place in a
particular country or that it was illegal anywhere to produce non-compliant
products.
  Passing information about people between companies without the consent of
the person involved, on the other hand, is subject to legislative control,
in the country I'm discussing this from as in other places. What's the
status of a product sold in such a country which denies the user a means to
prevent a potentially illegal practice, I wonder?
