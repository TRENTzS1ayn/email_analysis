I expected that :)

I agree that an origin server based redirect is a good idea,
and although I cant quickly come up with a case for it which
couldnt acheive the same results by other means, I think
this functionality is worthwhile.  However, from a security
standpoint I think its hard to implement.

The two cases are for different uses.

Yes.

Realm has been used before, but its meaning has been made unclear 
since current definitions of Realm have turned into a text
description rather than a specific identifier.
To call this realm might lead to confusion.

Maybe it is wise to separate proxy originated redirects ( as a means
of load balancing ) from origin redirects.  
Maybe they could share the set-proxy header but use 306 as well as 305.

I think we should leave this to the network designers.

Well, I think set-proxy is clearer, since the header is really
advising an action which is 'set to this proxy' for this resource.

This is a reasonable idea, the list could be given to the client
at the beginning of its session, maybe through the Proxy AutoConfig
methods.
