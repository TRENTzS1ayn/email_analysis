I'm missing a point somewhere ... why do you think there is a greater
security issue with an origin server specifing a proxy redirect than
a proxy doing it? My sense is that the converse is true. Since the
redirect is hop-hop, it seems like the origin server would be at least
as trusted as any proxy in terms of telling a user where to get resources
logically owned by the origin server.
