 A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
 Working Group of the IETF.                                                

       Title     : The User Agent Hint Response Header                     
       Author(s) : D. Morris
       Filename  : draft-ietf-http-uahint-00.txt
       Pages     : 10
       Date      : 03/19/1997

This document proposes a HTTP response header called UA-Hint, which can be 
used by applications (servers) to describe handling hints which will allow 
user agents to more accurately reflect the intent of the web application 
designer for the handling and presentation of the response entity.  The 
UA-Hint header is intended to be an extensible general mechanism by which 
the application can suggest user agent behaviors which alter or extend the 
behaviors specified in HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2068) with the express purpose of 
improving the usability of the resulting application.  Intended 
considerations include enablement of  safe POST and refined handling of the
traditional history buffer.

Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-uahint-00.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.



Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
