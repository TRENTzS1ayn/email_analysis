Well, sports fans, there's a new cookie draft.  Regrettably, the name
is draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-00.  (I had wanted it to be
draft-ietf-http-state-mgmt-06.) I have withdrawn
draft-ietf-http-state-mgmt-errata-00, which the new draft subsumes.

For the record, I know of two planned changes to the draft already:

1) I'll drop the "same port" requirement.  (Cookies can return to any
port on any host to which they could otherwise legitimately be sent.)

2) [10.1.1] When a user agent receives both Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2,
if the Set-Cookie2 has no Max-Age attribute, the user agent *must not*
[change from "may"] honor any Expires in Set-Cookie.
