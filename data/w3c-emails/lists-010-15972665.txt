Folks,

Having had more than our fair share of bozos in the last week or so (including
a kind gentleman who attempted to send *5MB* to *each* of you), I guess that
it is time to send a reminder about how to remove yourself from the http-wg
mailing list.

Send a message to:

  http-wg-request@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com
          ^^^^^^^
          don't omit this!

with a 'Subject' line of:

  unsubscribe

Please do not send a message to me and ask *me* to unsubscribe you, as I have
RSI and doing this manually is a *pain*.  Literally.
