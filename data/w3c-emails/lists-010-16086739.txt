And the UA of choosing what it might interpret.

The last time I looked carefully, there is no requirement in either the
HTML or HTTP specifications that either the server or the UA do anything
with the HTTP-EQUIV or any other meta data value. Perhaps I missed
something so my point is out of date, but I think one must examine the
server/UA pair implementation to learn what is done.
