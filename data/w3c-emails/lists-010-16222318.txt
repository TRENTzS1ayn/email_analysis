I may be wrong, but I believe that e.g. Netscape opens 4 connections
by default. Can it (or any agent that opens multiple conections) 
have persistant connections to multiple servers, and win/win ?

This seemed to me to be a good idea in general, but I'm not so sure
about linking images from places around the world (Blue Ribbon, etc.)
due to network problems giving partly-broken pages. See
http://vancouver-webpages.com/CacheNow/ for promotional material :-)

I think some of these problems may go away if/when URNs are deployed
instead of URLs (for multiply-sourced objects)
