Regarding:

       Title     : Simple Hit-Metering and Usage-Limiting for HTTP         
       Author(s) : J. Mogul, P. Leach
       Filename  : draft-ietf-http-hit-metering-01.txt
       Pages     : 37
       Date      : 03/20/1997

The document still contains several notes labelled "Design question"
or "Design note", and a detailed Revision History (instead of change
bars).  Larry Masinter says that the final draft cannot include
these components, since they would not be appropriate in an RFC.

To this date, I don't think there have been many (or any) comments on
the Design Notes/Design Questions identified in the draft.  Consider
this as your last change to discuss those notes.  If there is no
specific and unresolved discussion of these notes, I will remove them
and generate a new draft by the pre-Memphis I-D submission deadline
(next Wednesday, March 26).

Also note that there have been numerous changes to the document;
I think I managed to cover all of the normative changes in the
Revision History section.  The two most important changes are:

   Added a timeout mechanism, to constrain the time-inaccuracy of
   hit-metering (sections 3.3, 3.5, 5.1, and 5.2).

   Removed the rule that meter request directives apply to all
   subsequent requests on a transport connection.  These directives now
   apply only to one request.  Added an explicit requirement that a
   server must not ask a proxy to do something it did not volunteer to
   do (section 3.3).

Thanks
