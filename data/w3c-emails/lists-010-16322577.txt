Hmm....if you wanted a standard protocol for communication between a
user-agent extension and an external cookie review server, I would say that
should be a separate document. 

I also don't think any RFC will _make_ it happen.  If this spec allows it
to happen and people agree there's a need, it certainly can happen without
further specification.
