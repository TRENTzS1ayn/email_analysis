The issue of cookie sharing and domains is closed in this
working group, UNTIL AND UNLESS there are volunteers who are
willing to work together and submit a counter-proposal as
an Internet Draft. The counter-proposal must explain the
proposal, and, in its Security Considerations section, explain
how the deals with the issue of user privacy.

UNTIL OR UNLESS there is such an internet draft, any further
messages on this topic are out of order. Please stop.

Larry
