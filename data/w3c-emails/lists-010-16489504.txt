I'm confused.  Does the reverse proxy have another hostname?  (I think it
must have one for 301/302 to work.) And if so, how can it be completely
transparent to the users?

Would you ever have two reverse proxies for one site?  If so, and if they
have different hostnames, this would reduce the cache efficiency for
downstream caches.

I agree that we have to be very careful when speccing 305.  Would you like
all your requests to be routed through wwwproxy.doubleclick.com?
