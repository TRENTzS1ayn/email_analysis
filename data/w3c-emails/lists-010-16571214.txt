I mean a way for the proxy to tell the client to go direct...I'm not 
as interested in the origin server telling the client to reconnect 
 directly instead of using a proxy.  Basically this would be for 
environments where the proxy is not straddling a firewall: a proxy 
could selectively cache origin servers, or send a client directly to 
an origin server that for some reason was known to be not cacheable.

Thanks,
Kip

What exactly do you mean?
Do you mean an origin server redirecting a client, which
connected via a proxy, to try again direct?

Or do you mean a proxy telling a client to go direct?
