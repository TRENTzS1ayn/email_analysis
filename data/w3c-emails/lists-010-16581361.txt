Hmm.. That hasnt really been considered as far as I know.
Overall though, I dont see the need for that.

1. If the client is connected to the proxy and has given the request,
   whats the disadvantage of completing the request via the proxy?

2. At that same point, once the proxy has determined that the 
resource isnt cacheable, its already begun receiving the content
from the origin server. (typically, since the client did a GET, not
a HEAD )  Since this is a per resource or per URL thing, it would
end up creating more connections than if the client just completed
with the proxy.  

If the proxy intends to tell the client to go direct for a wide
scope, ie the whole site http://www.foo.com/ then that could be
taken care of by the browser's proxy config.
While this can be tedious for a user to configure their browser,
the Proxy Autoconfig settings can do this.
FYI: Ive heard that Microsoft intends to support the Proxy Autoconfig
as well..
