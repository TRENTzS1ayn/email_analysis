I'm not a language expert, but my personal opinion as a `negotiation expert'
is that internationalisation of comments in headers is not ready for prime
time.  This is a tar pit I'd rather steer clear of.  Maybe it would be nice
to add a note that the comment could be the URL of a page which explains the
cookie in multiple languages.

Specifically, Netscape said that, according to the contacts they had with
multi-hosted sites, the 1 domain level restriction would not be too tight
for the kinds of services these people had in mind.  And privacy expectation
considerations led to us wanting a number as low as possible, so 1 domain it
was.

I don't remember that we had very long discussions about this, we just noted
that Netscape's initial choice was a good one.
