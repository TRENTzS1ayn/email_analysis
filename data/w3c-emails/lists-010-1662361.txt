This field will be returned to its old definition.  In brief, that is

   The URI entity-header field may contain a list of Uniform Resource
   Identifiers (Section 3.2) which are considered equivalent to the
   Request-URI, but which may be mirror locations or location-independent
   names (URN) for the identified resource.

        URI-header  = "URI" ":" 1#( "<" URI ">" )

The details are actually more complex, but I'll get to that asap.
