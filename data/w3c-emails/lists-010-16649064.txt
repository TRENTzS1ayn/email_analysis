Here's my summary and elaboration of the proposal for restricting ports
in cookies.

Set-Cookie2
1) Syntax:
port-attr="Port" [ "=" <"> 1#port-list <"> ]
port-list=decimal-number

Note:  port-attr is, of course, itself optional.

2) Semantics
Reject cookie if there is a port-list and the original connection was
not to a listed port.

Cookie:
1) Syntax:
(Return Port as $Port, with its value as received in Set-Cookie2, if any.)

2) Semantics, based on the Port attribute in Set-Cookie2:
- default (no Port) behavior:  send cookie to any port
- "Port" behavior:  send cookie only to port from which it was received
- "Port=port-list" behavior:  send cookie only to a listed port

Note:  Port rules apply only after the Domain rules make the cookie otherwise
sendable.

Comments?
