Hmm, you lost me here.  How does the cache busting by the content site
affect the counting of ads sent by the ad network site?

Then we have a different opinion.  I can easily see this level of trust
happening.

Anyway, I think that the value of ad rotation and user profiling is vastly
overrated.  Of course, it is in the best interest of ad networks to overrate
the added value of these things: they are currently the ones who get paid
for adding this value.
