This works for me.  

With a little more work the default could be made more secure (i.e. only
send to the port it came from) in the pure `new cookie' case.  But we are
probably stuck with the `send to all ports' default when being compatible
with `old cookies' sent in a Set-Cookie without a Set-Cookie2.  Some
existing sites which continue sessions on secure pages will rely on this
less-secure default, I think.
