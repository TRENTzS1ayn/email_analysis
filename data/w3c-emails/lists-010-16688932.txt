I must be going dense but the section stating "Reject cookie if there is
a port-list and the original connection was not to a listed port."
confuses me. It sounds like something I agree w/but I'm not clear on
what it means.

If a set-cookie2 with a port list comes down and is accepted and then a
second set-cookie2 comes down, which matches the first cookie, but isn't
from the right port, the second set-cookie2 is to be ignored?
