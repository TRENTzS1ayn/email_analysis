If you don't go out of your way to cache-bust, the number of ads
served (redirected) by the content site will be 30-50% larger than
what the network site will receive due to clients/proxies NOT caching
a 302 redirect but caching the network provided ads.

These figures are empirical.... found the hard (expensive) way.

It'd also mean networks giving up far too much control over the system.
That's a tough pill for them to swallow.... assuming of course they
will try to maintain user tracking in the future.

I agree with you there.

I agree there too, the added value should be questioned by the advertisers.
They do however provide a valuable source of income or additional income
for many popular sites. Anyone who has tried selling advertising for
a site will know that it's tough competeing with the big players.. letting
a big network do all the work is great. I just hope that stomping on
their cookies doesn't lead to complicated/expensive alternatives - that's
bad news for everyone - can they afford to ditch user tracking ?
...we'll see.
