I fail to understand the rationale behind what to me is the most complex
section in the whole document.  Why are we requiring UAs to combine 
the two headers?

I think there is no siginificant loss of functionality if this whole
section is dropped along with the forward reference in the previous
section.  Simply require the server to send both with appropriate
attributes. If the UA understands both forms, it MUST send the new form
and it must replace an existing matching form 1 with the new form.

Otherwise the UA doesn't understand both and sends the old form.
