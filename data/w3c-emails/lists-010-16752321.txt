Jonathan, thanks for reviewing the RFC.

The potential loop problem (setting a cookie on the cookie information page
-- which you address in your proposed language) is pretty funny. 

I think this suggestion creates UI weirdness -- the proposal seems to
assume that the client can open a second window for review of the policy
before making an accept/decline decision on the cookie.  That may not be
true for, say, a Pilot Web browser, or other limited-UI browsers.  I don't
think it is a reason to reject the proposal, but I do think it is worth
considering.  I would say we might want to recommend that a comment always
accompany a commenturl, so that a limited-UI agent has options.

I like David's point about language negotiation being handled through the
follow-up request, though.

Hm....what if I want to reference the generic eTRUST cookie policy (if such
a thing were to exist) at the eTRUST site?  Then eTRUST could say, "5
million people examined our cookie policy before accepting a cookie this
month, so privacy is important to them."  (My point being that there is
value to centralized policies, and thus absolute commenturls, be they for
privacy advocates or Better Business Bureaus or whatever.)

How about 
  CommentURL = '<' commenturl '>'

Add: "A server SHOULD send a comment if sending a commentURL, for use by
those browsers unable to display the CommentURL contents."

Okay?

Should be: "A user-agent MAY..."
