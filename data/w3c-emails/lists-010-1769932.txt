Greetings, fellow HTTPers. I just ran across a not-so-heartening chart at
<http://www.interse.com/webtrends/>. Towards the bottom of the page, there
is a chart of the ratio of Netscape 1.X browers in use today to Netscape
2.0. As of March 1, there are still more people running 1.X than 2.0 (58%
to 42%), and the curves are not steepening.

This does not bode well for our assumption that deployed Web clients will
move to HTTP/1.1 soon after we release the final specs...
