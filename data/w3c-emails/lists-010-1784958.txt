It looks like this is a list of charset values used in other RFCs.

I'd also note that nearly all of them are defined by ISO standards.

It seems like a adding pragmatic list of national and/or corporate encodings
in wide use, would be a good thing for interoperability, though
less nice for standardiztion purists.

I'm not sure who has the expertise to tackle this for a wide range
of languages though.

What's involved in the IANA registration now?

It might be better to split this off into other internationalization
document(s) so as to not get bogged down.
