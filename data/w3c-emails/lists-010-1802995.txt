Everything else looks fine, though it may be editorially difficult
to make sensible sentences with just "charset".

Because we can't do it until IANA does it [or at least puts in place
the initial list and procedures for additions].  Can you work on getting
that done via the appropriate channels?

That exists (as per a request on the mailing list long ago) to preserve
backwards compatibility with 1.0 clients.  It is needed because the
old MIME specs prefer explicit naming, which breaks many 1.0 systems.
I don't see what is confusing about it.
