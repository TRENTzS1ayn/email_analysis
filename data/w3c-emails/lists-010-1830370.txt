If we're going to make exceptions, it would be more usual to say that
'Content-Encoding' can only occur once, and that if there are multiple
encodings, they must appear ordered and comma separated in a single
header.

In any case, if HTTP/1.1 is going to support multiple
content-encodings, this must be resolved, else we'll revert to the 1.0
situation and try again in 1.2.

I'll make sure this gets on the issues list.
