I like this definition of the meaning of language tags. It's
more general than that in RFC 1766

:   The language tag always defines a language as spoken (or written) by
:   human beings for communication of information to other human beings.
:   Computer languages are explicitly excluded.

and allows for sign languages for deaf people.

Please add a note to the effect that only "en" and "en-US" are
legal language tags at the time of publication of the document,
and that the other tags are included only to illustrate how
language tags registered in the future may look.

I suppose the second occurence of "be" on the first line should
be removed.
