That would be incorrect -- the 416 response would still require some
message in the response as a fall-back to older clients (or simply
as more information).

What you describe is exactly what 406 is intended to do, so use it.
Rewrite whatever text no longer applies, but do not introduce a new
error code.  There do not exist any implementations that depend on
draft 01's description of 406 (not that it would matter, since the
description is essentially the same even after your changes).
