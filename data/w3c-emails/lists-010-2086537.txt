I agree with Roy.

That said, isn't "require" a little strong? I seem to recall that it was
strongly suggested that a text/plain or test/html document be returned
with all error responses, with info about what went wrong, and (if
appropriate) links to click on, etc, to help the user rectify the
situation. The spec for 406 adds more detail about what should be in the
document when the response is 406.

After all, while it might be rude to not return such information,
nothing much will break if a server didn't. I wouldn't buy such a
server, but that's exactly what forces the implementors to do a better
job.
