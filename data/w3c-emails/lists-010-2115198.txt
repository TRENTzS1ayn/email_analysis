Yes. Note that the language tags discussion in the HTTP document
should not be interpreted to mean that HTTP allows more than RFC 1766
does.  The text is this broad to ensure that HTTP clients will not be
disallowed from using the language tags that a future revision of RFC
1766 may define.

Good idea, I'll try to come up with some text.

Oops, that second `be' should be a `the'.
