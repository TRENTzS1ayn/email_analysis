I hope nobody intends to make such a proposal until after the 1.1 
draft is submitted...

... in any case I think there might be somewhat more of a problem 
with versions than one might think at first glance. Having built a 
server on top of CMS a couple of years ago I don't think that there
is a comprehensive version naming strategy avaliable.

I think that it may be a more profitable approach to look at versioning 
in terms of annotations and link semantics and not in terms of URLs.
After all we may well have an MD5 URN someday [I already have a protocol
for resolving these]. There would be little opportunity to make an
MD5 URN work with versioning...

Anyway, enough said... we can return to this in May.
