As a late follow-on to the discussion about interaction of DNS and
HTTP clients and proxies:

Over the last couple of days, for various reasons, I've thrown
together some code to do DNS lookups which return time-to-live (and
incidentally, don't block the process).  The code at this point is is
*not* industrial strength, viz. the caveats in the README (in
particular, the one about resolver search rules --- if you're at
stuffed.down.quilt.org and you want crazy.quilt.org, with this code,
you have to ask for it by its full name; you can't just ask for
"crazy").

That said, the code does at least pass smoke tests on several
different systems, and so may be of interest to some people here.
It's available in ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/users/rst/dnshack.tar.gz
for the curious.  Comments appreciated, particularly from those who
have been dealing with DNS longer than I have.

If this is too far from official WG business, my apologies, but given
some of the comments about DNS interfaces in the prior discussions on
that topic, I thought it would be of interest.
