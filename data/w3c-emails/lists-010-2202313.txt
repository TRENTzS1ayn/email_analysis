Why?  The syntax for HTTP URLs hasn't changed between 1.0 and 1.1,
so there's no dependence on the version of HTTP.

I don't expect to document semantics of version names.
As long as there are no colons in the version name, then my
proposal should manage.  Even then, escaping colons, or using
&#xx; would work.  We already have a prototype working as a
server extension for the Netscape and MS servers.

Annotations and link semantics might also be appropriate.  After
talking to Ari about how to present the idea, in light of his
experience with the byte-range proposal, I figured that URLs are
a good start, because the have the advantaqge that the users can
enter them directly to fetch a particular revision.
