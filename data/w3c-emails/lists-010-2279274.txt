I'm embarrassed; the previous message had entirely relative URL's
to the documents.  If you didn't happen to know that previous versions
were available from the Issues page, you'd be mystified.  This message
fixes this.

We will announce on the mailing list when the real internet draft is sent
to the Internet drafts editor.

With some luck, this will be by Monday.  (it won't be before the weekend,
unfortunately).

In the meanwhile...

The draft here is now substantially complete, though some sections
are still being edited.  Areas outside of caching are not
expected to significantly changed between now and then.
Persistent connections and content negotiation are in
this draft. The caching section is now complete in critical
areas, and has been updated but there are still some slushy 
and fluid sections (marked as such in the draft).  I've not
had time to sanity check after major editing in the caching
parts of the draft last night.
Remaining questions are in bold face.

Note that renumbering of sections is substantially similar to previous
drafts, to make it easier for you to find things.
You can inspect the work in progress,

o and <A href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/Issues/Revs/Rev36Clean.ps.gz">

can be looked at. The Word version is most useful; you'll find annotations to
indicate why edits were made (or can work from an issue back to
the changes); if Word isn't available to you, you'll find the
Postscript nearly as useful, with both changebars and strikeouts
and underlines for replacement text.
