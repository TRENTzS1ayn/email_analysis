I'd probably prefer text over "1", whether it was "Connection: close" or
"Connection: no-keepalive" or whatever.

I keep thinking there's something wrong with this that we don't see.  Why
was the persistent connections group bothering with the Persist: <correct
hostname> requirement if it's not an issue here?  Were they ignoring the
leveragable behavior of intermediary proxies downgrading the HTTP version of
the request to the origin server to the proxies highest supported version?
Is that behavior absolutely universal amoung existing proxies?  Am I asking
questions that have already been asked an answered? (probably)
