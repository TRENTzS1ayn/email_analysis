I like it.  I'll change to use your words.

Probably true, but probably unimportant.  Adding words here, I think,
would only distract further.

The point was to reassure vendors (e.g., Netscape) that they're
probably doing what's needed already, and users, that they shouldn't
necessarily expect too much.

No, the port is not part of the FQHN, but it *is* used as a key for
storing cookies.  That is, the client must distinguish cookies that it
receives from servers on different ports of the same host.

Yes.  I changed them.

I guess I need to know what you mean by "save".  If you disable sending
cookies (first bullet), have you achieved what you want?  Or should the
bullet read "sending and saving"?

I believe a cookie from anyhost.sub.tld would indeed by sent to host
sub.tld.

Okay.

Good point.  The numbers come from the original Netscape proposal.  Lou
Montulli felt that application writers needed some certainty about what
a client could save.  I don't have a good defense for 300 specifically.
Lou?

Indeed!  Thanks for being early.
