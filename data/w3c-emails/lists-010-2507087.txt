That is not accurate and was addressed on the list a while back:

   <http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1996q1/0365.html>

That part of the Digest spec is wrong.  The decision of whether or not
that information is passed along is made by the Proxy.  Each proxy
along the line may forward or interpret or rewrite the proxy-AA header fields.
