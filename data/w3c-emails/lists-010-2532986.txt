First I want to point out that this issue has nothing to do with
Digest Authentication per se.  It is a question of the behavior of the
"Proxy-Authenticate" and "Proxy-Authorization" headers as specified in
sections 10.30 and 10.31 of the HTTP/1.1 draft.  Obviously that
specification applies to Basic Authentication, Digest Authentication,
and presumably to any yet to be deised authentication using these
headers.

The current working version of <draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-02.html> says
in section 10.30

   "Unlike WWW-Authenticate, the Proxy-Authenticate header field applies
   only to the current connection and must not be passed on to downstream
   clients."

and in section 10.31

   "Unlike Authorization, the Proxy-Authorization applies only to the
   current connection and must not be passed on to upstream servers."


The Digest Authentication specification is merely reflecting these
sections.
If changes are made to these sections then, of course, the Digest
Authentication specification will be changed to be compatible.
Until that time, I suggest that Roy's assertion that the digest
specification is "wrong" should be interpreted to mean that he
would favor a change in the HTTP/1.1 draft specification sections
quoted above.

On this subject, if a scheme like that described in 

  <http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1996q1/0365.html>

is to be adopted, it needs to be thought out carefully.  For example,
consider a chain of agents like

         A --> B --> C --> D

where C requires authentication from A, and D requires authentication
from B.  I believe that under the current specification for Basic
Authentication, when B receives a Proxy-Authenticate header from C it
would have no way to know if this originated from C and is intended to
be passed on to A or originated from D and is intended for B.
