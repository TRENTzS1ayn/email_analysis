I have modified the digest access authentication document so that it
refers to the HTTP/1.1 specification rather than repeating what is in
that specification.  This is what it should have done in the first
place.

This means that the digest authentication document no longer makes any
reference to proxies passing on Proxy-Auth* headers, but instead
refers to the HTTP/1.1 specification.

A diff showing the changes is attached below.  The old version is first
and the new version follows it.

  2.5 Proxy-Authentication and Proxy-Authorization
  
    The digest authentication scheme may also be used for authenticating
!   users to proxies or proxies to end servers.  Unlike the WWW-
!   Authenticate, and Authorization headers, the proxy versions, Proxy-
!   Authenticate and Proxy-Authorization, apply only to the current
!   connection and must not be passed upstream or downstream.  The
!   transactions for proxy authentication are very similar to those
!   already described.  Upon receiving a request which requires
!   authentication, the proxy/server must issue the "HTTP/1.1 401
    Unauthorized" header followed by a "Proxy-Authenticate" header of the
    form
