There seems to be an assumption that the full client implemenation would
reside in the PDA rather than being split between the PDA and a larger
PDAserversystem.  The comments I've read about the Oracle InternetBox
proposal as well as two pre-InternetBox projects I consulted on briefly 
lead me to believe that resource constrained PDAs etc. will not stand
alone. Hence, I don't think 300 cookies is really a problem.
