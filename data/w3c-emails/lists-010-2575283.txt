Hang on, if I buy a PDA claiming to give me access to the Web I want
it to talk standard protocols, not some proprietary protocol that locks
me in to one vendor.

I think that we should consider the HTTP based PDA in  our designs rather than 
assume that they will use non standard protocols and create a self fullfilling 
prophecy.

I don't see any reason why a person should really need so many cookies and I 
havent seen an actual justification apart from reference to people in the bowels 
of Netscape who apparently have opinions. 

I think that this is arguing for a "should" figure for the number of cookies 
rather than a "must". Since there is no requirement for the user to turn the 
cookies feature on there can be no logic in requiring that hardware must be 
capable of supporting a certain number of cookies.

We shoulkd also be carefull of suggesting enhancements because they only cost 
$20 or so. Some PDAs will cost less than than to build in total.
