Disk space is about 1,000 times cheaper than flash ram, and gets cheaper 
the more you buy it. When you can store 1K of date for a million users 
for a hundred dollars or so, it's much better to keep the data on the 
server. 
If the server needs the data for correct operation, they should look 
after it, unless the client volunteers to keep it of its own volition.
