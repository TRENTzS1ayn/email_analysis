Okay, so we should throw out the cookie draft?  I'm not saying your point

I didn't say the server _needed_ the data for correct operation.  What I
said was the user will expect that preferences they set will be saved. 
Allowing a low threshhold for discarding cookies goes against least

user has decided to keep.)
