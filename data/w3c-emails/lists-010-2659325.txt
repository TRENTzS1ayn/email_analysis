But this is totally an implmentation issue.  If someone sells a PDA that
only stores 3 cookies, they're going to get burned in the market.  There's
no need for protocol designers to tell PDA vendors how to build their systems.

But, assuming we're going to mention it anyway, I think a SHOULD is more
appropriate that a MUST.
