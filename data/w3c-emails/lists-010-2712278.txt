I was considering whether there would be any problems implementing what we
needed with proxy authentication in a future version, if the current 
restrictions are passed. We could authentication the user (agent) to any
proxy in line before a restricted proxy, but not after, because any
restricted proxies would throw out proxy-authenticate and proxy-authorization
headers it didn't understand. While that would work fine for services on
the user side of, say, a firewall, it would not work for services on the
service side of a firewall, which we also support. So passing the current
restrictions would pose problems that we could not overcome in configurations
involving proxies that support them.

Just who should I be engaging with over this? Roy agrees that the restrictions
are wrong :-), and John is willing to follow the lead of HTTP 1.1 (though he
points out some good concerns), and Jim claims he'll make any changes that
folks agree to.
