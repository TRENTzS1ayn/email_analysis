The latest draft of the cookie spec. is at
http://www.research.att.com/~dmk/cookie.html

The new version incorporates suggestions and corrections by Jeff Mogul,
Ted Hardie, and Koen Holtman, plus some slight rewording concerning
"minimum capabilities" prompted by several people.

You can get versions with change bars from either the I-D (v2.10)
or the previously announced draft (v2.16).

I'll extend the comment period to 2100 GMT, Thursday, April 25.  (Yes,
we're all busy with the HTTP draft.)  I believe we're close to
convergence anyway.
