Hmmm, at some point when we have a high-bandwidth connection
(i.e., not e-mail) I'd like to hear an explanation of how you
can authenticate user agents through non-trusted proxies.
As far as HTTP/1.1 goes, we did not intend to support such a
feature because it would be better done within an extensible security
architecture (i.e., that thing Rohit has been working on).

Proxy-Authenticate and Proxy-Authorization are (or should be) defined 
according to the Netscape Proxy implementation.  The current spec is
lacking the wording that I sent in a couple months ago about how the
proxy should forward the field if the credentials do not apply to it.
One problem is that the realm is not sent with the credentials (only
with the challenge), and thus things can still get messed-up if more
than one proxy is demanding credentials on a single request.

I'll update the 1.1 spec, but anything more than Proxy-Authenticate and
Proxy-Authorization will have to wait until a later protocol version.
