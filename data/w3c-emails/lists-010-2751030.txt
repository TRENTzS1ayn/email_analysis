In the current 02 version of the spec it is not clear (to me) that
the realm is required to be unique across hosts/proxies.  Here is what
the spec says:


            realm          = "realm" "=" realm-value
            realm-value    = quoted-string



      The realm attribute (case-insensitive) is required for all
      authentication schemes which issue a challenge. The realm value (case-
      sensitive), in combination with the canonical root URL of the server
      being accessed, defines the protection space. These realms allow the
      protected resources on a server to be partitioned into a set of
      protection spaces, each with its own authentication scheme and/or
      authorization database. The realm value is a string, generally assigned
      by the origin server, which may have additional semantics specific to
      the authentication scheme.
