Only two comments:


#4.3.5  Sending Cookies in Unverifiable Transactions  Users must have      |
#control over sessions in order to insure privacy.
                                   ^^^^^^

Shouldn't this be `assure'?


#8.2  Cookie Spoofing
#
[...]
#Note that a server at cracker.edu could send a cookie to the client and   |
#subsequently get both of the cookies in the preceding example as well as  |
#its own.

I was confused by this, and after re-reading it twice, I think this is
wrong.  I believe this should be:

 Note that a server called cracker.edu could send a cookie to the
 client without an explicit domain, and subsequently get the second
 cookie in the preceding example as well as its own.
