Well, maybe "ensure".

No.  Actually, the whole passage must be dropped.  I put it in when Ted
Hardie observed the problem as stated.  But we've fixed the problem by
requiring explicit leading dots in Domain=.

If a server at cracker.edu sent a cookie to the client, it would only
get back its own cookie.  It could only set Domain=cracker.edu, which
is also the default Domain.  (Domain=.cracker.edu would not
domain-match the host name (cracker.edu), and the cookie would be
discarded.) Since cookies with domains victim.cracker.edu and
.cracker.edu do not domain-match "cracker.edu", neither cookie in the
example would get send to the bad guy.
