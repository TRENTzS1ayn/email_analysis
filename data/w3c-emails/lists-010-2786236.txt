I believe NULL-Request was added to handle the lingering CRLF following
a POSTed entity body.  It may have an unexpected and unintended
interaction with persistent connections:  because the NULL-Request has
no HTTP-Version and no Connection header, the server is obliged to
close the connection after servicing the NULL-Request.
