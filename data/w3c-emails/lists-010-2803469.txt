Well, Dave, I must say that you have a perverse way of reading specs
that discovers problems I would never even dream of.  ;-)
I've noticed that some implementers manage to derive similar
interpretations, so I'm glad you find them first.

Any thoughts as to what/where words need to be added to prevent this
unfortunate event?
