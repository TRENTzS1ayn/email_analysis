Only if you're right, Roy, about proxies being able to pass proxy 
authentication information on at their own discretion (I still haven't seen
a draft of anything with that wording). Or if you're sure that PEP information
wouldn't be stopped by 1.1 proxies (the headers would be different, so they'd
be ignored and passed on, yes?).

Of course, I vastly prefer Rohit simply solving the problem right now :-).
