Um, thanks, I guess.  It comes from intense language lawyering for the
ANSI C spec.

Well, I found it because indeed I was trying to figure out exactly how
to implement null requests and noticed the presumed unintended
side-effect.

Not really.  The NULL-Request idea seems attractive at first glance,
but it makes me nervous that a server should silently eat and discard
an arbitrary number of blank lines (assuming the persistent connection
issue gets side-stepped).  That opens the gate for a malicious client
to mount a denial of service attack by pumping a stream of CRLF's at a
server.  I'm more inclined to deal with it as a special-case hack:

- if there is a POST, and
- if the connection is held open,
- (and if the request is HTTP/1.0?),
the server should look for, and silently discard, a CRLF that follows
the entity body.
