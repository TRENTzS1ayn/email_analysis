I think this is good. This is easier than Jeffs suggestion, which allows
extra LWS in lots of places.

To effect this:
Change the first line of the definition of Full_Request in section 4.1
(Message Types) and section 5 (why are they duplicated?) from
>Full-Request = Request-Line
>to
>Full-Request = *( CRLF ) Request-Line
