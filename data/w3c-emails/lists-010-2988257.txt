I believe this statement.  Now how to write the BNF that
expresses throwing away inital CRLF's?  I'm not good enough at this 
extended BNF used in this spec to trust myself to do it right... 
Could you (or someone else) who is expert do so?  I think we've
converged on the right solution here, if we can write it down correctly.
