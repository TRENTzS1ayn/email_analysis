Paul here encapsulates the nub of the argument. This may be the way we may wish 
to present the problem. It isn't a solution for the server writers.

Server writers need to be aware of the bogus CRLF problem and "cope". This may 
lead to butt-ugly code but sending spurious data was a butt-ugly hack in the 
first place. There are TCP/IP stacks which break unless the server writer codes 
arround this lunacy. 

I think we all agree that we don't like the fact that the iceberg exists. The 
problem is to avoid it holing the ships :-) 



I think Jeff's wording with clients must not do the wrong thing, servers must be 
aware that this is a very common form of garbage is a good one.
