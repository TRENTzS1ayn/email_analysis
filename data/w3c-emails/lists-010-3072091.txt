Having begun this thread, and in the interests of closure, I want to
make a proposal that draws on remarks by Paul Leach and Jeff Mogul.

1) Remove references to NULL-Request.

2) In Sect. 5, where it now says "A NULL-Request MUST be ignored,"
substitute the following:
"In the interest of robustness, HTTP/1.1 servers SHOULD ignore
null request lines (ones that comprise just CRLF)."
