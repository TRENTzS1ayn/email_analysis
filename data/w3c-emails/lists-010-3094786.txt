This is simply untrue.  The two-phase mechanism does not come into play
until AFTER the first request encountered A FAILED CONNECTION WITH RESET.

Also untrue.

Again, not true.  The section uses the term "client" exactly as defined
by the specification.

None of your points apply to the existing text.
