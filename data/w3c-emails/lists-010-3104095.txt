It's clear I wasn't clear about what I meant to say....

I would think that for the *http* specification, particularly for an
origin server, there are the following additional requirements that
are currently unstated:

- absoluteURI must be an http_URL (3.2.2)
- (should https_URL and shttp_URL also be mentioned?)
- host must be the FQDN of the host to which the request is sent
