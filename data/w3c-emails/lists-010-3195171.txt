Probably, but this is not what I would call a stylistically nice
solution.

Let's just say that I managed to mis-interpret 8.4.1 as requiring that
two-phase must always be used if the server is known to be 1.1.  I'm
happy to leave it up to Jim to rewrite the section into something
which does not allow such misinterpretation.
