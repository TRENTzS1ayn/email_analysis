% 
% 1) Remove references to NULL-Request.
% 
% 2) In Sect. 5, where it now says "A NULL-Request MUST be ignored,"
% substitute the following:
% "In the interest of robustness, HTTP/1.1 servers SHOULD ignore
% null request lines (ones that comprise just CRLF)."

I may be wrong, but I think that at the moment there is no 1.1 client
which sends the spurious CRLF. So, couldn't we say

"In the interest of robustness, HTTP/1.1 servers SHOULD ignore
null request lines (ones that comprise just CRLF) from HTTP/1.0 clients"

together with "HTTP/1.1 clients MUST NOT generate a NULL-Request" 

(and maybe say something about proxies which MUST eliminate 
NULL-Requests)??
