Okay, I'll accept your arguments.  However, there is still a piece I feel
is missing:

1) We want clients to send, and servers to accept, an absoluteURI.
2) Eventually we want to obviate the need for Host:.
3) The purpose of absoluteURI and/or Host is to specify the virtual host
for (at least) an http_URL.

The reason I've been trying to restrict the absoluteURI syntax is that
then it becomes easy to identify the virtual host.  I believe somewhere
in the spec. there should be an explanation of how to identify the
virtual host of "the resource identified by the request".
