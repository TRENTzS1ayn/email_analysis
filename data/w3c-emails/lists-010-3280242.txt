I am having a little problem with the proposed computation for the
correction to the received_age. Draft02, p. 87 states:

corrected_initial_age = corrected_received_age + (now - request_time)

If I don't miss something: 'now-request_time' measures the round time
trip between the receiver and the sender, while what we want to
measure is only the time between the sender and the receiver (since
the Age value at the sender is supposed to be updated right before the
sender emits it - see paragraph 5 of the same section).

While I understand that as an approximation, this is on the safe side,
I would like to know if this was intentional (in which case it 's
probably safer to state it in the text). Otherwise, I would suggest
naively dividing the computed RTT by two:

corrected_initial_age = corrected_received_age + (now - request_time)/2

Anselm.
