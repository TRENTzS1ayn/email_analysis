Overkill on my part, leftover from the prior definition.  It would be
better as:

    A TRACE request MUST NOT include an entity.

Yes (combined with the absence of Transfer-Encoding) -- I found a bug
in the spec (Section 7.2) related to that earlier this week.
It is going to take some time to get all the proposed changes
written into something useful for Jim.

No.
