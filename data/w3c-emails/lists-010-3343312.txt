No, we only want servers to accept an absoluteURI.  Clients can't
send it until 2.0.

Not in 1.x.  The stuff added to the third block of text in section 5.1.2
is wrong -- it needs to be removed.

That is only one of many things that absoluteURI is used for in the
specification.  In fact, it is probably the least important of them.

I believe Koen asked for such a section of text to be added to the
section on Requests.  However, that must not change the protocol syntax.

(and it ain't gunna write itself)
