How many times do I have to say this?  YOU DON'T NEED AN RFC TO ADD
AN ENTITY-HEADER FIELD.  There is absolutely, unequivocally, no difference
whatsoever between adding a new parameter and adding a new Entity-Header
field.  That is how I designed the HTTP specification, because it is
always the most efficient way to handle entity metainformation, and the
best way to handle extensibility of the payload.  You don't even have
to register it with IANA (though you may want to).

Crikey. There's about 40 pages of gunk in the new spec which has never
been reviewed by anyone outside the editorial group (and not enough by
them), and we are spending all our time arguing about TRIVIALITIES that
were settled over a year ago!  Hell, I already have 60 marked-up changes
that need to be made, and that's only in the first 40 pages.  We have
more than enough obvious problems to deal with already.
