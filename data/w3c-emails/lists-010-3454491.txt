This may cause the false sense of Content-Location applicable only to 
varying resources, however there are good reasons to use it for simple URIs:

identify the same resource. (Its worth mentioning that internet-drafts have a
lot of URIs on different servers, but that problem will be addressed by
URNs hopely in the near future.)
I guess the official name of the http server is 'src.doc.ic.ac.uk', and clients
(and caches) should use that name, but we cant be sure, unless the server says
that (using Content-Location).
Storing under 12 keys the same resource isn't economic, we need a possibility
to spare that disk space!
For other protocols the 12 variants of the internet host reference is the same,
but for http (since Host:) may have different meaning.
How should a client determine that the server in question deesn't hosts 
virtuals servers?
(Entity header comparison for every URL isn't enough effective,
but works.) Perhaps we should add some header declaring that the server does
host virtual servers?
