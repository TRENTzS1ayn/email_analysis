      14.1 Purpose
      HTTP's greatest strength and its greatest weakness has been its
      simplicity.  Prior to persistent connections, a separate TCP connection
      was established to fetch each URL, increasing the load on HTTP servers,
      and causing congestion on the Internet.   The use of inline images and
      other associated data often requires a client to make multiple requests
      of the same server in a short amount of time.   An excellent analysis of
      these performance problems is available [2]; analysis and results from a
      prototype implementation are in [32, 33].


The last two references should be [33, 34].  I believe that 
reference [2] is also incorrect but I am not certain what it 
should be.  Reference [2] is the gopher protocol.
