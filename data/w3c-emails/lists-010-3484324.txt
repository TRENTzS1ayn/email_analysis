In light of the problem raised by Phill I suggest the following.
We had already decides to try to "dock" the digest auth document with
HTTP/1.0.  I think that a reasonable thing to do now would be to 
separate the digest auth spec into two parts, only one of which would
dock with HTTP/1.1.  Unless I am mistaken the only part parts affected by the
MD5 weakness is the optional "digest" field of the the response header
and the optional "digest" field of the AuthenticationInfo header. 
I think we should "fire the explosive bolts" on this part making it
a separate option extension described in a separate document (and 
emphasing the use of a different algorithm).  Meanwhile the authentication
role of digest, i.e. its use as a replacement for basic would still
be intact and still secure.

Thoughts?
