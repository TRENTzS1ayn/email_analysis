10.22 says:

All Internet-based HTTP/1.1 servers MUST respond with a
      400 status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message which lacks a Host
      header field.

This conflicts with 5.1.2:

                                       If the absoluteURI form is
      used, any Host request-header included with the request MUST be ignored.

I think 5.1.2 has it right, in which case 10.22 should read:

All Internet-based HTTP/1.1 servers MUST respond with a
      400 status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message that lacks both an
      absoluteURI in the request line and a Host header field.
