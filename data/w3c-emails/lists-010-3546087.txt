Actually I was pretty keen on the shared secret being the hash. The idea being 
that the server need not ever know the password itself. This would be secure 
enough for many applications.

The additional hassle probably isn't worthwhile at this stage.

Actually the license terms are merely that you call it RSA-MD5 and tell pe0op,e 
that you use it, and those are only if you use Ron's code.


O.K. so things look pretty much alright provided we put in a note to mention 
that SHA is preferred over MD5.
