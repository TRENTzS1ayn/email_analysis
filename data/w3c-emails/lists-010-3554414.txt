Jim, I think you have made a great deal of progress on this important
task.  Just how important it is has become clear because of the 
difficulties we have had.

I have a few suggestions for your consideration.  Things marked with
'>' a the beginning of a line have not been changed, i.e. the "entity"
definition is unchanged but I would suggest moving it ahead of the other
definitions.  Comments or questions are marked with "###".

resource
-------- 

A network data object or service that can be identified by a URI
(section 7.2). A "resource" is a concept (a little like a Platonic
ideal).  In general a resource may correspond to a single entity or to
many entities.  These entities could exist simultaneously, or
serially, or both.  The resource may include entities which will only
exist in the future.  The defining characteristic that unites these
entities in a resource is the sharing of a common URI.


specific resource
----------------- 

A resource may be of the kind which corresponds to only one possible
octet stream representation.  An example is the text version of an
Internet RFC. That never changes. It will always have the same
checksum.  Such a resource corresponds to only one entity and is
called a specific resource.

### resources are rather rare.  We might want to use specific resource

generic resource
----------------

On the other hand, a resource may be generic in that as a concept it
is well specified but not so specifically specified that it can only
be represented by a single octet stream.  Such a resource corresponds
to multiple entities or potential entities.  Other URIs may or may
not exist which identify a resource more specifically. These other
URIs identify resources too, and there is a relationship of genericity
between the generic and the relatively specific resource.  As an
example, successively specific resources might be

### There are two reasons calling a variant a "specific resource"
### seems problematic to me.  1) Every resource should have a URI, but
### a variant may not (unless I misunderstand) e.g. a resource may
### have a French and English version determined by content
### negotiation.  These are variants, but there need not be a URI for
### just the French version.  2) A variant corresponds to something
### like "the French version" so it can change with time.  It would
### make sense for a variant to be a "serial resource," but not a
### specific resource.

### I don't understand why this term is needed.  Is there such a thing
### as an entity which is not a resource entity?
