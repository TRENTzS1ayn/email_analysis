Well, you are right in the sense that it does not occur in the Oxford
English Dictionary, but it is a very widely used technical term in
mathematics.  It means the property of being generic (which is another
technical term).  I just did a search of Mathematical Revues and found
68 articles with the word "genericity" in the title.

This is off the subject though as your point was well taken.
