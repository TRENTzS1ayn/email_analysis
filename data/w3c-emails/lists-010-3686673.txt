Until a few years ago, "generic" was only an adjective.
Now even my Webster's admits it is sometimes a noun used to identify
non-name-brand over-the-counter medications.
The OOP community has been using the (non-)word "genericity" for years.
Where do you think new words come from anyway?  Somebody has to make them up.
