I don't see a conflict here.  All 1.1 requests must contain a Host
header.   IF the request also contains an absoluteURI, the host
information contained in it will take precedence over the information
supplied in the Host header.

Then you've basically said that all HTTP 1.1 clients must generate only
absoluteURIs in HTTP/1.1 requests, which contradicts the language
in 5.1.2 that states

        To allow for transition to absoluteURIs in all requests in future
versions
        of HTTP, HTTP/1.1 servers MUST accept the absoluteURI form in requests,
        even though HTTP/1.1 clients will not normally generate them.   Versions
        of HTTP after HTTP/1.1 may require absoluteURIs everywhere, after
        HTTP/1.1 or later have become the dominant implementations.
