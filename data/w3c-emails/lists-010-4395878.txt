Ditto with DynaWeb, except that DynaWeb it supports far,
more encodings. As it is, with Japanese, you have to make some
arbitrary decision based soley on things like User-Agent for deciding
what to send to the client, and what the client is sending to you.

I agree with this sentiment 100%. Unless browsers start sending
information to servers, it is impossible to add multilingual
intelligence to them, and have them work all the time.
