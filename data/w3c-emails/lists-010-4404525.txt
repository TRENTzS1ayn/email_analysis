I wrote an nph CGI program which outputs headers in this order:

Date:
Server:
Content-type:
Content-length:
Last-modified:

Neither Netscape proxy 2.0b4 nor CERN httpd 3.0 (acting as proxy) kept
entity body in the cache. Then I looked at server output and rearranged
headers to this order:

Date:
Server:
Last-modified:
Content-type:
Content-length:

And entity body was cached. HTTP 1.0 says this:

   The order in which header fields are received is not significant.
   However, it is "good practice" to send General-Header fields first,
   followed by Request-Header or Response-Header fields prior to the
   Entity-Header fields.
    
Last-modified, content-type & content-length are all entity headers.
Is there a small print somewhere in the spec that requires this behavior?
If there isn't, I think there should be a warning about this in the
specifications. I was checking what they do with Pragma: no-cache directive.
I'd never notice it otherwise.
