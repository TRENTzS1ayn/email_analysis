Reading this over I realized I had failed to insert a necessary logical
step here. The discussion after this point assumed that we were simply
going to live with the fact that under rare circumstances a 1.1 response
was going to be passed to a 1.0 client and break it (presumably through a 
proxy).

Since labelling non-ISO-8859-1 charsets in the Content-Type is *proven* to
break at least some 1.0 browsers, making charset a MUST for non-ISO8859-1
charsets is an incompatible change from 1.0. If this is going to be
inserted into 1.1 - there is no reason at all other than local bias not to
make it a MUST for *ALL* charsets including ISO-8859-1.  Otherwise the
MUST language for non-ISO-8859-1 charsets should be abandoned as being a
political (it doesn't break MY browser) rather than a technical (it
doesn't break ANY browser) statement.

If charset is going to be inserted in a *compatible* way - it will have
to be done via its own header (Charset: ISO-8859-1). I wasn't here for the
debates on that - so if someone knows why that was rejected, please pipe
up with a summary.
