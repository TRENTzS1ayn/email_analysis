Larry informs us that he wants to close the issues of charset and 
language in warning headers (and for content, I assume), because 
there has been enough review by the group.

As for the Warning: header, I haven't seen any discussion.  Have I 
missed anything?  For the record, I did raise the issue at the 
Montreal IETF (although the minutes do not mention it), and at least 
twice on this list.

As for content labelling, it certainly was reviewed, but I am left 
with the impression that the basic issue (is ISO 8859-1 acceptable 
as a default) was not resolved.  Anyway, it was not a relaxed and 
serene discussion, so I am sure glad it is over.

I personnally find it unfortunate that HTTP/1.1 will end up doing 
nothing to fix the current brokenness and will remain artificially 
biased, but it seems there is nothing more I can do about it.  So be 
it !
