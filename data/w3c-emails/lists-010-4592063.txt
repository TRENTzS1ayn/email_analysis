I think this is just an implementation, or rather, a site setup/administration
problem than a protocol defeciency.  How about using a round-robin DNS
to map the hostname to multiple irons, use the power of such multiple
hosts in the cluster to serve nfs mounted files from the same or similar pool.

This will not necessitate redirection with Location: header;  the name
megasoft.com becomes virtual and need not be heavily loaded; the contents
need not be replicated as they are all NFS mounted and hence distributed
in the network (may be high speed because they are all potentially co-located).

May be there are some other issues I am missing in this simpleton approach.
