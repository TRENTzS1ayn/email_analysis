Ummm, that is what the Web is -- a single virtual server which is
physically distributed around the world.  You are just forgetting
that the top level in the HTTP hierarchy is the DNS name resolution
service.  A fully hierachical name service, such as that proposed
by the path scheme, is certainly better -- but getting it to work
efficiently with the existing DNS (or the cost of replicating DNS
in a separate system) is non-trivial.

Sounds like the URN problem all over again.  For example, see

  http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/draft-ietf-uri-roy-urn-urc-00.txt

and note the similarities.  I am not opposed to fixing that problem,
but I don't consider single-site performance to be a concern.

I wouldn't try to solve it in an IETF working group, regardless.
