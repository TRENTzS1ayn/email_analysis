Not really, if you nfs mount the contents across the hosts in the pool.

Just like this, megacorp/root1/... files can be on a disk on one host
and others can mount this filesystem.  megacorp/root2/... can be on a
different host's disks and can be mounted by other hosts including the
first one holding the files for megacorp/root1/...   I hope you get the
picture now.

This, again, can be accomplished very easily by nfs.  The automounter map
can specify the order in which the hosts holding the contents will be
accessed and thus any level of redundancy can be built in.

Having said all these, I should agree with Paul (paulle@microsoft.com)
in what he said in his followup mail.  i.e., The nature of content placement
and distribution (NFS) necessitates the data flow thru multiple network
interfaces which could be avoided by a protocol spec.  It is just like
having a provision in ftp to direct data transfers between a third host and
the initial host, instead of the ones that have control connection setup.

Well, again,  proxie servers take care of most of these situations
for static contents....

s.r.

PS:  I am not sure if this discussion is appropriate for this distribution.
     Larry, pl let me know if it is not and I will shut up.
