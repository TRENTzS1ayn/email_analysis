I agree with this. It isn't a HTTP issue but an implementation issue.  I
can think of a half dozen solutions for the 'mono-server overload' problem
off the top off my head. None of the solutions require changing HTTP -
only local or DNS configurations. In it simplest form, you could just use
redirects to bounce people to the 'nearest' or the 'least loaded' server
automatically (although simple random distribution probably would work
quite well for load balancing - *especially* on the big sites.).
