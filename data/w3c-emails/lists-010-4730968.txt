#!/usr/bin/perl
$_ = $ENV{'PATH_INFO'};
s#^/##o;
print "Location: $_\r\n\r\n";

(Ok - so, I'm depending on the server to add the 302 code. If you want
to, you can add the one line change).

I use this to count hits on links going *out* from our site. It wouldn't
be hard to integrate the functionality into a server for performance.
Anyway - it doesn't require any changes to HTTP.
