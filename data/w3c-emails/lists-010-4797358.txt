I'm not sure. I have been thinking about it some, and have the following
preliminary observations:

1. It could only be used if you knew you were talking to a 1.2
application.

2. A 1.2 proxy talking to a 1.1 or earlier application would have to
convert.

3. Signatures or hashes would have to be computed on the canonical, full
name, form.

I haven't seen any showstoppers yet to using it in 1.2.
