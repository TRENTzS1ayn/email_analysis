Not that I'm recommending this per se, but if a server cared about
this, it could use the Vary header to indicate the result
varies on the Referer request-header, causing any caches to treat the
results independently. 

Of course this would mean a lot more bookkeeping entries in caches, but
implementation-wise, if caches could have unique entries for resources that
were logically different but physically identical (using a digest hash
or something), this wouldn't be that much uglier than some
special case method of keeping track specifically by Referer.
