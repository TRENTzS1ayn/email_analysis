Yes, it does -- changing existing header field names (i.e., short names or
tokenizing) can only be done in HTTP/2.x.  Besides, it doesn't make any
sense to introduce short names now when the GOAL should be a multiplexed
and tokenized grammar for HTTP/2.0, and that can be accomplished in six
months if people don't waste their time on minor tweaks that are equally
incompatible with 1.x.
