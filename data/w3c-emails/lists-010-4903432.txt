rom the Montreal minutes suggestion for a new charter's milestones:

> Aug 1:   (Leach)   draft on sticky headers, short names for headers, and
>       context identifiers

I suggest dropping this as a product of the working group.  Although it
is certainly possible to compress the protocol through two adjacent
communicating parties by the addition of stateful interaction (what is
meant by sticky headers and context identifiers) and tokenizing protocol
elements (a small part of which is covered by short names for headers),
it is not a trivial task and needs to be extremely careful with regard
to proxy-proxy communication with requests from multiple user agents
being interleaved.  This falls into the category of "research" and
should be investigated outside the standards arena.

In other words, I don't think this task can be accomplished within the
lifetime of this WG. Furthermore, even if it were accomplished, our long
term (within a year) plans for HTTP would end up replacing it by the
multiplexing and tokenizing of HTTP/2.x.  Therefore, I think it would be
better to focus within the WG on things that can be done before the
next IETF meeting, and encourage other efforts to focus on the research
work that already needs doing for multiplexing and tokenizing of HTTP/2.x.
