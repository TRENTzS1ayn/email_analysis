In few last messages regarding charsets, I was to notice that many troubles
could be handled via some character remapping mechanism.

How this should work is as follows:

-let's suppose that browser cannot accept document charset, then
document should be translated into charset which is supported
by browser, but lest likely to loose some characters

(Example: with CP-1250 and iso-8859-2 there are only some
  swapped blocks of chars, says Dave, so then there should
  never be a loss in conversion, but we don't need to have
  both, duplicate versions of documents -- one for UN*X
  machines, and one for Wind*ws CEE [and still more for
  other platforms ...]
)

- conversion mechanism is simple transliteration, different codes are
  being assigned for the same characters
