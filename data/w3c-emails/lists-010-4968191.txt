If you're not convinced that you want that large a (virtual) site, OK by
me. But I liked your other reasons for referrals, too:

[Roy said:]
There are good reasons to support a
URI rewriting mechanism on the client side (e.g., to make the URI
syntax truly extensible, support automated mirroring, support URNs,
etc.), but I haven't considered single-site performance to be one
of them.

Administrative flexibility and distributed sites were also mentioned as
other good uses.

More comments below.

It doesn't. It is applying the same principles used by DNS to the part
of the HTTP URL that DNS doesn't own, for the same reasons as DNS uses
them in its part of the URL.

OK. Thanks for pointing it out.

So, would you suggest something like:
Link: Referral <absolute-URI-1>
Link: Referral <absolute-URI-2>
...

And why do you like it better? It seems weird to me, but in the way that
sometimes says to me that it's because my intuition hasn't been trained
properly yet.
