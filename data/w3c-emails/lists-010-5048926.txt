Yes, but the best solution for those problems do not involve changes
to the HTTP protocol -- the URI resolution table is a data format that
can be included in any entity (and thus subjected to things like
digital signatures, expiration times, and all the other things necessary
to avoid spoofing and denial of service).

Yes, but why? Why can't it leave site-dispersal to the DNS part and
the site-specific name resolution to the remainder?  I know why it would
be useful (it was the impetus of the "path" scheme, after all) -- my
question is why is it *necessary* to support a server with a single DNS
name that actually exists on separate sites.  Furthermore, if such a thing
is necessary, why not do it as part of the DNS resolution response
(like an MX record).

er,
        Link: <absolute-URI-1>; rel="mirror"

was more along the lines I was thinking.  It probably won't fit the
exact problem you are solving, but it would be nice if it could.

Because implementation of Link in general is important.  It is the next
big step on the road to salvation (or something).  It is probably the most
important aspect of the HTTP protocol that hasn't been implemented
(correctly, at least).  Why, if I owned a browser that implemented Link
correctly and was at least on a par with other browsers, I'd own the
market within three months.  It would make Java applets look like
yesterday's underwear -- stiff and unwieldy.

Hmmmm, I guess I could use some sleep...
