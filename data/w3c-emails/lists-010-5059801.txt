Oooh, you got the last part right.  Aside from being out of scope
(this issue, what would be in the spec, was settled in February),
the draft isn't even in the WG any more.  The only thing I would
consider removing from it at this point is the Appendix on Additional
HTTP things that are not in the standard, and even then only if
the IESG wants it to be shortened.  It is time to spend our brain cells
on more useful pursuits.
