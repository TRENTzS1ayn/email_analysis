There's some concern in the community that "HTTP-WG will close, what
will happen to HTTP-NG". The standard answer of "Another Working
Group" hasn't been all that reassuring, without there being much
evidence of such.

So, I'd like to strongly suggest that those who are interested in
starting a HTTP-NG working group ("binary format HTTP, without MIME
message headers") get together, create a charter, a list of
milestones, find document editor(s) and a chair and begin NOW to lay
the groundwork for starting HTTP-NG review now, if things are far
enough along.

I'd suggest that the charter of HTTP-NG-WG be narrowed to concern
itself only with the transport issues (tokenization, multiplexing,
etc.)  rather than an open ended list of HTTP enhancements.

Having a draft charter and a WG proposal will remove some of the myths
surrounding HTTP-NG.

I don't recall if there's a public HTTP-NG mailing list; creating one
so that all HTTP-NG discussion can move there (rather than here on
HTTP-WG) would be a good first step.
