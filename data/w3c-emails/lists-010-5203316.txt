Regarding <draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-06.txt>, Ross Patterson mentions:

No, common form is just that -- whatever is common.  Since that is a
time-dependent function, it can't be defined.  If we were to define it
as "today's common form", then it would be no folding, no space between
field-name and ":", and only a single space between the ":" and the
field-value.  However, I think that might lead to more poor implementations
in the future.

Yes, that should be fixed -- it was correct in the changes proposed to the
WG mailing list, but just got fudged in editing (it happens).

Yep.

Yep.

I think it should be removed -- we cannot know if it will help until it
is no longer a draft.

Item [5] should be referenced at the end of first para of section 19.6.2.4.
Item [12] can be removed or include a reference to it in the third para
of section 3.3.1 (where RFC 850 is referenced).

I should also note that item [30] currently has two references munged
together, and that the entire list should be listed alphabetically by
the first author's last name.

Larry, these can all be categorized as editorial changes, but should be
made before the document is frozen into RFC form.
