Using the Alternates header field, which has yet to have a well-defined

No, that would not be valid.

The semantics are different -- "Content-language: en,fr,de" means that
the content of that *response* is intended for people who want to read
English, French, or German (e.g., a document containing three descriptions 
of the same thing in those three languages).  It does not indicate what
other languages are available at that resource.

What you want is Alternates.  What is currently available is

   Vary: Accept-Language

which does indeed give the browser a clue that other languages may be
available (but not an exact clue).
