'referer' is misspelled. It says so in the spec.

Maybe I'm feeling overly grumpy this morning, but folks, this is not
the "general discussion about HTTP without having read the spec" list.
If you have any questions about HTTP, please at least look to see if
your question is answered in the draft document FIRST, and even then,
only post in 'http-wg' if it is something we actually need to consider
for the work items we have before us.

14.37 Referer

The Referer[sic] request-header field allows the client to specify, for
the server's benefit, the address (URI) of the resource from which the
Request-URI was obtained (the "referrer", although the header field is
misspelled.) The Referer request-header allows a server to generate
lists of back-links to resources for interest, logging, optimized
caching, etc. It also allows obsolete or mistyped links to be traced for
maintenance. The Referer field MUST NOT be sent if the Request-URI was
obtained from a source that does not have its own URI, such as input
from the user keyboard.
