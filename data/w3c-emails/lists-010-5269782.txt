I do not believe that HTTP needs any kind of additional method for
advising the site that a URL has changed. If the world needs a
standard like this, I suggest a new media type

      application/webmaster-advice

and that such a media type could be delivered by email to
      webmaster@host


I suggest for the format of application/webmaster-advice:


Dear Webmaster:
My system has discovered the following link on
        one of your pages is incorrect. Please correct it.

Link from page: http://sloppy.host/referring-resource
Invalid-Resource: http://myserver/mybadurl
Valid-Resource: http://myserver/mygoodresource
