Hi Gisle,

Sometime between those drafts.  It was removed because it wasn't being
used much, because it duplicates the purpose of Content-Description
in MIME, and because, like any Entity-Header, it can be used freely
without the need for standardization.

That's okay -- what we do internally is our own business (e.g., my use
of 600 level response codes to indicate client failures).
