Is current practice relevant?  I can cite you hundreds of servers using it.
True this is a tiny fraction of all servers.

I don't think it is fair to call this decision an editorial decision.
If you had decided to change the name to the corresponding MIME header
that could be called editorial.  

As it is, a decision was made that prevents its use in other than
ad hoc ways.  This is a functionality which HTTP used to have and
no longer does.  Don't some search engines use it?

In fact, I would find an argument to make it mandatory persuasive.
