Yes, you're right: this was not an 'editorial' decision. The accepted
procedure was that any feature not explicitly HTTP/1.0 and for which
there was no consensus to add to HTTP/1.1 would be removed from
HTTP/1.1, and it was on those grounds that Title was dropped.

A number of items that appear in appendix D ("Additional Features") of
RFC 1945 (HTTP/1.0) did not make it into 1.1 for similar reasons.

Larry
