I wouldn't really argue that it be mandatory.  I was venting my
pique that it was removed (even from an appendix) without discussion.

I agree with everything you say and I hope that a header with this
functionality can make its way back into HTTP/1.2. 

The Title header (its name is not important) as implemented in the
WN server has many of the aspects you suggest.  It is provided from
meta data stored external to the document which can be set by the
maintainer, but is by default automatically extracted from HTML
documents if not set (this extraction is done once when the meta
data is "compiled" not every time the document is served).

Non HTML documents which have no title set get the filename by default.

I would really like to see not only Title, but also Keywords.  Abstract
would be nice too, but perhaps that could be done with "Link".
