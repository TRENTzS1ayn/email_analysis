 A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
 Working Group of the IETF.                                                

       Title     : Proposed HTTP State Management Mechanism                
       Author(s) : D. Kristol, L. Montulli
       Filename  : draft-ietf-http-state-mgmt-03.txt, .ps
       Pages     : 19
       Date      : 07/19/1996

This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with HTTP 
requests and responses.  It describes two new headers, Cookie and requests 
and responses.  It describes two new headers, Cookie and Set-Cookie, which 
carry state information between participating origin servers and user 
agents.  The method described here differs from Netscape's Cookie proposal,
but it can interoperate with HTTP/1.0 user agents that use Netscape's 
method.  (See the HISTORICAL section.)

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-state-mgmt-03.txt".
 Or 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-state-mgmt-03.ps".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.

For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@ietf.org


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
