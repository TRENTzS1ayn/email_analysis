It's clear from the example later, you meant "Vary:
Accept-Language". And no, there is no requirement that
Content-Language be provided even though the response
includes "Vary: accept-language".

The server must send "Vary: accept-language" if and only if the
response would be different if a different accept-language would be
sent.

"Accept-language not supplied" is a different request from
"Accept-Language: en" if the response says "Vary: accept-language".

No, this is wrong. It's much simpler than this. If there's more than
one language, and the response would be different if you send a
different Accept-language, then the response must say "Vary:
Accept-Language". It's also a good idea to send Content-Language to
identify the language you actually sent, but there's no requirement
that you send it, that the Content-Language actually match (any of
the) Accept-Languages sent, etc.

It is my belief that my responses are the only reasonable
interpretation of what draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-06 actually says.  Do
you disagree?
