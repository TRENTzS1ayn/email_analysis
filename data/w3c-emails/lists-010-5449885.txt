Larry Masinter asked me to summarize the differences between the last
state management draft and this one.  Here goes...

- removed the word "proposed" in various places.
- fixed grammar for av-pair
- clarified that Set-Cookie can accompany any response and Cookie, any
request
- added Comment attribute to Set-Cookie
- reworded section about caching cookies in the face of HTTP/1.0 caches
and HTTP/1.1 caches.

If you want to see the changes marked in context, go to
http://www.research.att.com/~dmk/cookie.html
and find the "With diff marks" entry near the top.
