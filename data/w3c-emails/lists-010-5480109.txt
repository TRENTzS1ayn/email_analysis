I've been reading the draft HTTP/1.1 specification
(draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-06) and have some comments.


Section 3.2.1 General Syntax, page 16

since <segment> is *<pchar>, it can be empty, implying that
"foo/////bar" is a valid <rel_path>.  Is this correct?


Section 3.2.3 URI comparison, page 17

What is the intended behavior of the comparison for two
different host identifiers (names or addresses) which refer to
the same host?  From the spec, one could conclude any of the
following:  (1) this issue was neglected; (2) the comparison
algorithm is spared the effort and expense of doing DNS
accesses; (3) the comparison algorithm is prohibited from
doing DNS accesses.  The comparison algorithm's behavior
toward synonomous host identifiers, and the reason for that
behavior, should be explicitly stated.
