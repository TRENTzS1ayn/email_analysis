No, but it does belong in an implementation guide.  In fact, one
of the big advantages of writing an implementation guide is that
you don't have to restrict the discussion to HTTP, nor do you have
to consider all possible underlying transport mechanisms for HTTP.

The HTTP specification defines HTTP (not DNS, bind, TCP/IP, etc.).
The only times that the draft discusses things outside HTTP is when they
are part of the design rationale of the protocol or security considerations.
Some of those descriptions are more verbose than they would need to be
if there was a separate implementation guide to reference, but they
would still be referenced from the spec.  Other things, like the discussion
of handling broken connections, could be moved to an impementation guide
without affecting the definition of HTTP.  However, it is important to
note that they are only part of the HTTP specification if they appear
inside the specification or some other RFC that updates the specification
(the set of standards-track documents associated with the protocol).
