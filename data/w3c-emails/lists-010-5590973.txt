Hi,

I have made available text and HTML versions of a new transparent
content negotiation draft at:

   http://gewis.win.tue.nl/~koen/conneg/

The new draft contains the first complete specification of HTTP
transparent content negotiation, so this is a good time to read and
review it all.  Also, this is the first draft detailed enough to allow
the building of test implementations.

I am not planning any further big rewrites, my future work on this
draft will mostly be limited to processing comments from the wg.

Please post questions and comments directly to the list.  I am sure
that there are at least some mistakes in the draft...

ABSTRACT

     HTTP/1.1 allows one to put multiple versions of the same
     information under a single URL. Transparent content negotiation
     is a mechanism, layered on top of HTTP/1.1, for automatically
     selecting the best version when the URL is accessed. This enables
     the smooth deployment of new web data formats and markup tags.

     Design goals for transparent content negotiation include low
     overhead on the request message size, downwards compatibility,
     extensibility, enabling the rapid introduction of new areas of
     negotiation, scalability, low cost of minimal support, end user
     control, and good cachability.

Happy reading!

Koen.
