Implementation issue and *IMPOSSIBLE* to enforce. It clearly is not a
protocal item and so is beyond the scope of the workgroup. I can't imagine
a MUST NOT statement like that getting by the IETF. It is like specifying
that newsreaders MUST NOT present Usenet articles unthreaded by default. 
You are treading on the toes of the implementers. While it is certainly *a
good idea* not to do 3 by default - it is not something that can be
written into the protocal as a MUST NOT: SHOULD NOT, perhaps.

You are also running head on into a issue regarding privacy that I have
already shown is long out of the bag. Even *without* any kind of HTTP
level cookie, I can already, to a quite high degree of accuracy, track
individual users.  Even between seperate cooperating sites, without
letting them know I am doing so, if I so desire. Cookies raise no new
privacy concerns in that regard. It is, and has been, a red herring for a
long time.
