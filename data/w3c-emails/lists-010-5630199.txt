The issue here is not one of tracking, but resource control.  If a user is
to create or modify a local persistent resource at the behest of a remote 
server, then the user must have complete control over that process.  If the 
user is expected to spend bandwidth transmitting what a remote server considers
important, then knowledge of the state of that process should not require
gymnastics on the part of the (perhaps non-technical) party that is paying 
for the bandwidth and perhaps the content.  

The changing states of the state mechanism WILL be known to the server and 
available to only the most vigilant users (following the path of least 
resistence, the way Navigator doesn't conform to this specificied proposal 
right now) unless ideal privacy guidelines are specified, with SHOULD or 
perhaps in a separate document, if necessary.
