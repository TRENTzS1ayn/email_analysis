That's hardly true.  Section 7 is entitled PRIVACY; its first subsection,
7.1 is entitled "User Agent Control".

These are enumerated, in slightly different terms, in 7.1.

The thrust of the privacy considerations throughout the document is
to give the user control.  But I have to agree with Benjamin Franz
(<snowhare@netimages.com>) that user agent behavior is outside the
IETF's purview.  IETF can specify protocols, and they/we do that to
ensure interoperation.  I believe user agent behavior can be suggested
(we do), and then we have to rely on public (and, dare I say it,
marketplace) pressure to shine a spotlight on implementations that
pose a risk to users' privacy.
