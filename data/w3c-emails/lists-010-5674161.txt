My company is building an intranet product for the financial industry. Our
financial exchanges requires the product to pass some strict rules which prompted
me to ask the following question:

-How to properly authenticate the user? A user name/password is not enough. If
 we provide a cookie machanism, what stops the user to pass along the cookie
 file to another user?

-What is the best method to limit users to a single login, that is, if a user is
 logged in once to access our service, how to reject a second attempt from 
 another machine? In a proxy world, identifying by the IP/Socket address will 
 not help.
 
Any help will be highly appreciated.
