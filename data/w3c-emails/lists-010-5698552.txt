All of the MUSTs and MUST NOTs in RFC1123 are protocal issues which have
the clear potential to break interoperability if not addressed. Even the
NVT issue is interoperability - not user display.  Failure to display to
the user when a cookie is set will not break the *operability* of the
protocal at any level. Failure to negotiate a minumum terminal type in
telnet would result in option negotiation breaking down fatally -
something that would clearly break interoperability. RFC1123 is *not* an
example of implementation issues coded into the MUSTs and MUST NOTs.

You are going to have to be a lot more specific about which RFC you are
referring to. Context is everything and there are a LOT of RFCs.
