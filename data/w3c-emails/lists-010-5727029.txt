The "QUOTE" command is essential to allow the user to
access servers that require system-specific commands
(e.g., SITE or ALLO), or to invoke new or optional
features that are not implemented by the User-FTP.

Interoperability issue - NOT user interface. It is saying you have to have
a protocal backdoor to handle versioning (it *is* a poor way to do
versioning, however).

Try again.

6.1.4.2 DNS User Interface

Hosts MUST provide an interface to the DNS for all 
application programs running on the host.  
</quote>

Not even a user interface issue. This is nothing more than saying a host
has to have a way to resolve DNS addresses and to report errors *to
programs*. NOTHING about users here.

<quote> 
6.1.4.3 Interface Abbreviation Facilities 

User interfaces MAY provide a method for users to enter abbreviations for
commonly-used names. Although the definition of such methods is outside of
the scope of the DNS specification, certain rules are necessary to insure
that these methods allow access to the entire DNS name space and to
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
prevent excessive use of Internet resources.

Operability again. They are saying if you don't make sure that aliases
can't be confused with actual DNS namespace - it ain't gonna work
reliably.
