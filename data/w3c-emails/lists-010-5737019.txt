The whole concept of cookies is marginal...since a good user-tracking
database can implement all of these things in a secure and robust
manner.

The problem?  "good user-tracking databases" are hard to come by and
"bad HTTP standards" are easy.

Seriously, everyone knows that cookies can be dangerous when implemented
on operating systems/browsers with out decent user authentication.

I would rather propose:

It is recommended that Cookies not be used if your data is sensitive
and/or password controlled.  Use a user tracking system ... and you will
thank yourself in the end.  (SICK)
