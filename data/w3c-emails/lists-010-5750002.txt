Here's my take on the current status and tasks for HTTP-WG. There's a
lot going on, so I'm sure I've missed something. Please correct me if
you see anything.

Previous work:
 - HTTP/1.1:  draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-06.*
   In IESG last call. Some typos and clarifications may happen as a
   result of last call comments. I'm waiting to hear back from Jim
   Gettys and also one of the area directors on process.
   Some messages to WG have not been answered and need to be.

 - digest:   draft-ietf-http-digest-aa-04.txt
   In IESG last call. No comments; we're waiting for IESG action.
   
 - cookies:  draft-ietf-http-state-mgmt-03.*
   Submitted for IESG last call, but last call has not been
   issued. Some comments on "privacy" issues, but comments addressed
   on list.

Related items:
 - SHTTP: draft-ietf-wts-shttp-03.txt
   In IESG Last Call, new version was issued August 1.
   No visible discussion in either WG.

New items:
We have to decide as a group whether HTTP needs each of these; that
evaluation should happen over the next several weeks. It's important
for you to express your opinions.
