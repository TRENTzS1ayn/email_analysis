While the idea is sound, some time ago I did some measure on our
proxy cache: out of ~300 MB of files in the cache, only about 7MB
were duplicates with a different name. I only considered files with
the same size (after stripping metadata), so I might have missed
something, say text files with different end-of-line conventions;
also, this test should really be repeated on a larger data set.
Anyways, I am not very convinced that the saving are worth the
effort of handling multiple headers for the same object (while I
was *before* doing this test).
