I think the ambiguity is also resolved if we change HTTP/1.1 to not
allow pipelining UNTIL the first server response is received accepting
the persistent connection and hence pipelining. That response will
either include the server acceptance of the STICKY more or it won't.
But there will be no ambiguity for the server to interpret.
