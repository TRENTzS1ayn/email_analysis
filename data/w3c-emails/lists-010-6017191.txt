I need data from any content providers on this list!

When you do hit counting:

Do you count HEADs and GETs as hits?

Do you count conditional GETs that return 304 (Not modified) as hits?
(I.e., where the requester already had a copy of the page, and was just
checking to see if it was up-to-date.)

If you are not a content provider, but have information about their
practices, I'd love it if you contributed it as well. (It would be nice
if you indicated it was second hand...)

Thanks!
