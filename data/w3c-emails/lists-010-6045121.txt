It isn't content providers you need to ask - it is the people who write
the log analysis programs. Few people roll their own. I am one of those
people who have written a log analysis package for public use

I count whatever the server writers put in their log: GET, HEAD, POST -

Yes. I also account for them seperately to allow measuring how significant
code 304's are on a particular server. I *don't* count codes 302, 400,
401, 402, 500 or 501, except in seperate categories just for those codes.
