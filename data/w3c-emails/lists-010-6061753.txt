There is an effort underway to define a MIB for http and web servers
in general.  There was a BOF on this at the 35th IETF in LA.  The 
work is summarized on the web at http://http-mib.onramp.net/

Currently the latest draft is http://http-mib.onramp.net/draft_2.my

Most probably this MIB development will become part of the charter of
the Applications MIB Working Group.

    Paul> Do you count HEADs and GETs as hits?

The MIB counts each request type individually (for each virtual server).

It also counts each response type individually (for each virtual server).
