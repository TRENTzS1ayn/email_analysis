(written before I'd seen Koen's one)

http://vancouver-webpages.com/multilingual/select-lang.pl
http://vancouver-webpages.com/cgi-bin/select-lang/multilingual/try.lang
http://vancouver-webpages.com:8070/multilingual/try.lang (maybe)

I left the status of the multiple choice page as 200 (it should be 300),
as it causes strange behaviour with X-Mosaic as well as Lynx (Mosaic-l10n
being the browser I can most easily change Accept-Language on).

I have mostly tested this with LWP4/GET (modified to send Accept-Language,
Pragma, etc.).
