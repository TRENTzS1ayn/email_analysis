You may not know that, but I am pretty sure that when people say `my
server gets 10K hits per day', they mean request messages per day.

Maybe some statistics packages use other definitions of `hits', but I
am sure that cache-busting advertising sites who get payed by the hit
use this definition.  This definition yields the highest count, and
high counts is what they want.  Even an image transfer aborted at 10%
would be a hit; it yields a line in the access log file, after all.
(Which reminds me: you probably have to add something to your draft
about how to count aborted transfers).

Nope. You can collect demographic data fine without cache busting; you
just get less of it.  There will still be plenty of stuff in your
logfile.

Also, you really need to distinguish here between two kinds of
demographic data:

1) Hit counts

2) User's Referer field, IP address, User-Agent field, ...

Your hit counting mechanism can only reduce the cache busting done to
get more of 1), not the cache busting done to get more of 2).  

That is why I focus on by how successful your scheme is at getting
more of 1).  If most advertising sites are actually doing cache
busting to get more of 2), (and they might, I don't know) then your
proposal will not reduce cache busting anyway.

You don't understand my argument: the customers above are the ones who
pay for each the hit.  They are not the ones who do the cache busting:
it is the web advertising sites they pay who do the cache busting.
These advertising sites are sophisticated enough to pick and deploy
the mechanism which gets them the highest hit counts, which is cache
busting until something better comes along.

OK, that is good enough for me.
