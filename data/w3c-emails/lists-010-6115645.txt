In a kind of addendum to what I said in my other reply, I have just
released a free basic log analyser for the Apache cookie_log. This (at
least attempts to) measures the number of unique session accessing pages
on a site. The perl script can be found at
<URL:http://www.netimages.com/~snowhare/utilities/cookies.html>. This
measurement is, of course, completely different than those of traditional
access_log analyzers because it only counts unique sessions and not total
hits. The script is not a full featured analyzer, but a basic overview
tool.
