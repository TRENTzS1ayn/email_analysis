When following discussions on content negociation and similiar issues,
I often reflect as to whether it would be a good idea to allow meta data
to be embedded in the anchor when a document is retrieved so that if a 
link is to a docuemnt is several formats, the user could xxx-click on the
link and get a menu displayed of the available formats.

Most requests must be made by users clicking on a link. Having meta data
available as part of the link could help to negate some of the
complexity of negociation.

My limited use of Gopher+ has shown this to be very useful. You get to
specify your general preferences but still have the option of easily
fetching an alternate representation.
