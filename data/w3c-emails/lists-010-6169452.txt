        No. Our customers are concerned with the relative interest shown by
their audience in their various online resources. The marketing logic that
is being applied currently is not comprehensive enough to weight
conditional vs unconditional, HEAD vs GET etc, in determining where they're
getting their value. TrafficWatch is reconfigurable to allow for the
development of useful principles for evaluating any of the values recorded
in the log. Once the marketing principles for qualifying the various kinds
of Web-mediated impressions are established, the analysis will be able to
produce meaningful data. Until then, the scarcity of non-GET/POST queries
and the lack of a context in which to interpret them statistically renders
that kind of report nothing more than a distraction. However, TrafficWatch
could be used to analyze the logs in order to identify trends in the
appearance of such data.
