this cannot be used in a secure and verifiable fashion....which is
probably why nobody who cares about the integrity of their data uses it.

yes what? an attempt at sarcasm?  the lack of any verifiable content
identification in HTTP is marked.

how would you propose to validate the identity of a document without
knowing the method of identification?
i would reference the rfc on http-digests where the hash-method is...of
course...critical to the process of password-authentication.  this
information is also required for document authentication

in order to perform accurate object identification, a usable
