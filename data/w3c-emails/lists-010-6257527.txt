Uh.. The semantics of an empty Accept-Encoding are mentioned in the 11-06
draft.  And I think the semantics of "Accept:<CRLF>" are both self-evident,
and clearly not the same as a lack of the header.  Certainly the BNF allows
numerous headers to be NULL.

I was presuming (not having read the draft, can I admit that in a discussion
on the draft?) that your intentions were that a sticking client would
indicate turning off individual headers on subsequent requests by sending
the explicit format that was semantically equivalent to the default of those
individual headers.  As in, sending "Accept-Encoding:<CRLF>" since empty and
non-existant have the same meaning, or "Accept: */*" since that has the same
meaning as non-existant.  This would mean that all stick-able headers must
have a explict default-equivalent format (User-Agent:<CRLF> ??), or a that
you need a global way to wipe off all the stickyness (Here's where I propose
the Towel: header.), or, finally, that you have a
"Stuck-Headers-That-Slipped-Off:" header.

  The difference between cats and dogs:
  1) Dogs look at their owners, and say:  "Hmmm . . . they feed me, and
     shelter me, and take care of me . . . THEY MUST BE GOD!!!!!!!!!!"
