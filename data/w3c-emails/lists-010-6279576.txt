I'll put non-numeric values in the next transparent content
negotiation draft.  Your UA-media-* tag family is an excellent example
of why they need to exist.  It is much nicer, and more efficient, to
say

 Accept-Features: UA-media=stationary

than it is to say

 Accept-Features: UA-media-stationary, !UA-media-screen

if you are going to print the response on stationary paper.

Where appropriate, I'll rewrite the examples in my transparent content
negotiation draft to use your feature tags.  I plan to submit an
updated transparent negotiation draft as an internet draft soon.
