You're reading the wrong version. The current draft is
draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-06, and Section 2.2 is explicit about the
character set of request and response headers (most are restricted to
ASCII except those that use TEXT; those can be encoded using RFC 1522
rules), as well as your other questions. ("content-language" describes
the content, while accept-language describes the client's
preferences).
