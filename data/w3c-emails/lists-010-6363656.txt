I agree with the discussion that the http 1.1 spec is getting a bit large.

I would like to see the Transfer Protocol part of HTTP be split out as 
a seperate standard from the HyperText part.

The transfer protocol spec would be about the 'wire' format, 
requests, responses, persistance, chunking.

The HyperText part would be about content negociation, cacheing, 
http-attributes.

The transfer protocol spec would define the headers that are specific to 
it and say that other headers will also be added by the higher levels.

I do beleive in the N layer model of communications protocols.

Pete.
