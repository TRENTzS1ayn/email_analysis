I also believe that HTTP/1.1 can be defined as an N layer protocol,
and that such a definition would be a good way to cope with the size
of 1.1.

However, making such an N layer model is no trivial task, especially
if you are not allowed to make little changes to the protocol along
the way.  I don't think this group has the manpower needed to create
an N-layer definition of 1.1 on short notice.

I hope that HTTP/2.0 will end up having a layered definition, but even
there I have my doubts about manpower requirements.
