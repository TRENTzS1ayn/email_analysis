I thought about that. I agree that they should be evaluated separately,
and can be adopted independently. However, if both are adopted, using
one mechanism (Connection: sticky) to say that you're using both saves
some bytes on the wire. Even if sticky headers are in use, the use of
abbreviations is not required, so a client that only wants to do sticky
is not forced to do extra work. The only drawback I can see is if the
client wants to do abbreviations but not do sticky headers. I don't know
if that is likely.

Unless there is some reason to believe that one will fly and the other
one won't, then I'd personally avoid the overhead of a separate draft.
