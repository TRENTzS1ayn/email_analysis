There are two distinct issues -
- size
- layers (or separable protocols)

I would propose that the HTTP/1.1 spec should be split
more because of the latter than the former.

There are really distinct protocols:

- object exchange (HTTP)

- caching (MIME extensions for caching distributed objects)

- non-protocol HTTP extensions (MIME extensions for HTML)

- protocol extensions for persistence
including extensions for chunking and muxing

We can simply spec a new version, and deal with backward compatibility 
or reduced-function translators until the phaseover is complete.
This is a poor argument for inertia, ever since version numbers have
been included in protocol specs.
