I most certainly did not propose such a thing -- all I did was point
out an alternative indicator for part of Paul's mechanism that could
not have worked, and said it was yucky at that.

The original idea came from Alex Hopmann and was improved upon in
Paul's draft, neither of which involved my support (or even review).

However, I do agree with your conclusions.
