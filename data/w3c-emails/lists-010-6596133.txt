I suggested using "Content-ID" as a globally unique
originator-supplied identifier. You replied in one part that 

"this cannot be used in a secure and verifiable fashion"

which I interpret as implying that you'd somehow like the recipient to
be able to verify that the content actually corresponds to the
identifier, without having to take the word of the supplier of the
content.

But later, you argued for content identifiers to have domains, rather
than global scope. I don't see why anyone would bother providing
something that was both secure and verifiable and didn't have global
uniqueness.

Maybe you meant something else by "the scope of the
content-identifier"?
