just as a datapoint, the cable modem installations in the toronto area
(which are now actual production services, not beta tests) use two-way 
communication over the cable lines.  they're not assymetrical.

my opinion, not that you asked for it:   sticky headers would be pain to
implement, for little real benefit.  if the people involved really care, 
i would suggest someone go ahead and code it up before discussing
it further on this list.
