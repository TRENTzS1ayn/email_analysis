Several of the systems being tested in the U.S. use two-way
communication over cable lines, but are still bandwidth-assymetric.
As I understand it, they use several frequency bands (each band being
equivalent to what would deliver a standard cable channel) in the
downstream portion, but only a part of one in upstream portion.  The
system in Toronto may,of course, be designed very differently.
