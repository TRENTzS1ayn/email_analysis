For any such proposal to be realistic, a number of issues need to
be overcome.  These include:
1) who would do the editorial work (and coordinate a set of
documents).  Doing separate documents is more work than one
document, and I'm certainly not looking for more work to do.
2) are the sections actually separable.  The current document
has many "see section xx.xx" cross references; I'm not sure
such a spit is realistic, though I haven't examined it carefully.
My gut reaction it is that it is not...

The most sensible suggestions to date from where I sit would be to
split along implementation advice and the strict protocol itself, but
I haven't seen anyone volunteer to help do the actual work.  Without
such editorial help, any such proposal to split the document, if it is
deemed desirable, is fated to be just so much hot air and merely
wasting everyone's time, and I'd strongly suggest it be AFTER it is
moved to Proposed...
