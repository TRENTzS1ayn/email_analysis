The Gauntlet (TM) Internet firewall V3.2 has an http proxy/gateway that
does maintain connections between the client and the proxy. But since this
is over Ethernet or faster, sticky headers wouldn't be much of a win. The
proxy does NOT do onward persistant connections yet. 

The proxy is getting a bit big to be a firewall proxy at around 5000 lines
of C. As features are added to HTTP it is going to become harder to 
proxy HTTP with a program that is small enough to trust.

Pete.
