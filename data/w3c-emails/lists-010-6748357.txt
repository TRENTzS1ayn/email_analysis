I calculated the `500 byte scenario' to take such things into account.
Even this scenario showed no impressive improvements.  It would be
good to measure the average request size for today's clients, but I do
not expect large increases compared to a year ago.

>2. It was taken between proxy and server, 

This is because the internet backbone links are the bottleneck, not
the LAN between your proxy and your user agent.  Who cares if you get,
say, 30% savings in web traffic on the LAN?  In this game, it is
backbone savings that count.

I still have my original datasets, and just ran some new statistics on
them.  In proxy<->outside server traffic, 200 responses made up 82% of
all responses, and 304 responses 4%.

And the modem hooked to the ordinary telephone line will probably do
data compression, so you would gain little extra with sticky headers,
I believe.

I agree.  To get something like a firm conclusion, at least one other
study is needed.  My study was done a year ago, with a small sample
(145 Mb of traffic), and by someone who is not a statistician.

However, I think there is enough data to conclude that sticky headers
are *unlikely* to be worth the effort.  I therefore see no reason for
sticky headers to become a WG activity at this point.
