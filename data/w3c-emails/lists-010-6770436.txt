As a server implementer, I feel that one thing is missing from this
dicussion: the (CPU) time to parse headers. Sticky header allows for
reusing parsed header values, and at least in my Java web server, this
account for a non-negligible portion of the CPU time that is used to
handle a request (by optimizing this part of the server I got up to
20% speed improvements). However, I don't know if this applies to C
server as well...

Of course, I beleive that - still in my case - the CPU time to handle
sticky headers would not be greater then the time to parse, say, a
real Accept header.

Anselm.
