Not everyone has a LAN link between user agent and proxy. Some small
number of people dial in to their proxy, which is owned by  their
service provider. Say order 10 million or so, with providers like AOL
and MSN.

Again, I was talking about user-agent to proxy traffic, and the 304s
that would arise when the user-agent had something in its cache that it
needed to revalidate.

In your model, a 200 byte request would be reduced by useing sticky
headers to 40 bytes, and then the 40 bytes would be compressed to (say)
20 bytes (assuming a 2-1 compression ratio). Without sticky headers, and
the same compression ratio, requests would be 100 bytes. The savings
from sticky headers is still the same 80%.

Seems to me that there is enough data to show that it won't help much in
your environment.
In other environments, it's at least not so clear-cut.
