this is just selective cache-busting....the proxy has know way of
knowing if
the document "actually varies" so the entire document gets sent for each
variation.

perhaps the server should send

Cache-Control-Vary

or some such nonsense

BTW:

it would be nice to be able to vary by *.com, *.edu, *.org ... and still
have everything work.
