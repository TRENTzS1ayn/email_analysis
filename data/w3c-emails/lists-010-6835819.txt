    Not everyone has a LAN link between user agent and proxy.

Just to confirm this: we (at Digital's Palo Alto site) run the main
proxy between the corporation (still almost 60K people) and the
Internet.  We have something over 100 Mbits/sec of bandwidth
between our proxy and the Internet, but several orders of magnitude
less bandwidth to most of our internal sites.  In most cases,
the RTTs between the proxy and the users are on the order of
100 msec or more.  We have numerous users, unfortunately, who
have internal connections at 56 kbits/sec and multi-hundred
msec RTTs.  Anything that saves lots of bits over these wires is
Good.
