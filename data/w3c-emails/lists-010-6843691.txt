    this is just selective cache-busting....the proxy has know way of
    knowing if the document "actually varies" so the entire document
    gets sent for each variation.

Wrong.  Please read the proposed HTTP/1.1 specification; it
definitely allows us to avoid sending "the entire document"
"for each variation."
