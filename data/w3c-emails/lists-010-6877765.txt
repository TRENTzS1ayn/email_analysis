"See [document y]" perhaps ?  From the progress I've made so far (sorry 
- a week late already, sigh), this spl?it certainly seems to be more 
practical than the implementation/specification one.  Not surprising 
when you consider its origins ?

One possible advantage of splitting up would be that you could actually 
revise (obsolete? supercede?) individual bits without having to re-do 
the whole damn thing whenever you want to change part of it.  If you 
really are only revising just one aspect (e.g. cache-control features), 
you can have an effort which is focused on the problem, as opposed to a 
free-for-all on what features/changes people would like to see in the 
protocol ?

I suppose this approach has been taken with DNS, SMTP and PPP, to name 
but three.  Successfully ?  Hmm...
