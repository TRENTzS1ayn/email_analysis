That is not my definition of cache busting.  The cache busting done
for demographics reasons will be of the `max-age=0' kind, which allows
conditional GETs, rather than the `no-cache' kind.

I can't see much difference, as far as efficiency is concerned,
between your proposed use of the Vary header and max-age=0 cache
busting.  Both as are inefficient, but at least max-age=0 is
inefficient in a non-complex way.

To do a good job at giving demographers the complete request data
(including client IP address) they seem to want, a completely
different mechanism is needed.  Why don't you specify something that
lets origin servers tell caches to log certain request characteristics
and report them in a future request?  The logging overhead for such a
mechanism seems to be about the same as for your Vary mechanism.
