Dave, Phill,

I believe that the feature negotiation mechanism in transparent
content negotiation solves many of the negotiation and registration
problems you have identified.

Please review the draft spec (see
http://gewis.win.tue.nl/~koen/conneg/) and tell me what you think.

I feel that feature negotiation is fundamentally more powerful than
any user-agent header or version number dependent scheme can be,
because a big limitation to the power of these latter schemes is not
present for feature negotiation.  The limitation in question is the
need to produce a small encoding, to be sent in request messages, for
_all_ capabilities of the user agent and its components, and _all_
preferences of the user.

Transparent content negotiation does away with this limitation, and
feature negotiation exploits the absence of this limitation to the
fullest extent, yielding a framework which allows an open,
evolutionary approach to the problem of creating a shared language in
which to express capabilities and preferences.

Koen.
