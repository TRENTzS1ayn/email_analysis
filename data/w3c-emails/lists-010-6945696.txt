Agreed that these are all related I think we have to get the
concept space right before we try to compress everything into
one unified scheme. One reason why I was skeptical of PEP was
its "all encompassing" nature which never quite appeared to be
grounded.

I think that there is a role for some king of multi-circuit 
exchange protocol. I think that needs to be more general
than simply content type or even feature negotiation. I
am currently looking at assertion exchange based on common
reference terms which are essentially pure URNs except much
of the baggage associate with URNs has to be lost so I'm
using a new name.


I think we need to kick the requirements space arround a bit,
get a feel for the constraints on implementation and then look
at architecture again.
