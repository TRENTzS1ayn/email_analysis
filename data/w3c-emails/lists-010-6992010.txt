Sorry , I sent this message to the wrong group.......

I am in the process of designing an HTTP 1.1 server which  provides
 JPEG Images when a GET method with a certain URL is received, but am unsure
about the use of entity tags.  Should an entity of this type respond with an ETag
field ? In turn, should I support If-Match/If-None-Match? If so ,How?
