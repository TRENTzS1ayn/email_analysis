definition of a u-a-p:

a readable and understandable file transmitted via. HTTP
to a client .... it is similar in content
if not identical to the equivalent HTTP headers which it purports to
encapsulate

there should never be a NEED to use a u-a-p for a browser
...although it will be more efficient
