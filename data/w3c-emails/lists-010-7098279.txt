I'm not a specialist in modem technology, but AFAIK modems offer you a
constant amount of bandwidth both ways.  So savings on the request
stream will not get you more bandwidth on the response stream, which
means that the savings matter even _less_ than on a LAN.  My wait
chain calculations will _over_estimate the speedup in the modem case,
assuming that the modem is the bottleneck.

As for the high RTT on some of Digital's internal links: RTTs are
irrelevant for this discussion.  If anything, they will make the
savings less noticable.  If Digital's internal links were highly
_saturated_, that would be another thing.

The compression ratio varies depending on what you try to compress.
Have you ever gzipped a httpd logfile?  If the same effect happens
with modem compression, Jim will learn something about how HTTP works
very soon.
