Here is a version of the answer:

 - sticky headers: 1-4% traffic savings
 - compressing text/html and text/plain entities in relayed
   responses: 20-45% traffic savings

Now, why is there so much fuss over sticky headers?  Ever since Accept
headers dropped below 1.4K, they are a solution in search of a
problem.  If this group were to produce a sticky header spec, the spec
would only distract vendors from implementing optimizations which are
actually worth the effort.
