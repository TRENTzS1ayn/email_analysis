I know how vary works.  I expect that service providers would send

  Vary: Accept, Accept-Language, User-Agent, Referer, From

or even

  Vary: *

under your scheme.  The latter is equivalent to max-age=0. Even the
former this gives you so much variance that cachability is effectively
eliminated.  Also, the it is at least questionable whether cache
implementers will actually implement all optimisations allowed by
Vary.

Then our terminology is in sync.

No, I changed my mind after reading the messages from Erik Aronesty.
I no longer think that providers who *only* want hit counts are in the
majority.

For the record, I claimed that the *customers* of providers would not
know the difference.

I have outlined a number of problems in your proposal.  The bottom
line is that I don't think it will work in its current form.  I'm
still moderately interested in getting a working lightweight
demographics mechanism, and will wait and see if the next draft
improves things.
