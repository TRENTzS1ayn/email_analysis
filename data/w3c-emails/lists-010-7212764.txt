A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
Working Group of the IETF.                                                

Note: This revision reflects comments received during the last call period.

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for
distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a 
generic, stateless, object-oriented protocol which can be used for many 
tasks, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, 
through extension of its request methods. A feature of HTTP is the typing 
and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built 
independently of the data being transferred.    
                           
HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative 
since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as 
"HTTP/1.1".

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-07.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.

For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@ietf.org


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
