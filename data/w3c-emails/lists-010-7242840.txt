    As for the high RTT on some of Digital's internal links: RTTs are
    irrelevant for this discussion.  If anything, they will make the
    savings less noticable.  If Digital's internal links were highly
    _saturated_, that would be another thing.

Precisely.  In the absence of high bit-error rates (such as on wireless
links), high RTTs come from two sources: speed-of-light delays, and
queueing delays.  Although Digital is on a serious cost-cutting kick,
it's not possible to pay less and get slower light, so we use the same
300,000 KM/sec that everyone else has.  But extra bandwidth does cost
money, so in some places we are undersupplied, which means queueing
delays, which means high RTTs.

In other words: high RTTs imply link saturation.
