There's trust, and then there's trust.  While I (browser user) may
trust a browser vendor enough to give me a browser I can use safely
without trashing my filesystem (e.g.), I (service provider) may not
*believe* everything a browser vendor says about the capability of
their browser.  For instance, a browser vendor might want to advertise
they are fully compatible with the latest version of Netscape, when in
fact, there are numerous niggly details about their rendering choices
that are not done in the same way, and that might not even be noticed by
the vendor themselves.  Signature authorities would certainly provide
a nice level of guarantee, but I think that "relatively trustworthy"
DNS servers referring to relatively trustworthy profile servers
would be ok most of the time -- this seems to be very similar in
character to other kinds of DNS spoofing and so should be solved by
similar methods (whatever they are).

I agree.
