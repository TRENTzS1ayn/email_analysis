At Roy's request, I submitted the transparent content negotiation
draft spec as an internet draft.

The submitted internet draft is *identical* to the `pre02-19' draft I
made available on June 30 at http://gewis.win.tue.nl/~koen/conneg/,
except for the date, filename, and `STATUS OF THIS DOCUMENT' stuff at
the start, and the use of `HTTP' instead of `HTTP/1.1' in the abstract
and introduction.

If you have not read the draft already, don't get the .txt version
from an internet drafts ftp site, but get the HTML version at the web
page above.

Koen.
