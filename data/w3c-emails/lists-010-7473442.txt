 A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
 Working Group of the IETF.                                                

       Title     : Transparent Content Negotiation in HTTP                 
       Author(s) : K. Holtman
       Filename  : draft-holtman-http-negotiation-02.txt
       Pages     : 38
       Date      : 08/14/1996

HTTP allows one to put multiple versions of the same information under a 
single URL.  Transparent content negotiation is a mechanism, layered on top
of HTTP, for automatically selecting the best version when the URL is 
accessed.  This enables the smooth deployment of new web data formats 
and markup tags.              
                                                 
Design goals for transparent content negotiation include low overhead on 
the request message size, downwards compatibility, extensibility, enabling 
the rapid introduction of new areas of negotiation, scalability, low cost 
of minimal support, end user control, and good cachability.

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-holtman-http-negotiation-02.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.

For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@ietf.org


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
