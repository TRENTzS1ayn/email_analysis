HI ! 

  This may be a simple query .  Please execuse.

      I am writing an  Application in HTML .  Could somebody
      tell me how do we generate a popup window when clicking
      on an hyperlink.  (the TARGET="main" directive generates 
      a new netscape session itself, which is rather clumsy).
      I want something like the window which pops up when we
      view the source .

Thanks in advance.
Raj.
