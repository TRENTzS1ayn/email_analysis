Hi,

We have a web server implementing the HTTP 1.1 server MUSTS and most
easy SHOULDs running at:

http://wilson.ai.mit.edu/cl-http/cl-http.html

The server home page is at:

http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/iiip/doc/cl-http/home-page.html

The final prerelease is available for FTP complete with source code,
which can be viewed over the web, but is most useful for advanced lisp
programmers.

Although the server implements a number of proxy-relevant headers, it
does not provide 1.1 proxy service at the moment.

A variety of computed pages are generated on the fly using chunked
transfer encoding (if you are a 1.1 client).  The particular machine on
which this server is running has an adaptive TCP implementation, so you
may observe changes in the packet sizes as you interact with it.

The server makes efforts to keep connections open, as appropriate, when
it returns non-success responses.

The server does not do content negotiation.

If anyone spots any bugs or shortcomings, please drop us a bug report at
bug-cl-http@ai.mit.edu 

Kindly treat the test machine with respect as it provides file service
for our research group as well.
