Before people start getting jumpy ...

The Apache Group is not planning on releasing any server that uses
the native HTTP-version "HTTP/1.1" until after the IESG approves the
draft for RFC status (i.e., fixes that version in stone).  Since all
of the HTTP/1.1 features can be tested as an HTTP/1.0 server (assumimg
you are careful not to send HTTP/1.1 features to HTTP/1.0 clients
where it is noted in the spec that you MUST not do so), I strongly
suggest, for the sake of interoperability, that no application be shipped
with the "HTTP/1.1" label until after we all know that there will be
no further requirements placed on HTTP/1.1 applications.
