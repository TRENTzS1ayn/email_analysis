Are you saying that 1.0 clients do not ignore headers they don't understand?
Or are you trying to say don't send chunked encoded stuff to 1.0 clients?

I checked every occurence of MUST in the spec to make sure we were conforming,
and I believe we are.

CL-HTTP responds to 1.0 clients with 1.0 responses.  1.1 responses are
reserved for clients or proxies that also advertise 1.1 functionality.
Most of my user base is behind firewalls, with one prominent exception,
and they like keeping their research on the cutting edge. Of course, since 
we are in lisp, upgrades only take a couple of minutes. Servers don't
go down. Just load patches. No big deal.
