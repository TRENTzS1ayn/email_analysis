No, he's saying don't call yourself HTTP/1.1 until there is a HTTP/1.1
spec to ahere to. See, the IESG could come back and say "Whoa,
folks. We'll approve this spec, but only if you add a section that
says every time a request is made, the server MUST send to the
Pentagon, via overnight mail, a hot dog with lots of jalapeno
mustard." Unlikely, but if it happened, you'd have a server that
called itself HTTP/1.1, but was not HTTP/1.1 compliant. Which would be
a bad thing. So until the IESG approves the spec, you need to call
yourself HTTP/1.0.
