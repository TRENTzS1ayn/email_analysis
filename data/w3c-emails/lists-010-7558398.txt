The latter.

Great -- but what I was saying is that you can't be sure you are conforming
until the document stops changing, which means when the IESG recommends
it for RFC status.  So, you need to wait for that before you can ship
software that responds with "HTTP/1.1 200 OK".

I don't anticipate any more changes to the protocol, but stranger things
have happened.  I'd like to minimize the number of noncompliant servers
advertizing HTTP/1.1, and one way to do that is to encourage people to
implement the features within HTTP/1.0 first and only switch the version
when it can be tested against a completed RFC.
