C'mon Roy, they announced an experimental implemntation and solicited 
testing against it with experimental HTTP/1.1 clients. Your response
is quite harsh when you should be lauding their attempts to verify the
specification by attempting to implement it.

Impossible Roy ... many aspects of the new protocol depend on the version
for a experimental client to recognize the server as 1.1 and vice versa.

It is VERY IMPORTANT that such experimental servers not be released /
distributed as anything other than internet drafts until the RFC is
approved. But lets focus on the issue that experiments be identified
as such. Who knows, perhaps the protocol will change as a result of 
this experiment.
