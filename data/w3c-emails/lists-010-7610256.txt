I said "ship" -- as in letting it go outside your area of control where
you can personally ensure that changes to the protocol can be fixed
in the server code and thus not result in long-term faulty applications
in the hands of users that might not want to upgrade them.

If John hadn't said he was planning to ship it soon, I would not have
bothered.  In any case, these messages are directed at the entire WG
and not just his server (in fact, his server is the least of my worries,
since he has better control over his user base than other servers do).

There is nothing in HTTP/1.1 that an HTTP/1.0 server cannot send to
an experimental HTTP/1.1 client -- the only necessity is that the client 
not have the normal attribute of disregarding HTTP/1.1 features received
from an HTTP/1.0 server.  Nor is there any requirement anywhere that
forbids an HTTP/1.0 server from properly interpreting HTTP/1.1 requests.

Being able to use HTTP/1.1 features within HTTP/1.0 is one of the design
requirements that Henrik and I laid down at the beginning.  It would be
nice if people would take advantage of it.
