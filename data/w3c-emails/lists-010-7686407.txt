One that has risen more than once in my projects is the browser's 
handing of the following <form> fragment:

   <select name=x>
     <option>Choice 1
     <option>Choice 2
     <option>Choice 3
   </select>

One browser does what I prefer (default is nothing selected) but doesn't
follow the HTML standard as I read it and the other follows 
the standard (default is first is selected). Yet another browser ignores
selected in <option selected>.
