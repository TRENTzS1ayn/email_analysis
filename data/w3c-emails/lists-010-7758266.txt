Hang on a sec, of the 3 drafts only one was to do notification.

I don't think that length of the draft is a good way of measuring
the complexity of the draft. I thought spliting drafts up was
flavour of the month :-)

The others are linked insofar as they extend the functionality
but the core of the notification idea is the same size.

What I am more worried about is that the people are increasing the
requirements beyond those originally met by "simple" spec. Or
to put it another way, by the time you meet the demands of the
various advertsing brokers you may well be looking at 26 rather than
11 pages (closer to 40% than 1/3 :-).


One factor you will have to take account of is the need to forward
session id information. This means either trapping cookies or
some sort of explicit session id such as I proposed. The value of 
advertising is very heavily dependent on the demographic profile.
Look at doubleclick where demographic constraints increase the
cost of a 100,000 hits from 9K to 29K. 

Personally I prefer my session id scheme :-)
