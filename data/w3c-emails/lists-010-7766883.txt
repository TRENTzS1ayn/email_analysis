That's why I said it was a crude measure.

But just being notified isn't enough, right? The proxy has to implement
the extended log format in order to transfer the information in a
standard way, and so on with session IDs.

Sorry -- that was a thinko -- if you assume 2 pages of boilerplate per
draft, your 3 have 20 pages of real text and ours has 9 -- closer to

Part of our draft is just a note about how to get referer information
without adding to the protocol.

I'm not knocking your scheme -- its clearly the only approach to getting
all the information one would get if the origin server saw all the
requests. I'd be quite happy if everyone said they were really going to
do it your way, and it got deployed really soon. I was only objecting to
the characterization that ours is just as complex. I don't really want
to spend a lot of time trying to quantify their relative complexity  --
it would be better spent getting both approaches through the
standardization process so that the decision can be made the way it
usually is -- by implementors and customers voting where they want to be
in cost/benefit/time-to-implement/time-to-deploy space.
