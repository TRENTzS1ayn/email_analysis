Nope, session ids are orthogonal but are needed if you want to do
session tracking behind a proxy. I think that this is necessary for
both your scheme and mine.

The extended log format can be implemented in an afternoon with
little trouble provided the items logged are fixed. If you go for
allowing a choice of the items to log it gets trickier but not
much. 

The pain for Xlog is for the analysis tool writers, not the server
writers :-)
