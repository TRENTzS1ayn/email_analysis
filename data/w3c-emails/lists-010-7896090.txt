The "must-revalidate" cache-response-directive was created to fix that
problem and we have yet to see whether or not it will be sufficient.
The protocol is not capable of fixing the problem any better than that,
since the actual cause of your woes is simply that using state-marked URLs
or cookies for storing and exchanging market-basket state is a poor
design for a distributed client/server system.  If you want to do better,
you will need to convince the browser makers to define a standard for
identifying purchasable items in HTML and a client-side "basket window"
for manipulating items to be purchased via a POST request to one or more
"cashier" resources (also identified in the HTML) which can verify the
entire purchase (including cost/item and availability) before authorizing
the sale.  No changes to HTTP are necessary, and it is completely resistant 
to caching; in fact, it is cache-friendly.
