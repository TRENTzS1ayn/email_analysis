I just joined the ircache mail list, and thought I might have some
input.  I have been analyzing proxy logs to size a replacement proxy
cache.  Background - Fidelity Investments firewall proxy cache,
handling 500,000 access (5 GB) per day, 4000 active users.

The CGI URLS at my proxy make up 11% of all accesses.  In terms of
unique URLs, CGI URLs make up 15%.  Of these 56% are accessed more
than once within a week.   And the average number of times these URLs
are accessed is 1.9.  This means that if I were to cache CGI URLs, I
might be able to get a 48% hit rate.

What is more interesting is that only 16% of the CGI URLs are accessed
multiple times and might benefit from caching.  But these URLs are
each accessed an average of 12 times within a week.  Scanning the raw
data, I see that the largest number of these is for stock quote
lookups, where data more than 10 minutes old might be useless.  And
I responding to a question related to search engines - :(

Here's more data if anyone's interested - the raw numbers from a
week's access logs:

Total accesses (including client cache hits and failures)  3,586,096
Total successful transfers                                 2,502,142

From a quick scan through the logs, I don't see our proxies repeatedly
