This has very recently been fixed in the latest Lynx code.
It would be helpful if readers of this lists who think a browser
is not "a valid implemetation of HTTP/1.0" would share that opinion
with the developers in the form of bug reports - in the case of Lynx,
send them to <URL:mailto:lynx-dev@sig.net>.  If it's not known, it can't
be fixed.

No server will have to special-case Lynx for this purpose, at least
if the version in the User-Agent is Lynx/2.6 or greater...
