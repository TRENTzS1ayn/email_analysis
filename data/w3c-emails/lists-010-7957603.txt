   Who wants to write file and not know if there is a version conflict?

One way to solve this in HTTP/1.1 is to do:

PUT /foo HTTP/1.1
If-Match: "1ad18937shjd"

if the previously known Etag: for the resource was "1ad18937shjd",
or (if no Etag is available, but a Last-modified time is available)

PUT /foo HTTP/1.1
If-Unmodified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT

This latter approach is a little risky, since if the resource
is modified more than once during a given second, a conflict
could arise.
