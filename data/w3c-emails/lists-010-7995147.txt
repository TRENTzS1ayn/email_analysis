The following is off topic for this group, but I had to followup.

It's bad enough they claim HTTP/1.1 conformance before the spec is
finalized. The worst part is, it's a really crappy product.

- It's support for persistent connections consists of sending "Connection:
  close".
- It spits out TWO response lines/codes on a HEAD (neither of which is
  appropriate for the error entity body they send along with it).
- For ANY method, you don't even have the opportunity to input HTTP headers
  before it spits out a response.  How the heck it can support the Host header
  is beyond me.  Maybe they expect all the headers to be in the first packet
  (lame lame), or maybe they treat CRLF as CRCR (lame lame), which they can't
  legally do anyway.

I especially dislike the footer.  Mentioning competing and likely vastly
superior product names in the comments 10 times each at the bottom of your
web page is in the poorest possible taste, embedded illigal characters,
invalid HTML, misspellings aside.
