Rohit,

Just for your information, I am currently working on your
Internet-Draft <draft-ietf-http-pep-00.txt>.

I'll probably send an announcement to the entire IETF
regarding your I-D sometime tomorrow or the next day.
       
P.S.  As a normal procedure, please note that I've changed
      the filename from "draft-khare-http-pep-01.txt" to
      "draft-ietf-http-pep-00.txt" 

Kind Regards,

Cynthia Clark
Internet-Drafts Administrator
