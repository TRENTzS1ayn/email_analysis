`needs needs non-numeric attributes' is a but ambiguous.  More
accurate is `future version will use non-numeric attributes'.  And at
the end of the `content negotiation' paragraph: `future version will
define non-numeric attributes'.

   - - -

Please also put these issues on the list:

- there is a desire to make a shared recommendation on the use of the
1.1 version number

- when creating 1.1, we used the following rule a number of times:

 Any proposed HTTP/1.1 features not in HTTP/1.0 for which there is no
 consensus will revert to HTTP/1.0 status in 1.1 and be considered for
 inclusion in HTTP/1.2.

This rule also implies a promise that deferred proposals would not
disappear into the bit bucket.  I therefore propose an action item to
gather such `not 1.1' things from the 1.1 issues list and record them
in a document, to be passed on to any future 1.2 WG.  (By the way,
have we decided already that this WG would not do 1.2?)
