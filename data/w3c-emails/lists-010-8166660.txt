Just to put a real stake in the ground, I've received two *.dll-s from
a vendor. The second includes fixes/changes from the first, but the
length is identical (5xx120 bytes, I don't remember the xx). In this
case, the only improbability is generation of two 500K dlls within 1
second ;-:)

Bottom line, you can't assume the length won't change.
