OK.  If you feel that these issues got adequate consideration, that is
good enough for me.  I agree that we should not add any additional
issues for this WG.

None of the drafts before us seem to require incrementing the version
number, they are all `extensions on top of 1.1'.  (They had better be
for editorial reasons alone: there is no way we can add N pages to
the 1.1 draft and call the result 1.2.)

I think we will see lots of extensions, but they will be created
within the feature negotiation and PEP frameworks, not in the IETF
framework, where creating anything takes a lot more time.  I don't
think an IETF WG could add much value to the 1.x framework after we
have feature negotiation and PEP.

Personally, after this WG closes, I'd rather work in a WG chartered to
do 2.x.  This is where I can see some substantial added value which
can only be gotten with an IETF-like activity.

By the way, about closing this WG: If I'd have to choose between

 1) closing in December
 2) closing when transparent negotiation and PEP have
    proposed status 

I'd choose 2).  I of course hope that 1) and 2) will coincide, and
will work to make this happen.  But if they do not coincide, I'd go
for 2).
