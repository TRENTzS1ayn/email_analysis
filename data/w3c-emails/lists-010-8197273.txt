A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
Working Group of the IETF.                                                

       Title     : HTTP/1.2 EXTENSION PROTOCOL (PEP)                       
       Author(s) : R. Khare
       Filename  : draft-ietf-http-pep-00.txt
       Pages     : 11
       Date      : 08/19/1996

PEP is a system for HTTP clients, servers, and proxies to reliably reason 
about custom extensions to HTTP. Traditionally, HTTP agents offer extended 
behavior by private agreement using additional message headers. PEP has 
features for expressing the scope, strength, and ordering of such 
extensions, as well as which extensions are available.      
               
PEP as described here is substantially simpler than previous drafts.  
The title has also been changed, since PEP addresses a chartered 
HTTP WG work item.

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-pep-00.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.

For questions, please mail to Internet-Drafts@ietf.org


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
