We have a techreport:

http://www.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/caching.ps.gz

which discusses some issues in the relation between cache size and
hit rate.

Actually, we have also done some simulations on the performance of
hierarchical and/or cooperating caches; a report on that is not
available yet, but the bottom line is the following:

N cooperating caches (a la Harvest) with disk capacity D each work
almost as a single cache with N*D disk space (for N not too large,
let's say N < 10).  The communication between caches is a small
fraction of the overall traffic (because it only affects documents
which are accessed more than once).
