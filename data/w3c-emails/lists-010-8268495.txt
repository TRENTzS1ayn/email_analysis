    The extended log format can be implemented in an afternoon with
    little trouble provided the items logged are fixed. If you go for
    allowing a choice of the items to log it gets trickier but not
    much. 

    The pain for Xlog is for the analysis tool writers, not the server
    writers :-)

How does your technique (with the server asking the proxy to transmit
a large log) work when there are multiple levels of proxy involved,
some of which may be hidden behind firewalls?
