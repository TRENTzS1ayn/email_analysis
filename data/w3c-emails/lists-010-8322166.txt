As long as we're making progress, we can continue working.
But if we can't finish the items in process by December, I'd seriously
question whether we're "making progress".

I'd like to encourage the authors of the current drafts to respond to
comments and release new drafts QUICKLY: turnaround measured in small
numbers of days rather than in weeks is really important.

I know people have other jobs and other things to do, but just think:
this will be over soon.  Let's finish.

Larry
