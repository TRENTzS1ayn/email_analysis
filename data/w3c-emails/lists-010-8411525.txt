If we want to do it *right*, we should not re-introduce mxb, but
introduce an Accept-Length header.  

I did not just remove mxb because it was unused, I removed it because
it was was the kind of unused cruft that brings a protocol much closer
to the point at which no extension is possible anymore because of
interference effects.

Personally, I think people vastly overestimate the good a `don't ever
send me something longer than X bytes' mechanism can do: if this
actually was useful, browsers would have `abort all transfers longer
than X bytes' configuration options by now.

But if we are going to have such a mechanism, we at least need to make
it orthogonal to the other negotiation headers.
