Quick suggestion:

There's some ISO standard, don't know which, which suggests to
use this notation for dates:

YEAR-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ

or something like that.

This format is very handy as you can use lexical comparison
to compare times.

Therefore it would be a plus to have this in some future
HTTP version.. Maybe one should introduce acceptance of
this style with HTTP/1.1 already so one can switch to
this syntax only sometime in the future..

Best regards,
