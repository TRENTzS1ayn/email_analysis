I feel that digest authentication is a `may support' feature, not a
`must support' feature for HTTP/1.x applications.  I feel that
compliance with 1.1 must _not_ require support for digest
authentication: support for various authentication methods has always
been optional in HTTP.  If support were required, this would greatly
increase the requirements on a minimal 1.1 application, which is a bad
thing.

I have no opinion on whether it is preferable to merge the digest
authentication draft into the main 1.1 draft.  As far as I am
concerned, this decision can be left to the RFC editor.

Koen.
