I would like to see it be mandatory.  Here's why.

1) We would like Digest to supersede Basic.

2) As long as there's uncertainty that Digest is widely supported by
browsers, servers will of necessity ask for authentication by either.
(That's assuming they support Digest themselves.)

3) If servers can ask for both kinds of authentication, there's no
incentive for browser vendors to support Digest.  So (I believe) they
won't.

So here's a proposal:  if an HTTP/1.1 agent (client or server) supports
Basic, it must also support Digest.  Authentication support remains
optional, but it's all or none.
