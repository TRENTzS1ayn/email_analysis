I strongly agree with Dave.  I think his arguments are very sound.
I would clarify one point, though.  It should be possible to support
Digest and not support Basic.   But I like the requirement that
if Basic is supported then Digest must be also.  I think Koen's 
concerns about minimal implementations are met by the possibility of 
supporting neither.
