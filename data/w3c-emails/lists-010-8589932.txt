I do agree that digest is essential but if both documents are already 
approved by the IESG then how can this be done without introducing 
significant delay in the process? Will IESG react different to a "docked" 
digest document versus a simple reference from Chapter 11.2 or was the 
approval a "blank check" for what we decide on?
