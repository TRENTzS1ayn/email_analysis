Clarifying language like this is already in the draft, see the end of
Section 13.1.1.  The start of 13.1.2 could be interpreted to
contradict the clarification as far as the Warning header is
concerned, though.  My concerns are mainly about cache implementers
who just get it wrong, and add a Warning:stale when they should not.
Like I said, `obvious' mechanisms added for robustness could easily
cause catastrophic failure when deployed in a chain of proxies.

That would be acceptable to me.  I don't see the need to add Age when
you get something directly from a pre-1.1 _origin_ server, but I could
live with this requirement.
