Basically, "docking" isn't practical. I don't think the HTTP editor
(Jim) is prepared to do the rather major editing that would be
necessary to make the merged document readable, I know that the RFC
editor isn't, and I don't think that we can do that much editing
without recycling through "last call".

I've heard there's currently a two-month backlog in getting things
through the RFC editor, even when they're straightforward.
