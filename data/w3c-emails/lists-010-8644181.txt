History has shown that getting bad data in a cache has had major
headaches associated with it.

I believe we should stay with Jeff's conservative algorithm, and this is why
I have not to date made any changes in the specification; I will of course
go with the consensus of the group, but to date, I've not seen
a good case made by Roy.  Not surprising users is a very good thing;
if the web is unreliable, it will generate many more problems than whatever
small performance gain might be available with a more optimistic algorithm.
