Ah, I misunderstood your question which sounded like you were
asking about docking. My understanding of the wording in the spec 
was that the group were generally agreed that incorporating
digest was a good idea but that it might be controvertial
vis a vis the IESG and hence the conditional statement...

At all costs we must avoid going back to last call (IETF snakes
and ladders, your draft has a misprint go back to square 1)
