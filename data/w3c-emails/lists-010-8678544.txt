I disagree weakly ... SHOULD is strong enough ... I have an
HTTP application
which at the 99.9% level will be deployed in a single machine. A password
in the clear would not be exposed outside of the machine. Of the remaining
.1%, the bulk will be on an intranet LAN where exposure is not a large
risk. On that basis, we use basic authentication to restrict access
from users outside the single machine. Hence, I believe it a reasonable
design point to support BASIC w/o DIGEST. SHOULD support DIGEST provides
an opportunity for carefully reasoned escape where other features are
probably worth more of the implementation effort.
