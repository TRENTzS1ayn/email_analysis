Undoubtedly, there will be a very small minority of applications where 
passwords in the clear are not a serious problem.  But this is such a small 
fraction of the HTTP applications as to be negligible.

In my experience, applications have long lives with tortuous paths from 
their start point to their end -- witness the 1401 Autocoder payroll system 
I knew of running 10 or so years after IBM discontinued making the 1401. 
 Dave, IMHO it is dangerous to assume that this application will forever and 
ever not be subject to someone, somewhere, wanting to break security on it 
 -- if not on its current platform, then on the next platform, or the 
next...  If the data is worth protecting, it is likely that the data 
security is worth cracking.

If an HTTP 1.1 server supports Basic, they MUST support Digest.  This is the 
only way to eventually eliminate passwords in the clear.
