I didn't consider the statements I made to be an attack.  Just truths.
Independent of whether or not the statements were an 'attack' I think the
statements were justified.

Given Paul Leach's involvement with discussion on Digest in his working
group, I have faith that Microsoft would not ship a HTTP/1.1 product without
Digest support (How's that for pressure Paul?) -- especially if we mandate
it for HTTP/1.1 compliance.

I have not said Netscape has been an unfriendly, un-open (I might be
thinking it, but I haven't made available my opinions on Netscape in this
forum) company...

...although I will say I'm quite irked when you say Netscape has been *more*
internet friendly than any other major corporation.  Maybe "even" at best.
You could have picked any number of large companies that have been even more
standards oriented, and I wouldn't have disagreed if you had picked
Spyglass.  Netscape is much maligned, certainly overly so, but they haven't
been poster children of IETF process either.  That cookie draft sure took a
long time to appear, and even then it wasn't without extraordinary efforts
from Kristol.  Then there's all the HTML extensions that were never put into
an internet draft, or didn't even show up quickly (yet?) in publicly
available DTDs.

I have only said that indications I've received imply Netscape needs to be
coaxed to support Digest, because they, as of recently, had no plans to
support it.
