The story I heard blamed lack of cycles, but that tends to be
the way for every extension that they don't think up in house.

For a long time Netscape refused to contemplate tables claiming
they were unnecessary. They have dragged their feet on maths
markup for years claiming "nobody wants it".

What was somewhat ammusing was when Marc stood up to explain his
"discovery" that the Web could be used as an Intranet collaboration
tool, I think a guy in Geneva had a similar idea at some time:-)
