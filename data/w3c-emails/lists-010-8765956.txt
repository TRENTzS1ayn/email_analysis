We had been adding support for digest auth back in 1.1 but
then some folks decided to keep changing the spec so we
dropped the feature.

At this point there isn't any good reason to add such a weak
authorization scheme when certificates are available already.

Why would you ever want to use digest if you already have
certificate support?
