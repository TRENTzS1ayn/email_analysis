In Netscape's defence, I implemented Digest for a late beta of
Navigator 2.0 (I think that version was called SimpleMD5), but just
days before that beta was due to go out the spec submitted to the IETF
changed and became unstable judging by the amount of discussion that
suddenly bursted out in the respective mailing list.  Consequently, I
had to remove the support that I had added.  We had all due eagerness
to support it asap but it backfired when spec kept changing.
