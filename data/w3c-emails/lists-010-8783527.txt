Before everyone gets angry at me, allow me to refute my
own message.

While I still feel that certificates are *way* better when
they are used, realistically speaking, they are much 
harder to put into every users hands.

On the other hand Digest auth is *way*, *way* better than
basic auth and can be put into place fairly easily by
adding support in new clients and servers.  For that
reason they are worth implementing even given the
existance of certificates.
