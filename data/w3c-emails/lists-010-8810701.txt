This isn't quite fair.  Anyone can propose any crazy idea they want on
a newsgroup and many people did.  However, I don't believe that there
have been any drafts of the spec (the current one is 04) which would
not interoperate with "SimpleMD5".  There were some additions, but all
were optional. This was done despite the fact that (IMHO) there were
suggestions for (incompatible) changes which would have improved the
specification.

The motivation for this (at least on my part) was to preserve
compatibility with Spyglass client implementations (some of which also
showed up in some versions of MSIE).  People at Spyglass had done
much of the early work on digest and I thought they deserved that
consideration -- even though when I took over as editor of the spec
they said do whatever is best and they would accomodate if need be.
