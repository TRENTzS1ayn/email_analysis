Oh yea, we have also been implementing it for some time now- I know there
were several implementations out there, just I guess it wasn't obvious how
to find them...

In any case I am hearing from Lou and others that it should like noone is
objecting to digest authentication in 1.1, right? In other words, various

is easy so everyone can implement it as a minimum standard that is
signifigantly better than  basic.

Right?
