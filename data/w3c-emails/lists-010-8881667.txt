Actually, spyglass has such servers as do I. You can test the digest support
from the examples/documentation at http://wilson.ai.mit.edu/cl-http/cl-http.html,
along with other 1.1 features. We tested implementation against theirs about
a yaer ago when we first did it.

I vote for a *must* on digest authentication. We would be much happier using
it rather than basic on a number of public web pages.  Of course, MD5 does have
it shortcomings so it is important to implement the extensions that allow
the algorithm to be specified.
