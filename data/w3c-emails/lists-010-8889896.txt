It is completely against the principles of IETF standards that the
process of arriving at "rough consensus" could result in threatening
to slap "uncompliant" on someone publicly. It's a rather empty
power-trip.

Besides, there are ample examples of situations where a HTTP/1.1
compliant application (not necessarily a browser) might implement one
kind of authentication and not another. There's no first-principled
reason to brand THOSE applications uncompliant in a quest for some
kind of marketing press release.

No thanks,

Larry
