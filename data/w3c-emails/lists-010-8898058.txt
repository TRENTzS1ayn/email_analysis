Now, now.. Let's just get the digest scheme into wider use by deprecating
basic in favor of digest.

There are a number of other uses of digest authentication, including
authenticating post transactions and http return codes so the client
knows the data was received and actually processed by the server.

We are putting this into our system and phil should have a spec available
soon.  This allows one to implement transaction-controlled updates with post
and have some confidence that everything is working properly.

It might be useful to extend the notion of digest authenticated transactions to any http transaction.
