In fact, Apache does have a solution - originate the code outside the US and
import it. This has a major advantage over exported servers in that the
crypto is not crippled. This solution is, of course, Apache-SSL.

Actually, it was the NCSA that had the arm-twist applied (by the NSA, I'm
told), and they advised the Apache Group to follow suit, which they did.

This is true. If we were to drop crypto into the main Apache distribution, it
would prevent the distribution from being stored in the US (not really a big
deal) but worse, it would prevent US developers from working on Apache. This is
why Apache-SSL is distributed separately, and developed entirely outside the
US by non-US nationals.

But even if there were no export hassles, certificate support is no substitute
for digest auth. The code is several orders of magnitude harder to write, and
the maintenance overhead for the user of certificates is also considerably
greater than maintaining digest auth.

Apache supports digest auth in a few hundred lines of code. Certificate support
takes tens of thousands of lines.

Cheers,

Ben.
