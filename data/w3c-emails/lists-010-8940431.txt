With respect, this distinction seems a little labored. As I see it, 
Basic authentication is badly flawed from the point of view of the 
_function_ it is supposed to support. Protocols exist, and are specified, 
for practical, functional reasons, not exercises in abstract logic, and 
it seems clear to me that for HTTP to achieve the purposes for which it 
is designed in a satisfactory way, we have to get away from Basic 
authentication. So I strongly favor the MUST.
