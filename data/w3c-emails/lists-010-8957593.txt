For example, if I set up my Corporate Technical Memory document submission 
process to require SSL, it would (at least technically) be illegal for 
French TCE employees to submit documents, as they would be encrypted 
en-route and there is no general license to use SSL granted by the French 
government.  This would be inside the TCE WAN -- not even out on the 
Internet.
