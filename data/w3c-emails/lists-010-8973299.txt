As larry has pointed out, basic for client / server non persistant requests
is a poor choice.

client - proxy  with persistant connection between client and proxy 
when used with one time password systems ( as we do in our product) allows
sites to authenticate strongly which of their users can do WEB stuff.

Basic auth as a mechanism can very useful even if it is not what it was
intended for.

There are no export restrictions for hash algs (MD4,5). crypto can be
exported if used for authentication only and cannot be used for data
encryption. (you ship binaries only.. no source.)

Patent restrictions are a different matter...

Pete.
