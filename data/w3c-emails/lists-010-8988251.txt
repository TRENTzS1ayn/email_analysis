This sounds interesting.  But I am not sure whether you 

   (1) Authenticate a client only once for a persistent connection,

or

   (2) Authenticate each transaction (reusing the password), but use
      a new password anytime there is a new connection.

Either would seem possible.  

If it is (1) then strictly speaking you are probably not HTTP
compliant since you are essentially making the Proxy-Authorization
header "sticky".  But I see no reason that your proxy shouldn't
interoperate with HTTP clients.

If it is (2) then you aren't strictly using one-time passwords, as the
same password is re-used for each transaction, but you should have
essentially all the benefits of one-time passwords.
