This is unfortunate. The design of DIGEST deliberately made it possible
to share a database for both purposes - if absolutely necessary. No 
server should ever be storing the passwords used by DIGEST, all that is 
necessary is the one way function hashed key.

The one way hash used by DIGEST is much stronger than that used by the
UNIX password format. There is no cryptographic reason to prefer the
UNIX format.


The reason why nobody is using DIGEST is because of clients which do 
not.
