I strongly disagree. Noncompliance to a spec is a very big marketing force.

-It makes sense to stop sending passwords in the clear.
-It makes sense to have *a single way* to stop sending passwords in the clear.
-It makes sense to require that any browser that allows a user to send a
password allow that user to send it securely.
-It is not politically expedient to try to force the largest manufacturer
do anything. This argument is a (dare I say it?) red herring.

The IESG has told us to consider security part of the system. Sending
passwords in the clear breaks the security system.

I disagree, and it seems like the rough consensus so far is to use MUST.

Huh? It has been pointed out that Basic authentication does *not* work well
with OTP because every transaction is re-authenticated.

I strongly disagree.
