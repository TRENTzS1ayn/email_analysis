You are missing the point.  Digest can and should have been implemented
in HTTP/1.0 as the experiment that it was -- whether or not it is stable
only affects the allocation of limited resources.  In contrast, we are
using the label "HTTP/1.1" to indicate minimum compliance to a specific
proposed standard, and you cannot indicate minimum compliance to something
which is still subject to change.  Any future change to HTTP's minimum
compliance will now require a change to the HTTP version, since that
is how the version stuff is supposed to work. My concern is that the WG
as a whole needs to understand the meaning of HTTP-version, and when
the version number should change, since that understanding is central
to the protocol's extensibility.
