Ummm, excuse me, but history has only shown that caches which cannot
know whether or not they have received the whole message, due to the
lack of a content length or chunked encoding, are susceptible to storing
incomplete responses (bad data).  What Jeff is talking about is stale
data (data which was known to be good at some prior time, and may simply
be out-of-date).

I'm sorry, but this is incredible.  I demonstrated how the entire
network of New Zealand (3.6 million people and the highest tech ratio
of any nation) can be completely disabled by Jeff's "conservative algorithm".
Would it be more compelling if I explained how someone could do the same to
Digital's corporate network by spoofing NTP responses to the proxy outside
the firewall?

There is no way that I will implement Jeff's notion of having every
proxy add an Age header -- since I have documented the alternatives,
implementing Jeff's mechanism would subject me to liability every time
some idiot plays network ass-of-the-day.
