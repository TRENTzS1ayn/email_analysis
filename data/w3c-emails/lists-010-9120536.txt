We don't disagree -- that is what I meant by experiment.  I have no
problem with Netscape's decision not to include it in their released
products until there is a stable spec.  However, I do hope that you
(and everyone else) have continued to experiment and thus that you
will be ready to release a completed implementation, based on the
now final draft, as soon as possible.

My disagreement was with Mr. Morris' suggestion that this is the
same as the "HTTP/1.1" labelling issue; it is not.  Digest (as a draft)
is now just as stable for HTTP/1.0 as it is for HTTP/1.1.

I personally do not care whether Digest is a MUST or not -- people will
implement it because doing so results in a better product.
