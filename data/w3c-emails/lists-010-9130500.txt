Well, we're not working on a 1.1 proxy at the moment, but we will in a
matter of weeks.

I vote:
     - MUST add Age when serving from cache memory
     - SHOULD add Age when relaying a response from a 1.0 proxy
     - SHOULD NOT add Age when relaying a response directly from a 1.0 origin
       server
     - SHOULD NOT add Age when relaying a response from a 1.1 or
       higher source
