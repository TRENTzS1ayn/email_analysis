For those who are interested, you will note that the chunk size
emitted by the cl-http server varies.  This is because the lisp machine
has an adaptive TCP implementation that identifies optimal packet
sizes based on TCP factors.  The chunk sizes vary because chunking is 
built on the TCP buffer, which is the TCP packet to send. 
The server selects chunk sizes 2 less than the packet size to allow
the CRLF to be appended at the end of the packet, thus delivering a chunk
every TCP packet.

One would imagine that this kind of implementation will achieve the
best throughput rates for a given platform and network route.
