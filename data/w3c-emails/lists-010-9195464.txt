Okay, it looks like we have resolution.  We can't impose new requirements
on the protocol (beyond those already written in the documents) without 
another Last Call and IESG ballot, and we don't want to delay HTTP 1.1 
any longer.  Therefore:

1. I'll ask the IESG Secretary to immediately issue the HTTP 1.1 and 
digest protocol actions (declaring that each is approved for Proposed 
Standard status) and send the HTTP 1.1 and digest documents to the 
RFC Editor with the following note:

   NOTE TO THE RFC EDITOR
   
   draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-07 was written without knowing
   whether draft-ietf-http-digest-aa-* would be approved as
   a Proposed Standard.   Since both documents were approved at
   the same time, each may need modifications to make appropriate
   references to the other.

   Notes to the RFC Editor in the HTTP 1.1 draft (in section
   11.2 and 19.8.4) leave the decision to the RFC Editor to
   combine both drafts into one document or to keep them
   separated.  Assuming the RFC Editor will prefer the latter,
   it is suggested that section 11.2 of draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-07 
   be replaced with the following text:

   "The Digest Authentication Scheme, described in RFC XXXX, may also
   be used with HTTP/1.1."

   where "XXXX" is the RFC number assigned to draft-ietf-http-digest-aa-04.txt

2. The HTTP WG should decide whether to issue a brief applicability 
statement which specifies requirements (and/or recommendations) of 
HTTP 1.1 implementations with respect to digest authentication.  
If and when the WG produces such a document, it will require a 
Last Call and IESG approval just like any other standards-track document.

Thanks for your patience,

Keith
