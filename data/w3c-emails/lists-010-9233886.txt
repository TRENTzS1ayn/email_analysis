Personally, I don't see any point in a short RFC that says that you're
required to implement what's in draft-http-digest-aa-04.txt, because
*that* draft is pretty weak.

If working group members really want to REQUIRE that you MUST REALLY
implement digest authentication, I think we would have to revise
draft-http-digest-aa-04.txt so that it actually stated some
requirements where "MUST IMPLEMENT" actually meant something.

Personally, I think it's a waste of time. Little applicability
statements are the hobgoblins of ... well, you know how it goes.

We should focus on more important things, like the HTTP/1.2 documents.
The folks in distributed authoring and version management seem to also
want us to consider LINK and LOCK and UNLOCK and GET-VERSION and a
bunch of other things, too. We have lots of work.

I guess people can get excited about "MUST implement digest
authentication" but don't have time to actually make progress on
the _real_ problems.
