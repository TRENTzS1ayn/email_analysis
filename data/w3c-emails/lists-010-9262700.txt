I'll add some "practical" (non-technical) reasons:

(1)  Browsers do not permit sharing of certificates. The user must purchase
     a separate cert for each brand of browser they use.

(2)  Browsers have no "end-user" support for carrying certs around between
     computers. 

(3)  Corollary to (1/2): Server operator must be able to register and keep
     multiple certs for at least some of their users

Until certs are as portable as passwords, I think there are good reasons
for having something like Digest.
