Oops, right.  I forgot to add the chunk-ext change as well.

What are these "reference client" implementations?  Amaya isn't quite
ready yet (last I checked) and Henrik's line-mode browser still has
a couple things to implement.  Is there another?  I'd like to do more
testing as well.

Actually, I would put the *(SP | HT) inside the definition of chunk-ext
(before and after each ";").
