>What HTML mark-up would encode a
>POST-style bookmark?

Maybe I am picky, but the above should be "what HTML-*like* mark-up would 
encode a POST-style bookmark?".  Having just recently tried and failed to 
get HoTMetal Pro 3.0 to let me edit my Netscape 3.0 bookmark file, in my 
experience you can't say that bookmark files are true HTML.  However, 
because they _could_ be valid HTML, the fact that bookmark files are not 
currently in valid HTML is not a valid argument.

Offhand, I would think adding to HTML support for bookmark lists would be 
appropriate.  The DTD fragment could look something like:

<!-- bookmark list                      -->
<!ELEMENT BL        - -  (BL | BLE)+           >
<!-- bookmark list entry                -->
<!-- contains 1 anchor, possibly with POST request data     -->
<!ELEMENT BLE       - -  (BL | ble.content)+   >
<!ENTITY  % ble.content "A, POSTDATA?"              >
<!-- data for a POST request, encoded as PCDATA        -->
<!ELEMENT POSTDATA  - -  (#PCDATA)        >

I can even see where you could use data entities in POSTDATA for binary 
files to be uploaded.

(P.S. Please set flamethrowers on low; this is my first DTD fragment! :)
