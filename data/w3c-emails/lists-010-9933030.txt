What is the (real) purpose of this header? 
 
The client has no way to request it, it is not a security feature, and 
connection oriented transport protocols (i.e. TCP/IP stream sockets) 
already guarantee reliable data delivery. 
 
Why would I want to ever generate it? 
 
I found no discussion in the archive on the rationale for this header, 
only arguments about what it should be called.

Thank You, 
Richard L. Gray
