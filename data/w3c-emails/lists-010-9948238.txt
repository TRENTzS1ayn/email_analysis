It is not an issue of unfairness, but simply misperception of
the situation.  I can see now that a separate draft was required for
addition of a header (idempotent->redo-safe->safe) or method (repost)
from the outset of his discussion.

It might be better, then, if Roy and Koen finished their
discussion of what we have term the "rel=source alternative", and
a qualifed group of people took on the issue of safe, private and
secure storage of post-content, and mechanisms or re-using it via
a bookmark-like facility, beyond the simple, "first step" I was
suggesting.  Ideally, this should be done in coordination with the
W3C ERB.  It seems inappropriate to undertake an IETF ID that is
likely to involve new HTML markup or at least naming conventions
under circumstances where the IETF no longer has a clear role in
the development and standarization of HTML.
