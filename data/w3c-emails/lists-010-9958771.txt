I understand too that it's better to leave this feature in a separate
draft.

I was however wondering if any addition to 1.1 should be lumped together
and put in waiting list for 1.2 , or there is some shortcut, something
like tables' RFC in HTML. I know that probably it is more a political
issue, but for "simple" modifications a preferential route would be
great.
