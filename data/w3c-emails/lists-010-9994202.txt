I too have been waiting for Roy (or Larry) to comment on my objections
to rel=source.  I have been thinking about writing a `safe: yes'
mini-ID in case nobody else volunteers, but would like to see the
`rel=source' issue settled first.

I personally have little interest in taking the work beyond a `safe:
yes' mini-ID.  I don't think a bookmarking standard would create much
added value.
