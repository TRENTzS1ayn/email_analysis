A much debated point on this list, of late.  But yes, it is definitely not
our concern here.  I raise the UI implications of this proposal simply
because the spec should consider the many clients that may implement it.

See the 'Accept-Language' header of HTTP.  Basically, the client could say,
"I prefer Japanese to English," and the server processing the commentURL
request could return a Japanese policy document.

Okay, that sounds good.  Since we have been debating domain restrictions, I
thought you meant to restrict the policy URL to the same server as the
resource setting the cookie.

Yes.

Yes, Set-Cookie2 accepts a comma-separated list of cookies.  Since some
sites (the c|net sites come to mind) use commas in URLs, we would need to
protect the URL commas from interpretation.  This would add a little
complexity to URL-parsing.

Good point, my suggestion isn't necessary.

I do think it should be "may" so that browsers unable or unwilling to open
a second HTML-rendering window can feel perfectly comfortable ignoring the
commentURL.  (Hence the suggestion for both commentURL and comment.....)
