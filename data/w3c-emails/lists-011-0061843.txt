I disagree with this approach unless we make it legal to have
multiple Comment attributes within the same cookie (And I don't
think we really do want to do that.)  As discussed earlier, I think 
there is a definite value in being able to include a URI AND a 
comment "string".  Some browsers may support one and not the other, 
some groups may want to dynamically explain their cookies,
sending a user-specific comment string with each cookie, or who
knows... I don't think we should limit ourselves to having
one or the other.

(And Dave, I like the quoted notation for the URL's better than
<> as well.)
