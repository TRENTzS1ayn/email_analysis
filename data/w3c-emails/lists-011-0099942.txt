This issue has been discussed (but perhaps privately?)

The complaint from some parties was that the NAME=VALUE part of cookies, in
particular, can be (and already is) quite large.  So sending it twice, once
in Set-Cookie and once in Set-Cookie2 would incur a lot of network traffic.

I agree that sending a completely separate Set-Cookie2 header with its own
set of values would be much simpler.  But the network traffic that results
was deemed excessive.
