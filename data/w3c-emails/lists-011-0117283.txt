 A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
 Working Group of the IETF.                                                

       Title     : PEP: an Extension Mechanism for HTTP                    
       Author(s) : D. Connolly
       Filename  : draft-ietf-http-pep-02.txt

HTTP is an extensible protocol. PEP is an extension mechanism designed to 
address the tension between private agreement and public specification and 
to accommodate extension of HTTP clients and servers by software 
components.    

The PEP mechanism is to associate each extension with a URI, and 
use a few new header fields to carry the extension identifier and 
related information from HTTP clients, thru proxies and intermediaries, 
to servers, and back again.

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-pep-02.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.



Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
