Servers can already do this under the existing spec.  It is relatively easy
to build a `cookie-enabledness' detector by using redirection.

So I see no need to burden the protocol with yet another extension: this can
be solved with some clever CGI scripting.

The same goes for the CommentURL proposal that had been floating around in
another thread.  I don't think servers need hard-to-implement protocol
extensions if they want to tell their users about their privacy policy.  Why
not just put a link to your privacy policy on your company home page?
