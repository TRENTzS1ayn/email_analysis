This is a revised agenda for the HTTP working group.
Please note that for us to have a focussed discusion,
it is important that EVERYONE who attends have actually
reviewed the drafts. There are a LOT of drafts, so
please do not put off your reading until later.

Note that some items are intended for "last call"; this
means that if you have comments or objections, you should
state them NOW (don't wait until the meeting).

Keeping track of all of the items we're processing is
difficult. If I've left something out, please let me know.
