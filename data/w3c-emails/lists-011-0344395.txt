I proposed Safe to quicky solve a deployment problem for RFC2070.  It is a
bug fix, not a new feature.  If there had been more contacts between the
http-wg and the i18n group before both drafts went to last call, we would
not have had this deployment problem in the first place.

Please see my internet draft for a longer discussion of this issue.
