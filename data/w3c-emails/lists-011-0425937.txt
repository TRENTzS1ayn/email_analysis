Sorry, I'm not willing to entertain the idea of credentials and trusted parties
for this version of the spec.  Maybe it's reasonable for the future, but lacking a
complete description of the credentials infrastructure, your proposal isn't
practical now.

Perhaps, but you've only made reference to a now-non-existent facility.

I disagree that 7.1 eliminates persistent cookies.  The current wording is:
====
When the user agent terminates execution, it should let the user discard
all state information.  Alternatively, the user agent may ask the user
whether state information should be retained; the default should be
``no.''  If the user chooses to retain state information, it would be
restored the next time the user agent runs.
====
Note the wording:  "should *let*".  And "may ask".  The spec says the UA should
give the user the choice of what to do.  The default in the *dialog* should be
``no'' (i.e., did not retain).  I see no invisible control. (:-)
