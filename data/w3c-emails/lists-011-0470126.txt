        I concur. The technique outlined below will make the association
between the user's discarding the cookie and the app's probable failure in
the cookie's absence. The message would be similar to an "Authentication
Failed", "Document Returned No Data" or "No Response From Server",
indicating a C/S failure. The "CommentURL" field also being discussed would
be helpful as a supplement.
