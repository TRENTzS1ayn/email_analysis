'b.' seems to be the open to same kind of 'hammer the user until they
yield' abuse some servers use today against people who refuse cookies.  a. 
is fine. If 'b.' is allowed at all, it should be on a 'show this to me
ONCE per session' basis. It was *deliberate* that the option for silent
cookie refusals was added to the specs. This appears to be an attempt to
subvert the intent of the 'silent refusal' aspect of the spec.
