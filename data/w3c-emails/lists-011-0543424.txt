I don't see why it couldn't be:

    Cookie: $version=1

So there would only be 1 header to examine. But I don't think this is
necessary. As I said before, I think this is needless complexity for a
transition plan to save an arguably large/small amount of network traffic.

The server (read application author) burden in terms of the potential for
some client not correctly merging the two headers is quite high.
