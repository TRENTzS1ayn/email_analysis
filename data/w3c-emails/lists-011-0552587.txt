Nope .... well I wrote the question/proposal and there is no such intent
.... what the intent is is to build more robust www applications. I have
no objection when/if this written is spec. language that how the warning
is delivered would be a UI issue. The current spec. is long on telling the
client that they must give the user flexibility but really short on
helping the user understand the implications of that flexibility.

And frankly, I consider clients and servers peers. If the client user is
silly enough to keep going back to a site and refusing the cookie then I
don't see why they shouldn't keep getting warned. That is the cost of
using the server.
