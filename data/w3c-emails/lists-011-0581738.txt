  What the client knows may well depend on what the client is. If the
client is itself a large caching server, it does not know how long it will
be before the end user on whose behalf it is retrieving information will
ask for another object from the same server. An entirely different
question, to which it does not know the answer either, is how long it will
be before any of its clients ask it for material from the same server.
  However, even in the case where the client does not know these things, it
is quite conceivable that such a caching server will make use of its own
algorithm, based on things like time since last request for an object from
the server and round-trip time to the server, to work out how long it
wishes to retain an existing TCP connection, and that it will choose to
ignore any hints it may receive. And the information on which that decision
is based is very unlikely to be available to the server.
