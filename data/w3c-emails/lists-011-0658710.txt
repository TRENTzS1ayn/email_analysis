 A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
 Working Group of the IETF.                                                

       Title     : Simple Hit-Metering and Usage-Limiting for HTTP         
       Author(s) : J. Mogul, P. Leach
       Filename  : draft-ietf-http-hit-metering-02.txt
       Pages     : 34
       Date      : 03/26/1997

This document proposes a simple extension to HTTP, using a new ``Meter'' 
header, which permits a limited form of demographic information 
(colloquially called ``hit-counts'') to be reported by caches to origin 
servers, in a more efficient manner than the ``cache-busting'' techniques 
currently used.  It also permits an origin server to control the number of 
times a cache uses a cached response, and outlines a technique that origin 
servers can use to capture referral information without ``cache-busting.'' 

Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address.  After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
     "get draft-ietf-http-hit-metering-02.txt".
A URL for the Internet-Draft is:

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-hit-metering-02.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.



Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
