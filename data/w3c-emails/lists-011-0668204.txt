Thank you for restating what I had not stated clearly enough.  I am indeed
referring to a situation wherein the image will not yet exist if the client
requests it immediately upon parsing the HTML.

Interesting idea which should help with pipelined requests.  It does,
however, require invoking a second script on the server.  I want a single
response to send HTML, pause while the image is generated, and then send the
image.

I would not dream of suggesting that this idea be included in 1.1.
