 A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
 Working Group of the IETF.                                                

       Title     : HTTP Connection Management                              
       Author(s) : J. Gettys, A. Freier
       Filename  : draft-ietf-http-connection-00.txt
       Pages     : 13
       Date      : 03/26/1997

The HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2068) is silent about various details of 
TCP connection management when using persistent connections.  This document
discusses some of the implementation issues discussed during HTTP/1.1's 
design, and introduces a few new requirements on HTTP/1.1 implementations 
learned from implementation experience, not fully understood when RFC 2068 
was issued.  This is an initial draft for working group comment, and we 
expect further drafts.

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-connection-00.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.



Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
