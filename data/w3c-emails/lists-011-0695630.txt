I believe that some server implementations allow an "nph" script to
completely take over the connection.  In that case a single script
could handle a number of requests in one connection in the way you
want.  Personally, I have always considered this a security hole.  It
a allows a script to highjack the connection and pretend to be the
server for the duration of the connection without the real server
being aware of the transactions.  My guess is that this "feature" will
disappear from future versions of servers.
