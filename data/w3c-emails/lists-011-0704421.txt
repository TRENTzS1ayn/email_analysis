I hate to keep bringing up the same idea, but what do people
think about including an alternate URL, let's call it for now
a "NoCookieURL" that, if the cookie were rejected, would replace the
page that wouldn't work without the cookie.  There are some problems
there too, but then the user could customize the response returned
after a "required" (for the app to run) cookie was rejected?

(So, just to try and be clear, if a page was served with a cookie
and the cookie were refused, the user would instead see the page
at NoCookieURL.)

Same effect as NoCookie, but a little more customizable.
Perhaps if NoCookie had a value, it could be interpreted as a
URL, if not, it could signal one of the above mentioned errors...

Just a thought...
