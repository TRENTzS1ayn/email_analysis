   A question about auto-config:  under what circumstances does it come into play?  For
   example, suppose I start up a browser and it configures itself.  Then I fuss with
   the configuration, use the browser for awhile, then quit.  When I start it again, is
   the browser going to override the settings I put in place, or does it try to
   auto-config only if there are no other settings?

   If the browser only tries to configure itself if there are no pre-settings, there's
   another problem.  Suppose, given the scenario above, that I decide, for whatever
   reason, that I want no proxies.  When I exit and restart, will auto-config force a
   proxy on me again?

I think the answer should be that by default, a browser will try automatic
configuration, and if that fails will use no proxy.

However, the preferences of the program should allow you to tell it
to use something other than the default setting.  So you can either
choose a proxy manually or disable proxies.
