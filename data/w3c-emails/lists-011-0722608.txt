I think the default should be up to the client publisher. I would
recommend that once the user has manually altered setting, either those
setting persist or the user should be asked if the settings are temporary.

In the context of Netscape 3.0, the user has three proxy choices:
   1.  No
   2.  Manual ... which allows mix and match
   3.  PAC URL

The shipping default is NO proxy. I would expect that the new protocol
would either replace #3 or add a #4 and I would guess that the install
script would include an autoconfig option and either select #1 or #4 but
I mention these only to put in context the ID as I read it with how it
might be used. I don't see any need for the RFC which might result from
this dealing with how individual implementations might be seen by the
user except as setting the context for understanding the protocol.
