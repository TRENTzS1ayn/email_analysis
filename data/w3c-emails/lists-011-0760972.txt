Apparently, protocol working groups have the responsibility
to ensure that the agents that implement their protocols are
managable. There's an "application MIB" working group also
scheduled for IETF, and one of the issues is network management
of web servers. Perhaps things like proxy configurations and
the network management of clients are a good topic to raise
in that forum.
