A new Internet-Draft describing S-HTTP version 1.3 is available from the
on-line Internet-Drafts directory:     
    "The Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol" draft-ietf-wts-shttp-04.txt

It differs from the previous draft in that the revised specification takes
note of and is aligned with HTTP/1.1 (as per comments received during last
call). Specific changes made include:
    * Replaces previous use of application/http with message/http.
    * References HTTP/1.1's header syntax and BNF.
    * Removes HTTP-incompatible Content-Transfer-Encoding.
    * Is 'Host' and 'Connection' header aware.

Cheers,

-Allan
