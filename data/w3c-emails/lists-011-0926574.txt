Eek!  This is a completely new SHOULD as far as I can see.

I oppose adding this SHOULD because it leads to sub-optimal caching.  I
don't see any need to be compatible with the `Many HTTP/1.0 cache
implementations' the paragraph talks about.  I consider these `many
implementations' to be sub-optimal, because they should be using I-M-S to
revalidate the stale entry instead of just throwing it away.

Also, this new SHOULD contradicts the Expires section:

|14.21 Expires
|
|   The Expires entity-header field gives the date/time after which the
|   response should be considered stale. A stale cache entry may not
|   normally be returned by a cache (either a proxy cache or an user
|   agent cache) unless it is first validated with the origin server [...]
