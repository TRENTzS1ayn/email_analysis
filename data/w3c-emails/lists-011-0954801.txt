Actually, it is an old SHOULD that was discarded when the big caching
changes were made to Expires.  It reflects what was in HTTP/1.0.

The only way to obtain optimal caching is to use Cache-Control, or no
Expires at all.  This paragraph would only apply when it is clear that
an older, RFC 1945-compliant origin server is attempting to force proxies
not to cache a message.  The changes to Expires from RFC 1945 to 2068
removed those semantics, but in so doing created an incompatibility between
HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1, which by definition is an error in the new protocol.

The only significant effect on HTTP/1.1 caching will be the prevention of
caching messages from HTTP/1.0 servers that are clearly intended to not be
cachable.

>Also, this new SHOULD contradicts the Expires section:

That would be changed as well.
