I think that was a misinterpretation of something I didn't state very
clearly when I pulled together the document summary information.

What my summary meant was not specific initial feature tags, but the
description of the feature tag structure (name space and data types, etc.).
 This would include some of the material in sections 2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.8 of
your original draft.
