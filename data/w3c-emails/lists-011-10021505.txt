Folks,

Due to the large amount of spam hitting the http-wg mailing list, I propose to 
make it closed to postings from non-subscribers unless I hear objections to
the contrary.

What this will mean will be that if a posting arrives from an e-mail address
that isn't on a list of acceptable addresses, it will be sent to the list
administrator (me) instead of being sent to the list.  I will then either drop
it in the bit-bucket (for spam) or send a message to the poster telling them
how to post to a closed list (but see below).

The initial list of acceptable addresses are the addresses that you folks
originally subscribed to the http-wg list with.  If you want to know your
subscription address, just ask me.

What I can do to make this process a little less painful is to keep an
additional list of alternative posting addresses for people whose posting
addresses are always different from their subscription address.

For a _small_ while (like about a week or so), I'll attempt to augment this
additional list based on the messages that I see bouncing, and then re-submit
the bounced message to the list.

After that time, you can either unsubscribe and re-subscribe to the list from
your new posting address, or you can send me personal e-mail and ask for an
alternative posting address to be added for you.

Questions, comments, objections... feel free to e-mail me.

(The above functionality assumes that I can get Procmail/SmartList to work as
advertised.  If it fails, all bets are off and we can all suffer spam.)
