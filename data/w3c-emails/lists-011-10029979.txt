I prefer STRONGLY that you keep the function of being added to the
additional list as a permanent service.

You may even consider automating it :-)

There are all sorts of reasons why people post from addresses other
than their listed address, including:

- Subaddressing (the + convention)
- Travelling
- Multiple accounts
- Broken mailers that include hostname of workstation

And so on.
Apart from that, I have no objections, just a sad feeling :-(
