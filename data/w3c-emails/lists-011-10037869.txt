Maybe i wasn't too clear.

You can send me an e-mail at any time to have additional posting addresses
added.  The service I was offering for a week or so was noticing failed
postings and auto-adding the posters e-mail address to the additional posting
address list.

I don't have the time nor the energy to do this for a longer period.  ;-)
