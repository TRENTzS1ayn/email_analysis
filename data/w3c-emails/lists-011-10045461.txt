Hi Ted,

Before you start editing, here is the reasoning behind the current
structure of the draft.  

For section 3, the entire structure, and much of the wording, was
lifted from the MIME registration document (RFC 2048), and you should
definately look at that document before you start taking section 3
apart.  

Sections 2.[123] explain feature tags to end users, and give some
guidelines on the appropriate use of feature tags by negotiation
protocols.  Note that there is no reference to a specific negotiation
protocol in the draft.  If there were, that reference could replace
the explanations in sections 2.[123], but there is no such reference.
The draft creates a shared namespace for potentially many
protocols/mechanisms without mentioning a single specific protocol or
mechanism.  This is a strange thing to do, but it certainly guarantees
the desired decoupling between revising registration procedures and
revising specific protocols. 

Koen.
