  The third HTTP/1.1 Multi-Vendor Internet Test Day is Oct 30.

  If you plan to participate, please register by filling out the
  survey form at the end of this mail, and sending it to
  'httptest@agranat.com' by your close of business on Tuesday, Oct 28.
  I will combine them and forward them as a single mailing on
  Wednesday to all who signed up.  If you will have multiple instances
  of the same implementation and configuration active, send that as
  one registration; if you will have different implementations or
  configurations active please send those separately so that it is
  clear just what each active system should be.

  All are welcome, including 1.0 implementations (testing backward
  compatibility is important too).

  If you participated in either of the first two days and would like
  me to just resend that information, just let me know.

  Test Day Ground Rules:

    - Participating systems may be configured to allow access only by
      announced participants for that week (if you will be using a
      dynamically assigned IP address, indicate this and try to
      specify the range from which it will be chosen).

    - Participants will, on request, make a reasonable effort to
      provide whatever relevant log or trace data they have to other
      participants to resolve problems.

    - If a problem or possible issue with another participant
      implementation is found, that issue will be communicated to the
      contact for that implementation promptly.  Only if the
      involved participants disagree on the correct behavior or if
      the involved participants agree to do so will the issue be
      brought to the working group mailing list.

    - Any other disclosure of problems found with other
      implementations during these tests is poor form.

    - Communicating positive results to other participants is
      strongly encouraged.

  Additional suggestions welcome.
