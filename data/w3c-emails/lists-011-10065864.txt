A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

Title: HTTP State Management Mechanism (Rev1)
Author(s): D. Kristol, L. Montulli
Filename: draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-04.txt,.ps
Pages: 19
Date: 27-Oct-97

This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with HTTP
requests and responses.  It describes two new headers, Cookie and Set-
Cookie2, which carry state information between participating origin
servers and user agents.  The method described here differs from
Netscape's Cookie proposal, but it can interoperate with HTTP/1.0 user
agents that use Netscape's method.  (See the HISTORICAL section.)

This document reflects implementation experience with RFC 2109 and
obsoletes it.

NOTE: 

     Discussion of State Management in the HTTP Working Group has
     stalled because the issues of the basic functioning of the
     protocol were intertwined with concerns about the nature of
     the restrictions placed on it to ensure user privacy.  At the
     request of the Working Group chair, the discussion of protocol
     restrictions for user privacy has been temporarily removed
     from this draft, in order to focus the discussion on the basic
     protocol elements.  Any Internet Standard for State Management
     must address security and privacy issues.

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.

Send a message to:mailserv@ds.internic.net.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-04.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
