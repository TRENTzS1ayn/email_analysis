It is a hell of a lot easier to just define a multiplexing wrapper
for HTTP/1.x messages and use the Upgrade header field to initiate
the wrapper on the first (normal) request.  Performing contortions
within the scope HTTP/1.x is a waste of energy, since the result is
no more compatible with HTTP/1.x than just doing it the right way.
