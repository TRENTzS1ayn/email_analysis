Here is a question arising from the interoperability test.

If a server receives a byte range requests for a 100 byte file like

a)   Range: bytes = 0-10, 130-140
or
b)   Range: bytes = 30-20
or
c)   Range: bytes = 0-10, 30-20, 40-50


what is the correct response?  

In case a) one of the two ranges is invalid, but the spec says send
a 416 only if *all* are invalid.  If the valid ones are returned with
a 206 then there is no way to signal an error.  

In case b) the spec says

            If the last-byte-pos value is present, it must be greater
            than or equal to the first-byte-pos in that byte-range-spec,
            or the byte-range-spec is invalid. The recipient of an
            invalid byte-range-spec must ignore it.

If the server ignores it then it should send what?

Case c) is like b) except it is possible to send the valid ranges.
