And another one I forgot:

rom section 14.17
            A server sending a response with status code 416 (Requested
            range  not valid) SHOULD include a Content-range field with
            a content-range-spec of "*".

What is the purpos of this?

BUT 10.4.17 says about status 416:

            When this status code is returned for a byte-range request,
            the response MUST include a Content-Range entity-header
            field specifying the current length of the selected resource
            (see section 14.17).

I don't think '*' specifies the length. On the other hand I see no
way to make a Content-Range header which would be legal and would 
specify the length.

Maybe what is needed is to allow something like 

   Content-Range: bytes *-*/200

when an illegal range (like 300-400) has been requested from a 200
byte file.
