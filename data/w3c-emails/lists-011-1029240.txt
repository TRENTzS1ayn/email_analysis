I don't think it's too late. It is essential that there be some such
address, and "webmaster" certainly seems to bve the logical choice.
Unfortunately, the term  "webmaster" has been coopted (too strong a word?)
to refer to HTML authors and web page designers. Even so, I don't think it
would be overly confusing to use "webmaster" in way you suggest. A
secondary problem is that many people maintain multiple webs on the same
system (e.g., ISPs that provide web hosting) without having a separate
domain. Typically, this results in URLs like

http://www.whatever.com/~whoever/

I'm not sure how to handle this situation.

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come
up with a better one.
