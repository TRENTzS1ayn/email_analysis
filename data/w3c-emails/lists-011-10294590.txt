  I got this forwarded thorugh a couple of hops.

  There has been some discussion on the IETF http-wg list of setting
  up a face to face HTTP/1.1 testing session; perhaps this is a good
  venue for that.

  Please direct any questions to "cthon@sun.com".

Plans for Connectathon 98 are already under way!  The 12th annual
Connectathon event, an interoperability testing event for engineers
only, will be held March 4-12, 1998, in San Jose, California.
Connectathon, sponsored by Sun Microsystems, Inc., hosts over 30
companies annually in an effort to test and debug source code which
utilize the following technologies and protocols:

NFS and WebNFS
PPP
DHCP
Service Location Protocol
NIS/NIS+
TI-RPC
Automounter

Based on demand, in addition we are considering to offer:

IPv6
LDAP
HTTP

If you are interested in testing IPv6, LDAP or HTTP, please send a note
to Cthon@Sun.COM and we'll gauge interest.  Or if you have a suggestion
for another technology, feel free to contact us as well.

Testing continues 24 hours per day.  Technology testing coordinators
will organize testing procedures and test suite material.  In addition,
there will be seminars with speakers addressing various topics.

The registration deadline is February 1, 1998.  For a registration
packet, please send complete address and fax number to Cthon@Sun.COM, or
if you have any questions, please feel free to contact Audrey Van
Belleghem at (408) 358-9598.  For more information about Connectathon,
we will be updating our web site continually at
http://www.sun.com/sunsoft/connectathon.

We look forward to seeing you at the 12th annual Connectathon event!
