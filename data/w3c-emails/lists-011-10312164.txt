I want to put in a few good words for the ongoing HTTP/1.1
interoperabiity testing and to encourage others to participate.  (But
first, thanks to Scott Lawrence for organizing it.)  If you haven't
signed up to participate, you may not even realize it's going on.

The testing of my server (mostly by Ronald Tschalaer, my chief bug
finder :-) has turned up a couple of bugs in my server, which I have
fixed.  It also led to the recent discussions about Range and
Content-Range, because we determined that the words there needed to be
clarified.

So let me others to sign up next week, when Scott sends out his next
solicitation, in the interests of a clearer HTTP/1.1 specification and
a higher degree of interoperation.

P.S.  You are welcome to poke at my server at
