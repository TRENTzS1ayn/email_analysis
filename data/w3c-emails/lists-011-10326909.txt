The request for the second slot is awaiting the approval of the
area directors. Probably also the arrival of 4 hours of agenda.

I believe we will have ample agenda items to close out HTTP/1.1,
especially if more issues arise during interoperability testing.

In particular, the 'documentation of interoperable implementations'
will probably require more time than is available if we go feature-by-feature,
although some of that can happen outside official meeting time.
