There has been no substantive discussion about Stage Management
since release of the -04 draft, because all of the bugs in the current
RFC were fixed in the -03 draft and consensus had been reached on the
technical issues, *and* because the few paragraphs that commented on
privacy issues were nothing more than advice to implementors, and also
were fine as they stood.  I realized you were asked by the Chair to
do this, but it appears, in fact, simply to have stalled progress.
Can it now be put back together again, and move on to Draft Standard
status?
