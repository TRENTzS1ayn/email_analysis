I was pondering this the other day. It occurred to me that it would be sensible
to be able to ask a web server who the webmaster was for a particular URL.

Then all such problems could be solved by careful configuration.

I guess that would need a new method - which could return other stuff that is
not normally of interest to the client. "INFO <url>", perhaps?

This may be related to the WEBDAV work that's going on at the moment.

Cheers,

Ben.
