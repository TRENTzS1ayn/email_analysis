Here is the slight wording change by Jeff to close out the comments
raised on the text in Rev-00 by Klaus Weide in:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1997q3/0493.html

I'll be incorporating them in Rev01, which I'm working on now.

            If an implementation receives a response with a warning-
            value that includes a warn-date, and that warn-date is
            different from the Date value in the response, then that

            storing, forwarding, or using it.  If all of the warning-
