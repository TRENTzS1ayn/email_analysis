The consensus from our lunch meeting was that
as long as proxies upgrade all requests to the proxy's
highest version number, then the re-version issue
could stay as it is.
Response version is the servers highest version,
 not the message version.

While the message version would have merit,
 it seems that people felt that at this point
 we couldnt justify changing it.

The only remaining fringe case which I can
think of where there may be problems are
with the example of the chunked post. 
I dont think we can solve that easily.

I propose an edit like this in the version clauses.

"Proxy servers MUST upgrade all requests to the highest
version supported by the proxy"
