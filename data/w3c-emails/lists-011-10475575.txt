>Is this a different model for 'alternates'?

No.  It is limited to media types and the syntax isn't even capable
of handling media types with quoted parameters (which is why I introduced
the braces notation).  Even if it didn't have those limitations, the
overhead of multipart/alternative is an order of magnitude greater
than an Alternates with the same expressive power.
