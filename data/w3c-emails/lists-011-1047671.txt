I guess the question is, does postmaster refer to the
domain or the server machine.
I think reality wise, postmaster refers to the server most often.
(ie sendmail can only direct stuff to postmaster for mail it receives,
 not that the domain receives... )
So, I think its appropriate that a host running a WWW server must
have a webmaster address, which goes to the system maintainer,
who can then refer it to the appropriate content author.
Keep in mind that the message to webmaster may not be a content issue,
it may be about a server misconfiguration.  In the example you mention
it's usually the same server for all users, and often for all domains
served by that system..
