There's also the sentence

If none of the entity tags match, or if "*" is given and no
current
   entity exists, then the server MAY perform the requested method as if
   the If-None-Match header field did not exist.

Which is what I was referring to when I mentioned treating the
header as if it didn't exist. I like your proposed alterations, we just
need to strike this sentence too.
