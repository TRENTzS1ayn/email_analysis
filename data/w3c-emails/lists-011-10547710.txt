  I think that there is no reason to allow for multiple sets of
  credentials; it doesn't really add any usefull feature I can think
  of, and introduces a number of other possible errors (what if one
  set is ok and another is not?).

  I don't think that there is any interoperability reason why you
  should not send unsolicited credentials (that is, I don't think that
  it breaks the protocol itself to do so), but it makes no sense from
  a security point of view:

  - With Basic all you're doing is publishing your password to someone
    who may not need it or have any reason to get it (which is what
    you're doing every time you use Basic anyway...)

  - With Digest you can't generate valid credentials without the nonce
    from the challenge anyway.
