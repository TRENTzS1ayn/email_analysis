I agree that you dont generally send unsolicited credentials, but
the context isnt necessarily clear.  If you are challenged for credentials
initially, but a long while later (potentially hours) in the same
browser session, you might send those same credentials again
in a later transaction.  One could argue that this
would be unsolicited, since its possible for those
credentials to be invalid at the later time.
