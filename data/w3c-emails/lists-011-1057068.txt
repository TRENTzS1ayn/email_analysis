Right. There i a distinction between content issues (broken links, etc.) 
and server issues and sometimes people will be sending mail rtegarding one
or the other. My solution is to set up webmaster@wnetc.com, and almost all
mail I receive pertains to issues I can handle. If necessary, I can
forward it on. I suspect tht most people visiting the site won't know the
difference between a broken CGI or an errant redirect (things I can
address directly) on the one hand, and DNS or connectivity routing issues
on the other.

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come
up with a better one.
