Without advocating a particular position, I would like to note that
one of the 'justifications' for byte ranges was the ability to
continue retrieving a previously interrupted response. In that mode,
if I were the developer of the client, I would want the byte range
to apply to the compressed form.

In the usage associated with partial retrieval of structured data such as
a PDF file, I'd want the byte ranges to apply to the uncompressed 
resource.

It would be helpful to know what actual use is being made of byte ranges.
