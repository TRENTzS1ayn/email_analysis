I have said before that the reason there is both a Content-Encoding
and a Transfer-Encoding is that the former is a property of the
resource and the latter is a transmission issue.  The reason I say
this is because the other metadata describing the entity always
describes the entity-body as whole, e.g.,

   Content-Encoding( Content-Type( data ) )

so that things like Content-MD5 and Range requests apply to the whole.

The compressed form.

This would assume the part of the server performing the range
has access to the non-compressed data, which is false.
