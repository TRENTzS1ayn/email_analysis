Well, for what it's worth, I'm seeing quite a few 206's in my access 
logs, mostly due to Netscape clients resuming interrupted retrievals 
of GIF files. The files aren't compressed on disk, but byte range 
requests certainly are being used.

Without advocating a particular position, I would like to note that
one of the 'justifications' for byte ranges was the ability to
continue retrieving a previously interrupted response. In that mode,
if I were the developer of the client, I would want the byte range
to apply to the compressed form.

In the usage associated with partial retrieval of structured data such 
as
a PDF file, I'd want the byte ranges to apply to the uncompressed
resource.

It would be helpful to know what actual use is being made of byte 
ranges.
