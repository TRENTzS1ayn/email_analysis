That should be done in the abstract (and it is, as I recall).
I think the draft should contain exactly what the final RFC will
contain, aside from the Status section and Header/Footer.

I don't know what to suggest.  What happens when a cookie includes an IPv6
address (or is that even possible)?

Terms, yes -- algorithms, no.  The hostname dot comparison doesn't make
any sense without the context for why the hostname dot comparison exists.

I should have also mentioned that I was reading it from that view.
I like implementation advice, but it needs to be clear what the
protocol requirements are as opposed to how one might use them.
A proposed standard needs to define the interface and avoid defining
the application.

It is in the EBNF defined by the drums WG.  I tried to avoid such implied
things in the HTTP specs, though I note that a few are in RFC 2068.
So, I suppose you are correct.  I'm just one of those programmers who
likes to put parentheses around conditions, I guess.

Nope, from very painful man-page-writing experience.  I suggest line breaks.
