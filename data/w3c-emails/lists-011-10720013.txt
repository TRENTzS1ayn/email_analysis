I am *assuming* that your reference to 'transfer-encoding' maps to MIME
'content-transfer-encoding'.  If this assumption is false, please ignore
this comment...

The MIME specification STRONGLY discourages (its capitals) the creation of
new content-transfer-encoding values.  I would think that this would
encourage designers to try and shoehorn transfer-encoding semantics into
content-coding headers.
