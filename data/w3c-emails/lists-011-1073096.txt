I believe that 

ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-crocker-stdaddr-02.txt

is in (or has passed) "last call" as a "Best Current Practice":

> This specification enumerates and describes Internet mail
> addresses (mailbox name @ host reference) to be used when
> contacting personnel at an organization.  Mailbox names are
> provided for both operations and business functions.  Additional
> mailbox names and aliases are not prohibited, but organizations
> which support email exchanges with the Internet are encouraged to
> support AT LEAST each mailbox name for which the associated
> function exists within the organization.

and it includes a recommendation for "webmaster@site".

In any case, this level of site management is not in scope
for HTTP-WG.

Thanks,

Larry
