While reading through the latest HTTP draft, I was dismayed to find several 
new status codes, since the WebDAV protocol specification is also 
introducing new status codes.  While I respect the right of the HTTP WG to 
define whatever HTTP status codes they need (the WebDAV specification will 
work around them), I thought it would be worthwhile to state which status 
codes WebDAV is planning on introducing, so that other HTTP extension 
efforts will be sure to steer clear of them.

102 Processing

207 Multi-Status

418 Unprocessable Entity
419 Insufficient Space on Resource
420 Method Failure
421 Destination Locked

Complete details on the sematics of all these status codes can be found in 
the next version of the WebDAV protocol specification, which will be 
available RSN, depending on the I-D submission crunch.
