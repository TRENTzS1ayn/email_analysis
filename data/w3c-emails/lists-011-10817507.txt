A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

Title: The Alternates Header Field
Author(s): T. Hardie, K. Holtman, A. Mutz
Filename: draft-ietf-http-alternates-01.txt
Pages: 11
Date: 13-Nov-97

   This document proposes a header, Alternates, which is intended
   to provide a common method for Internet-based application
   protocols to indicate that a particular resource exists in
   multiple forms. The Alternates header provides a
   machine-readable indication of the bases on which the
   different forms vary and how the the recipient of the header
   can select among them.

Send a message to:mailserv@ds.internic.net.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-alternates-01.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
