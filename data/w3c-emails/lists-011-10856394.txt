The proposed resolution has been to Proxy can add the domain name
but not change it if it is already present. 

Here is the proposed change to close out the HOST issue. 

Additional clarification paragraph to section 3.2.2:

"If a proxy recieves a host name which is not a fully qualified domain name,
it MAY add its domain to the host name it recieved.  If a proxy recieves
a fully qualified domain name, the proxy MUST NOT change the host name."
