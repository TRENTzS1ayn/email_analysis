There are two reasons why you can't substitute one for the other:

1) They don't have the same scope - one is end-to-end and the other is
hop-by-hop. As the message length changes, it can only be used through
proxies that know about that particular encoding. In other words: the
stupidest link in the chain decides the encoding.

2) A client can't say that it "accepts" transfer codings, so there is no
way to introduce the funkyflate compression. Currently, the only way is to
use Accept-Encoding. I would actually vote for having a Accept-Transfer
header field - this would also make the handling of trailers much easier.

I think you need both - the real problem is the separation of content
encoding and content type.
