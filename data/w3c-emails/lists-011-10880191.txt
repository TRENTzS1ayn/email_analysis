  I second Roys comment on the beginning of section 4:

  That whole statement could just be cut without detracting from the
  spec.  CGI is irrelevant - almost all server implementations provide
  other mechanisms for programatic access and the state management
  mechanisms apply to them all equally (whether they are "more
  sophisticated" or not).

  Why not just make the syntax for 'value':

 value           =       token | quoted-string

  I don't see any use for the 'word' token (and the name 'word' is
  misleading because it isn't a word in the normal english usage).

  ... and between the "=" and the value?

  There should just be a reference to the general rule for implied
  whitespace in HTTP header parsing (section 2.1 in RFC2068).
