Not presently, there is a 305 and maybe 306 redirect which may
allow this functionality to be discussed at memphis.
Current implementations do not allow this.
A workaround is using a Proxy Auto Config file, where
you specify a failover, that way if the proxy is unavailable,
the client will go direct. ( assuming the network allows it )

Yes, the 407  Proxy Authentication Required response is used.

For a busy server, it generally makes sense for it to cache
if it has to retreive it anyway.  Of course, we're assuming
the object isnt already in the cache-- if it is, then the
proxy can potentially return it from the cache.

The biggest cost for a proxy is the origin retreive (contacting 
the web server ), writing a cache file is much cheaper.
In addition, by caching it, if there is a request for the
same object, the proxy can then return it from the cache 
next time, which helps the proxy a great deal.

I think in a worst case scenario, it would be O.K. for the
proxy to act such that:
"I am too busy to go to the far away web server for you, but
Ill give you what I have in my cache, even though its out of date".
The client can accept that or attempt to go direct.
