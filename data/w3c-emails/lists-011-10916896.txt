Okay.

I suspect no one sends IPv6 addresses in cookies now, and probably no
user agents would know what to do with them.  But I thought the spec.
should allow them.

Last I looked (some time ago), the proposed text representation of IPv6
addresses involved ':' separators, and I think they will pose problems
for the URL syntax.  But that syntax shouldn't pose a problem in the
context of the cookie spec.

I think you and I will have to disagree here.  I'm trying to define
a term, "domain match", and it can't be done without describing the
algorithm.  And I do give a sense of context:  "[s]ometimes we
compare one host name with another."

I've looked over section 4.2.1 particularly, but I'm not sure how you
would want me to recast it.  I don't believe I'm defining the
application, although I'm certainly describing the things an
application can/should/must do.  I prefer the application-centric
approach; too often I see specs. that describe all the things a
protocol can do, but I haven't a clue which ones I need to use.
