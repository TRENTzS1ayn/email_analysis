Ok, here's a closer stab on wording, in section 3.1 HTTP version

Old text:

Requests with a version lower than that of the proxy/gateway's version MAY 
be upgraded before being forwarded; the proxy/gateway's response to that 
request MUST be in the same major version as the request.

New text:

Due to interoperability problems with HTTP/1.0 proxies discovered since 
the publication of RFC 2068, caching proxies MUST, gateways MAY, and tunnels 
MUST NOT upgrade the request to the highest version they support. The proxy 
or gateway's response to a request MUST be in the same major version as 
the request.
