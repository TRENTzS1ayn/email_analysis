Thanks very much for your help.

A very busy proxy is in a state resembling deadlock.  It should not
accept any new TCP connections, because it will not be able to serve
them anyway.  It might want to remember the request and fetch it later
from the origin server.  It should be able to communicate to the
client to leave it alone.

The response "I will not cache this" might be useful if a user agent
is trying to place some information in a cache.  Also, if a user agent
does not follow exclusion standards, the proxy will take the blame.
It might be useful to answer "I will not fetch this for you" to
bothersome user agents.
