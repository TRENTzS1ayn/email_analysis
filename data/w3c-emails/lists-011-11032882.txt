I have promissed Jim to reach closure on this.

I do not believe that the discussion has brought any need for changed
wording regading content-codings vs transfer-codings.

However, it has shown a need for better support for transfer-codings, which
is the reason for the Accept-Transfer header proposal [1] and the changed
wordings for Transfer codings [2]. So please review these proposals
Accept-Transfer proposal ASAP.

Thanks,

Henrik
