I don't think this exception is necessary.  As far as I know, none of the
existing HTTP/1.1 servers put anything in the trailer yet.

Likewise, that is unnecessary.  We can live with the discrepancy between
RFC 2068 and now, since nobody uses these features yet.  Somebody should
correct me if I'm wrong [and they do care].
