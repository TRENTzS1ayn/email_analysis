Henrik's proposal includes:

    The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry for
    transfer-coding value tokens. Initially, the registry contains the
    following tokens: "chunked" (section 3.6.1) and "identity" (section 3.6.2).
    
Since we got into this partly because of the Range+compression question,
I suggest that this paragraph should read:

    The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry
    for transfer-coding value tokens. Initially, the registry contains
    the following tokens: "chunked" (section 3.6.1), "identity"
    (section 3.6.2), "gzip" (section 3.5), "compress" (section 3.5),
    and "deflate" (section 3.5).
