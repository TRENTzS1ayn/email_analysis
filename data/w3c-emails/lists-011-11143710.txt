Shouldn't that be:

       Accept-Transfer  = "Accept-Transfer" ":"
                           #( t-codings [ ";" "q" "=" qvalue ] )

since one of your examples is:

       Accept-Transfer:

(I know, I made the same mistake for Accept-Encoding in rev-00.)

Also, since (as Roy has pointed out) the requirement for protecting
Accept-Transfer with Connection makes requests somewhat verbose,
perhaps we should be using a shorter name ... "Accept-Trans"
would save 6 bytes per request.  

I'm not even sure this header should be called "Accept-anything",
since it's a hop-by-hop mechanism and thus pretty much orthogonal
to content negotiation.  Maybe "OK-Trans" (saving another 8 bytes
per request)?  It's not as if any human being is supposed to be
reading these headers.

P.S.: OK, I *do* include HTTP implementors in the set of human
beings :-)
