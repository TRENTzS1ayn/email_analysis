THE UNICODE STANDARD

The Unicode Standard is a 16-bit character encoding encompassing the 
world's principal scripts which provides the foundation for the 
internationalization and localization of software.  With its simple 
and efficient approach to special and modified characters, the Unicode 
Standard defines a new degree of data portability between platforms 
and across borders.  Software (especially modern, distributed systems) 
can be adapted for particular countries far more easily than when 
existing character sets are used.  The Unicode Standard is code-for-
code identical to the International Standard ISO/IEC 10646.

For further information on the Unicode Standard, visit the Unicode Web 
site at <http://www.unicode.org> or e-mail <unicode-inc@unicode.org>.
