No flames, but here is some gasoline for ya.

Yes.  The same thing can be (IMHO) more easily accomplished as

    Connection: deflate
    Deflate: --best

(or whatever options might be desired).  The sender would still be in
control, of course, but this is far more informative than a qvalue.

BTW, "compress" is a dead encoding -- it has no reliable definition
other than "that thing you get when you run compress on Unix."
Likewise, "deflate" obsoletes "gzip".  In fact, it would probably
be sensible to go back and remove "gzip" and "compress" and simply
standardize on "deflate", "x-gzip", and "x-compress" (plus whatever
new encodings come out down the road).
   
BTW BTW, the reason for this rapid-fire set of responses today is
that I am about to go off-line for a while so that I can get some
real work done.   Two conference deadlines on Dec 1 and a UCI
research dealine on Dec 12 can't coexist with standards discussions.
