We're trying to pipeline getting the resolution of issues into
the draft; Jim Gettys is editing the proposed resolution into
the draft even though we're only now doing "LAST CALL".

LAST CALL:

        PROTECTION_SPACE
        CONTRADICTION
        BYTERANGE_SYNTAX
        RE-VERSION
        HOST
        OPTIONS
        DIGEST_SYNTAX

The OPTIONS resolution in the draft will clarify the base
specification; however, the issue will remain 'open'.

Reclassified from editorial to technical issue:
        RANGE_WITH_CONTENTCODING

Closed issues:
        AUTH-CHUNKED
        REQUIRE-DIGEST
