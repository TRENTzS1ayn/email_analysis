Please note that in addition to the HTTP working group meeting,
there is a two hour BOF on content negotiation.

Currently HTTP has only one two-hour session allocated. I have
asked for a second session. This is intended to be the LAST
MEETING of the HTTP working group.

Agenda items:
1. Jim Gettys:   review draft & discuss open issues
2. Dave Kristol: state management
3. Scott Lawrence: Options & PEP
4. Review of other drafts

Available time will be split up among the issues.

I would like to arrange a smaller meeting with individuals
who are willing to go through the draft and identify whether
their implementation has been tested for interoperability with
an independent implementation, for each and every feature of
HTTP/1.1. 

This effort will probably take a couple of hours if we move
quickly; please let me know if you're available during the
IETF week, and, if so, when. (A thorough review of the draft
which identifies which features you DO NOT implement or HAVE
NOT tested against other implementations would be useful preparation.)


Larry
