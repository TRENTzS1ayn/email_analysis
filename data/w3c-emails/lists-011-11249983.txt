Jim,

The descriptions of Content-Length in rev-00 are slightly out of sync. I
propose two small changes to 4.4 and 14.14:

Section 4.4

- If a Content-Length header field (section 14.14) is present,
  its value in bytes represents the length of the message-body.

should say

- If a Content-Length header field (section 14.14) is present,
  its decimal value in OCTETs represents the length of the
  message-body.

Later in 4.4

When a Content-Length is given in a message where a message-body
is allowed, its field value MUST exactly match the number of
OCTETs in the message-body. HTTP/1.1 user agents MUST notify
the user when an invalid length is received and detected.

10.2.7

- Either a Content-Range header field (section 14.17)
indicating the range included with this response, or a
multipart/byteranges Content-Type including Content-Range
fields for each part. If multipart/byteranges is not used,
the Content-Length header field in the response MUST match
the actual number of OCTETs transmitted in the message-body.

14.14

The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of
the message-body, in decimal number of octets, sent to the
recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of
the entity-body that would have been sent had the request
been a GET.

should say

The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of
the message-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the
recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of
the entity-body that would have been sent had the request
been a GET.
