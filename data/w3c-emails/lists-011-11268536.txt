I wouldn't say that - for small files of often used media types (HTML, XML,
SGML, for example), it may make a lot of sense to have pregenerated
dictionaries. Jim and I talked to Mark Adler and Jean-loup Gailly during
our performance testing but didn't have time to try it out.

If the dictionary was a resource in itself, it would work fine. Deflate
uses a Adler32 hash to name the dictionary. Depending on how good the hash
is (I don't know), it may be used as a location indendent identifier in
itself or by hashing it again using some stronger hash algorithm.

You have a good point - and we actually already have the BNF for
generalized parameters from the Accept header and the Content-Type header
fields.

However, it introduces the problem of separating extension parameters in
Accept-TE from extension parameters in transfer-codings just like is
currently the case with Accept (see 14.1):

Note: Use of the "q" parameter name to separate media
type parameters from Accept extension parameters is
due to historical practice.  Although this prevents
any media type parameter named "q" from being used
with a media range, such an event is believed to be
unlikely given the lack of any "q" parameters in the
IANA media type registry and the rare usage of any
media type parameters in Accept. Future media types
should be discouraged from registering any parameter
named "q".

Are people willing to live with that?
