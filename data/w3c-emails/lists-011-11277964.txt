"accept-" request headers are handled specially by the 'vary'
header response. Since this doesn't apply end-to-end and might
be introduced by an intermediate, I don't think that it should
be called "Accept-" anything. Roy's suggestion of making this
an option to 'Connection' might be reasonable, but I'm suspicious
of adding this last-minute feature into a Draft Standard.

Is there some way that having compression transfer encodings
as opposed to compression content-encodings could be
handled outside of the main HTTP draft, and moved forward
as a separate Proposed (or even Experimental) standard?
