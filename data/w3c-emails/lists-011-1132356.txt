I will try to get an updated issues list done before the end of the
week, but an unanticipated April Fools joke has slowed me down.

New England just had a blizzard, which has cost me a couple days of time
this week (biggest storm since the blizzard of 1978).  It was quite
spectacular (I measured 26" of snow on the deck behind my house; the
whole area got between 24" and 33" of snow.
