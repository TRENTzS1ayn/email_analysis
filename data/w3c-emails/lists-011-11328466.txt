The purpose of the Trailer header field is to provide a general mechanism
describing where headers are in a message, so that it doesn't have to be on
a case by case basis (see also description of problem [1]).

The notion "Only put fileds in the trailer that can be safely ignored by the
client (e.g., Last-Modified)" doesn't really say much as it depends on who
you are (as a client) and what you are doing.

The combination of Accept-TE and Trailer allows the server to put headers
in the trailer and the client to say no thanks.
