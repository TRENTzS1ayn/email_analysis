??  In ther last version I saw, Vary did not treat any field as
special.

I feel that making a clean separation between content and transfer
compression is a cleanup we should have made a long time ago, and on
that grounds I think it is reasonable to add it as a last-minute
feature.  

It is not really critical whether it is called Accept- or connection:
something.  I like the connection alternative slightly better.  And no
gunky parameters about compression quality or dictionaries please --
adding these would take the whole thing way beyond a 1.1 cleanup, and
how are we ever going to claim two independent implementations for
such things if we add them?
