Sorry, but I find these paragraphs very confusing and, possibly,
contradictory.  According to (3), an empty Accept-TE allows only
"identity".  According to (4), "chunked" is always acceptable.  Which is
right?

Also, in these (earlier) examples of Accept-TE:
       Accept-TE: deflate
       Accept-TE:
       Accept-TE: chunk=1.0; deflate=0.5

Is "chunk" a hypothetical new TE, or is it a misspelling of "chunked",
in which case it's invalid (because "chunked" can't take a parameter)? 
And, syntactically don't those have to be
       Accept-TE: chunk;q=1.0; deflate;q=0.5
?
