They are indeed - must have been eating something bad. I think this is better:

3. The "identity" transfer-coding is always acceptable, unless specifically
refused because the Accept-TE field includes "identity;q=0". The "chunked"
transfer-coding is always acceptable. The Trailer header field (section
14.Y) can be used to indicate the set of header fields included in the
trailer.

4. If the Accept-TE field-value is empty, only the "identity" and the
"chunked" transfer-codings are acceptable.

Sorry, it should have been

        Accept-TE: chunked; deflate;q=0.5

meaning that the client accepts any allowed header to occur in the trailer
of a chunked encoded message and is somewhat happy to accept deflate.

Thanks!
