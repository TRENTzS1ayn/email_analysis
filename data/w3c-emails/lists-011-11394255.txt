Transfer encoding is one of the "big wins" possible in HTTP/1.1; our
tests showed substantial improvements both in elapsed time for end users,
and in bandwidth on the net.

So lets get closure on the technical solution right now,
independently of the implementation question for draft standard.
(Though I would hope we could keep the idea of undocking it in mind).

Getting two interoperable implementations isn't that hard a test to meet,
even in a month (where did you get that date from, anyway?, though I'm
even more anxious to be done than you are).  We could even do that here
at W3C if we had to do so to meet the implementation requirements
(used to be a cheat when Anselm was sharing an office with Henrik, but
it wouldn't be now).

This isn't the only place where we have implementation issues to
deal with (e.g. 305/306, which needs help, and for which I know of no
implementations).  Ari promised to pick it up from Josh and try to
get something done this week on that one (which we may also want/need to
undock).

So lets keep focussed on solving the technical problems; there are
VERY few of them left (my last count was 7 outstanding technical issues,
most of which are well on their way to closure, I believe).
