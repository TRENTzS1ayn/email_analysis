As promised, here is a description of our proposal to amend RFC2109
to allow certification of unverifiable transactions.

I have two questions in particular regarding this proposal:

1)  Should "certified" cookies be a third! type of cookie header
[this is what we have written in the proposal] or can we
incorporate the certificate as an option in the SetCookie2 header?

2) Can we include this in the next version of RFC2109 or must it be a
separate RFC?
