  I buy the argument that allowing for extentions in the syntax is a
  good thing even (perhaps especially) if we don't use them now, so
  put it in.

  I also feel strongly that the transfer coding is the servers
  business and 'q' values will, in practice, be ignored.  If this
  argues for renaming the header to not be Accept-*, then rename it.
