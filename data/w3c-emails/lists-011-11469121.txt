I object.  The draft defines a 3-digit status code space.  There is a
significant risk that a 3-digit status code space will be too small to
cater for all future activities by IETF groups and individuals, which
would leave IANA in the difficult and unpopular position of having to
manage the allocation of a scarce resource.

The draft should allow for status codes of more than 3 digits, and
should allow IANA to allocate large blocks of status codes (say blocks
like 456000 - 456999) to individuals.  Failing that, it should at
least give sound reasons why a restriction to 3 digit codes is
absolutely necessary.
