I will start production of these drafts this evening for submission tomorrow.

Anything I receive after 7:00 PM EST is very unlikely to make the new 
draft(s).  I don't know if I will have time to deal with what is on the 
list today, either (we'll see when the time comes), as I'll be at a meeting 
much of the day.  We don't have many open issues left, as you'll see below.

The current state of what I have edited can be divined from
the issues list, as always: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Issues/

The following is a summary of the current state of the drafts and
of the open issues:
