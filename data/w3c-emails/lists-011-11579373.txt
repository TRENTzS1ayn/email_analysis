I have argued for several years that a browser ought to have a way to
let a user say "forget all my authentication stuff".  However, as a
user, I dislike this suggestion of a timeout.  I keep the browser on my
workstation up as long as the browser and OS don't crash.  I don't
particularly want to have to reauthenticate myself every hour or so.

The problem you're trying to solve is one of machines shared by multiple
users.  Better to address that problem in all its glory (including
shared cookies, for example), than to nibble around the edges with a
timeout for a specific authentication problem.
