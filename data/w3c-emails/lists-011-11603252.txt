Agenda for 40th IETF HTTP working group.

The first meeting is scheduled for Monday, December 8 at 1300-1500.
The second meeting has not yet been scheduled.

This is intended to be the last meeting of the HTTP working group
prior to the submission of HTTP/1.1 as Draft Standard, and other
proposals as Proposed Standard or Experimental. It is expected
that subsequent work on HTTP within IETF will happen in new
working groups focused on explicit narrow issues.

Agenda:

2 Hours: Jim Gettys
   Review the HTTP/1.1 draft, and discuss remaining open issues
    see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Issues for list

20 minutes: Dave Kristol
   Review state management draft
20 minutes: Scott Lawrence
   Review 'OPTIONS' and 'PEP' drafts
20 minutes: Larry Masinter
   Review of other drafts
20 minutes: Larry Masinter
   Report on survey of interoperable implementations

In addition, there will be a meeting Tuesday evening of a small
group who are willing to help document interoperable implementations
of each feature of HTTP/1.1, in order to progress to draft standard.
The time/place will be announced at the first meeting and on the bulletin
board.
