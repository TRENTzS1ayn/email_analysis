True, but the draft discusses status codes for `HTTP and HTTP-Derived
Protocols', and I suppose that for at least some HTTP-Derived
protocols, compatibility with the status code parsers of plain http
clients will not be an issue.  

And if you really want to send a 5 digit code like 45205 to a http
client without prior negotiation, you could always invent some wrapping
scheme with responses like

HTTP/1.1 299 Extended status code
Status: 45205 Epibration complete
Content-type: text/html
....
