  I think that the choice of a credentials timeout may have been an
  unfortunate one, and think that the example should be omitted from
  the text in the standard.

  One has only to read the CGI newsgroup or ask people who develop
  applications to run over the Web to know how often people want this
  - they want to be able to explicitly flush credentials.  It is an
  easy thing to do.  Yes, it won't work with old browsers, but neither
  will a number of other 1.1 innovations; we should just do the right
  thing now and get on with it.  (There, I got my 2 cents in before
  7EST :-)
