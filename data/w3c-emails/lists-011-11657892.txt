Based on feedback, and the epiphany that screen savers do the same thing as
I proposed the browser do, I withdraw the proposed modification to section
11. Something like it should go in the security considerations section --
Jim, can you mark it as an editorial issue, not for this revision?

I also added text about an error message, and what happens with browsers
that don't understand the new status code.

Revised proposal:

> Add sections 10.4.19 and 10.4.20
> 
> ==============================
> 
> 10.4.19 420 Reauthentication Required
> 
> This header is similar to "401 Unauthorized", except that the user agent
> MUST request credentials from the user before resubmitting the request,
> even
> if the challenge is the same as on a prior response or if the user agent
> has
> already obtained credentials from the user. The user agent should not
> assume
> that the current credentials are invalid if the request contained an
> Authorization header. The server can use this status code to cause the
> browser to verify that the current user is the same as the one who
> supplied
> the original credentials (say, after a period of inactivity). The server
> SHOULD send an entity-body
explaining the reason for requiring reauthentication, because user agents
that do not understand the status code will treat it as a generic 400 error
and display
the message.
