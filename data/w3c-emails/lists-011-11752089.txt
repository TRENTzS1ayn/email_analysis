Paul, I wonder how many of the browser, etc. should be clients instead?
I don't see that this should be specific to browsers, though it
certainly is to deal with browser security issues.

I'm adding an editor's note to the draft to this effect, and I'll add
a place holder to the security considerations section.

I'm also renumbering to confuse the innocent.
