Please delay comments about the trailer/TE stuff until after this
next draft comes out.  I like what I see of it, now that I've put it in;
it fits, it fixes a number of real problems cleanly, and leverages what's
already there.

And lets not deep end on process right now; lets get the problems fixed,
preferably in a backward's compatible way.
