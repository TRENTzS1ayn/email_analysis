You all done good.  We're down to 4 substantive technical issues, by my 
(possibly optimistic) count.  Lets get this puppy put to bed soon, and complete 
interoperability testing.

I just submitted both the HTTP/1.1 and Authentication drafts to the internet 
drafts editor; hopefully they won't drop them on the floor like they did 
60 or more drafts before the last IETF.

Despite the time-stamp on my mail, I live on the east coast, (my mail lives 
on the west coast, courtesy of Internet, Web, HTTP and Java magic) so it 
is rediculous in the morning....

There are several more hours work to get clean word and postscript files 
all set up on our web site, and I'm not going to do it before going to sleep.

In fact, it isn't clear it will happen necessarily happen
before sometime on Monday; I may sleep all day today, and my family has
dibs on me this weekend.

Here's the summary of the issues list, which I'll post as well once
I've got the links in it set up to the files.
