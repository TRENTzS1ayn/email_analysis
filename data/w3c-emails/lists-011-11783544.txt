I have a question on how to treat ISO 8859-1 in
Accept-Charset and didn't find it discussed in the
archives. 

> 14.2 Accept-Charset

> The ISO-8859-1 character set can be assumed to be
> acceptable to all user agents.

If a server receives

  Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, *;q=0

is iso-8859-1 acceptable to the client?  What about:

  Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, iso-8859-1;q=0

In both cases I would assume it is not acceptable to the
client, but this seems to contradict the first sentence above.
If this is in fact the case, then I think the sentence

> The ISO-8859-1 character set can be assumed to be
> acceptable to all user agents.

should be removed.  Given the last paragraph, which I find
quite clear, this sentence only adds confusion.
