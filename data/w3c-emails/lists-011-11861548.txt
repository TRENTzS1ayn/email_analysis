Hi Everybody!

I am doing research on Web traffic modeling at G.I.T.
With certain Web page(www.cnnfn.com), the client continues to re-connect
with that page in exact every 180 second automatically. This situaion was
found on
tcpdump of dial-up Web traffic. 

The user in a client watches the
time and press the button ??  It is not a possible scenario.

If anyone is able to answer to the question, it would help me a lot.
Thank you in advance.
