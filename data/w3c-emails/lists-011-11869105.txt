I agree.  (They've been like that for hearly two years.  Where have you
been. :-)

Okay.  Now that I've removed some of the introductory stuff that mentions
"persistent", there's less risk of confusing the two concepts.

Okay.

Basically I'm emphasizing that cookies are end-to-end, and that proxies
shouldn't be inserting them.  I think the restriction is appropriate.
