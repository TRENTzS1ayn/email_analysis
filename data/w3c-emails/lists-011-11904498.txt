How the server does it's timeout is completely up to it, or more precisely,
up to the application that uses the server.

As far as I can tell, the people who want this have quite well formed ideas
as to how long the timeout should be, so we don't need to include
guidelines.

As to the second suggestion, which I'll call  "2xx Logout", I'm agnostic,
and await more WG feedback.
