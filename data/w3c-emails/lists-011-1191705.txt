Folks,

As I'm off to the bay area for a conference, the http-wg list will be running
on script power alone for two weeks.

If mail loops happen or people start pestering the list with unsubscription
requests, then please be patient and direct them to the correct place.

Thanks... and perhaps see you in Santa Clara...
