Cookies are one way to maintain state, munged URLs are another. Both
are more complex than needed if the client is simply given a timeout.

Servers which want more precision or actually require a stateful
interaction will of course maintain their own timeouts. But for basic
access to a secured set of WEB resources, having the client provide
the timing keeps everything simpler.
