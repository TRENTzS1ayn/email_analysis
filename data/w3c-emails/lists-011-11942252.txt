Two comments:

Certain popular web servers have a builtin "session" mechanism, so that what
the server needs to do has already been implemented.

The guys who want this want to trust the browser as little as possible. A
browser that doesn't understand the timeout directive would ignore it. A
browser that doesn't understand "4xx reauth required" will consider it a
fatal error. They like that default.
