True, but the session mechanism I am intimately familiar with on one
popular web server doesn't apply for all cases where basic authentication
can be used. To activate that session management would require the
addition of additional logic.  Furthermore, there is quite a bit of
server overhead associated with session management AND there is 
some degree of end user and developer resistance to use of cookies and
sessions when there isn't an obvious need.

As far as I'm concerned, that still represents a degree of trust.

As far as 'the guys' who want this is concerned, I believe you are
describing a specific set of guys. I can assure you that there would
also be quite a bit of interest in the timeout and 2xx logoff additions
I've suggested based on several months of following the 2500 subscriber
mailing list associated with a common server.

In any case, I'm not objecting to the original "4xx reauth required"
proposal except that I believe it is quite incomplete in terms of the
needs/desires of the HTTP based application community.
