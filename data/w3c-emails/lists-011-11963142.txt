  I'm not sure that I understand this comment.  The discussion of a
  timeout in the proposed addition was strictly an example of the use
  of this code, not a part of the definition of its function.

  This is an excellent suggestion.  I put forward the following
  suggested wording.

   2xx Discard Credentials

     This status indicates that the request succeeded, but that the user
     credentials used to construct the Authorization header field for the
     request MUST be discarded.  This allows web based applications to
     implement a 'logout' function.  The body of the response should
     in all other ways be treated as though the response code were
     '200 Ok'.

  This is completely backward compatible, since clients that don't
  understand it should already just treat it as a 200, they just won't
  discard cached credentials, which is the current situation anyway.

  Yes - users can just walk away without using an offered 'logout'
  function, but in my view that is no reason not to provide the
  capability.  I've been getting 2 or 3 pieces of email a week for
  the last couple of months from developers trying to figure out how
  to do this, and I haven't had any answer for them.
