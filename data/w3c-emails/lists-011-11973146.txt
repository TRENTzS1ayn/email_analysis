I'd like to thank Jim Gettys for his heroic efforts in getting
the HTTP/1.1 spec out. We may yet succeed in completing our work
in 1997! If we can close the remaining issues and document
interoperable implementations, we can declare success.

I imagine that we will keep the mailing list open for discussion
of HTTP protocol issues; substantive remaining issues will
be candidates for forming smaller, more focused working groups.
New proposals can be considered as individual contributions
as well. There's already sufficient movement for me to feel
confident that we can start working groups on:
  - privacy (within USV/APPS joint)
  - state management
  - content negotiation
and that HTTP-NG protocol and design are moving forward within
the W3C, but with an intention to bring those forward as IETF
proposals for review.
