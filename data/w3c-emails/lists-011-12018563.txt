%   You make an excellent point.  We could add this to the
%   Authentication-Info header as follows:
% 
%        3.2.3 The Authentication-Info Header
% 
%        When authentication succeeds, the server may optionally provide
%        an Authentication-Info header indicating that the server wants
%        to communicate some information regarding the successful
%        authentication.

There is a thing I still do not understand. 

As some pointed out, often it is the client, not the server, which 
would like to forget the auth info (but this does not belong to HTTP); 
moreover the server cannot be sure that the client forgets the infos.

This all said, shouldn't the server send a cookie (oops, wrong term :-))
which the client should send back together with the usual Authentication:
data? 

ciao, .mau.
