The problem with this suggestion is that it makes an already confusing
and user unfriendly prompt even less obvious to the end user. Since 
the realm is the only clue the server can give to the user as to what
they are being asked to login to, I dislike any scheme which requires
arbitrarily distinguished realm values.
