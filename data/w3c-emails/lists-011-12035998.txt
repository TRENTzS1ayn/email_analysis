  The proposal is to provide a mechanism whereby the server can direct
  the client to discard the user credentials.

  Clients should also have other mechanisms for doing the same things
  - for example, there should always be some way for the user to
  direct a browser to delete any stored credentials (so the user can
  leave a shared system without leaving credentials for the next
  user).

  As I wrote the proposal, 'discard' can't be combined with other uses
  of the Authentication-Info header, such as nextnonce; this may have
  been a mistake.
