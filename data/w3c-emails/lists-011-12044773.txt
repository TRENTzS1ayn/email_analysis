Paul Leach:

% The basic idea is to allow PUT with Content-Range, and allow caches to apply
% the update when possible to avoid having to refetch the whole entity-body,
% and to create a model for (e.g.) WebDAV that wants to do partial updates on
% resources.

How would it cope with plain append (which I suppose is the most 
useful thing to do)?

ciao, .mau.
