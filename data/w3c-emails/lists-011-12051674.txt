Just to be clear: You're proposing that a client receiving an
"Authentication-Info: Discard" header in a response should discard the
credentials it supplied on the Authorization header in the request,
correct?  Given everything Fote has been saying about the domain of
credentials over URLs, not to mention realm values, it's entirely
possible for a browser to have a large cache of presumably-valid
credentials.  I don't think you're asking to have them all discarded, or
even some subset of those associated with the origin server, correct?

One more point: Since Authentication-Info is defined by RFC 2069 as
being sent when authentication is successful, this discard response must
be sent with a 2xx or 3xx status code and without a WWW-Authenticate
header.  In other words, an origin server is only allowed to request the
client to discard credentials at a time when they are acceptable to the
server.

And I assume we'd want to support "Proxy-Authentication-Info: Discard"
as well.

I have to say that this is all starting to sound like something we
aren't allowed to do while trying to move HTTP/1.1 from Proposed to
Draft Standard.  As much as the lack of a procedure for invalidating a
client's credentials has hurt my company's products (quite a bit!), we
would nonetheless be opposed to any change that would prevent the rapid
advancement of HTTP/1.1 to Draft Standard.
