With the discussion around the "discard" token for the Authentication-Info
header I realized that this header contains no syntax for adding further
elements (whereas, for example, most header definitions in the http spec
do). To rectify this I propose making the following changes.

In section 3.2.3 replace

            AuthenticationInfo = "Authentication-Info" ":"
                                 1#( digest | nextnonce )

by

            AuthenticationInfo = "Authentication-Info" ":" 1#(auth-info)
            auth-info          = digest | nextnonce | discard | extension-info
            extension-info     = token [ "=" ( token | quoted-string ) ]

and in section 3.6 replace

            Proxy-Authentication-Info = "Proxy-Authentication-Info" ":"
                                        nextnonce

by

            Proxy-Authentication-Info = "Proxy-Authentication-Info" ":"
                                        1#( proxy-auth-info)
            proxy-auth-info           = nextnonce | discard | extension-info

(or appropriately modified if "discard" is not accepted in the end).

But probably the definition of these headers should be moved to section 1.x
and suitably adjusted, since "discard" is not restricted to the Digest
scheme.


  Cheers,
