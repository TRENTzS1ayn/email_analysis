I personally think it would be better if there were a common
registry for 'headers' that included the list of which
were useful in HTTP, EMail, NetNews, within particular multipart
types, etc.

I think it would help in future coordination between extensions
of mail, news, other kinds of 'push', etc.

Do you support using the same registry for HTTP and other applications
of MIME?

attached mail follows:
A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the Detailed Revision/Update of Message Standards 
Working Group of the IETF.

Title: Mail and Netnews Header Registration Procedure
Author(s): J. Palme
Filename: draft-ietf-drums-MHRegistry-02.txt
Pages: 9
Date: 24-Nov-97

Various IETF standards and e-mail and netnews software products
use various e-mail and netnews header fields. This document
specifies a procedure for the registration of e-mail and netnews
header field names, to reduce the risk that two different products
use the same header name in different ways (homonyms) or that
several different header names are used with identical meaning
(synonyms).

Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address.  After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
"get draft-ietf-drums-MHRegistry-02.txt".
A URL for the Internet-Draft is:

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.

Send a message to:mailserv@ds.internic.net.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-drums-MHRegistry-02.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
