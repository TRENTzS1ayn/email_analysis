Because of the various scheduling constraints, there
is only a single two-hour session, Monday December 8, 1300-1500,
for HTTP-WG. However, there are several other sessions
related to HTTP on the agenda: Monday 1930-2200 on "Web Privacy",
and Tuesday 1545-1800 on "Content Negotiation".

I suggest the following agenda:

80 minutes: Jim Gettys: review open issues in HTTP/1.1 draft.
10 minutes: Dave Kristol: Review state management draft
   (Interested parties should meet after the WEBPRIV BOF to
   plan further work on state management and privacy.)
10 minutes: Scott Lawrence: Review status of 'OPTIONS' and 'PEP'
20 minutes: Larry Masinter: Review of Working Group status & schedule
   for completing work.

In addition, there will be a meeting Tuesday evening (during the
dinner/social time) for a group to document interoperable
implementations of each feature of HTTP/1.1.  (Come with
your marked up copy of the HTTP/1.1 spec.) Location to be announced.

Larry
