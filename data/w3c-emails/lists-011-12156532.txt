A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol Working Group 
of the IETF.

Title: HTTP State Management Mechanism
Author(s): D. Kristol, L. Montulli
Filename: draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-05.txt,.ps
Pages: 19
Date: 26-Nov-97

This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with HTTP
requests and responses.  It describes two new headers, Cookie and Set-
Cookie2, which carry state information between participating origin
servers and user agents.  The method described here differs from
Netscape's Cookie proposal, but it can interoperate with HTTP/1.0 user
agents that use Netscape's method.  (See the HISTORICAL section.)

This document reflects implementation experience with RFC 2109 and
obsoletes it.

Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username

type "cd internet-drafts" and then
"get draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-05.txt".

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.

Send a message to:mailserv@ds.internic.net.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-05.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
