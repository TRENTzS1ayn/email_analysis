Here, here (or should that be "hear hear"?)

I find there there seems to be much discussion about the cross-overs
between protocols, so having a mechanism which avoids using the same name
for different purposes in different protocols seems like a good start.

And should there also be some equivalent to the "vnd" tree in MIME, for
strictly private protocol use?
