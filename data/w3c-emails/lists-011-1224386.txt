Dear sirs,

I want to bring this issue up.

Arabic, Hebrew and other languages are wrriten from right to left. 
While The latest HTML draft does not have a special tag to specify the
direction and takes left to right as the default direction of the
language.

I think it is about time that such a tag (property) will be defined.

The suggestion is to add a property called Language with the following
features:
1. Direction - The direction from which the language is wrriten.
2. Default font - The default font for that language as in the OS (such
as Windows 95) installation.
3. Wrap - Direction of wrraping according to the dominent language.

So that if we combine Arabic/Hebrew with English in the same sentence,
which is most common we can write:

<Wrap=right>
<Language Direction=left font=TimesNewRoman>English text</Direction>
<Language Direction=Right font=HebFont>Hebrew text</Direction>
</Wrap>

The wrapping issue is also very important and should be concidered with
the "Dominent" language in which the HTML document was wrriten.

I would like to get your commenct on these important issues.
