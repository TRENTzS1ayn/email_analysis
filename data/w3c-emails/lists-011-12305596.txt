I'll bring my usual set of nitpicking editorial comments to the IETF
meeting for personal delivery.  Meanwhile, here are some substantive
ones.

1) Sect 1.2
[Proxies] MUST forward the WWW-Authenticate and Authorization
headers untouched....

I would like MUST to be SHOULD.  I've brought this up once before.
There may be services (LPWA, lpwa.com, is one such) whose legitimate
purpose is to provide authentication services for a user, such as
replacing special character sequences in Authorization with a user's
computed identity.  The proxy ought to be able to do so without being
considered non-compliant.

2) Sect 3.2.1, under "nonce"
... is the dotted quad IP address ...

How to handle IPv6 addresses?

3) Sect 3.2.2, syntax
should be
    entity-digest = <"> ...
      ^

The "date" attribute description bears no mention here of what
date we're talking about.  I inferred from text much further on
that it's supposed to mirror the Date header of the
request/response.

4) Sect 3.2.2, semantics

Consider sender -> proxy -> receiver.

The entity-digest incorporates information from headers from
the sender.  Consider, for example, Date and Content-Length.  A
proxy could add Date if one were missing.  A proxy could add a
Content-Length after gobbling up something that the sender sent
"chunked".

The receiver wouldn't know that the proxy had added those
headers.  It would use the added headers in its calculation of
entity-digest and derive a different value from what the sender
calculated.
