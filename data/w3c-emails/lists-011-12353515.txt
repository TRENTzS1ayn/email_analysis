I believe that the original intent of the "opaque" field in the digest
authentication header may have been precisely for such a ticket.  A
request could be referred to an "authentication server" which would
redirect to a server that could check the ticket in the opaque field
and satisfy the request.  In this way only the authentication server
would need to know all user passwords.  The document servers would
only need to know a single secret shared with the authentication
server.
