The latest PEP draft (draft-ieft-http-pep-05) has an inconsistency
between the BNFs for <bagname> and <map>.  Specifically, <ext-decl>
is claimed to be a <bag>, meaning that <map> must be a legal
<bagname>.  <bagname> is defined as just a <token>, but <map> looks
more like a <bag> - it takes the form "{ map ...}".  From the rest of
the spec, it looks to me like the <ext-decl> BNF is defined as intended,
and that <bagname> should be defined as something like:

   bagname = token | bag
