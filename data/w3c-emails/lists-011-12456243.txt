I agree that there is an issue here.  The current spec says the
proxy MUST not add these headers.  If I recall you suggested the
MUST be changed to SHOULD.  I am not sure how this helps beyond
making the proxy technically "legal."  It doesn't materially affect
the problem.

What should a proxy do in this situation?  It seems it must either
not add headers or break the entity-digest.
