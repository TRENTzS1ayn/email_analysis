I agree that this hasn't been addressed. I don't think it'll be a problem in
practice -- implementors would quickly discover that Message Digest didn't
work if the origin server omits any headers and proxies add them.  It would
be (at least) nice to be clear about this, though.

There are two ways to fix the problem -- 
1. Say that origin servers can't omit the headers
2. Say that proxies can't add them when using Message Disgest.

I don't know which is best. For Date, at least, it seems silly to omit it.
