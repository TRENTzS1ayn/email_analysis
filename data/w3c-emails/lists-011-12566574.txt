Date should not be part of the digest -- it gets updated at times
when the entity does not change (think 304).  Likewise, the
Content-Length header field should not be part of the digest;
instead, include the actual value for the size of the entity-body.

Keep in mind the distinction between general-header fields indicating
properties of the message, and entity-header fields indicating properties
of the payload of the message.  Aside from HEAD responses, Content-Length
indicates the size of the message-body and not the entity-body.
