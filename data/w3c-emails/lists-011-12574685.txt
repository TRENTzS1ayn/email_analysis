I think we're looking at the problem from different directions.  A
*sender* produces an entity-digest.  I look at the problem from the
perspective of an origin server *receiving* the entity-digest.  In this
case the sender is a client (user-agent), possibly doing a PUT or POST. 
Clients seldom send Date.  Proxies could (conceivably) add them.

I like Benjamin Franz's suggestion of a fixed date that means "this is
not a date" as a placeholder.

Content-length is another matter.  If the client sends the entity with
chunked encoding, it probably does not know the content length, although
it may calculate an entity-digest on the fly (and add it as a
trailer?).  But the proxy may coalesce the entity and add a
Content-length header.  Now what?  The entity-digest as calculated by
the two parties will be different because of the Content-length.
