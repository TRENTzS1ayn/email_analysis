     Hi,

      RFC2068 for HTTP/1.1 specifies Accept-Ranges to be a response header
      field in Section 14.5. But there is no mention of this field in
      the BNF for response header fields in Section 6.2.

      Accept-Ranges seems to have been grouped along with the other Accept*
      fields of the request-header, but does not find a place in the BNF
      for request-header fields also.

      Could anybody clarify this?

      Regards,
      Ramya T.V.
