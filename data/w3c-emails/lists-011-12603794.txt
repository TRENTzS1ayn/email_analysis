[Joshua Cohen]  
Well, I guess its time for me to fess up.
Im the guy who "quipped".  Im also the guy who wrote the 305/306
draft to specify 
the 305 and 306 so that they are usable.
Unfortunately, we simply couldnt resolve the security implications
in time
and leaving them in the http/1.1 draft puts the entire protocol at
risk from
a process point of view.
Before anyone jumps at dont put process over function, if we had a
good
resolution, Id be pushing for it in the core protocol.  We dont, and
until
we do, it needs to wait..

[Joshua Cohen]  This "guy at microsoft" gets it, and I beleive
that most of my colleagues do as well.   As I said earlier, the
305-306 draft (which was supposed to roll into http/1.1)
was my doing. 

Please dont ascribe any higher meaning to the fact that
a "microsoft" guy spoke about temporarily holding
305/306 from the http/1.1 draft.  Im still enthusiastic
about the 305/306 functionality but until
we can resolve the very real security implications
it is prudent to withold it from the draft..
