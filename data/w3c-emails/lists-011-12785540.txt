But what is there about the protocol which allows this requirement to
be enforced?

Seems to me that the protocol relies on gentle (i.e., conforming)
behavior by proxies and servers. The definition of spoofing includes an
element of malicious intent.

Perhaps it would close the loop to require that the client only 
accept a 305 status from an origin server to which it is directly
connected?

Then the potential for spoofing would be limited to IP and/or DNS
spoofing.

In either case though, I fail to see the motivation for someone
intending to spoof a redirect who wouldn't simply change the
origin server or make the IP spoofed variant of the origin server
simply serve the nefarious content which would have be acquired
as a result of the redirect.

Thus I don't see any difference in risk with/without 305.
