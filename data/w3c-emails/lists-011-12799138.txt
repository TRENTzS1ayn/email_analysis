The "current practice" is unintended:  The 305 is passed back
to the browser because deployed proxies don't recognize it.

The 305 *was* intended (I think, but the original discussion
about it was long ago) to be handled by proxies if interposed between
the browser and origin server, in which case it would be the proxy first
receiving a response from the origin server (i.e., what you mean by
"directly connected").  That would be desireable, because for 305 the
browser should not act on it if it already is using a proxy (IMHO, for
security/privacy considerations, and thus how it was implemented in
Lynx).  If proxies do act on it, then it's even more important to make
305 redirection GET-only, because the user of the browser will not be
able to confirm or cancel redirection of a POST.  One can leave 306
redirection of POSTs by proxies as a future possibility (not in the
HTTP/1.1 Draft Standard), but for what it's worth, I've been
scratching my head for some time about how to deal with the
security/privacy problems that would raise, and still don't see any
solutions.  For 305, it's possible that in a chain of proxies the one
which first receives the origin server's response doesn't recognize it,
and passes it on to the next proxy in the chain, but if any proxy in
the chain recognizes it and acts on it with a conversion to GET (if
it's not a GET request in the first place), then there's no security
problem, and no serious privacy problem (certainly much less than with
unverifiable cookie transactions :).
