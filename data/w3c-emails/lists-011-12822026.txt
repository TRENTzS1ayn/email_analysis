I think proxies should be ok.  If they understand a new TE which requires
Transfer-length then they should also understand Transfer-length.  If
they don't understand the TE they have to reject it.  Proxies are not
supposed to touch digests so that shouldn't be a problem.

Yes, you are right.  Indeed, any request or response should have
Transfer-length 0 if and only if it has an empty message body.  And
an empty messge body should imply Transfer-length 0 without the header
being present.
