I'm all for an editorial note about "Content-Length" that explains
its difficulty in serving both as an entity length and a transfer
length. In fact, this kind of confusion is, I believe, one of the
reasons why content-length was deprecated for use in mail!

So we're saddled with a legacy, and need some clear warnings that
"Content-Length".

It's less clear what "Transfer-Length" would buy us, since we've
survived for so long without it. It sounds like a good conceptual
aid ("we shoulda done it that way") but not a necessary protocol
addition ("we need to do it this way now").

Unfortunately, this seems (to me, personally) to be the only
way out. I believe that most implementations treat it this
way, in any case.

This seems acceptable to me; what do others think?


We will need two interoperable digest implementations (two clients, two servers)
that have been tested as interworking in conjunction with a
1.1 proxy that does rewriting of the transfer encoding. Is there any
hope of setting up such a test during the weekly testing?
