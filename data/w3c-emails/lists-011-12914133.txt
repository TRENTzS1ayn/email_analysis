  Whoa - this is authentication, not authorization.  The purpose is to
  provide a trustable identity for the end user without exposing the
  means of doing so to the world, not to do access control.  Access
  control depends on authentication, but authentication does not
  include access control.  I believe that any discussion of ACLs is
  out of scope for this specification.
