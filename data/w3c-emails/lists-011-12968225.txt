  I believe that he was just noting the fact that given the current
  usage of the Content-Length, that is the way it is.

  At this point there are a great many reasons not to introduce a new
  header without a compelling reason - they are called deployed
  implementations.  There is no reason why the definition of a new
  transfer encoding cannot be done in a way that corrects this
  situation, and no benefit in correcting it before that time.

  There are no transfer encodings in 1.1 for which the length is
  ambiguous; we don't need to change the spec now.

  I have already logged this among the caveats we will document in the
  guidelines for extending HTTP.
