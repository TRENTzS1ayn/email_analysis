and various other people seem to agree.

I have a suggestion: instead of coming up with a new syntax
for "this is not a date" (when the existing date syntax, horribly
inefficient and hard-to-parse as it is, has at least more or
less been tamed by implementors) perhaps we can get by with
something a little simpler.

For example, we could say

If the sender is required to send a Date header
by some part of this specification, and is unable
to generate a current HTTP-date value, it SHOULD
send a legal HTTP-date value that is provably in
the past.

For example, send
Date: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:0:01 GMT

As far as I can tell, this will not lead to any more trouble
than simply omitting the Date header.  It also seems to be
legal according to section 14.19 of -rev-01.
