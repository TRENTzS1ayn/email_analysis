It currently says:

       In theory, the date SHOULD represent the moment just before the
       entity is generated. In practice, the date can be generated at
       any time during the message origination without affecting its
       semantic value.

I don't think it makes sense for a normative keyword such as "SHOULD"
to be preceded by "In theory", except if this is clearly marked as
a "Note".  This would be very confusing to someone trying to figure
out if this is a real SHOULD, or just a theory.

How about

       In theory, the date ought to represent the moment just before the
       entity is generated. In practice, the date can be generated at
       any time during the message origination without affecting its
       semantic value.

In fact, if you read 14.19 carefully, it never has any actual
normative requirement on what the Date value MUST or SHOULD be
(except for this "in theory").  But perhaps what we really meant
to say, before the paragraph quoted above, is:

The HTTP-date sent in a Date header SHOULD NOT represent a date
and time subsequent to the generation of the message.  It
SHOULD represent the best available approximation of the date
and time of message generation, unless the implementation has
no means of generating a reasonably accurate date and time.
