It would be good to do this renaming or at least name the length of
the entity-body something.  This is the number which Digest
authentication needs to use.  The current D-A spec uses
"Content-Length" and "content length" with the intended meaning of
length of the entity-body (the ambiguity of this is how we got into
this discussion).  Anyway, *some term* should be defined meaning
length of the entity-body and that term should replace "content
length" and "Content-Length" in the DA spec.

Interestingly, the D-A spec contains the sentence.

       "The HTTP/1.1 spec requires that content length is well defined
       in all messages, whether or not there is a Content-Length header."

Sounds like wishful thinking at this point, but I guess this sentence
should be removed if content length is replaced by entity-length.
