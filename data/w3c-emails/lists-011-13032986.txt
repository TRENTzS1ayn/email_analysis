That's not a problem for the Lynx implementation because it
will show the body instead of acting on the 305 if it already is using
a proxy, on the assumption that the UA which receives it from the origin
server should act on it, and that can't be the browser if it already
is using a proxy (plus, the browser's current proxy may be obligatory
for a firewall).  Also note, as was raised in the recent discussion,
that if a proxy acts on it, you need a GET-only requirement, because a
POST should not be redirected without confirmation by the human user of
the browser.

But this all seems academic upon reading the statement in the
recently posted minutes of the IETF meeting that to be retained in the
Draft Standard there must be two independent implementations, because
there is only one.  So I guess it's indeed bye bye 305. (i.e., put it
off with 306 to a new draft :)
