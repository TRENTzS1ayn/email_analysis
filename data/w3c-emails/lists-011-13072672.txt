Maybe an example is best. Assume the Request-URI is
"http://somewhere/the/path/index.html" then you want to to talk about all
URIs with a prefix of "http://somewhere/the/path/", i.e. the scheme, the
site component and the path component of the Request-URI minus any trailing
segment. I assumed "symbolic element" to refer to "/".
