I'm not sure this is true. In the latest draft I discovered the
following
in Section 3.6:

     The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry
for
     transfer-coding value tokens. Initially, the registry contains the
     following tokens: "chunked" (section 3.6.1), "identity" (section
3.6.2),
     "gzip" (section 3.5), "compress" (section 3.5), and "deflate"
(section
     3.5).

Two questions:

1) Are gzip, compress and deflate really to be used as both transfer
   encodings and content encodings? What's the rationale behind that?

2) I'm not very familiar with the details of these encodings, but I
   believe they aren't self delimiting. Is this true?


  Cheers,

  Ronald
