Yes.  A proxy may wish to compress an object before transmitting it
to a client to improve bandwith utilization or perceived speed.
The proxy can add a transfer encoding, but not a content encoding.

I am not sure.  But from the recent discussion it is very clear
that it is cruicially important that all transfer encodings be
explicitly defined to be self-delimiting or non-self-delimiting.
I am not sure this is done in the IANA registry.
