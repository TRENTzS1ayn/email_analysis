Actually, I thought I was discussing the property of the encoding and
asserting by example that I believed it was trival for the implementer
of the transfer encoding to meet the requirement.

I'll take your word about the context ... I think I've attempted to
make that point more than once ... but what I've been trying to
say is that there is a catch-22 ... either the length of the
transfer encoding result is self defining OR we are right back where we
invented chunked encoding because we don't know the length til the
end of the transfer.

Sounds like a complete solution to me.  Of course, I think there
might still be a few words about content-length to bring into
alignment.
