This raises the whole issue of stacked transfer encodings.  
Are you suggesting that arbitrary stackings be allowed, or
just two, the second of which is chunked?  This would need to
be clarified.  But generally, at first glance I don't see any
problems.

What I would most like to see is the assertion that if a Content-length
header is present its value is the length of the entity-body.  It
may not be too important that it be officially end-to-end.
