    This raises the whole issue of stacked transfer encodings.  
    Are you suggesting that arbitrary stackings be allowed, or
    just two, the second of which is chunked?  This would need to
    be clarified.  But generally, at first glance I don't see any
    problems.

I'm not "suggesting" anything.  It's already in the spec, and
has been there since at least RFC2068:

14.40 Transfer-Encoding

   The Transfer-Encoding general-header field indicates what (if any)
   type of transformation has been applied to the message body in order
   to safely transfer it between the sender and the recipient. This
   differs from the Content-Encoding in that the transfer coding is a
   property of the message, not of the entity.

          Transfer-Encoding     
  = "Transfer-Encoding" ":" 1#transfer-coding

the BNF clearly allows any number of transfer-codings.

The current -rev-01 draft adds:
       If multiple encodings have been applied to an entity, the transfer
       codings MUST be listed in the order in which they were applied.
