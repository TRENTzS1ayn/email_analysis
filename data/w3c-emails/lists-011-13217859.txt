I would take that bet ... we've had multiple implementors report that
they thought 'content-length' was entity length, not message length.
NONE who reported the converse.

Can't speak to implementations ...

but imposing chunked is an almost ZERO overhead operation.  NO MORE
overhead than adding a transfer-length .... probably less:

     3039[crlf]
     encoded message content
     [crlf]
     0[crlf]

Nothing about chunked encoding requires more than a single chunk.

This also cleanly covers the case where the encoded length (as 
in compressed) is unknown UNTIL after encoding is complete. Just
use multiple chunks.
