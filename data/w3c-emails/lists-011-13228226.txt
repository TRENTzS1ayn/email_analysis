Thanx for the (very clear) explanation. I suppose one could just substitute
"symbolic element" by "segment".

The nonce is not (that much of) a problem. If you previously got a
nextnonce then use that, otherwise just use the previously used nonce.
When pre-emptively sending auth info the main difference between Basic
and Digest authentication is that you have to recalculate the response
digest (and possibly entity-digest) and adjust the various parameters,
instead of just sending exact same header as you can do in Basic. So
the prefix idea works just fine with Digest.
