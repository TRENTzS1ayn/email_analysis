You may do this if you want, but I'm not planning to spec the content server
(CS) to authentication server *AS) protocol as part of the proposal. I'll
give a sample one, perhaps in a separate draft, to make sure that one is
possible.

(Personally, I don't see why the content server can't evaluate the ACL
itself. But that just proves that if we do try to spec the CS<->AS protocol,
it'll slow down the client->server protocol finalization.)

Re-directed authentication is totally transparent to the client, so talking
about "on top of existing schemes" is not meaningful.
