It is still an attack as the origin server, if it has not been
authenticated, is just some random server. To remind folks of the problems
with click tracking and cookies, a bunch of servers could choose to have
requests to them redirected to indicated proxies where advertising and other
information will be inserted as needed. This very effectively gets around
cookie issues.
