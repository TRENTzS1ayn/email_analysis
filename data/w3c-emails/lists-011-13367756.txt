[Joshua Cohen]  Im confused.
If the purpose of this discussion is simply to have a date
placeholder,
what are the effects of using a token marker date, such as the 
epoch beginning , ie 0 unix time.

I imagine that existing 1.0 proxies will be using last-modified to
determine
the age of an entity, not date:.
Presently, many proxies will not cache an item without a L-M header
or expires:.  

We cant fix any old 1.0 proxies that are deployed today, but I cant
imagine how they will be worse off in this case.
For 1.1, we can define the epoch time as a value that
means "I have no idea what time it is".
Newer 1.1 proxies which implement the new age-calculation formula
should be aware of the null date value.

As far as a proxy adding a date: header...
Assuming the proxy adds a date header from its own clock on a
response,
and there are nested proxies, will each successive proxy be
incorrectly
calculating the age? 
someone tell me if Im wrong, but we are saying:
"Age = age of the locally cached entity" NOT "Age= age of the entity
in question ( since it was created/modified)"
right?

Objfun: We should keep dating to a minimum in the wg, "This is not a
date", we're just friends :)
