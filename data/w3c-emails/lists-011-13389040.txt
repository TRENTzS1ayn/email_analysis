  I think that we don't need to worry about the case of preserving
  cachability in shared caches of a digest-authenticated response;
  because of the nonce it just can't be done (and I don't think that
  we would want that changed - as an origin server I can't trust the
  proxy anyway).

  The goal is to allow the athenticated message to pass through the
  proxy uncorrupted - that's all.
