> Could the spec allow for customization of the authentication dialog?

  The only customization allowed for is the value of the realm, which
  should be displayed to the user (if any) if challenging for the
  credentials.  In thinking about customizing this, bear in mind that some
  clients will not be browsers and will not have human users.
