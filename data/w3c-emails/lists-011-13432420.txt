FWIW, ages ago I asked for (and was denied) the addition of a "prompt"
attribute, which would have been (one of) the thing the user saw in the
dialog box.  The argument against at the time was, I think, that such an
attribute could be used by a malicious server to fool the user into
giving credentials for a spoofed authentication domain.

Notwithstanding that valid criticism, I still think a "prompt" attribute
could be useful.  In one application I wrote, users have to register
before they can gain access to "protected" documents.  The project, and
hence the realm, is "SEPTEMBER".  But to remind users that they have to
register first, I had to make the HTTP realm attribute be "SEPTEMBER
(You must have registered)", so browsers would present that string, and
users would get the useful hint.
