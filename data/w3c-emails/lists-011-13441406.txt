At the IETF meeting I promised to send out a summary of where things
stand and where things ought to go to nail down a revised HTTP State
Management.  This is it.

Please keep the discussion on http-state@lists.research.bell-labs.com.
(See <http://www.bell-labs.com/mailing-lists/http-state/>.)  I'm sending
this message to http-wg only as a courtesy.

Step 1:  Nail down the "wire protocol".

At the IETF meeting I believe we narrowed down the outstanding
issue(s) to the domain-matching rules.  There are two
sub-problems:  a) flat namespaces in intranets; and b) using
the n-dot rule to restrict the set of servers to which a cookie
can be returned.

I believe we actually resolved the flat namespace problem.  The
resolution is that, if the Domain attribute is omitted in
Set-Cookie2, the client is restricted to return the cookie only
to the server from which it came.  That rule applies regardless
of the name (and how many dots it contains).

That leaves the domain-matching restriction rules to address.

Step 2:  reach consensus on the "privacy rules"

Attendees thought they could arrive at an agreement about the
interaction of the (previous) privacy rules and the user
interface.

The rules for unverifiable transactions, or at least the
default user agent setting for them, remain contentious.


For now I would like to restrict the discussion "agenda bashing" for
Step 1 only.  Does anyone believe there are other outstanding issues?
