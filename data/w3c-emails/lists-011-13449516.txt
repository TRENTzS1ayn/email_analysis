Subject: web-priv list set up

Hi all,

This is to let you know that the mailing list for the Web Privacy group
(not working group) is set up.  It is web-priv@nasa.gov.  To join, send to
web-priv-request@nasa.gov with 'subscribe' as the body of the msg.

For those of you unable to make Washington or who did not attend the
web-priv BOF:   I will append the original description of the BOF at the
end of this msg.  Larry Masinter chaired the BOF, which was convened to
look at concerns related to the privacy of user information collected via
the Web and whether there should be a group to develop some guidelines or
recommendations for site administrators about better ways to collect or
handle such information.  (I also think there may be some work aimed at
end-users alerting them to privacy "threats.")

The BOF was very well attended.  There was a lot of interest in the topic,
but there was not enough time (in my opinion) to flesh out what tasks a
group would actually take on.  Therefore, not surprisingly, there was a
dearth of volunteers to do actual work.  However, many people felt work
should be done.  So, there was no working group formed as a result of the
BOF, but this mailing list has been set up to continue the discussion and
hopefully make it more concrete.  Personally, I think that as the work
topics are clarified, people will be willing to pitch in, but this list is
a test of that theory!

I am sending this msg to the uswg list.  The HTTP list is also being
alerted.  Feel free to let anyone interested in this area know about the
list and encourage them to join.  Soon, the minutes from the BOF will be
posted here (Larry, can you make sure of that?  I'm not sure who took
minutes at the BOF) and we can start from there.

Actually, as this msg got a bit long, I will send Larry's original
description as a separate msg.

Please join in the discussion!

thanks,
April Marine
