I agree, but requiring chunked on top will get us in the much nastier
business of forbidding self-delimiting transfer codings specified by
others.

It should be legal to use something like gzip as the top transfer
encoding.  If a server has to put chunking on top of a gzipped stream
without knowing the size of the zipped data beforehand, this could be
quite expensive in terms of either memory copy operations or software
complexity.  The same is true for decoding such a thing.
