Hello,

Please redirect me, if this isn't the right forum for this question.

I am looking for Web server implementations of Hit-metering for testing against our Proxy server implementation.

I tried searching the working group archive for such information and I could not find any announcements regarding implementation of RFC 2227.

Thanks in advance,
jayakumar
