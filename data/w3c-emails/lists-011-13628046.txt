  The next Test Day is 12-18; please send registrations as usual to
  httptest@agranat.com.  If your information hasn't changed, just say
  so - you needn't repeat it all.

  I am interested in hearing from people who have test systems
  available more or less continuously - I am considering putting more
  detail on the W3C HTTP Implementors Forum page on these systems.  If
  you think this would be a good thing, drop me a note and say so - if
  not, drop me a note and say why not or how we should change for that
  sort of setup.  There really is no reason why all this should happen
  only on Thursdays (I try to have my latest version up by Thursday,
  but something is there more or less all the time).

  Test Day Ground Rules:

    - Participating systems may be configured to allow access only by
      announced participants for that week (if you will be using a
      dynamically assigned IP address, indicate this and try to
      specify the range from which it will be chosen).

    - Participants will, on request, make a reasonable effort to
      provide whatever relevant log or trace data they have to other
      participants to resolve problems.

    - If a problem or possible issue with another participant
      implementation is found, that issue will be communicated to the
      contact for that implementation promptly.  Only if the
      involved participants disagree on the correct behavior or if
      the involved participants agree to do so will the issue be
      brought to the working group mailing list.

    - Any other disclosure of problems found with other
      implementations during these tests is poor form.

    - Communicating positive results to other participants is
      strongly encouraged.

  Additional suggestions welcome.
