Yea, and now Internet Explorer 4.0 has broken their digest implementation
form 3.0. Of course, netscape doesn't do digests.

Of course, digests never authenticated the transaction and return codes,
leaving them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

Quite the mess.

A couple of simple fixes and this would be very useful.

What gives?
