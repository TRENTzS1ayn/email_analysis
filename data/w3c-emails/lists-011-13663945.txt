Folks,

Due to a combination of Xmas site shutdown and physical re-location of the
list server, the http-wg mailing list will be unavailable from the 18th of
December until the 5th of January.

Mail sent to the list server will be queued up and hopefully should not be
dropped on the floor nor returned.

Apologies in advance.
