The goal is to separate the directory server from the content server; do
not replicate
 the directory onto the content server; do  not use LDAP for authentication
OR authorization
(on the back end).  Do authentication and authorization on the
"authentication/authorization" server.  When
visitors are registered on your site, they are instantly "registered"
(authorized) on all content
servers because there is only one authentication/authorization server.

PL> Re-directed authentication is totally transparent to the client, so
talking

The point is, regardless of the scheme, to separate the directory services
from the content services.
Can webmake this authentication/authorization protocol generic enough to
(optionally) use X.509 certs?
If that is possible, I don't want to require them to be on the content
server...
