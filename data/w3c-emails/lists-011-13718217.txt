Regardless of the original purpose, cast-iron protection for
authentication secrets seems quite important, especially in
light of ...

Absolutely.  Password reuse between weak and strong methods
must be discouraged, as long as weak methods continue to be used.
But memorized secrets remain important.

I disagree with the conclusion, which goes too far.
Some password-based certificate-free methods work quite well.

Sure, but you can verify a small password without exposing it
to an untrustworthy party, even in digested form, using a
stronger method.

Clear-text and digest-style authentication are flawed, and
it sure is discouraging that they are so widely deployed and
used.  This should motivate the deployment of stronger methods.

The "pinhead" problem is that a PIN code is all that seems
to fit in an average human head, and this code is small
enough for brute force attack.  Methods like SPEKE and EKE
solve this problem w.r.t. the network.  For example, these
don't leak PIN-sized secrets to eavesdroppers.

Memorized factors remain important for personal
authentication, and a total dependence on stored keys
and certificates unnecessarily weakens a system.
The goal of replacing broken password methods with
stronger password methods seems quite important.
