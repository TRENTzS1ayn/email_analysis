Excuse me.  Did I say encryption?

It has to provide a hash of the return codes and a hash of
the entity to achieve its full potential.  This allows client
to know that you have the right entity body and it allows 
the client to know how the server processed the request,
i.e. the entire transaction is authenticated. This point
has been raised before on the list.  I can't why it isn't
dead obvious.

Earlier versions of Internet Explorer did indeed do digests because they 
were based on the Spyglass code, which did.
