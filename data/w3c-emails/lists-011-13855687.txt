libwww is certainly designed to handle multiple transfer encodings as well
as multiple content encodings on client side. The application can register
new handlers for encodings dynamically - they just get plugged into the
read stream.

When a client says that it understands multiple encodings using TE, it
should also be able to plug them together.

I actually don't think we have to provide sanity rules here - there are
many other places in the spec where we expect people to use the "don't
forget to think" rule. The only rule we need is that a message must be self
delimiting according to section 4.4, but this is already stated there.
