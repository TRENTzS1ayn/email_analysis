It isn't 'too late' to do something else BESIDES digest;
it's just too late to leave Digest out. It's not all that much
implementation hair, really, and it will give us something
that we can hope that every server can offer and that every compliant
client will implement. So Digest fills a real need. If there's
some other authentication mechanism that's better, then offer
it too.
