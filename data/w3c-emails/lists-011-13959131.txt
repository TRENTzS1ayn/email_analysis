Roy,

Jim Gettys is now the lead editor of the authentication draft,
despite his absence the list of authors at the top of the draft
he recently submitted. Jim was charged with integrating Basic
and Digest together; in our rush to get all of the issues integrated
into the main HTTP/1.1 spec, we didn't spend much time on the
authentication draft.

Your willingness to volunteer to help with editing is greatly
appreciated, and I'm sure we will coordinate with you to take
advantage of your willingness to help. But please don't go
off on your own.

Thanks!

Larry Masinter
(as chair, HTTP working group)
