I'm really uneasy about this. I can imagine an implementation that
just doesn't read from the connection at all unless there's some
request outstanding, and a server that sends a 1xx 'response' [sic] 
without a pending request might wind up with stuff stuck in buffers 
that never gets read. 

Seems like it puts unnecessary requirements on implementations,
and it doesn't seem justified. Just what ARE these unanticpated
'responses'?
