The registry I am trying to start is only for header fields, not for HTML
elements. However, a registry for HTML element might also be useful.

My proposal for the header field registry can be found at URL:
ftp://ftp.dsv.su.se/users/jpalme/draft-ietf-drums-MHRegistry-03.txt

An example of how the header field registry could look like can be found
at URL:
http://www.dsv.su.se/~jpalme/ietf/iana-header-field-registry.html

So far, I have only produced an incomplete list of e-mail headers,
which would be the basis of developing the starting set for the
header-field registry. That incomplete list can be found at URL:
ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc2076.txt, I plan to submit a revised
version shortly, but still only containing e-mail and netnews,
not HTTP header fields.

If you reply to this message with comments which I should read, then
include me in the recipient list, since I am not a subscriber to
the http-wg mailing list. There is also a specific mailing list
for the header registry issue. This mailing list is presently not
active, but could of course become active and be used for a discussion
of header field registry issues, and possibly also HTML tag registry
issues. The list is named "mail-headers", since initially we planned
a registry for only e-mail header fields, but now we believe that
the internet community is best served by a common registry for
e-mail, netnews and http header fields.

Information about the mailing list:

Send contributions to the "mail-headers@segate.sunet.se" mailing list. You
can subscribe to the list by sending a message to
"listserv@segate.sunet.se" containing in the text a line with "subscribe
mail-headers " followed by our name (not your e-mail address), and
unsubscribe with a message "unsubscribe mail-headers".

Archives of this list will be (but are not yet) available
by anonymous FTP from
   ftp://segate.sunet.se/lists/mail-headers/

by HTTP from
   http://segate.sunet.se/archives/mail-headers.html

by E-MAIL
   send a message to
   LISTSERV@SEGATE.SUNET.SE with the text "INDEX mail-headers"
   to get a list of the archive files, and then a new message
   "GET <file name>" to retrieve the archive files.

The FTP and E-MAIL archives are best if you want to retrieve
all messages during a month or more, while the HTTP archives
are better if you want to browse and find particular messages
to download.
