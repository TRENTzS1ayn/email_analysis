Some note of that sort should certainly be included, but I still think
that this needs to be a MUST or be omitted.  Granted, all implementations
earlier than 2068 and some (including important ones) based on 2068 will
not do this.  The point is that it is a good thing (IMHO) to have in the
protocol in the future and if we make it a must then the day will come
when it can be assumed to work more or less universally; if we do not make
it a MUST then that day will not come, and the protocol feature is
useless.  I was most carefull in my original post - this should either be
a MUST or it should be removed altogether; I don't think that compromise
is helpfull here.
