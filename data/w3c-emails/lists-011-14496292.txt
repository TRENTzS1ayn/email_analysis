Sorry if I am missing something, but is duplicate suppression really a
big issue ? And for what reason ?

Last time I checked (which was perhaps in summer '96, and looking at
cache performance) on our proxy, the amount of duplicate objects
was very small -- at least in size, I think it was maybe between
1 and 2% of the total cache size.

Cheers
