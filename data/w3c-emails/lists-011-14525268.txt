It was noted in that thread that [ and ] were illegal in URLs.

We did not really reach a consensus, but one intermediate conclusion
was that a notation like

 http://1080::8:800:200C:417A.8000/blah

with the . separating the address from the port number, would do the
trick.  I see however that you quoted some ipv6 addresses which have a
. in them above, I think we assumed at the time that the ipv6 notation
would use : only. 

Anyway, this is probably an issue between the ipv6 people and whoever
feels responsible for maintaining URLs (Larry(?)).  I am just
providing some pointers.  I think we should at least add a note to the
1.1 spec to warn implementers of this issue.
