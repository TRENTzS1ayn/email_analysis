This whole issue is really one for the URI documents, rather than HTTP...
Of course, we'd like them to get to draft standard soon as well, so
that we can reference them rather than incorporating duplication.  Yet
another headache of mine of last week...

At the IETF, a number of us (quite interesting collection of people),
talked through this issue (over beer in the bar, of course; was the most
fun conversation of the IETF I had...)...  This was alluded to in the minutes
(the "design team").
Attending included: 
Brian Carpenter, (IAB chair)
Larry Masinter
myself
Henrik Frystyk
Steve Deering (Cisco, and IPNG heavyweight).
probably one or two more I forget.

Bottom line was that the browsers were the least of the problem;
we almost certainly could get the big players to change the browsers...

But...  The browser is the tip of the iceberg...  The first proposal (things 
like brackets or other syntactic changes to URI's) would break a large number 
of tools that know about HTML, XML and the like, and that therefore something 
like the .ipv6 domain hack proposal was the only viable approach.  These 
tools vastly outnumber the browsers in the world.

Steve was going to take the []less proposal back to the working group meeting.  
Sounds like the proposal got taken back, but not everyone understood the 
issue (in particular that the browsers were the least of the problem) and 
think that URI syntax changes are feasible....  (wish they were, as URI 
syntax is far from ideal, but reality can be very hard...).

Looks like some further education of the IPV6 community may be in order,
if Steve Deering  or Brian Carpenter thinks that things may go wrong...
