The usage of Content-Location within HTTP is specifically to allow the
specification of which one of some number of alternate versions of an
entity is in this response.  This would appear to me to be in conflict
with the use being suggested by MHTML.  I don't believe that this should
be changed at this late date, so I'd be carefull about assuming that
changes proposed by MHTML will apply to HTTP usage.

You describe the motivation for this as being a multipart message
containing multiple different references to the same entity.  For example,
message contains A, B, and C where A refers to C and B refers to D but D
is really another name for C.  Rather than adding an attribute to C to
give it the additional name (from the HTTP point of view overloading the
semantics of Content-Location), why not add another part to the message
that provides the equivalent of an HTTP redirect.  Something like (for
D):

Content-Type: mime/alternate-name
Location: C
