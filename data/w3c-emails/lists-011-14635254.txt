Thanks Jacob and Jim for digging into this issue.

At a meta level, the basic problem is that putting HTML into Mail
objects leads inevitibly to composing composite objects which then
causes us to rrun up against all the little shortcuts that developers
(of both standards and products) and that makes our separate WGs rub
up against each other in abrasive ways, but that is the nature of
rubbing each other smooth so our users can interwork with our tools.

More directly, after all the work on how to do MHTML for MAIL, we also
discovered interesting uses for composite objects that no one had
thought of, like creating archive objects that record the state of an
every changing composite object (e.g., a weathermap) at a point in
time, and it is very easy to see the value of such use.

And, we can esily see that one might want to ship that archive object
via HTTP, or EMAIL, or even FTP, or SneakerNet, and always get the
same result.

So, back at the meta level, we have discovered that we areally do have
to very seriousl consider our sister protocols and arrange for them to
interwork.

Cheers...\Stef
