The next MHTML draft will say that MHTML applies to the formatting
of MIME composite objects for sending through e-mail, netnews or
HTTP. I think it is obvious that the format of MIME composite
objects should be the same, independent of how they are sent.

A simpler solution might be to have two headers:
Content-Location: .. one single primary location ..
Alternate-Locations: .. list of other locations with the same content ..

I do not quite understand how you are able to designate one location
as the primary one, if you are sending two copies of exactly the
same object, referenced in two different ways. In the case you
describe, how can you say that C is primary and D is secondary?
