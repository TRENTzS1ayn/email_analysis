The point is that a single resource may exist in english and french
versions (or an image in high, medium, and low resolution, etc.) and
based on other information, primarily HTTP header content such as
Accept-language, the server picks one of the versions to return as the
response. The server notifies the client and any intervening caches
that the identity of the response is some other URL via the
Content-location field. In other words, the versions are not the
exact same object.
