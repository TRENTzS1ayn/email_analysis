I don't really want to stir up a firestorm here, but there are several
issues (mostly procedural), I'd like to raise with your statement about
your next draft applying to HTTP...

1) the HTTP working group tries not to lay constraints on the
MHTML group.  In particular, not without negotiation with the
MHTML group.  I suspect we'd like a similar attitude from
the MHTML group.  Hopefully, this discussion is that negotiation...
Our specs certainly makes no statement about HTTP messages
being the format that mail messages must conform to.

2) HTTP is NOT a MIME prototol; it is really a "MIME-like"
protocol, where we've tried not to be gratuitously different.
(not always successfully).  HTTP != mail. 

But thanks for raising the topic, in any case, as this is how
we can avoid being gratuitously different.

3) there is NO requirement that HTTP implementations support
 composite objects (e.g. multipart is NOT a requirement of HTTP).  It was settled 
The HTTP working group long ago that for HTTP, such a 
requirement was both unneeded, and actually 
unwise (for example, the caching consequences), though transmitting 
multipart as the payload of an HTTP message is certainly not 
forbidden in HTTP (and used in a very small number of optional
places).  

So the Content-Location discussion (on the HTTP mailing list, I think,
should be framed in the context of HTTP requests for single objects, 
not the transmission of composite objects (which HTTP really 
doesn't know about at all).

Note that the security issues that attempting to deal with problems
of caching composite objects (as independent, named objects)
are far from trivial for HTTP; you'd have to worry about what
happens if a composite object claims the name of some part
of the namespace not under the origin server's control, for
example.  This is a problem that Mail does not have, but that
would make HTTP's life difficult...  I get headaches just thinking
about the spoofing problems possible, and the problems caching
proxy servers would have implementing such a model....

I therefore question how much the MHTML specification should say about
what goes over HTTP, and am reacting to the the statement in
your paragraph above (possibly not justifiably, since I haven't seen
your not yet released draft or previews of the language). 

Your paranoid HTTP/1.1 editor who'd like
to get to draft standard Real Soon Now...
