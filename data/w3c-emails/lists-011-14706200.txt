Or you could use the equivalent of an external-body part, or a
part that serves as a namespace catalog, or something similar to
the Alternates header field.  This would not be a frequent occurrence,
so the representation could be verbose.

HTTP cannot allow multiple Content-Location header fields unless the
syntax for the field-value is changed to allow multiple URLs separated
by a comma, which in turn would require that each URL be delimited.
Such a change is not going to happen at this point in the process.
