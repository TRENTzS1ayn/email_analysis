It seems clear that we should now explore the idea of having:

No More Than One Content-Base; No More Than One Content-Location; and
Multiple instances of Content-Location-Alternative headers, where-in
it is required that the Content-Location-Alternative values must be
alternative URIs for the exact same content as that which is inclosed
in the same MIME PART of an Compound MHTML Object.

We must remember that all MIME headers must start with "Content-"

}HTTP cannot allow multiple Content-Location header fields unless the

}by a comma, which in turn would require that each URL be delimited.
}Such a change is not going to happen at this point in the process.
