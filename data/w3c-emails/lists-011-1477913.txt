Hey everybody!

After the wg meetings I was reviewing the notes on pipelining in the
connection mgt draft and rfc 2068.
I have a few questions which relate to proxy server behavior..

When a client is talking to a proxy server and is pipelining requests,
should it use a single pipeline connection to issue requests to 
different origin servers ?
ie should GET http://www.ups.com/ HTTP/1.1
   and    GET http://www.fedex.com/ HTTP/1.1 
be sent over the same pipeline or should a new connection be established.
A common occurence of this is when advertisement gifs come from a 
different server than the html file.

I guess the question becomes :
Can requests in the same pipeline be to different origin servers?

With the advent of pipelined persistent connections ( and to a lesser
extend 1.0 keep alives ), the distinction of 'who the client is
talking to' is confusing to me.  Since while the client may be
pipelining to a proxy, and the proxy can go ahead and do an
old style connection to an origin server, how does the client deal
with old responses?
Assuming the answer to the previous question,  is yes...

IE: client pipelines:
  GET http://www.foo.com/ HTTP/1.1
  GET http://www.bar.com/ HTTP/1.1
what happens if foo.com is a 1.1 server ( the proxy can do a
persistent conenction ) and bar.com is 1.0 (proxy cannot)?

Also, when the responses come back to the client, the first is
a 1.1 response, and the second is a 1.0 response ..

How should the client or proxy behave ?
