Do others agree with Roy's analysis?  Is this true in the face of
negotiated resources, where Content-Location might be used to tell you
where the underlying version is found? 

The minimalist in me says if we don't actually need a mechanism, or a different 
mechanism we do need can be used to solve a problem, we shouldn't have it...

And we haven't heard other opinions (e.g. lynx, etc....).  I'd like to hear
from others who've formed opinions.
