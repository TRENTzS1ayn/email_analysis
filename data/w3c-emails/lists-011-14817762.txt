MHTML was mainly meant for the case where two different URLs actually
get to the same physical file. But it could, of course, also be used
in the case of mirrors. This might be very useful, to send an object
with a list of mirror URLs. Sometimes, the sender knows which is
the primary, and could then indicate this. But in many cases, the
poor mail client which produces the message will have no idea which
of several URLs referring to the same physical file is the primary
one.

In that case, there would be no need for multiple Content-Location headers.
So that would not be any problem.
