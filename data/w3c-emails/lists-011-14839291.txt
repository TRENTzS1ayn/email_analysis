Since there is so much discussion about this, I have put up the
latest editing copy of the MHTML standards draft by FTP, in case
one of you HTTP people want to look at it and find if there
are other cases where we have unnecessary discrepancies between
HTTP and MHTML.

You can get the document from URL
<ftp://ftp.dsv.su.se/users/jpalme/draft-ietf-mhtml-rev-04X.txt>

Note: This is not an official IETF draft, and the present text
has not yet been approved by all three editors, but I am putting
it up immediately so that you can see it while the discussion
is current.
