To get them into the mailing list archive (and so that people can
complain if they think the changes are not just of editorial nature).

I'm assigning it editorial issue RONALD.

Here are few typos in the latest draft (draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-01.txt)
I've noticed.


1) Section 10.3.7:

       If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other than
       GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request
       unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might change the
       conditions under which the request was issued.

   ought to be

       If the 307 status code is received in response to a request other than
       GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request
       unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might change the
       conditions under which the request was issued.

   (i.e. "307" instead of "302")


2) Section 14.3:

              Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0; identity=0.5; *;q=0
   ought to be
              Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0, identity;q=0.5, *;q=0

   (various ";" where "," should be used, and a missing ";q").


3) Section 14.48:

              TE: chunked; deflate;q=0.5
   ought to be
              TE: chunked, deflate;q=0.5

   (";" where "," should be used)


  Cheers,

  Ronald
