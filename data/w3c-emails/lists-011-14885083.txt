I don't think we need to decide at this point in time if a revival
changes the semantics or offers the server control over precedence.

That said, it has finally sunk into my thick skull that there is a
semantic difference between Content-location and <base>/Content-base.

The origin for relative URL interpretation is acquired from
Content-location by parsing off the 'file name piece' where as the origin
for <base> is explicit.  The <base>/content-base allows an application
to utilize a relative base for the whole application and to use
relative URL references within the document without consideration of where
a particular page appears within the structure.  Content-location is
an alternative to the request URL and requires that all links within
pages be written with full knowledge of their own context.

I think Content-base should be removed from the specification but I 
did want to note that use of Content-location really isn't equivalent.
