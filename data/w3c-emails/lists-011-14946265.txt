Actually we don't support ANY mechanism which defines base information
outside the scope of the document and it is unlikely that we ever will. It
screws up the protocol stack (as if http-equiv wasn't bad enough) and we
think it is just confusing and unnecessary.

Note that we don't explicitly define the require-uri as the default base,
rather we allow for the concept of references relative to "current
location", whatever that may be. In the case of a net resource, the current
location is its URI.
