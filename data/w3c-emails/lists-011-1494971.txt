  I was unclear - what I meant was that I would like to see the client
  always wait for a 100 response following the headers on a 1.1 POST,
  not just when it is retrying one that was interrupted.

  Our current behaviour is that we will send the 100 Continue after
  reading the headers on any 1.1 POST which we think is ok (it may
  still be rejected if the authentication digest does not check out,
  but we can't know that until we get the body).

JC> BTW: was 'Yoland' meant to be an abbreviation for Yaron Goland ? :)

  Yes, my apologies, Yaron - my fingers are faster than my brain
  sometimes.
