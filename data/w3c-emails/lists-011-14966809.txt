I have submitted a slightly updated version of the main transparent
content negotiation draft, draft-ietf-http-negotiation-05.txt, and
made it available at the usual place:

   http://gewis.win.tue.nl/~koen/conneg/

To make room for independent developments on feature tag registration,
some small changes were made to the feature tag parts of the draft:
feature tags may now be quoted, so that one can use URLs as feature
tags, a reference to work on feature tag registration procedures has
been added, and the syntax has been changed slightly to make
fault-tolerant parsing of feature tags which are URLs easier.

The web page above has also been updated to reflect recent revisions
of other drafts by Ted Hardie.

Koen.
