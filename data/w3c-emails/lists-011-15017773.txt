And to add from the long-expired-but-still-regarded-as-authoritative
CGI Internet Draft (draft-robinson-www-interface-01.txt, 15 February
1996) in section 5 "Environment Variables" (pp. 8):

   "If multiple headers with the same field-name are received then
   they must be rewritten as a single header having the same
   semantics."

Not only must it be *possible* to normalize headers, when running a CGI
program all headers *must* be normalized for its pool of variables.
