Hi Jim -- I think the term you are thinking of is "alternative" as in
Mutipart-alternative, which I believe serves the very same purpose for
EMail use of MIME to present the recipient with different
alternatives.

However, in your case, the "alternates" are not identical content
versions with alternative names, but alternative (i.e., different)
content versions with distinctive names, as should be the case for
different content.

MHTML is trying to specifically ponly deal the case of identical
content with alternative URIs.  

Perhaps the header name "Content-alias:" will better convey the
meaning and also be a distinctive header that will not be coonfused
with other kids of alternatives.

Anyway, I really think we should jointly (MHTML+HTTP) sort these
issues out before you go to DRAFT, cause after that we can't even make
minor changes.

I can certainly appreciate your conceren and desire to ush to the
finish line for DRAFT status, but it seems to me that the payoff from
real INTERWORKABILITY is too great to so easily give it up.

Cheers...\Stef
