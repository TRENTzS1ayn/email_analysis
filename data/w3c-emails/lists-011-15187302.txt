With a couple of minor well specified exceptions HTTP does not deal
with Multipart objects as multipart, but as a single object.  There
are no outer vs inner headers; only one set of headers.  What you
might call inner headers are just part of the data to HTTP. The
content of a MIME Multipart object is no different than the content of
a binary file to HTTP.  An HTTP cache should be no more likely to use
a heading inside a MIME Multipart object than to use a string inside
an object of type application/octet-stream.
