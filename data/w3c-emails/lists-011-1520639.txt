the original post, ie the draft, was from me, and that wasnt what I said.
I meant that the DNS record was a pointer to the PAC URL.

If you meant yaron's original post, then I see your point.
However, it seems that a service location server is inevitable.
It may be SVRLOC or something else, but I've come to accept that
there willl be some sort of svrloc server..

(yes, it suffers from point of failure problems.. )
