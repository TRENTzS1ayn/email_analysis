Seems to me that the problem with this is that you can't enforce "the
client MUST use the nonces in order", partly because multiple
simultaneous connections, for example, could foil the client's best
efforts to obey, by exhibiting variable delay, and partly because the
client may be multithreaded, so synchronizing the sending of the nonces
with each other (as opposed to the acquisition of them, which is
trivially synchronized) would be onerous.

The way to fix this is to say "the client MUST use each nonce at most
once", perhaps? I think this still makes life easy for the server,
right?

Cheers,

Ben.
