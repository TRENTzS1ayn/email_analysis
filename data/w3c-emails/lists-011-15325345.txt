Ah, excellent that you set those forth, because I disagree with the
assumption.

The purpose of Digest is to replace Basic, with its cleartext
passwords.  Basic is already subject to replay attacks.  Digest should
be no more susceptible, and it isn't more susceptible.  By clever
choice of time-limited nonces, it can easily be less so.  But it isn't
perfect.  We've known that for a long time.

So let me hark back to the discussion of a few weeks ago.  Let's not
try to make Digest do something it was not intended to do.  Let's
hold replay-proof Digest for digest-ng discussions.
