Agreed. Another way of saying much the same thing is that HTTP is
stateless by design. Strictly avoiding the reuse of nonces makes it
stateful (at least, I can't see a way of doing it that doesn't).
However, we can get a very similar effect by time-limiting nonces,
without changing the nature of HTTP.

Exactly. Also remember that for those cases where Digest is
insufficient, there is always SSL/TLS.

Cheers,
