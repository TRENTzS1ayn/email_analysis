This is a bit ambiguous: I meant to say that nobody in this working
group is working on changes to the text of
draft-ietf-http-negotiation.  However, some people in the
implementation community *are* working on developing implementatations
of the protocol in this draft.

Thanks to Larry Masinter for pointing out this ambiguity.
