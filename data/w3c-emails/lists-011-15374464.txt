As I mentioned in another message, requiring that nonces are only
accepted once makes HTTP stateful, and will be difficult to implement in
some servers. However, since some servers may want to (at least in some
modes) make this requirement, it would seem we need a mechanism to
support it. It seems to me that the list-of-nonces (unencumbered by any
ordering requirements) is a way to achieve this, which, so long as it is
optional, has no impact on servers and clients that do not wish to
implement it.

I should point out that a server that implements it is likely to have an
awful lot of nonces to track.

Cheers,

Ben.
