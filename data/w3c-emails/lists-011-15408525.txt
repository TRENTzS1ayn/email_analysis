A replayable Digest is by no means as bad as Basic:

1. The replay is likely to be time-limited in any sensible
implementation, unlike in Basic.

2. The replay is only applicable to a single URL, unlike Basic.

3. The attacker is likely to have already seen the content, in the
process of stealing the material necessary for the replay.

Cheers,

Ben.
