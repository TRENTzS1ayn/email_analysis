You can.

Agreed.

I'll limit the obvious snipe to this sentence :-)

Fair enough, but I don't think we can go so far as to mandate the
algorithm, because...

...this, I believe, can only be solved by requiring servers to keep
state, which is a Bad Thing. I have no objection to those servers that
want to (and can) doing this, but I really don't see the point - if you
are _that_ concerned about the content, you should've SSLed it (because
the Bad Guy who is failing to get usephul stuph for a replay attack is
getting the content anyway).

Cheers,

Ben.
