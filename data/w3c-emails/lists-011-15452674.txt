If the client chooses the proxy based on URL it will work because the
URL requested without credentials (which elicits the nonce) will be
the same as the URL requested with credentials.  If the first request
without credentials and the second with credentials are from different
proxies, then you are right it will break.

You could only receive *exactly* the same document indefinitely into
the future as any update of the document changes the ETag.  I don't
see repeatedly obtaining exactly the same document as a problem with
idempotent methods like GET.  Of course, PUT and POST are a different
matter, but I don't think they have ETags.
