Oh wait, I thought we were requiring that nonces never be re-used. If not
then that is cool, the next-nonce header should go into a SEPARATE
specification from the draft digest auth proposal. Since it is 100%
compatible with RFC 2069 and the draft digest auth proposal I don't see any
reason to shove it into the main digest auth spec. It can ride on its own.
