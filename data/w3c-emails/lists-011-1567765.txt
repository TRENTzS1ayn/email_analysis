I recall the change was made to the HTTP spec sometime in 1992.
Perhaps you could state which clients were producing the buggy

I wouldn't bet on people being that smart... If people could produce
buggy  code despite being warned in 1995 they can probably continue 
to do so in 1999. After all the problem will go away in 2000 for the
rest of our lifetime.
