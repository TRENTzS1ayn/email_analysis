I don't think there should be a normative requirement that a timestamp
be used in the nonce. The server owns the nonce and could easily
implement some other mechanism including tracking nonces issued and
setting timelimits, perhaps even a moving window reset with each use.

I have no objection for a SHOULD level requirement that the server
implement some form of replay protection, and I have no objection
to text which describes a timestamp and clock-less server version of
nonce handling which achieves Pauls #2 objective.

All given that the WG otherwise agrees that #2 should be part of
the digest specification.
