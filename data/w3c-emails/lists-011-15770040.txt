You are right.  There was not a consensus to remove 
Authentication-info/nextnonce.

I am sceptical of its utility however.  It would be useful if
a typical session looked like 

 request - response - request - response -  request - response...

rather than

 5 piplined requests - 5 piplined responses

But the latter is much more likely to be typical.
