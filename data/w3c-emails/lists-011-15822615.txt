Do I understand you rightly, that Content-Location for this purpose can
only occur on the outermost header of a HTTP message (or possibly
it could occur on a subobject of Content-Type: message/http?).

The MHTML usage of Content-Location only occurs inside Content-Type:
Multipart/related. Thus, there is in reality no conflict. We could
even say that Content-Location can have multiple values inside
Multipart/related but that only single values are allowed in HTTP headers!

In the MHTML group, we believe that more and more the same objects will be
transported by different protocols. For example, you get a resource through
HTTP from your intranet, and post it via e-mail to someone outside the
intranet who could not otherwise get it because of the firewall.

In these cases, it would be an advantage if the resource need not be
modified to different format in e-mail than in http. Such format changes
might invalidate digital seals and signatures. Thus, we think it would
be nice to recommend (even if not to require) that also in http the following
rules are followed:

(1) Header lines are kept shorter than 76 characters
(2) Header lines can be split into multiple lines
(3) In the special case of long URLs, such can be split into
    multiple lines, and the receiving software should concatenate
    the parts (removing entirely all whitespace) before using the
    URL
(4) Line breaks should be CRLF, not bare CR or bare LF

I think it would be very nice if the HTTP spec referenced the MHTML
spec saying something like this:

   When aggregates of linked objects (for example HTML plus in-line images)
   are transported, they should be formatted using the MHTML standard.
