Certainly HTTP must *allow* all the current variants of document formats
with various end-of-line characters. But the HTTP spec could still
*mention* the problem that security checksums will not work if messages
are converted from HTTP to mail, unless they already in HTTP are in
the canonical form. Security checksums will probably  be more and more
important in the future, and more and more people will want to provide
documents with digital seals and digital signatures, and which can
be moved from HTTP to mail.
