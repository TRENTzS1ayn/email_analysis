Scott,

At last this fine improvement is moving into the spec where
it should have beeen all along.

Please note that a number of http implementations already addressed this
problem not known content length in advance due to dynamic content
generation by padding with spaces on the right of the HEX length.

Your change to the BNF should make space padding on the right explicit 
in order to ensure interoperability of the installed base. Typically, these 
implmentations perform all character translation and chunking using windows into a
single buffer, which on some platforms is the TCP packet.

You can find discussions about this in the working group archives back
about 6-8 months. Roy Fielding proposed some syntax at the time.

When is this spec change expected to be deployed?
