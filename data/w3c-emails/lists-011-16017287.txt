A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

Title: HTTP Remote Variant Selection Algorithm -- RVSA/1.0
Author(s): K. Holtman, A. Mutz
Filename: draft-ietf-http-rvsa-v10-03.txt
Pages: 13
Date: 26-Jan-98

        HTTP allows web site authors to put multiple versions of the
        same information under a single URL.  Transparent content
        negotiation is a mechanism for automatically selecting the
        best version when the URL is accessed.  A remote variant
        selection algorithm can be used to speed up the transparent
        negotiation process. This document defines the remote variant
        selection algorithm with the version number 1.0.

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.

Send a message to:mailserv@ds.internic.net.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-rvsa-v10-03.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
