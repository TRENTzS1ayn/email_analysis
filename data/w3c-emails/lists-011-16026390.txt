A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

Title: Transparent Content Negotiation in HTTP
Author(s): K. Holtman, A. Mutz
Filename: draft-ietf-http-negotiation-06.txt
Pages: 57
Date: 26-Jan-98

        HTTP allows web site authors to put multiple versions of the
        same information under a single URL.  Transparent content
        negotiation is an extensible negotiation mechanism, layered on
        top of HTTP, for automatically selecting the best version when
        the URL is accessed.  This enables the smooth deployment of
        new web data formats and markup tags.

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.

Send a message to:mailserv@ds.internic.net.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-negotiation-06.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
