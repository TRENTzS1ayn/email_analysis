To: IETF working group on HTML in e-mail<mhtml@segate.sunet.se>,http-wg@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com

Why did the HTTP group decide to remove Content-Base from the HTTP
specification? Does this mean that the sender must use the
base element inside the HTML text, in all cases where relative
URLs are not matched by the base taken from the request URI.

If the HTTP group has decided to remove Content-Base, are the
same reasons valid for removing Content-Base from MHTML? The
difference is that when you send by e-mail, you have no request
URI, so this might be a reason why Content-Base is more important
in e-mail than in HTTP.
