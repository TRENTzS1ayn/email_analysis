Certainly you cannot ask people to reformat existing documents.
But a company which buys a WYSIWYG HTML editor like Frontpage
or Pagemill might require that they produce "canonical" HTML
which agrees with both e-mail and HTTP rules. This would allow
company employees to, for example, take pages from the local
Intranet and send them by mail outside of this Intranet,
without having digital seals and signatures broken.

What kind of encoding are you thinking of? E-mail only has Content-
Transfer-Encoding, and this can in e-mail only be applied to individual
body parts, not to a whole multi-part as one single object to be encoded.
Encoding of a whole multipart as a single large object using
Base64 och Quoted-Printable is explicitly forbidden in e-mail.

I am no expert on security issues and in particular how the security
checksums are computed. If security checksums are not to be broken,
then either the original document must be in canonical form, or
all content-transfer-encoding must be removed at receipt *before*
computing a security checksum. In the second case, the algorithm
for applying content-transfer-encoding (before sending by e-mail)
and removing it again (after receipt by e-mail) must be so exact
that the identical octet sequence is returned at receipt.

(1) Are the algorithms for encoding and deconding with content-
transfer-encoding defined exactly enough to ensure this?

(2) Do the security standards say that content-transfer-encoding
is to be removed before computing security checksums?
