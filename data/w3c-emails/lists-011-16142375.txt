I've always found this one of the most annoying things about how
MIME was specified. If all message types must obey the same rules
as an RFC 822 message, then why would you ever need more than
message/rfc822?

HTTP does have the ability to send proper MIME line folding, line breaks,
etc.  However, for various other reasons it might be better to use
application/http instead, particularly when the entire message needs
to be content-transfer-encoded in order to pass through e-mail.
Perhaps we should change the media type, or simply define both?
