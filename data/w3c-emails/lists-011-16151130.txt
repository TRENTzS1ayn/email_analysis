Thanks Roy for punctuating our discussons with very clear marks.

Until we have a very clear conclsion that MHTML and HTTP do not collide, it
continued to make me very nervous about havig to recycles again at
Proposed.
none of us want that to happen, and none of us want to later be found to
have ignored any collision that should hav been found at this stage.

Per your suggestions that MHTML might be further simplified, I suggest that
our editing team lok very carfully at your suggestions to see if we can use
them as you predict.

Cheers...\Stef
