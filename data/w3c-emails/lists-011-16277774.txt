    Chunking has very low overhead.  From the point of view of efficiency

      Content-length: 123456
  <123456 bytes of data>
    
    and 
    
      Content-encoding: chunked

Unfortunately, there is a slight correctness difference here!

rom 3.6.1, "The chunk-size field is a string of hex digits"
so the correct form is

      Content-encoding: chunked

      1E240
          <123456 bytes of data>
      0

Otherwise, I agree entirely with John.  (And note that parsing
hex numbers is usually less expensive than parsing decimals,
by a few instruction cycles.)
