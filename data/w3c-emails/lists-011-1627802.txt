  Our server does send a 100 Continue under those conditions; the rule
  I would like to see stated more directly is that:

    When sending a request with a body to a server it has reason to
    believe implements HTTP/1.1, a client SHOULD send the headers and
    then wait for a 100 Continue or an error status before
    transmitting the body of the request.

  the current spec essentially says this only for the case where the
  client is retrying a request, not for the first attempt.
