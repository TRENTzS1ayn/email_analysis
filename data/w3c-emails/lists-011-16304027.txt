I was only referring to single parts.  The message type has its own
encoding restrictions, which is why it may be more appropriate to
recommend use of "application/http" even though the semantics of
"message/http" seemed like the right choice at the time.

This is actually fairly important, since it determines the most likely
method of performing WebDAV operations via E-mail.  The other advantage
of "application/http" is that it can be defined as a pipeline of requests
or a pipeline of responses.
