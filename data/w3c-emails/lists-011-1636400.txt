Here's something that has puzzled me about HTTP server
implementations.  What happens if the server encounters an error after
it sends, say, a "200 OK" response and part of the entity body?
Example cases include an origin server that gets a timeout from a CGI
part way through relaying the CGI's output, or when a proxy acts as a
pure relay and, for example, its connection to the next hop server (is
that upstream or downstream? :-) breaks.  The server has no way to
signal to its client that the previously claimed success has now turned
into an error.
