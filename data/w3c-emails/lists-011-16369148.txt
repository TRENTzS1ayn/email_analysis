In reality, it is easier and more reliable to deploy a protocol that
is backwards compatible.  HTTP/1.0 was almost as complex as HTTP/1.1 --
the only big difference is that HTTP/1.0 was unable to accomplish what
it tried to do, whereas HTTP/1.1 is barely sufficient without making
incompatible changes.

Keep in mind that HTTP is intended for many more applications than
just the one that you are working on today.  Even with all of its
apparent complexity, it is still possible to write a simple HTTP server
in just a few hours, and a simple HTTP client in a few days.  The
complexity is only needed by complex applications, such as caching,
but failure to account for that complexity results in failed systems.

Kia ora,
