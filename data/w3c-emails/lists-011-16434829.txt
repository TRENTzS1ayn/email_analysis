Sure, you could do that.  You'd just have to encode it a layer up.  If
you had the equivalent of:

Content-type: message/http
Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary

[binary data]

and you wanted to send it through email as a message/http type, you
could do something like this:

Content-type: message/rfc822
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

Q29udGVudC10eXBlOiBtZXNzYWdlL2h0dHAKQ29udGVudC1UcmFuc2Zlci1FbmNvZGlu
ZzogYmluYXJ5CgpbYmluYXJ5IGRhdGFdCg==

When you decoded this, you'd have the original message/http data.  

What's less clear to me is *why* you'd want to do this....  -- Nathaniel
