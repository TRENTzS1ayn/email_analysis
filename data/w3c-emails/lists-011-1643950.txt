OK, don't laugh... For CGI, WebSite spools the output by default (you can 
disable it) into a file which is implemented as a privately backed block of 
expandable virtual memory. This has a few advantages and the obvious CPU/disk 
hit and reduction of capacity. The advantages are (1) you can rewind the 
output stream and send a non-200 response at any time, and (2) Keep-Alive is 
retained without chunking because you can get the content-length. The latter 
"advantage" will fade with time, of course.
