Technically yes.  However to make the 'reauth request' actually
work and be useable, both are necessary from a system view.

1) the server needs a way to send a message to the client saying
  please revalidate your credentials with the user
2) the server needs a way to detect that the client has
   or is at least claiming to knowingly complete the task
   (revalidate the credentials)

So, I guess Im lumping two things together in a sense.  I see the
 second part as an infrastructure item needed by the first to make it
 useable.

(else how would you know if the client actually revalidated?)
