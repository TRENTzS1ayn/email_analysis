  I know that I sound like a broken record here, but the minimal
  requirement is to instruct the user agent to discard the current
  credentials - whether or not it should then obtain new ones depends
  on whether or not it has another request to send that requires
  them, which might be immediatly or next month.

  A 'Logout' function does not require that new credentials be
  obtained - in fact, doing so would defeat the very purpose of
  discarding the current set.

  A 'Revalidate' function can be accomplished by instructing the user
  agent to discard current credentials in any redirection or
  authentication-required response.

  But the assurance means nothing; in neither case can the server know
  anything about what the user agent did.
