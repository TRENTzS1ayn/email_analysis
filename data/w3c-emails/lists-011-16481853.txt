  I have updated the W3C Implementors Forum page to list many of the
  regular participants in these tests, including several servers (both
  origin and proxy) that are available most or all of the time.

  Test Day Ground Rules:

    - Participating systems may be configured to allow access only by
      announced participants for that week (if you will be using a
      dynamically assigned IP address, indicate this and try to
      specify the range from which it will be chosen).

    - Participants will, on request, make a reasonable effort to
      provide whatever relevant log or trace data they have to other
      participants to resolve problems.

    - If a problem or possible issue with another participant
      implementation is found, that issue will be communicated to the
      contact for that implementation promptly.  Only if the
      involved participants disagree on the correct behavior or if
      the involved participants agree to do so will the issue be
      brought to the working group mailing list.

    - Any other disclosure of problems found with other
      implementations during these tests is poor form.

    - Communicating positive results to other participants is
      strongly encouraged.

  Additional suggestions welcome.
