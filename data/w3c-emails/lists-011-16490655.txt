[This proposal has been circulated among the editorial group
with no dissent.  -Jeff]

Most of the changes below are editorial, in that they clarify
the language of the specification but don't actually make any
normative changes.  The only real normative change is that
we require the use "chunked" to delimit any other kind of
transfer-coding.  We also remove the "proxies MUST NOT
modify Content-Length" rule, which makes no sense when
combined with (for example) "Transfer-Encoding: gzip".

I think we need to clean up the terminology in 14.36.1 (Byte Ranges),
but that's probably a separate editorial issue.

The following edits are based on draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-01.txt,
which you might need to refer to when reviewing these edits.

(1) In section 3.6 (Transfer Codings), after:
       All transfer-coding values are case-insensitive. HTTP/1.1 uses
       transfer coding values in the TE header field (section 14.48) and
       in the Transfer-Encoding header field (section 14.40).

Add (as a new paragraph) [NORMATIVE CHANGES]:
Whenever a transfer-coding other than "identity" is applied to
a message-body, the set of transfer-codings MUST include
"chunked", unless the message is terminated by closing the
connection.  When the "chunked" transfer-coding is used, it
MUST be the last transfer-coding applied to the message-body.
The "chunked" transfer-coding MUST NOT be applied more than
once to a message-body.  These rules allow the recipient to
determine the transfer-length of the message (section 4.4).

(2) In section 4.4 (Message Length), insert at the beginning:
The transfer-length of a message is the length of the
message-body as it appears in the message; that is, after any
transfer codings have been applied.

Change
When a message-body is included with a message, the length of
that body is determined by one of the following (in order of
precedence):
To
When a message-body is included with a message, the
transfer-length of that body is determined by one of
the following (in order of precedence):

Change
 2. If a Transfer-Encoding header field (section 14.40) is
 present and indicates that the "chunked" transfer coding has
 been applied, then the length is defined by the chunked
 encoding (section 3.6).
To
 2. If a Transfer-Encoding header field (section 14.40) is
 present and indicates that any non-identity transfer
 coding has been applied, then the transfer-length is defined
 by use of the "chunked" transfer coding (section 3.6),
 unless the message is terminated by closing the connection.

Change
 3. If a Content-Length header field (section 14.14) is
 present, its decimal value in OCTETs represents the length of
 the message-body.
To
 3. If a Content-Length header field (section 14.14) is
 present, its decimal value in OCTETs represents both the
 entity-length and the transfer-length.  The Content-Length
 header field MUST NOT be used if these two lengths are
 different (i.e., if a Transfer-Encoding header field is
 present).

Change
 4. If the message uses the media type "multipart/byteranges",
 which is self-delimiting, then that defines the length. This
 media type MUST NOT be used unless the sender knows that the
 recipient can parse it; the presence in a request of a Range
 header with multiple byte-range specifiers implies that the
 client can parse multipart/byteranges responses.
To
 4. If the message uses the media type "multipart/byteranges"
 and the transfer-length is not otherwise specified, then this
 self-delimiting media type defines the transfer-length. This
 media type MUST NOT be used unless the sender knows that the
 recipient can parse it; the presence in a request of a Range
 header with multiple byte-range specifiers implies that the
 client can parse multipart/byteranges responses.

Change
       Messages MUST NOT include both a Content-Length header field and
       the "chunked" transfer coding. If both are received, the
       Content-Length MUST be ignored.
To
       Messages MUST NOT include both a Content-Length header field and
       a non-identity transfer coding.  If the message does include
       a non-identity transfer code, the Content-Length header field
       MUST be ignored.

(3) Change section 7.2.2 from

7.2.2 Length

The length of an entity-body is the length of the message-body
after any transfer codings have been removed. Section 4.4
defines how the length of a message-body is determined.

To
7.2.2 Entity-Length

The entity-length of a message is the length of the
message-body before any transfer codings have been applied.
Section 4.4 defines how the transfer-length of a message-body
is determined.

(4) In section 13.5.2 (Non-modifiable Headers)

Change [NORMATIVE CHANGE]:
A cache or non-caching proxy MUST NOT modify any of the
following fields in a response:
 
  .  Expires
  .  Content-Length
 
but it may add any of these fields if not already present. If an
Expires header is added, it MUST be given a field-value
identical to that of the Date header in that response. If a
Content-Length header is added, it MUST correctly reflect the
length of the entity-body.
 
  Note: a typical reason for adding the Content-Length header is
  that the origin server sent the content chunked encoded.
 
To
A cache or non-caching proxy MUST NOT modify any of the
following fields in a response:
 
  .  Expires
 
but it may add any of these fields if not already present. If an
Expires header is added, it MUST be given a field-value
identical to that of the Date header in that response.
 
at the end of section 13.5.2, add this new paragraph:

The Content-Length field of a request or response is added or
deleted according to the rules in section 4.4.  A cache or
non-caching proxy MUST preserve the entity-length (section
7.2.2) of the entity-body, although it MAY change the
transfer-length (section 4.4).

(5) In section 14.14 (Content-Length)

Change
The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of
the message-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the
recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the
entity-body that would have been sent had the request been a
GET.
To
The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of
the entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the
recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the
entity-body that would have been sent had the request been a
GET.

[NB: there is exactly one word changed above.]

Change
Applications SHOULD use this field to indicate the size of the
message-body to be transferred, regardless of the media type
of the entity. It must be possible for the recipient to
reliably determine the end of HTTP/1.1 requests containing an
entity-body, e.g., because the request has a valid
Content-Length field, uses Transfer-Encoding: chunked or a
multipart body.
To
Applications SHOULD use this field to indicate the
transfer-length of the message-body, unless this is prohibited
by the rules in section 4.4.

Change
 Note: The meaning of this field is significantly different
 from the corresponding definition in MIME, where it is an
 optional field used within the "message/external-body"
 content-type. In HTTP, it SHOULD be sent whenever the
 message's length can be determined prior to being
 transferred.

(6) In section 14.17 (Content-Range), change all occurrences
of "entity-length" to "instance-length".  (The non-terminal
"entity-length" appears nowhere else in the -rev-01 version
of the HTTP/1.1 specification.)
