[Cc-ed to http-wg as a courtesy.  Discussion to take place on http-state.]

The above I-D was released on Jan 27.  If there are no comments by the
end of Friday, Feb 6, I would like to declare discussion of the
protocol-only aspects of the draft closed at that time.  Thereafter (or
whenever those discussions end), we will return to the discussion of
the privacy aspects, and discussion of the protocol aspects will be out
of bounds.
