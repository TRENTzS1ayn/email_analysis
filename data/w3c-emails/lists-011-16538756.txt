    This confused me ... "indicates that any non-identity transfer coding

    clearer to say:
    
      2. If a Transfer-Encoding header field (section 14.40) is
      present and has any value other than "identity", then
              the transfer-length is defined

I think Ben's proposal makes sense, although I don't
think anyone would (or should) ever send
Transfer-Encoding: identity

although the spec doesn't explicitly say this.  It does say
that the "identity" content-coding "SHOULD NOT be used in
Content-Encoding header", but the same statement is not repeated
with respect to the "identity" transfer-coding and Transfer-Encoding.
However, I think this was Henrik's intention, and perhaps we need
to add that statement.

At about the same time, Roy Fielding wrote:

    Is there any way to say the same thing without referring to
    "identity" as a transfer coding?  It is far less confusing to say
    "no transfer coding", in my opinion.
    
although I don't think Roy had seen Ben's message (judging from the
Date headers on their messages, if I did the math right).

Unless we are going to say that "identity" "MUST NOT be used
in a Transfer-Encoding header" then I think Ben's is the clearest
way to put things.  If we were to ban the sending of
Transfer-Encoding: identity
then I guess we could simply say
      2. If a Transfer-Encoding header field (section 14.40) is
      present, then the transfer-length is defined
      by use of the "chunked" transfer coding (section 3.6),
      unless the message is terminated by closing the connection.
    
But I think there is no specific reason to include an outright
ban on "Transfer-Encoding: identity".
