The MHTML group will probably want to handle Content-Base in the same
way as the HTTP group. We understand that the HTTP group has decided
to remove the Content-Base header field, and we will probably do the
same.

Question: RFC 2068 did contain a Content-Base header. How will
this circumstance be handled in the new HTTP standard?

(1) Write nothing at all about Content-Base.

(2) Mention somewhere that an earlier version of this standard
    had a header Content-Base hwich has been removed.

(3) Indicate Content-Base as an obsolete syntax, which servers
    are recommended to accept for receipt during an interim
    period, but not use in new HTTP headers.
