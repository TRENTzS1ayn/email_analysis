Hello,

I understand that HTTP is a request/response protocol that normally
works over a single connection where the client (browser) creates the
connection and the server closes it after sending the response.

My question is: does the server _ever_ initiate a connection to a client
that requires that the client to have previously established a listener
socket or does the HTTP server _always_ return responses over the
connection that was established by the client?

Thanks in advance,
