This is implicit in the current (rev-01) draft, but I think it
could be made explicit:

In section 3.6 (Transfer Codings), after:
       The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a
       registry for transfer-coding value tokens. Initially, the
       registry contains the following tokens: "chunked" (section
       3.6.1), "identity" (section 3.6.2), "gzip" (section 3.5),
       "compress" (section 3.5), and "deflate" (section 3.5).

Add this paragraph:

       The "identity" transfer-coding is used only in the TE
       header, and SHOULD NOT be used in the Transfer-Encoding
       header.

Also, in section 3.5, there's a minor grammatical error in the
existing analogous statement:

       identity
    The default (identity) encoding; the use of no
    transformation whatsoever. This content-coding is used only
    in the Accept-Encoding header, and SHOULD NOT be used in
    Content-Encoding header.

should be:

       identity
    The default (identity) encoding; the use of no
    transformation whatsoever. This content-coding is used only
    in the Accept-Encoding header, and SHOULD NOT be used in
    the Content-Encoding header.
            ^^^
