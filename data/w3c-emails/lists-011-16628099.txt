The latest version of the cookie spec. is available via the
Internet Drafts directory and from my usual repository:
http://portal.research.bell-labs.com/~dmk/cookie-ver.html

Copies are available with change bars from the previous I-D and from
RFC 2109.

state-man-mec-07 is the culmination of the discussions concerning
the "wire protocol" aspects of RFC 2109+.  Further discussion will
focus on privacy/security aspects ONLY.  I hope to submit a new
I-D soon that restores the words for those pieces.
