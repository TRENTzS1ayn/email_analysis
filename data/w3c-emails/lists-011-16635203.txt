We are developing a transparent web proxy, such that a browser does not
necessarily know that it is sending requests through a proxy. I have
inherited the Web proxy code from a contractor who left. It turns out,
that our Proxy only supports HTTP/1.0 and will reject any requests for
HTTP/1.1  Looking at the Netscape Proxy server, it seems to have some
way of 'downgrading' the Browser to HTTP/1.0 as a stopgap measure. 

My question: Is there a document / RFC somwhere which explains how we
are supposed to do this ? 

I haven't been able to find anything so far.
