If CGI outgput is spooled, doesn't that defeat the purpose of chunked
encoding for CGI output?

I share your concern about errors that occur after the 200 response. I
can't think of any way to signal a problem except to close the connection
before the final chunk length of 0 is transmitted. This would work, of
course, but it would be nice if the server could give some indication of
the nature of the problem.

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come
up with a better one.
