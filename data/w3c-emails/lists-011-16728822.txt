I don't think this is a 'political' ; it is just not very helpful. In a handbook
of good
practices for site security, 'use of cryptography' is just one of a large number
of
things that need to be done judiciously. In fact, I could imagine for a proxy
cache
that the main thing to do is to limit remote access.
