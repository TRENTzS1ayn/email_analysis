Hi!

As I see it, if only your transparent proxy returns a HTTP/1.0-response it
would 
downgrade the client correctly. If it totally rejects a request just
because it's HTTP/1.1,
there is probably just some stupid strcmp(lastpartofrequest,"HTTP/1.0")
somewhere.
I've seen that before on some webservers.

On the other hand, I can't see why a transparent HTTP/1.1-proxy would be
impossible.
I just wrote one myself (transparently proxies socks port 80) and it seems
to work.
It will rather upgrade on both sides to 1.1 than downgrade to 1.0, and IMHO
it works like a charm.
So, I nervously wonder, what paragraph of RFC2068 did I just break, who's
the victim,
and what's the verdict? :)

TIA for comments.
