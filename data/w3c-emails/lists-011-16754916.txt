Hmm, I think you are using `clients' to mean `user agents' here.  A
suggested rewrite:

15.6 Authentication Credentials and Idle Users

Existing HTTP user agents typically retain user-supplied
authentication information indefinately. HTTP/1.1 lacks a facility to
force reauthentication of users, which may have been idle for extended
periods, by an origin server or a proxy. This is considered a
significant defect that requires further additions to HTTP, and is
under separate study. There are a number of work-arounds to parts of
this problem, including terminating the user agent in order to clear
all accumulated authentication credentials.  We encourage the use of
password protected screen savers on systems which run such user
agents to mitigate some of the resulting security problems.


This still does not spell out the actual problem scenario involved,
which is that a user walks away after which a malicious other user
takes control of his user agent, so I guess it can be improved still
further.

Koen.
