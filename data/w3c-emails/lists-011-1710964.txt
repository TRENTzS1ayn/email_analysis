We don't have sticky headers in HTTP/1.1.  (I think we should, but that's
another discussion.)

If we did have them, then the rules for multiplexing such requests
over a proxy would have to be specified carefully.  In fact,
earlier versions of the hit-metering draft did do something like
this, but people talked me out of using anything sticky in
the hit-metering design.

I believe that the solution is not extremely complex, but it wouldn't
be a total no-brainer, either.  Let's worry about this in HTTP/1.2.
