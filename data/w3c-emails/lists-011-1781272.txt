Here is one of the problems which seems to show up too much.  Issuers of
indirect (I like this term better than unverifiable) transactions are
not collecting data about individuals.  We do not have any method other
than direct registration on our site or another site sharing the
information, to understand "who" a viewer is.  We set cookies in
user-agents.  We do not know the individual!  Part of the fear of
privacy violation is that we can track someone down, get their phone
number, etc. and this is not true.  So, we collect data about the
behavior of people who use and potentially share a web browser, but we
do NOT know who that person is. In no cases have we ever found a web
site who is willing to share information about registered users.  One of
the big issues is what do the sites who issue verifiable transaction
cookies do with their information.  If they were to provide us with
their registered users' data and the IDs of the issued cookies, we could
completely skirt the issue of unverifiable transactions (with some
work).  So, there are ways around this.

How...tripleclick does not have access to names and phonenumbers unless
someone gives it to them.  This
kind of information cannot be extrapolated from IP address.

I honestly believe that once again the big issue is for people to
understand exactly what are the potential breaches of privacy and how
they can occur. Let's face it, the Ad networks are interested in
tracking user behavior, no secret there....however, there are limits to
what we can and would do with this information.  

It is our policy to completely disclose how we use cookie data (and this
will show up on our web site in the near future). I also believe that
other Ad networks disclose this information. 

I personally would accept the certification process if this is the only
alternative.  One issue with this is how fast can sites be certified,
what are the criteria, and how much will it cost?  

I would prefer an easier solution which I assume has been discussed
(please excuse my late entrance into this mailing list and my potential
ignorance of history) which is to make the default for user-agents to
accept all cookies with the ability to turn off unverifiable
transactions if desired. 

Can anyone from the companies providing browsers give a company position
on what they intend to do with respect to RFC 2109 and the default of
turning off unverifiable transactions.
