Well, independant of whether Content-Length belongs in the footer, I was
uncomfortable with the side-effect usage proposed earlier. What you
proposed above is close to what I was thinking of suggesting.

An alternate less modest proposal ....

       0
       Reset-Response: xxx abcde asdl
       CRLF

Where the xxx... is a status code and interpretation.  With appropriate
status codes (appropriate to be defined), a replacement response would
immediately follow and might be a full error response with optional
content.  This approach appeals to me because is allows for the maximum
amount of communication between the server and the user for problem
understanding/ resolution.

Yeah .... I agree ... either of these may be out of scope for the
transition we are facting from propsed->draft.
