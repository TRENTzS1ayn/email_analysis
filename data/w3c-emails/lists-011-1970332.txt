I absolutely agree. There is nothing to stop a CGI programmer from
generating appropriate Expires: and Cache-control: headers. In fact, I
don't know why a  server couldn't have an option feature to disable
caching of resources with URLs matching *.cgi, http://domain/cgi-bin/*,
etc. But by all means, make this optional.
