Actually, those words were mine.

That's different.  A proxy can collect the entire chunked response and, once
successful, can add a Content-Length header in the message headers (and eliminate
chunking).  If there's a Content-Length as a footer, then we have to decide what
to do if that length disagrees with the entity body length gathered through
chunking.  Jeff Moguls's solution, "consider the response to be broken", is one
choice.  Another possibility is "disregard the (obviously wrong) header".
