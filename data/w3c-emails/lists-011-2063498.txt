What about Last-modified?  In my use of cgi-bin programs to generate
pages for HyperNews forums and messages, I don't know about the
future, but I know about the past.  Caching is possible, but
If-Modified-Since requests should always be used by cache servers to
find out if there has been a change.  So neither Expires nor max-age
will do what I want.
