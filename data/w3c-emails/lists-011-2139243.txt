    I'm a bit confused with the proposed addition. I thought 
       
       Cache-Control: public
    
    would be enough, but that's not explicitly stated.
    
The "public" directive was intended for a different purpose.  From
RFC2068:

    public
      Indicates that the response is cachable by any cache, even if it
      would normally be non-cachable or cachable only within a
      non-shared cache. (See also Authorization, section 14.8, for
      additional details.)

While simply adding "Cache-control: public" to a response does
imply that it is cachable, this doesn't say enough.  I.e., how
long is the response "fresh"?  It seems more useful, in general,
to use
Cache-control: max-age=3600
(or whatever), since this also implies cachability, but it also
gives more explicit information to the cache.
