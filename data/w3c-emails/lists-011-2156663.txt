I don't have a problem with adding something which has
a well-defined meaning with the caveat that some recipients
might not "understand" it. The problem is that allowing for
1xx responses outside of the context of a request would
make them ambiguous where they are not now ambiguous.

Now, if a client has sent two pipelined requests, gets one
response, and then a 1xx response, it would be ambiguous as to
whether the server intended the 1xx response to be associated
with the second request or to be interpreted outside of
the context of that request.

If we (continue to) disallow 1xx responses outside of
the context of a specific request, then the context of
the response is not ambiguous.
