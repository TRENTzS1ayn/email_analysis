Your experience may depend on what origin servers your proxy acts as
proxy for.  None of the (HTTP/1.0) CGIs I've written (on Unix systems)
produce any headers that would indicate anything about cachability.
But they also don't contain Last-Modified.  I think that's typical of
Unix-based servers and their CGIs.

However, I just poked an Apache (1.2b7) server with a CGI and found it
produces:

Cache-Control: no-cache
Expires: Tue, 01 Jan 1980 00:00:00 GMT
Last-Modified: Tue, 01 Jan 1980 00:00:00 GMT

So maybe that's why things largely seem to work.
