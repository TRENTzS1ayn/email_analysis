I don't think that would be right. Ari: sorry for mentioning this, but
that seems to be a good example: the URL http://home.netscape.com/ does
not contain Last-Modified header, but at our campus couple of users often
visit this site. I don't want our backbone congested by this traffic since
this page doesn't change in every minute or so.

Cheers,
Bertold
