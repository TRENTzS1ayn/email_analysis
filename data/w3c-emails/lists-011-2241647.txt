As promised in Memphis, here is the text of the clarifications I
proposed.  

STATUS100 Message transmission requirements may need clarification (rlgray)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.1 Informational 1xx

Is:
---
This class of status code indicates a provisional response, consisting only
of the Status-Line and optional headers, and is terminated by an empty line.

Proposed:
---------
This class of status code indicates a provisional response, consisting only
of the Status-Line and optional headers, and is terminated by an empty line.
| There are no required headers for this class of status codes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14.19 Date

Is:
---
However, since the date--as it is believed by the origin--is important for
evaluating cached responses, origin servers MUST include a Date header field
in all responses.

Proposed:
---------
However, since the date--as it is believed by the origin--is important for
evaluating cached responses, origin servers MUST include a Date header field
| in all responses, except those with 1xx status.
