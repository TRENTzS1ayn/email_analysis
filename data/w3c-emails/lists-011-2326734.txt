The most frequent case for our implementation at least will, I suspect, 
be when the server has configured different realms for serving and 
submitting a form.  This turns out to be a common situation in an 
embedded system because it saves memory and simplifies interface design; 
the same page is used to display current configuration information and to 
change it, but the authentication required is different.
