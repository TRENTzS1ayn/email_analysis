I am not interested in revisiting two years worth of discussions just
because people have forgotten why it exists.  That is what the mailing
list archive is for.  We cannot discard "100 Continue" because the
implementations have already been deployed and it is known to be useful
in situations where the client doesn't want (for whatever reason) to
send the data before it knows that the URL is correct, that it accepts
the method being used, and that it doesn't require some additional form
of authentication.  It is trivial for the server to implement (see
Apache 1.2b*) and trivial for a client to implement (just ignore it) --
the only difficult implementation is one that makes use of the
reliability feature, and for them the difficulty is worth it.
