No, we could do that already.  The reason for it is so that a client
which knows that it is talking to an HTTP/1.1 server can at least
determine that the action part of the request is OK before it sends
all the data, since that is important for some applications.  After all,
HTTP is used for more things than just GETs and filling-out HTML forms.
