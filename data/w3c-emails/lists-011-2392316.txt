I believe that this is dependent on the nature of the request, and thus
should be determined by the user agent and not by the protocol.  This is
why the 100 response is required from an HTTP/1.1 server, instead of
being optional, so that a user agent can be selective in deciding whether
to wait for the round trip.

Because of interactions with HTTP/1.0 and proxies, I do not expect this
to be useful except for specialized applications, or until all HTTP/1.0
are outside the operating domain.  Nevertheless, 100 was added because
it was something that some HTTP applications needed to express, but
couldn't be expressed in HTTP/1.0.
