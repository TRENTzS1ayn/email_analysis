rom the Memphis minutes:

-- After consulting the language in use in RFC822, Koen Holtman will
   also draft an editorial correction on the use of LWS in headers
   like VIA.

Here is the editorial correction, taken from a slide I showed in
Memphis.  New/changed text is marked with ** **.  This is a correction
to section 2.1 of the 1.1 spec.

 implied *LWS

     The grammar described by this specification is word-based. Except
     where noted otherwise, linear whitespace (LWS) can be included
     between any two adjacent words (token or quoted-string), and
     between adjacent tokens and **tspecials**, without changing the
     interpretation of a field. At least one delimiter (**LWS and/or**
     tspecials) must exist between any two tokens, since they would
     otherwise be interpreted as a single token.

Koen.
