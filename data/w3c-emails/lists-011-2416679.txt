rom the Memphis minutes:

 -- Koen Holtman
    will draft a clarification that a qvalue of 0.0 means "Don't send
    me this."

The clarification (taken from the slide I showed in the Memphis
evening session) is one new sentence in section 3.9 of the 1.1 spec.
The new sentence is between ** **.

 3.9 Quality Values

   HTTP content negotiation (section 12) uses short "floating point"
   numbers to indicate the relative importance ("weight") of various
   negotiable parameters. A weight is normalized to a real number in the
   range 0 through 1, where 0 is the minimum and 1 the maximum value.
   **If a parameter has a quality value of 0, then content with this
   parameter is `not acceptable' for the client.**
   HTTP/1.1 applications MUST NOT generate more than three digits after
   the decimal point. User configuration of these values SHOULD also be
   limited in this fashion.

Koen.
