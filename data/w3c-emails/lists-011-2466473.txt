We still have a discrepancy on the delivered filename.  In general
the MUA tries to name the current stream based on the URI.  This leads to
unknown file types on the client system.  Based on messages in the archives,
maintainers are concerned that this will be compounded by groupware users and
others who want to share common files but the files are generated or retrieved
by an engine and not a straight URI.

IMHO, we should put these concerns in 1.1.  Since the MUA is acting our behalf,
shouldn't it obey a variant of the first law of robotics?
