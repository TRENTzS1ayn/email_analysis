The 13% may be too pessimistic.

Another data point: about 2 years ago, I measured the amount of text/*
data in the HTTP traffic between our campus proxy cache and outside
servers, this turned out to be 30%.  As text/* data generally
compresses with a factor of 75%, compression would lead to savings of
30%*0.75 = 23% for total off-campus traffic.

Also, compressing HTML pages may increase the perceived speed by more
than this percentage because it would allow browsers to render the
layout and start loading inlines (or subframes) earlier.

By the way, we really need more datapoints on this, and on other
proposed optimisations.
