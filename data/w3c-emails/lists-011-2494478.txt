unfortunately WEB statistics are a moving target. Web pages nowadays
are much different than they were two years ago. We have moved from
1-2 inline graphics to the dozen that you can find on many such
pages.

well, consider that modems also compress data, so the savings are not
as large as one could think. And, going along these lines, one would
then move to a binary HTTP and binary tags for HTML...

personally my feeling is that compression is an orthogonal problem,
which is already addressed at many layers (network; file system;
source encoding).  A content provider has all the interest to
provide compressed data.  If he chose not so, probably he'll pay
the consequence in the long term (because of user dissatisfaction),
and it is not the proxy code which has to take care of this.

Agreed.
