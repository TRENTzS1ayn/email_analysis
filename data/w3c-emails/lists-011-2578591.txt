While I understand and sympathize with the issue here (I've already
got too many clocks in my home, I don't need more to reset twice a
year!), I find it suprising that TCP can be implemented on a system that
has no timing facilities.  For that matter, don't many (most?) embedded
systems have a real-time kernel, with a timer-based dispatcher?  Or am I
mistaking a timer for a time-of-day-and-date clock?
