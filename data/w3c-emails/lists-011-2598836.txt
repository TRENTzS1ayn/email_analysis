Most modem dial-up links employ PPP to initiate their connection and PPP
compression, as implemented in Win95 and NT, negates most if not all of the
effects of modem (v.42bis) compression.

A bigger-picture issue for compressing HTML is the potential to reduce the
number of IP packets traveling over those 'hops'. This is an effect that
neither PPP nor modem compression can offer. The fewer packets handled at
each hop, the more capacity available for other traffic at those hops and
thus, more overall network improvement. That is, the raw 'local' efficiency
of the compression is not the only benefit, even when that efficiency is
relatively low.
