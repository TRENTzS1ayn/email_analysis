Don't underestimate the modem compression. When moving highly compressible
(textual) data it can easily double to triple throughput in my experience.

Even without the modem compression you are only talking on the order of a
7.5% savings - or about 3/4 of a second difference on a ten second load -
for a typical web page with a mix of about 30K of text and graphics
combined. This seems to me to be chasing the point of diminishing returns.
