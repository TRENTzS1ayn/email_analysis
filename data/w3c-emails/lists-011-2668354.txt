One note here: the size distribution of pages stored in web caches
will not in general equal the size distribution of the pages
transported over the HTTP link.  Especially if you have a cache
replacement algorithm which takes the size of the page into account.

And it is the properties of the traffic over the link (usually the
upstream link these days, unless you have a slow modem) we are
interested in.

For those who have time to do statistics, I suggest using Digital's
Web Proxy Traces at
