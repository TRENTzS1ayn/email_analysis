For what it's worth, we recently did some analysis of the logs from
Microsoft's corporate proxies. For static HTML, there were approximately
77,000 hits, and the average size was 6882 bytes. For HTML that we
believe was dynamically generated there were approx. 74,500 hits with an
average size of 7419.
