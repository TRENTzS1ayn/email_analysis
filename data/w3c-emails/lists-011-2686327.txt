The interpretation of q=0 is a general thing, so it belongs in the
general section as far as I am concerned.  And servers do not send
qvalues in HTTP/1.1.  They do send them under TCN, but such a qs=0 will
still mean that the content is not acceptable for the client.

I'm willing to change my proposal from 

 is `not acceptable' for the client

to

 will be `not acceptable' for the client

but I think it would be a mistake to move this to the Accept* sections.
