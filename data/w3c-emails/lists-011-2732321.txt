This reminds me: if you are a browser vendor implementing (some parts
of) 2109, please do *not* use language like

  [X] disable cookies in unverifiable transactions 

in your preference setting panels.  It is not only ugly, it is
imprecise as well, because 2109 talks about the option

  [X] disable cookies in unverifiable transactions on domains which
      do not domain-match the domain of the origin transaction.

`unverifiable transaction' is fine terminology for specs (disclaimer:
I believe I invented it), but in end-user applications you should say
something like

  [X] disable third-party cookies


Thanks,

Koen.
