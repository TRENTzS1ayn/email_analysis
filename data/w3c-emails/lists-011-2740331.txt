I would really hope that any browser vendor would do a much better job
of providing a user interface than any of the above variants. There is
NO WAY Joan Average-User has any way of understanding:
     "unverifiable transaction"
     "domain"
     "domain match"
     "origin transaction"
Etc.  Therefore, informed consent would be impossible.

Actually 'unverifiable transaction' is bad spec termnology as it implies
there might be a verifiable transaction.  There was a recent suggestion
that the transaction be refered to as an 'indirect transaction'.

For informed consent to exist, users need:

a.  An explanation of the issues written in terms they can understand
b.  An explanation they can *easily* view as to how an individual cookie 
    provider will use the cookies.

Browser vendors can nicely differentiate themselves by how well they
integrate the decision process for the user. The protocol doesn't make
(b) possible and it should (e.g., the commenturl).  Secondly, some form 
of the general Cookie Certificate Approach proposed to the WG should be
integrated as an alternative which enables immediate acceptance of
authenticated level-1 cookies preconfigured in browsers. It really
shouldn't be difficult to get the CCA infrastructure established by the
time UAs are available with the CCA support.
