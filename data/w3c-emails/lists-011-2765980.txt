That I understand ... I guess my point wasn't clear. The whole notion of
verifiable here is rather obscure as the english word means something to
me much stronger than the usage in the spec.  The implication is along the
lines of a certificate authority having done research to verify the
identity of the origin and providing a CA to that end.  When I initially
studied the various drafts, I found it confusing because I had to keep
reminding myself exactly how the termnology was defined in the draft.

As you pointed out, the concept is completely unsuitable from a UI
perspective.
