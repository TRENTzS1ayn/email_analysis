Thanks for the backup, and I'm not going crazy.  I just spent the last day
reviewing the archives of WEBDAV and this topic of a UA using the C-D as a
suggested filename on download is somewhere in the new black hole that was
found.

I understand that the C-D section is a documentation of the current pratice.
But, what is the collective say of the WG about the future DISPOSITION
direction.  I've initiated a private discussion with members of WEBDAV, but
who should be driving the bus?  IMHO, the WG should since it is general
issue.
