Hi Mike,

I understand the problme you are trying to solve, but I see
a large number of difficulties with the method which you are trying to
solve it.

1 On the D.O.S. attack, I dont really see how this helps.  In mounting
any serious attack, the attacker would be smart to write a small
client program to produce many sessions, assuming it could
defeat a duplicate IP addr check ( multi session same client ),
it could simply choose never to honor your endsession url..

2 What about people like me who leave their browsers running forever,
I just lock my screen at night, etc..  The endession would never
get executed.

3 Dont cookies often persist longer than the 'browser session' ?
ie stored in the cookie file?  SHould the browser delete the cookie
on shutdown ?

4. What is the method which the endsession URL should be submitted?
POST, GET?  What is the browser to do with the response?

5. Security.
Gee, this sounds like a nice way for a site to induce a client
to access an abritrary URL at shutdown.   What if the URL is a 
file containing Java, ActiveX or the like ?
