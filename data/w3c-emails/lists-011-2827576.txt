As a result of the discussions at the Memphis IETF meeting and WWW6, a new
version of the PEP draft has been submitted as an ID. I have attached the
draft to this mail.

You can also find the draft as an W3C working draft at

http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/WD-http-pep-970428.html

Please read and comment!

Thanks,

Henrik
