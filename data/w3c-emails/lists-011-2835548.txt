At work (this is my "home" address) we have a number of proxy servers
which are geographically/topologically distributed, and people manually
configure their browsers to use the appropriate proxy. Lately, I've been
thinking about how one might go about configuring a network so that proxy
configuration is automatic. I suppose the proxies could send 305 responses
to requests originating on the wrong network, but if a client has no proxy
configured it then becomes necessary for a router to send back a 305
response in response to attempts to connect via TCP port 80, and I really
don't like this approach. Ideally, I'd like to see this done through DHCP,
but that requires OS level support.

Can anyone point me in the direction of what has already been done here?

If you're going to reinvent the wheel, at least try to come
up with a better one.
