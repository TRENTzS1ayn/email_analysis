This is precisely why the browser needs to have configuration
options for processing.

I fail to see how adding an attribute to the specification causes the 
problems
that you envision.  First, the browser is not required to implement support.
Second, this is for inTRAnet applications where sites will have considerable
control over user configurations.  Finally, if the specification suggests 
that
browsers should ignore such an attribute by default, then it seems tough to
make any assumptions about it.

This feature is intended for inTRAnet applications.  In this case, the
browsers *will* be up to date, and the site will dictate how to configure
the browsers. Again, inTRAnet.  These are corporate applications,
behind the firewall, inside the glass house, ...
Corporate policy will mandate that the proper browser is installed,
and that it is configured appropriately.

As I said, the intent is for inTRAnet applications where the site 
administration
has considerable control over the user environment.  True that the server 
will
have to program for timeouts, but this should not preclude the workgroup from
considering features that allow a site to improve on the situation.  It seems 
a
bit shortsighted to leave a feature out of the specification just because it
might cause a security problem.  If all specs took potential risks into 
account,
we would never have been able to do file io or dereference pointers in C.
