The suggestion that
>     - the users browser is up to date enough to support this

Does not seem to apply.  This is a specification for a new type of cookie,
defined by Set-Cookie2, and there is no guarantee that the browser
will support the Set-Cookie2, least of all one of the attributes.  For those
browsers that do support Set-Cookie2, the EndSession attribute would
be entirely optional.  The specification would only define how the attribute
is processed *if* implemented.

As for
>     - the client system will not crash

Any brwoser that crashes is coded incorrectly.  Browsers are supposed to
ignore headers they do not recognize.  From the draft for
HTTP State Management Mechanism (Rev 1) dated March 19, 1997
"The user agent should ignore attribute-values pairs whos attribute
it does not recognize."

On the issue of security, here again, the draft is fairly clear
"This state management specification therefore requires that a user
agent give the user control over such a possible intrusion, although
the interface through which the user is given this control is left 
unspecified."
