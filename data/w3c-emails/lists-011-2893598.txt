I don't think a new WG is needed with all the salient overhead ... but we
do need to take the task 'offline' to a reconsituted and more open
subgroup. What I think we primarily need is is an offer to host the
mail list serving the group along with a list archive. (The largely
dormant mail list used by the original state managment sub-group is
actually run as a sendmail alias with heavy duty manual effort required 
as a result to add to the list.  No echo back to submitter, no archive,
etc.)
