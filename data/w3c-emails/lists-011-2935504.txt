In my ignorance of MIME, I've been puzzled about this boundary
business.  Assuming each multipart contains a Content-Length header,
does it matter what the boundary is?  Can't the recipient just eat the
number of content bytes before looking for the next boundary?  If so,
the boundary strings don't have to be particularly clever, do they?
