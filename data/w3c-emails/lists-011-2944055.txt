  I had also considered the use of Content-Length to address this; the
  HTTP spec seems to allow it:

2068> 19.4.5 HTTP Header Fields in Multipart Body-Parts

  So is it legal for me to put an HTTP/1.1 Content-Length header into
  a multipart/* part to indicate its length?  It seems a workable (in
  fact, preferable) solution.  As server vendors we can't assume that
  though.
