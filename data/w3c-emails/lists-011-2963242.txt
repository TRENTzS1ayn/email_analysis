  Hear hear.

  If the intent is/was that Content-Length should be used in each part
  of a multipart/* body part rather than boundary markers, then I
  believe that the spec needs some clarification on this point.  While
  I expect that others may disagree, I believe that such a change
  would be a big improvement.

  A gateway would also have to do work to change the HTTP 8-bit data
  to some Content-Transfer-Encoding anyway, wouldn't it?  Adding a
  boundary marker (or the Content-Length in the other direction) in
  the process hardly seems an extraordinary requirement.
