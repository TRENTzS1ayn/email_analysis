It would be good to get a definitive answer as to whether
Content-Length takes priority over the boundary string in a
multipart/*.  At a recent IETF meeting I asked such a question to some
knowledgeable person who said that Content-Length was ignored in this
context and that the boundary string was the only way to determine the
end of a part in a multipart/*. I would prefer that Content-Length take
priority if it is present.
