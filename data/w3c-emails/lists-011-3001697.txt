Why is chunking redundant? It seems important for the case where the
client doesn't know the length of the data at the beginning of the
transmission.  Without the Transfer-Encoding of chunked, HTTP/1.1 seems
to require a Content-Length for a client transmission (as a client, it
cannot close the connection and multipart/byterange doesn't seem
appropriate for clients to send).
