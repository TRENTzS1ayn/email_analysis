The revision has been implemented in Lynx, and is undergoing
field testing, with no problems so far.  Most of the changes relative
to the current RFC where made to accomodate MSIE, and the draft does
so, fully now, within the context of valid concerns about user privacy
and not just those of market forces.  Just as no one should expect
to be believed simply on the basis of where he is employed, rather
than on the basis of the credibility he establishes over time, no one
should assume to have a crystal ball concerning what will or will not
be implemented.

I agree that it should be moved on to Experimental RFC which
supersedes RFC 2109 (and that most of the time most of the options
to disable this or that aspect of cookie handling should be used,
just as BLINK should be disabled :).
