That is not accurate, Microsoft is planning on implementing hit meeting.
I also know that AOL and Netscape have expressed interest although, in
so far as I am aware, neither party has committed to an implementation.

As for RFC 2109, what happens to a protocol that is broken and that no
one intends to implement? The thing should just be declared null and
void and the whole situation forgotten about.
