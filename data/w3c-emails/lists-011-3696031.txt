Are proxies not already prevented from safely multiplexing streams
because of cookies, authentication, and OPS?

If client A sends up a cookie to http://foo and client B sends up a
cookie to http://foo there is no way, just looking at the response, to
know which of the two responses the server generates is meant for which
client. 

A similar situation applies to authentication where client A and client
B may both perform a GET on a resource with authentication information
and one client makes it and the other doesn't, given that custom
authentication mechanisms can be used, there is no way for the proxy to
figure out which response was intended for which client.

A similar situation also applies to OPS. Two clients may establish an
OPS session with a server and then make separate requests for the same
resource. The response may be different based upon the OPS information
but there is no way to examine the response and know which client that
particular response is meant for.

Of course, its late and maybe I missed something. But it looks to me
like proxy multiplexing is already impossible.
