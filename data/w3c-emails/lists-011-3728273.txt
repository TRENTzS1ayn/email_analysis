No, think I was referring to
http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1997q2/0134.html (Re:
1xx Clarification, which was written a few weeks ago).

Anyway, I think I interpreted Yaron's message wrong.  I thought he was
arguing the case

  <copy request> <200 OK response to copy request> <100 response about
  progress=50%> <100 response about progress=100%>

in which the progress events are sent *after* the OK response which
ends the transaction.

But I guess that what he actually had in mind was 

  <copy request> <100 response about progress=50%> <100 response about
  progress=100%> <200 OK response to copy request>

And this latter case would indeed work through a multiplexing proxy
(though the code would have to be 101 or something, with semantics
slightly different from 100). 

So I believe I was wrong, and that Yaron has a valid case for keeping
the 1xx codes.

Sorry for all the confusion.
