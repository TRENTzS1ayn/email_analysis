Fine.  (And I like the hierarchical namespace approach.)

OK.  (I think it's the term 'dimension' -- it tends to imply a scalar
associated value.)

Another draft to cover a generic negotiation framework?  (Not to specify an
order, but partly to make it clear that there is no predefined order.)

Hmmm... I'm not sure one could construct a sufficiently general metadata
fraework either.  I had assumed that such detail would be bound up in the
semantics of a particular tag:  e.g. any component which new about a tag
would know what kind of response (if any) would be needed to conclude
negotiation w.r.t. that tag.

I think it was fairly clear that details of values associated with the tags
were not part of the feature tag.  But I felt there were implicit
assumptions about the range and complexity of values which might be allowed.

That comment of mine was slightly tongue-in-cheek.  And I just wanted to
raise a flag concerning the possibility of Web-centric thinking allowing
assumptions to creep in.

It was clear from what you wrote that it was just an example.
