Sorry to raise this while you're trying to close down issues for the Munich
IETF meeting, BUT I notice that RFC 2045 and RFC 2068 contain conflicting
definitions of syntax production 'tspecials'.

RFC 2045, section 5.1, p12
RFC 2068, section 2.2, p16

Sections 3.7.2 and 16 of RFC 2068 incorporate RFC 2045 syntax productions
by reference, so not only is this a potential source of confusion but I
think it is technically ambiguous.

GK.
