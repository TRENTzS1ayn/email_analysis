I am also aware of several efforts to use this mechanism
in the context of lightweight no-human user agents.  One
of these, being done by a different group within NASA, will
be using the lightweight state information available through
cookies to maintain information about what image data sets
have been received from and passed to different reporting
stations.  Having cookies available lets the interacting
servers know that which sets are complete without having
to query on each image in each sets; it makes for a nice
cheap short cut.

I believe that cookies are in widespread use in passing
just this kind of shortcut information. Repairing the existing
State Management Mechanism is important for interoperability;
we want to make sure everyone is using the same standard
to create this kind of application. Even if those applications
would work fine with the original Netscape docs, having a standards
track doc is important.

It is being Proposed; if it does not receive adequate implementation
support, it will not move on.  That's okay.  But we shouldn't short
circuit the process by assuming that it's dead because two vendors
won't be updating to it.  The browser market is not the same as the
useful field of play for internet protocols.
