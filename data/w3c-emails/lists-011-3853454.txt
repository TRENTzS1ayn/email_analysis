If you're going to be submitting another draft, I suggest that
in the section explaining the port attribute you include an explicit
statement that its value should be double-quoted if it's a comma
separated list of ports.  It was not difficult to do "sanity checks"
for whether what follows a comma is another port number versus the
start of another cookie if the value is not double-quoted, but it would
be better to promote the double-quoting explicitly, particularly because
in "historical" Set-Cookie headers the expires attribute value, which
includes commas, is not double-quoted (for backwardness compatibility).

Yaron's other criticism of 4.2.2, regarding the mushiness of
the "at least as secure" phrase, is the same one I raised some time
ago, and you answered at length, so Yaron (and Larry as well if he's
forgotten) can find that in the archives.  However, now that the
blanket port restriction has been lifted, and cookies can be shared
between https and http servers unless the secure attribute was
specified, it might be worth indicating that UAs can offer human users
the option to set cookies as secure in addition to taking any "advice"
about that from the server's Set-Cookie/Set-Cookie2 header(s).  That's
just an "implementation issue", so it's OK if you'd rather not, but we
did make that both a configuration and run-time option in Lynx.

These are just comment/explanation suggestions.  The actual
specs are fine.
