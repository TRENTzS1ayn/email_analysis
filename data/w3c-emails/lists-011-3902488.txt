One of my concerns is that symmetric mechanisms would add complexity
to HTTP negotiation, so if your (b) is simple enough, this concern
would be addressed.

However, another concern is that any new HTTP negotiation framework
must not shift paradigms more than is needed.  Especially for the
simple cases, the metadata format must stay as close as possible to
the way the target metadata authors think about negotiation.  And
these target authors are not programmers who write server-side
rendering engines, but content authors who may not have any knowledge
of programming or mathematical logic.  This puts some limitations to
the amount of complexity the protocol can shift to the metadata
author.
