I did not intend it to suggest that dimensions must be scalar, quite
the contrary.  I plan to add some examples which make this more clear.

The trouble is that some dimensions can be described nicely in terms
of their values, while for other dimensions, where the values are yes
and no, a description in terms of the `meaning' of these values must
be given.

I plan to change "Summary of the indicated dimension of negotiation"
to "Summary of negotiation with this feature tag", or something.  I am
not sure I want to use the word `dimension' in the form.

Do you mean in the form or in the text around it?


>(B) I feel your list of "Result in the indicated dimension of negotiation"

It is.  It is supposed to reflect increasing complexity, both from a
human viewpoint and from the viewpoint of an extensible negotiation
mechanism.  For example, not all extensible mechanisms may support

I think (1) is a very frequent, and simple case, so separating it out
would make it easier to fill in and read the forms.

No, (4) is also supposed to represent choice values without a natural
enumeration.

?? If there were not multiple values to choose from, there would be no
negotiation.


Here is a rewrite of the first part of the form, please say if you
like this better.  Note that I'm trying to avoid the `dimension'
terminology.

3.8 Registration template

   To: ietf-feature-tags@iana.org (Feature tags mailing list)
        (or directly to iana@iana.org)
   Subject: Registration of feature tag XXXX

    | Instructions are preceded by `|'.  Some fields are optional.

   Feature tag name:

   Summary of negotiation with this feature tag

    | Include a short (no longer than 4 lines) description or summary
    | Examples:
    |   `Negotiation on whether to use the xyzzy feature of ...'
    |   `Negotiation on the MIME media type of the data which
    |    is transmitted for ...'
    |   `Negotiation on whether to use colors in displaying ...'
    |   `Negotiation on the number of colors to use in displaying ...'

   Number of alternatives in (sub)negotiation with this tag:

     [ ] 1. Two alternatives
     [ ] 2. More than two alternatives

   For case 1: nature of the two alternatives:

     [ ] 1a. A particular feature is used/invoked/enabled, or not
     [ ] 1b. Other

   For case 2: Is there a natural way to identify every possible
               alternative?

     [ ] 2a. Yes
     [ ] 2b. No

   For case 2a: How is a single alternative naturally identified?

     [ ] 2a.1 With a name, keyword, label, or tag (e.g. a language tag)
     [ ] 2a.2 With an integer value
     [ ] 2a.3 With a numeric value of a non-integer type (e.g. float)
     [ ] 2a.4 With a non-numeric (non-scalar) value (e.g. a piece of code)
     [ ] 2a.5 With a record or tuple of values
     [ ] 2a.6 With a set of values
     [ ] 2a.7 Other
