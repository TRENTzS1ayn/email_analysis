I think that approach would be consistent with the motivations indicated in
your response to my point (B).

A bit of both.

I think the word 'dimension' gets a bit overloaded in the draft.

I phrased that badly.  I was trying to indicate the ability to specify
multiple instances of each value.  E.g.
(1)  {Yes,No}
(2)  {1,2,3,5,7,11} or {Red,Green,Blue}
(3)  {{1},{1,5},{1,5,11}}
(4)  {1.1,3.3,7.7,100}
(5)  {text/plain,text/html,application/word} or {[1.5-2.5],[2.0-20.0]}

Another thought: for item (4) should there be a distinction between
open/closed intervals?

?? (sub)negotiation -- I don't know what you mean by that.

How about:
"Number of alternative values for the feature identified by this tag"?

2a.2: bounded/unbounded alternatives?  I am thinking that there might be
known limits on the value of an integer used as an enumerated value.  I am
not saying this is a Good Idea, just asking the question.

2a.3: bounded/unbounded alternatives (e.g. real numbers <= 1.0)?.  Again,
I'm just asking the question.

2a.4, 2a.7: don't these amount to the same thing?

2a.5, 2a.6: to provide complete coverage of structured types, union should
be included.

Given that this is not intended to be used by programmers, I would suggest
collapsing 2a.4..2a.7 into a single 'other' category (possibly singling out
2a.6 as a 'common' case).



To answer your question, I like the earlier paragraphs better than the
original, but I am uneasy about the technical depth implied by the
alternatives for 2a.  If you follow this approach I do not think there is a
single correct answer -- just a judgement as to what is appropriate.

Maybe the summary of negotiable features I posted a while back could
provide a yardstick for what should be explicitly offered?  I don't think
there is a reason why the form should not be extended later if new feature
value types start occurring frequently in the future (as this would simply
represent a refining of the 'other' category, not the addition of new
information).
