For what it's worth, here's some "implementation experience" on
that.  The draft has a parenthetical statement:

"(Obviously the Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers must
  both contain the same number of cookies.)"

It might be interpreted as a requirement that they MUST be the same
number, but not necessarily.  The draft's examples all have Set-Cookie2
and Set-Cookie cookies in the same order, but there is no clear MUST
about that either.  The Lynx implementation does not depend on either
(not because of anything in or not in the draft, but because I personally
wouldn't assume they'll always be the same number and in the same order,
even if they MUST be).

The Lynx implementation includes handling of a commentURL
attribute.  It addresses the criticism, otherwise not addressed, that
the comment attribute, by itself, does not accommodate i18n concerns.
If the comment also can be sought via a URL, charset and language
negotiation can be brought into play.  The Canadian freenets probably
are still the largest Lynx user base (well into the six digits) and
whether the comment is in English or French is an important factor
there.  It's also an important matter for our CJK user base.  Could
the RFC at least designate commentURL as a reserved name (not to be used
as a cookie name)?  It also might be helpful to state explicitly in the
comments/explanations that use of expires as a Version 1 cookie name,
or max-age, version, port, and discard as Version 0 cookie names, is
ill-advised (I know, "That goes without saying!", and those to whom it
should be said probably won't ever read the RFC. :)  While tabled, I
guess sites which want to use it can do a User-Agent check for Lynx
(and any other browsers which implement it).
