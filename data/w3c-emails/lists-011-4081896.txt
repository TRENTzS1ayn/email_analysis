What's the feeling here about putting out (some future version of...)
that document about cache-busting as an RFC ?

It could definitely benefit from some peer review, which is one 
thing.  Would it be a useful community resource, though ?

Cheerio,

Martin 

PS Whether or not it should be an http-wg work item is another 
matter :-)
