 A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
 Working Group of the IETF.                                                

       Title     : PEP - an Extension Mechanism for HTTP                   
       Author(s) : D. Connolly, R. Khare, H. Frystyk
       Filename  : draft-ietf-http-pep-04.txt, .ps

HTTP is used increasingly in applications that need more facilities than 
the standard version of the protocol provides, ranging from distributed 
authoring, collaboration, and printing, to various remote procedure call 
mechanisms. The Protocol Extension Protocol (PEP) is an extension mechanism
designed to address the tension between private agreement and public 
specification and to accommodate extension of applications such as HTTP 
clients, servers, and proxies. The PEP mechanism is designed to associate 
each extension with a URI[2], and use a few new RFC 822[1] derived header 
fields to carry the extension identifier and related information between 
the parties involved in an extended transaction.

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-pep-04.txt".
 Or 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-pep-04.ps".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.



Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
