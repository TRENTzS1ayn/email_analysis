You're absolutely right about my having botched the syntax.  I'll have to
fix this up.  Thanks!

Concerning making the quotes optional for a single port number:  I accept
Foteos's argument that it's easy to handle.  I'll allow that in the spirit
of "be liberal in what you accept", an implementation may want to handle it
that way, but I still think it's a really bad idea for the syntax to be
*specified* that way.  Apart from making the syntax (marginally) more
complex, the (proposed) syntax above invites errors of omission, where a
server goes from sending a single port number to sending more than one and
the implementor has to remember to add quotes to get it right.

Concerning remarks about requiring FQHN:  I'll have to think this through
more carefully when I get back from vacation.

Concerning Foteos's suggestion about reserving the attribute name
"CommentURL", sure.  Concerning CommentURL itself, I'll think about that
some more.  The risk in adding it is that supporting it has implications
for browsers and browser vendors, and they haven't seemed too keen about
RFC 2109 (and successors) as it is.

Concerning Foteos's suggestion that all the attribute names be reserved
from use as cookie NAMEs, it's unnecessary.  The cookie NAME=VALUE always
comes first in the Set-Cookie2 header, so you can always distinguish it
from any attributes.
