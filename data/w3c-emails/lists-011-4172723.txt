I actually believed you had intended the quotes to be optional ... my
main concern was getting the syntax right so on the quotes I'm satisfied
with whatever you choose because I think the port=xxxx case would not be
used since it is exactly the same case as 'port' with no value.

Sounds fair to me ... you've been working hard enough from vacation.

But I don't recall a vendor objection to the suggestion. If I were the
vendor, I'd like this one because it would be a real value add to handle
it well and I believe it's a real win for users.

Yeah, I scratched my head on that one for a long time before I concluded 
I could see no reason for breakage if the attribute names weren't 
reserved.
