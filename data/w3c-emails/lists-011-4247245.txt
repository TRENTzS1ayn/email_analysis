I actually believed you had intended the quotes to be optional ... my
main concern was getting the syntax right so on the quotes I'm 
satisfied
with whatever you choose because I think the port=xxxx case would not 
be
used since it is exactly the same case as 'port' with no value.

Sounds fair to me ... you've been working hard enough from vacation.

But I don't recall a vendor objection to the suggestion. If I were 
the
vendor, I'd like this one because it would be a real value add to 
handle
it well and I believe it's a real win for users.

All of the web site and software developers I have spoken to on this 
would love the opportunity to provide a link to explain what and why 
they are doing what they are doing to help address the spread of 
misinformation (particularly by the media)  This would be a big win 
for everyone...

Yeah, I scratched my head on that one for a long time before I 
concluded
I could see no reason for breakage if the attribute names weren't
reserved.
