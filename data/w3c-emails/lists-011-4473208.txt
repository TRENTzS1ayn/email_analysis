No, this is not an appropriate use of SHOULD NOT.  If we reference the
Bradner RFC, then we follow its rules, and one of them is that we MUST NOT
use the capitalized forms for things which are not interoperability

Likewise, inappropriate.  Recommendations should be presented as
recommendations, not as requirements.
