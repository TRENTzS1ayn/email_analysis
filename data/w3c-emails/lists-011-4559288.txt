The editing group accepts your proposed addition as a reasonable
bit of implementation advice to add to the HTTP/1.1 spec

> >>> START OF PROPOSED ADDITION
> Note: When making the choice of linguistic preference available to

> are not familliar with the details of language matching as described
> above, and should provide appropriate guidance. As an example, users
> may assume that on selecting "en-gb", they will be served any kind
> of English document if British English is not available. A user
> agent may suggest in such a case to add "en" to get the best
> matching behavior.
