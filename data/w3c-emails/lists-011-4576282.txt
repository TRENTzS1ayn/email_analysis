I've rewritten the subsection to make it clear that it applies
to user-agent clients, not to proxies:

   8.2.3 Automatic retrying of requests

   If a user agent sees the transport connection close before it
   receives a final response to its request, if the request method is
   idempotent (see section 9.1.2), the user agent SHOULD retry the
   request without user interaction.  If the request method is not
   idempotent, the user agent SHOULD NOT retry the request without user
   confirmation.  (Confirmation by user-agent software with semantic
   understanding of the application MAY substitute for user
   confirmation.)
