There probably is, the draft-mutz-http-attributes drafts do not
reflect the syntax rules in the latest TCN draft, but this will be
fixed eventually.

Yes, any sufficiently generic framework would have to be able to treat
features as interchangeable.  This would even have to be done if the
alias problem were absent.  For example, for a document which will use
animated gifs if java is not present, the `java' and `animated gif'
features are interchangeable.
