You may be right.  When writing the draft, I fluctuated between using
the terms `area of negotiation' and `dimension', and chose for
`dimension' eventually.  But maybe I should have chosen for `area of
negotiation'.

I guess the problem is to find the right level of detail.  I'm trying
to stay away from things like open/closed intervals.  I don't think
that the _result_ of negotiation in a dimension will often be an
interval, though intervals may be used in the exchange which
establishes the result.

Oops, some more terminology I did not introduce.  Chop off the (sub).

>"Number of alternative values for the feature identified by this tag"?

I think that would not work: values are not always `for' a feature.

I don't know how often there would be known limits at registration
time.  I think that, when negotiating, the added value of knowing the
overall min. and max. values beforehand would be small: parties in a
negotiation process would presumably have to exchange their own
specific min. and max. values anyway.

Also, the trouble is that `always big enough' often turns out to be
`too small' 5 years later.  The 640K barrier in PCs is a good example.
If there are lots of deployed negotiation mechanisms which `know' that
the max. value is 640, these may end up blocking progress beyond 640.

I think you are right, I'll reduce the categories in the next version.
I think I'll just delete 2a.4 - 2a.6.

If I remember correctly, this summary has *lots* of different types of
values.  Offering them all explicitly would make the list very long,
I think.

Yes, so it makes sense to keep the initial list limited.
