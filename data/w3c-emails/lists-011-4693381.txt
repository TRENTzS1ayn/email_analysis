My personal (not wg-chair) opinion is that we should avoid placing
any requirements we don't need to place. Limiting the transmission
of unnecessary bytes over the network is grounds for good implementation
advice, but not for a SHOULD NOT. There are a few cases where we've
placed requirements for reasons other than interoperability, so I don't
think it's a hard rule.

Officially, we can't make requirements that don't match experience;
in going from Proposed to Draft, we cannot have a "SHOULD NOT
do X" if we can't document two independent interoperable implementations
that don't do X; but I don't think that's an issue in this case.
