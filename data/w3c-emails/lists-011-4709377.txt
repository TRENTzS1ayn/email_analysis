So is there/will there be an automatic adaption to  data/content dependent 
transmission schemes within HTTP, i.e. certain streams of data are fault 
tolerant by nature or need more throughput or somthing else. So an adaption
to the best protocoll for certain data types would possibly quite usefull.

Is there a plan to put it into HTTP or is this delegated over an 
interface (probably the MIME-type handling) to another protocoll or the 
actual http server itself?

Thanks for help or references
