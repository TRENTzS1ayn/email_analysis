We plan to remove section 19.6, "19.6 Additional Features "
which is part of the appendix (i.e. this is non-normative material currently
in the specification).

This documents proposals for methods PATCH, LINK, UNLINK, and header
fields Alternates, Content-Version, Derived-From, Link, and URI.

The grounds for removing this section include:
1) there are no known implementations
2) the WEBDAV group is working in this area, and documenting
different, and incomplete functions, is a bad idea.
3) there are known problems with some of the proposals: e.g. Link
sytax does not quite seem to be what the HTML group needs for
enabling server setting of sytle sheets; its grammar is suspect.  I've
suggested to Dan Connolly that Link progress as a separate (very short)
Internet Draft to proposed standard with whatever they need, and hopefully 
quickly.
4) there has been no known discussion of these features on the
mailing list, and given we don't know of any implementations, going to
draft standard with these in the document is a bad idea.

IETF process does not allow documents to become draft standards with
unimplemented features, and while this section is not part of the normative
document, we don't need the confusion or errors that might result.

Note that RFC 2068 is now an RFC, so anyone interested in seeing such
design work can always refer to it, even when obsoleted by the draft
standard.
