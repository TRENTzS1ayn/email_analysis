Yes, it is allowed to cheat, but I would not call it cheating.

The 1.1 spec prescribes how to assign a q value to a language tag
using an Accept-Language header, i.e. there os only one legal way to
compute q-of-en and q-of-ja for English and Japanese.  However, the
spec does not prescribe what you should do with these q-of-* values
once you have computed them.

There is no rule which prescribes that, whenever you have an
English-Japanese bilingual document, jou must compute the overall
quality of this document with the formulae

  max(q-of-en, q-of-ja)

or 

  (q-of-en + q-of-ja)/2

or whatever.  HTTP leaves the selection of appropriate formulae up to
the service author.  In terms of your example below:

>As an example, assume that a server has an English document,

the correct formulae for the overall qualities of the documents would,
I think, be something like

       English document:   q-of-en * 0.8
       Japanese document:  q-of-ja * 0.8
       Bilingual document: min(q-of-en,q-of-ja)

(These are correct assuming that you always want to return the
document with the highest overall quality.)
