The PEP demo consists of a simple HTTP client, proxy, and server, a PEP 
library, and a couple extensions. It demonstrates policy announcement, 
extension declaration, and dynamic extensions.

The source and documentation are available at
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/PEP/PEPmodel and a complete description of 
PEP is available at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/PEP. I hope to get a 
chance to strap the PEP library to the RTSP code, too.
