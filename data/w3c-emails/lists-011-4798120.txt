There are already numerous places in RFC2068 where the "*" syntax
is used as a "wildcard", including
OPTIONS method
Accept:
Accept-Language:
If-Match:
If-None-Match:
Vary:
And its use has also been last-called in the Content-Range header.

To me, it seems odd that Accept-Charset and Accept-Encoding don't
already allow a "*" value, given that Accept and Accept-Language do.
