I support this.  The WEBDAV working group has requirements for providing
partial resource updates and for the creation, deletion, modification and
access of typed links between resources.  The latest protocol draft, which
was submitted to the Internet-drafts editor on Friday, details a PATCH
method, and a mechanism for creating links using a general-purpose facility
for defining properties on resources.  The WEBDAV proposals differ from the
definitions in Section 19.6 of RFC 2068.  Since WEBDAV is currently working
on these items, it makes sense to me to remove Section 19.6.

Some brief comments:

The NTT, Palo Alto group has produced an implementation of LINK, UNLINK,
and the Link header.  However, to the best of my knowledge, this is not a
production server, but rather a research testbed.  Since they have been
actively tracking the WEBDAV working group, I suspect they would be
comfortable moving to the WEBDAV interface and semantics for links.

I agree.

Since WEBDAV is developing a mechanism for links, I'm not sure what the
value of a separate I-D would be.
