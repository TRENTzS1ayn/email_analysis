  I don't think this is a serious enough concern to merit doing
  anything at all.  If this is not possible that's just fine.

  That having been said, the q-value solution would seem the best to
  me.  I prefer not to use '*' for this, so my choice from your
  alternatives would be:

JM>   (c)Accept-Encoding: gzip, compress, identity;q=0.0

  Our server doesn't currently do anything with Accept-Encoding (our
  customers generally don't have the storage to devote to storing
  multiple encodings, and don't want the CPU spending time creating
  them) so we have no backward compatibility issue.
