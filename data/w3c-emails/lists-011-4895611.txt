I find this a very persuasive argument.. Content Encodings are
something we are intending to deal with aggressively in current and
upcoming server extension projects.. (CGI, fast CGI, nsapi,
whatever..) If this is the type of functionality that's going to be
handled by a lot of different applications (as opposed to a handful of
base web servers) simplicity is paramount... that unfortunately means
no q values.
