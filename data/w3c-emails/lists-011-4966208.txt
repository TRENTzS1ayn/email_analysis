I don't see why you want to exclude sending of cookies when
a UA is acting on the commentURL, nor why you are conceptualizing it
as only for a policy statement.  That's possible, but the PEP or
PEP-like extension is a better way to assess a site's "policy".  One
of the main reasons for wanting cookie support in UAs is that it's a
simple, "here now" way to maintain user preferences across documents
at a site, and is complementary to the TCN/features mechanisms.  The
hope is that the reply will include a statement about the purpose of
that particular cookie, and "preference cookies" should still be able
to affect how the reply is structured.

You simply want to guard against the server trying to set new
cookies via the reply to the commentURL request, and there too, you
need not exclude things like it expiring or modifying old cookies
which the user accepted.  How about something like this:

If the user agent allows the user to follow the CommentURL
link as part of a cookie inspection user interface, the server
should not include any new cookies in the reply, and the UA
should allow the use to inspect the body of the reply before
acting on any other commentURL links.

If this is a "first contact", or is consequent to the user having
enabled formerly disabled cookie support, that degrades to the
reply having no more than the cookie about which a comment is being
sought.
