I think a prior post of mine would indicate agreement with your concern
but I'm not sure I would accept as a 'main reason' for cookie support
being the storage of preferences. Preferences are, IMHO, a minor 
concern and a particular type of 'session' which cookies can be used
to maintain. But all this really says is that cookies have tremendous
appeal because they are a general facility which can be used in many 
ways, each of which would probably be more effectively solved some 
other way.  They also enhance cachability of the web by reducing 
the need for munged URLs, etc.
