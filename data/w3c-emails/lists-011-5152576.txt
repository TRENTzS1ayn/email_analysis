A lot of what is written above turns up exactly the same in
Accept-Charset, Accept-Language, and so on. In many cases, there
is something special, but not too much. Is there a way to organize
the text different? This would hopefully a) save space, b) help
getting an overview, and c) make things more consistent.

For example, with respect to "*", the general description could
say that:

"*" in an accept field matches any value possible in that accept
field, including a default. A q-value given to "*" applies to all
values, including the default, but except those that are explicitly
present. An accept field may not allow "*", or may use a more
elaborate syntax for this functionality. Such cases are explicitly
mentionned in the description of the field itself.

Similar texts could explain the use of a default, the meaning of
q=0 (this seems already done to a certain extent), and so on.

For "Accept-Encoding", we would then just have to list the
possible values and identify the default.
