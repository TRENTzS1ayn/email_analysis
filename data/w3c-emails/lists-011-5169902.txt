  I like the revised proposal better, and I think that it does as well
  as can be done to preserve compatibility with 2068 implementations,
  and I very much like the idea of using RFC numbers as feature
  identifiers.

  On the question of proxies modifying the responses, perhaps it would
  be better for a proxy that does not implement a particular feature
  to add a non-compliance indication without removing the original
  assertion; this might enable a client to detect the true situation.

  Non-Compliance =
        "Non-Compliance" ":" proxy-host 1#non-compliance-option

    proxy-host = host [ ":" port ]

non-compliance-option =
        compliance-namespace "=" option-item [ ";" option-disposition ]

option-disposition = "passed" | "dropped"

  If the proxy recognizes the option-item as one that it will pass
  through but not react to, it will send the 'passed'
  option-disposition.  If it recognizes the option-item as one that
  will not operate correctly through itself (either due to an
  implementation restriction or as a matter of policy), then it will
  send the 'dropped' option-disposition.  If the proxy does not
  recognize the option-item, it will send no option-disposition, in
  which case the client must rely on its own knowlege of that item to
  make any guess as to whether or not it might work through that
  proxy.

  A Non-Compliance header field MUST NOT be sent by any origin
  server.

  What do the client and proxy authors out there think?  Would this
  enable you to do something useful?  Is there a way we could or
  should modify the rules for the Public header like this?
