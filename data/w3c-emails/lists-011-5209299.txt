We can't quite LAST CALL a document which has a technical
issue unresolved. The technical issue that's unresolved
is the limitation on accepting cookies while interacting
with the resource identified by the CommentURL annotating
a cookie.

I will state my personal opinion, again, just in case there
is some additional support for it:

I think that the complexity inherent in "CommentURL" makes
it suspect, and that the simplest thing to do is to remove
it. If there is no CommentURL, then you don't need a policy
for accepting cookies while interacting with it.

Too much icing on the cookie, just say no.
