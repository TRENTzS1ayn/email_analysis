I brought this up at the San Jose meeting, but there never was a
satisfactory (official) answer, as far as I remember.

SIP and RTSP re-use a number of HTTP status codes, among other
properties. It is likely that they may need to or want to adopt other
HTTP status codes that emerge in the future. Thus, it is desirable that
the SIP and RTSP-specific status codes do not conflict with HTTP codes.

One possible solution: Declare officially that HTTP will only use status
codes up to x49 (say) and leave others for private extensions, including
SIP and RTSP.

(Note to HTTP-WG: SIP and RTSP are described, inter alia, at  and
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/rtsp and
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/sip)

Comments and decisions are appreciated.
