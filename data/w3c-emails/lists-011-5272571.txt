One way or the other, I believe there is going to need to be an IANA registry.
Private codes don't work too well, as two different people might
still happen to choose the same one.

To get one, you need a standards track document that defines the
process to deal with the registry.  (I.e. IANA needs directions on how
it should be run).

So you need to generate an Internet draft outlining the process, and
circulate it to the appropriate working groups.  It doesn't have to be
long, but it does have to exist, and go through the normal mill.

I think you'll find people here receptive to such a document (but don't
expect any volunteers from here either to write the first draft; we have
our hands full getting 1.1 to draft standard right now).
