I think the best approach would be to establish an IANA registry
for HTTP status codes, "preload" it with all of the status
codes defined in the next draft of the HTTP/1.1 spec, and then
insist that people defining new status codes use the IANA
registry to avoid conflicts.

If people are going to propose additional methods or headers,
outside the context of the HTTP working group, then it might
be a good idea to establish IANA registries for these namespaces,
too.
