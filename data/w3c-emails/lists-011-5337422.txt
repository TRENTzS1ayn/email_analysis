That sounds as though we agree but haven't both realized it yet.
This is almost entirely a UA issue.  The server may or may not act
on any cookies the UA sends, and the UA may or may not send any, which
is already encompassed by the specs as they presently stand.  As far as
my UA is concerned, if it has a cookie that qualifies for inclusion in
a Cookie header for the commentURL based on the specs, and isn't
disqualified based on any additional configuration or run-time options
set by the user, and for example is being used to maintain a preference
for documents that are suitable for a braille interface or speech
synthesizer, I don't see why it shouldn't be included, with the user,
of course, crossing his/her fingers that the server respects it and
doesn't return glitz and blitz for GUIs.

If the filters imposed by the basic specs are not adequate in
this case, then they are inadequate, period.  I think it is desireable
to send at least one cookie, which in the case of a commentURL being
requested in an "assessment" context must have been in a Set-Cookie2
header, and thus will be sent with a $VERSION leader, signaling a
modern implementation.  If no cookie qualifies after applying the
spec's filters and any additional contraints configured or imposed
at run-time by the user, then none will be sent.  Life always has
its hard knocks. :)

This is mere semantics.  You've tentatively accepted it, or you
wouldn't be seeking the body of a commentURL, and will decide whether to
discard it or not after receiving that body, hopefully with a charset
and language that allows you to read it and make an informed decision.

I did send alternate wording, as did Dave Morris.

Here' my effort at a synthesis that might yield consensus:

A potentially confusing situation exists if this sequence occurs:
  - the user agent receives a cookie that contains a CommentURL
   attribute;
 - the user agent's cookie inspection interface presents a dialog
    that allows the user to follow the CommentURL link; and,
  - when the user follows the CommentURL link, the origin server (or
   another server, via other links in the returned content) returns
   another cookie.
The user agent MAY discard any cookie received in this context
that the user has not, through some user agent mechanism, deemed
acceptable.


Note that the user agent MAY discard *any* cookie it receives in *any*
context, so this comment/explanation doesn't change anything that is in
the -02 draft, and could not validly be construed as a reason for postponing
LAST CALL.
