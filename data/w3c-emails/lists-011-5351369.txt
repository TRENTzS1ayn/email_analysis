  I agree; I'm not convinced that piggybacking the Compliance on other
  methods would be usefull.  In particular, would such a header
  provide information on what features are available for _any_ method,
  or only the one to which the Compliance header was attached?

  For the time being (that is, the next version of HTTP/1.1) I think
  that introducing Compliance (and possibly Non-Compliance) as a
  header to be used with OPTIONS is sufficient.  If we do not define
  any behaviour for it with other methods, future versions of HTTP can
  attempt to do so based on experience with the many new aspects we
  are defining.
