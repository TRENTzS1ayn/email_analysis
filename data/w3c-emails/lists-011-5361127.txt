   We can't quite LAST CALL a document which has a technical
   issue unresolved. The technical issue that's unresolved
   is the limitation on accepting cookies while interacting
   with the resource identified by the CommentURL annotating
   a cookie.

   I will state my personal opinion, again, just in case there
   is some additional support for it:

   I think that the complexity inherent in "CommentURL" makes
   it suspect, and that the simplest thing to do is to remove
   it. If there is no CommentURL, then you don't need a policy
   for accepting cookies while interacting with it.

   Too much icing on the cookie, just say no.

I disagree.

Effectively, showing the CommentURL merely involves going to a different
page, probably with a different set of cookies.  I don't see what's
really hard about it.  Is there something I'm missing?

It is likely that at some point in the future I will implement a UA
which will support the CommentURL, and I would like the CommentURL
to be available.
