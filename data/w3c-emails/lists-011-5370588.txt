I agree, it opens too many cans of worms.  As a clarification to scott's
previous remark about Jeff's changes to my OPTIONS spec, I agreee with 
those changes, to make the OPTIONS use a header instead of the request
body.

By using the header, we have made it possible for this issue to
come up, using the compliance with a non options request.

The original motivation I had to write the OPTIONS clarification/spec
was to allow a simple, required mechanism to detect extensions in
HTTP/1.1
which would be in the spec.  I specifically avoided making it very 
complicated to avoid the difficulties that PEP has faced.
PEP is very flexible and powerful, and I beleive, a "good thing".
However that complexity is something that has kept it from 
being included in HTTP/1.1. So, rather than rush PEP or cobble
together a subset of it, it seems that a baseline OPTIONS is
needed in the protocol, as a MUST.

Sine PEP can do what the compliance header w/ non options method can
do, I beleive we should leave that alone, and not define 
compliance: header behavior with non OPTIONS messages.

Additionally, excluding the goals of PEP, the reasons I can think
of for using compliance: with a non OPTIONS method can be addressed
by existing headers such as upgrade:...
