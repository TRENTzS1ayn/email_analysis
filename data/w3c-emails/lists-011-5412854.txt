  Looks fine.

JM> Anyone have strong feelings about 3a vs. 3b?

  Where
    (3a) ~= Proxies MUST NOT modify Allow or Public headers
    (3b) ~= Proxies MUST modify both Allow and Public headers to
            reflect what is possible through this proxy.

  Either is better than treating the two headers differently, but I
  strongly prefer 3a; I believe that alternative, combined with the
  information in Compliance and Non-Compliance headers, will provide a
  useful set of information to someone trying to debug why a given
  request is not working, and use fewer requests to get what they
  need.
