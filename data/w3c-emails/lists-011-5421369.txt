Some comments on the draft below:

1.  It is factually inaccurate to say that this proposed change
addresses either an interoperability problem or a security problem.
The change may have virtues (like saving bandwidth) but it has no
effect on security.  This has been re-iterated here many times, but I
will do it once more: Under the current draft, if the recipient
requires the message body be accompanied by a digest, it must reject
any message without the digest and send an appropriate error message.
Some bandwidth has been wasted in sending a message that was rejected,
but security has not been comprimised.

2. Nevertheless, the suggested change is probably a good one, as it
does does simplify the issue of sender/receiver negotiation on whether
a digest is required.  Rejecting a message is not a very efficient method
of negotiation.  

3. Any change along the lines proposed should make clear (as the ID
below does not) that for a client or server to be compliant with
the specification it is not necessary to be capable of providing
digests for message bodies.
