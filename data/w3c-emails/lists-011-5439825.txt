Well, I guess I disagree with your tentative agreement about what
might be a good idea.

I feel that the burden of proof that adding q values does
*not* introduce new problems is entirely on your side.  You need to
show that this does not break or disable existing implementations.

At this stage in the standards process, we are supposed to be fixing
problems based on implementation experience.  For me, this means that
compatibility considerations *always* outweigh considerations of
cosmetic uniformity.  So you'd better show that the compatibility
considerations are absent.
