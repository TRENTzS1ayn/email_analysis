Some nitpicks:

This is slightly self-contradictory.

>(2) The special "*" symbol in an Accept-Encoding field matches

..except those listed explicitly in the header field.

This SHOULD was not present in 2068, and I don't think adding it is a
good idea.  A server which knows that a legacy client accepts an
encoding (e.g. by looking at the user-agent field) should be
encouraged to send content in this encoding.

Are we allowed to make such an addition at this point in the standards
process?
