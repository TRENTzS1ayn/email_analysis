I think the approach to solving this problem is wrong: the burden of
ensuring that the commentURL mechanism does not lead to
user-unfriendly or recursive situations should be on the server side.

I propose something like this:

 Servers SHOULD ensure that the user can visit the information pointed
 to by the commentURL without causing the user agent to receive
 additional Set-Cookie2 headers.  User agents SHOULD guard against the
 entering of infinite loops due to the commentURL mechanism, and MAY do
 this by disabling cookie processing when the commentURL is visited.
