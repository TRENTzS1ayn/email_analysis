Note that even in that example, you are restricting yourself
to ASCII characters. :)

I doubt it will be considered icing by users whose language
is not adequately accomodated by the device of try to stuff a body
into the value of a Set-Cookie2 header's comment attribute. :)

The work of the IPWG group and the P3 project so far indicates that 
the semantics of privacy and the scenarios are complex.  To enable 
"Free, informed consent", servers need to be able to display in an 
accessible manner their privacy practices and implications.   A 
comment alone doesn't do this.

In addition, I think the CommentURL (with or without additional cookie 
support) potentially introduces a mechanism to engage the user in a 
privacy dialogue leading to a more robust privacy solution: e.g., OPS 
and/or the results of the W3C P3 project...   Of course this could 
also possibly be dealt with through PEP.  For example a web page could 
have a link to an P3 (or whatever)-compliant browser or plug-in, which 
would give the user control over what could be done with information, 
cookies etc.
