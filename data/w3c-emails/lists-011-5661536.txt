 I think this proposal is the best solution to the problem.

I would much rather the specification was consistent than there be 
a special treatment of Content-Encoding for the benefit of perl
hackers. I don't see any logic in treating Content-Encoding
differently from the other tags and we would almost certainly 
want to correct the anomaly in HTTP/1.2. We might as well make
the change now.
