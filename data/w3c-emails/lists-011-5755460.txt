can reference for further info. regarding the cookie.Also, once users realize
that they're spending time reading small paragraphs about cookies, they'll
realize how unobtrusive and uninteresting the information in the cookie is to
them, and stop reading about specific cookies altogether, thus rendering the
commentURL obsolete anyway.

The user would have to look at what the commentURL says and make a decision
anyway.

Not many. But no-one said the UA wouldn't parse the comment attribute, realize
there's a url in in and provide essentially the same functionality the
commentURL would provide. There would be no copying and pasting.

I don't agree here. A cookie should have some means for describing its purpose
(the comment attribute).
