The internationalization benefit that comes with the commentURL attribute is a defensible argument and it is quite convincing. I'm wondering if maintaining comment attribute character set information is the solution?

This is what I'd propose. I wouldn't consider it a "requirement" however. A semi-capable UA would just implement it, if it so desired.

I'm not sure nested cookies are really a concern. If the user is that interested in reading about the cookies being set on his machine, then he can read about every one associated with every commentURL that comes down the pike. If that spins him into a spiral he should tell his content provider not to set cookies when a request for a commentURL comes in. If content providers, malicious or not, don't abide, users will stop viewing commentURLs and then the attribute's very intent has been defeated. Or a simple solution
would be to not allow cookies to be set/sent when a request goes out to a commentURL.

I'm beginning to wonder about the need for any comment/commentURL attribute at all. If the user/customer is the one driving this issue ("I want to know what data is being stored on my machine"), I'm of the belief that actually he is not, perhaps the same informational URL that has been proposed to be placed in some attribute associated with a cookie should simply be made available on the site the user/customer is visiting (at the discretion of the content provider of course, just like his willingness to fill out a comment
attribute). Rather than placing the responsibility on the protocol to provide potential confidence about a cookie, shouldn't it be placed on the content provider. Cookies are a mechanism by which one can store potentially stateful information and various bits of data, not one that provides a privacy issue/non-issue communication channel.
