The point is not that the protocol provides confidence by providing either
the comment or the commentURL only that the protocol provides the 
content provider (aka server) with the ability to easily associate the
description of cookie usage or whatever they'd like to say with the 
cookie.

What you propose guarantees that users will never look at the information
about cookies.  How do you expect them to find the information on
Netscape's or IBM's or Micorsoft's sites. The commentURL provides the
connection.  Otherwise it's a giant adventure game.
