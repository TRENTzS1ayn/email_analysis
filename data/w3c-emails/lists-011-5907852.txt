I don't see why the comment attribute shouldn't be retained
for short, telegraph strings like those appended to status lines.
That could be helpful when doing a cookie cleanup, at least for
ASCII-speaking users, and the commentURL would be available for
more substantive information, hopefully with a negotiable charset
and language. 

My thoughts on this are based on the hope that there will
be follow-through on a PEP or PEP-like extension, down the road,
which would further reduce the number of cookies about which the
user must be consulted at time of reception.
