 A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
 Working Group of the IETF.                                                

       Title     : Transparent Content Negotiation in HTTP                 
       Author(s) : K. Holtman, A. Mutz
       Filename  : draft-ietf-http-negotiation-03.txt
       Pages     : 43
       Date      : 07/25/1997

HTTP allows web site authors to put multiple versions of the same 
information under a single URL.  Transparent content negotiation is an 
extensible negotiation mechanism, layered on top of HTTP, for automatically
selecting the best version when the URL is accessed.  This enables the 
smooth deployment of new web data formats and markup tags.                 

Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address.  After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
     "get draft-ietf-http-negotiation-03.txt".
A URL for the Internet-Draft is:
ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-negotiation-03.txt
 
Internet-Drafts directories are located at:

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-negotiation-03.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.



Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
