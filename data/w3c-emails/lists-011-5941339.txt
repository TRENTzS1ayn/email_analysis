As I see things, a reasonable solution for Comment-URL could be
that servers MUST NOT send any cookie for URLS referenced in Comment-URL,
and that clients SHOULD discard them if received. 

UA, then, MAY let users accept any cookie which come with a Comment-URL
already "accepted" (and from the same domain, blah blah...). It cannot be
neither a MUST nor a SHOULD, of course, but it makes sense that if
you trust a cookie from a site because you agreed with the policy, it is
useless to show it over and over again.

ps : why is this discussions taking place in http-wg , rather than in
http-state?
