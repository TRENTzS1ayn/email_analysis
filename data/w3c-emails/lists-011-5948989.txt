%     If no Accept-Encoding field is present in a request, the server MAY
%     assume that the client will accept any content coding.  In this
%     case, if "identity" is one of the available content-codings, then
%     the server SHOULD use the "identity" content-coding, unless
%     it has additional information that a different content-coding
%     is meaningful to the client.

While the SHOULD make sense to me, I don't understand the reason for
the first MAY. What else could a server do? Reject the request 
altogether?

ciao, .mau.
