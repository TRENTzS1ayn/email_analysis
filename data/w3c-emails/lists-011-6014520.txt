I revised all four internet drafts connected to transparent content
negotiation, and put the new versions (.txt, .html, changebars, etc)
in the usual place:

 http://gewis.win.tue.nl/~koen/conneg/

The new drafts are:

1. draft-ietf-http-negotiation-03.txt 
     `Transparent Content Negotiation in HTTP' 
     Defines the core mechanism. Experimental track. 

2. draft-ietf-http-rvsa-v10-01.txt 
     `HTTP Remote Variant Selection Algorithm -- RVSA/1.0' 
     Defines the remote variant selection algorithm version 1.0. 
     Experimental track. 

3. draft-ietf-http-feature-reg-02.txt 
     `Feature Tag Registration Procedures' 
     Defines feature tag registration. Best Current Practice track. 

4. draft-ietf-http-feature-scenarios-01.txt 
     `Feature Tag Scenarios' 
     Discusses feature tag registration. Informational track.

There are no major changes in these drafts, except for some
improvements in the text and some resynchronisation.  Most of the
improvements are due to comments from Graham Klyne.

I hope to freeze 1. and 2. above as experimental RFCs soon after
Munich.

Happy reading!

Koen.
