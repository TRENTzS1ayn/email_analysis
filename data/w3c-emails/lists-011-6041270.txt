Intentionally no ... with good citizen seals and other future
possibilities, there may be no correlation we could see at the
protocol level and in the near term case, it seems reasonable that
IBM would have a corporate policy on use of the cookie information,
owned by the legal folks.  That policy URL would exist on www.ibm.com
but be referenced by www.lotus.com, www.hursley.ibm.com, etc.

OK, what errors exist which aren't appropriately UI design issues?
We have warned about recursion and suggested handling. Beyond that,
this URL is just a URL and except where absolutely necessary should
behave as any other URL. It shouldn't matter too much whether the user
clicks the URL in a cookie accept dialog, from a cookie history management
dialog or from a WWW page.
