The CommentURL mechanism assists the user in making a decision.  With
that in mind, the answer to your questions is, I think, the UA tells the
user what happened.  If we're talking about an inspection mechanism at
"the port of entry" (when a cookie accompanies a new page and before the
user has viewed the page), the user probably has a choice of whether or
not to accept the cookie.  Examining the comment URL is a way for the
user to make an informed choice.  If the UA reports it can't fetch the
CommentURL, the user still has that choice, just with less information
than s/he hoped for.

Assuming a sophisticated enough cookie inspection mechanism that would
let the user select cookie inspection behavior on a per-site basis, the
user can decide whether or not to inspect each cookie from a given site
as it arrives.  If, after looking at the first cookie from a site, the
user decides not to inspect each one, I would expect him/her still to be
able to inspect the cookies in the cookie jar later.

I think the only guard against a site that describes cookie policy one
way in one place and differently elsewhere is social pressure.  I don't
think the UA should try to guard against it.
