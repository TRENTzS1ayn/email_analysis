First, I would hope, though I must admit I've not tested the question,
that UA would receive the complete response w/o consideration for 
whether the user wished to accept the cookie. It would be bad programming
to keep the connection open while asking the user about accepting the
cookie, in particular since there is no suggestion in the cookie
inspection UIs I've used or in the cookie spec that the response should
be suppressed if the user suppresses the cookie. This is already an issue
if the UA cookie dialogs hold the connection open waiting for user
interaction so I don't see it as a significant change in the status quo.

Individual URLs are the lingua franca (sp?) of the web. As I've said
before, I'm not convinced that the whole official IETF cookie
definition provides much gain over cost when we consider the real
possiblity that the vast majority of users won't have the opportunity
to use the facilities and protections we've crafted.

But we've defined a baseline. Part of our argument has been for
informed consent. It is hard to argue in my mind that we support
informed consent when the only protocol supported mechanism for 
communication between the application/server and the user is a 
comment string.  URLs are the mechanism of information on the WEB and
as such are the 'right' approach here as well.

If you grew up with lawyers, then you know that getting two lawyers
to agree on sharing a single well known policy is even harder than
getting an IETF working group to produce a cookie standard, probably
by several orders of magnitude. So we can expect lawyers to insist
on having their own statement.

With a URL to check and track, you would at least be able to use existing
automated tools which will check web resources for change. W/o the URL,
the only choice would be to read each comment value, which if it was
several lines long, might have a subtle change you'd never see.

The difficultly is that I believe it unlikely that a comment value will
be changed when the policy changes ... comment values will be buried in
code unrelated to policy implementation ... code which is on the front
line which if not updated carefully could cause breakage. So I'm a
real skeptic when it comes to believing the comment. I also know it would
be impossible to find a cookie policy on most web sites so the commentURL
allows a protocol defined interoperable mechanism for connecting the
cookie to whatever descriptive material the publisher wants the user
to see.

I think the main benefit of everything we're currently doing with Cookie2
is to provide a foundation upon which something like Dan Jaye's proposal
can build. I believe CommentURL fills a critical gap and complements
Dan's proposals.
