A server could distinguish between old HTTP/1.0 scripts 
and new HTTP/1.1 ones, and either rewrite the response
or change the version number, or support another URL that
the redirected POST would redirect to, or change the version
of the response...

Even though it's awkward to do any of these things
doesn't mean that it's wrong.
