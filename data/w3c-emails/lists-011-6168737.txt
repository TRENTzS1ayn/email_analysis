 A Revised Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol 
 Working Group of the IETF.                                                

       Title     : Feature Tag Registration Procedures                     
       Author(s) : K. Holtman, A. Mutz
       Filename  : draft-ietf-http-feature-reg-02.txt
       Pages     : 12
       Date      : 07/28/1997

Recent Internet applications, such as the World Wide Web, tie together a 
great diversity in data formats, client and server platforms, and 
communities.  This has created a need for various kinds of negotiation 
mechanisms, which tailor the data which is exchanged, or the exchange 
process, to the capabilities and preferences of the parties involved. 
   
Extensible negotiation mechanisms need a vocabulary to identify various 
things which can be negotiated on.  To promote interoperability, a 
registration process is needed to ensure that that this vocabulary, which 
can be shared between negotiation mechanisms, is developed in an orderly, 
well-specified, and public manner.       
                                  
This document defines registration procedures which use the Internet 
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) as a central registry for this 
vocabulary, which is the vocabulary of feature tags.

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-feature-reg-02.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.



Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
