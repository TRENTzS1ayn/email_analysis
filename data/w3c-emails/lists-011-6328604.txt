We seem to be talking past each other, or something.  I don't understand
your remark.

Yes, the intent of chunking is dynamic content.  Well, actually, in my
mind the purpose of chunking is to provide a way to demarcate the end of
dynamic content so a server can keep its connection open.  So the
preferred behavior is that, if an HTTP/1.1 server supports CGIs, for
example, and the CGI does not provide a Content-Length, and the client
is also HTTP/1.1, the server can add a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked"
header to the response, chunk the output, and keep the connection open. 
But it's not required.
