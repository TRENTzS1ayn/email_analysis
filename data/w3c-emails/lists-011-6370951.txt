Unfortunately, when I get stuff I wrote back from a list server
and re-read it, it often becomes clear that I don't understand what
I'm talking about.  For a 301 on a POST, does that really mean
substitute the new RequestURI for all future submissions, or only
when the content is identical to that of the current submission?
