Ive added the following text:

This response is returned by a proxy, to a downstream proxy or
client, when it cannot or chooses not to honor a redirection.

Ive added these examples:

An example header:
    Set-proxy: SET ; proxyURI = "http://proxy.me.com:8080/", 
scope="http://", seconds=5

 Scope Meaning: all URLS beginning with "http://"

Another example header:
    Set-proxy: SET ; proxyURI = "http://proxy.me.com:8080/", 
scope="http://*.ups.com/", seconds=5

 Scope Meaning: all URLS beginning which are for 
  hosts in the ups.com domain.
