  [NON-Text Body part not included]

The question was whether a 1.0 response w/o content length had to 
be fixed up by a proxy .... my interpretation is that there are
three choices:

1.  Accumulate the body and create a correct content-length before
    forwarding.
2.  Add a cunked transfer encoding header and accumulate chunks
    and forward then with proper length fields
3.  Don't report the response as HTTP/1.1 in the status line

All of this of course presumes that the request was HTTP/1.1.
