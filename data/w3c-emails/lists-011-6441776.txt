I'm now beginning FINAL preparation to submit draft 08 to the ID drafts
repository later today.

Anything not in the draft this instant will have to wait for draft 09.
Sorry.

When the draft is in, I'll also update the issues list with current status.
Below is extracted from the abstract of the draft.

I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank the working group.  As you
will see from the following summary of where we are, the end is in sight.
I'll be seeing many of you in Munich.

This draft does not resolve all open issues in the HTTP/1.1 specification 
requiring closure before HTTP/1.1 goes to draft standard.  It does, however, 
close most of them, and note where in the document there are still significant 
issues under discussion.  

The most significant outstanding issue is OPTIONS; there is a separate internet 
draft on the topic that you should review NOT incorporated into this draft 
(though editorial notes identify where changes may occur).  This draft is 
draft-ietf-http-options-00.txt.

Also an issue: AGE-CALCULATION; Roy Fielding has issued an ID on the topic; 
Jeff Mogul intends to issue a draft as well.

The editorial group is very interested in feedback on the sample table of 
requirements in this draft (issue REQUIREMENTS, section 19.9). Is it useful?  
How could it be improved?
