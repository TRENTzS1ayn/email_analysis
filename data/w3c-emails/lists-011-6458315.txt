Many moons ago we had a discussion about creating a SAFE GET method.
During that discussion it was clear to me that any method which
didn't explictly exclude a request body could include one. IFF the
content-length and/or transfer-coding: chunked was specified.
In other words, for historical reasons, GET couldn't have a body and
there were words to that effect. I didn't specifically look for HEAD
or DELETE so I can't comment now, but I did convince myself that any
other 'modern' method could have a body under HTTP/1.1 because HTTP/1.1
requires an explicitly stated content length. (header or chunked
encoding).

And it is that explict length which allows proxies, servers, etc. to
sort out the question that Jeff raised. On a persistent connection,
the transaction is bogus if it has a body and doesn't have explict
length.

There is no hope for extensible methods if the rules don't allow content
with unknown methods.

So I think the wording needs to be something like (if this isn't there
already):

   Any request with a method which doesn't explicity exclude a content
   body may include a body. Any request which includes a body MUST
   explictly state the length with either a Content-length: header
   field or Transfer-encoding: chunked.
