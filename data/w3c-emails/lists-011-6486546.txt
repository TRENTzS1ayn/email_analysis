That makes sense, although I doubt it is implemented like that anywhere.

To take this a step further, I assume that also means that a 301
redirection remains in effect not only over variations of POST content,
but also over variation of method.  I.e. (if the same resource allows
multiple methods) a POST to a URL gets a 301 response, this would[*]
influence what the client does if it is later asked to do a GET on
the same URL.  And vice versa.

[*] Actually "could" instead of "would", since no client is required to
remember (cache) 301 responses.

Is that a correct understanding?
