There is no reason to have a special type for PEP extensions. Information
about PEP extensions (called extension policies) can be transmitted via any
number of mechanisms as pure metadata that doesn't take any action in the
message where they are included.

An extension is applied to a message by adding an extension declaration,
which differs from a policy in that the extension is being used in the
message.

There is work going on designing a generic metadata model by combining the
experiences from PICS and XML, but as this is not finished yet, the PEP
spec defines it's own mechanism for distributing metainformation (in PEP,
it's called a "policy" describing which extensions either MUST or MAY be
applied to a particular resource.)

With PEP-Info, the server would send:

       proxy4.microscape.com responds:
