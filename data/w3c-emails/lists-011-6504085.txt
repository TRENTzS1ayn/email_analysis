This implies that non-compliance-option allows parameters, e.g.:

   Non-Compliance: MyNameSpace=MyThing;MyParam@Somebody.Else.Proxy

Is this an accident of syntax?  If not, what is the interpretation of
such a header?  Two possibilities come to mind immediately:

   1) Somebody.Else.Proxy doesn't support the MyNameSpace=MyThing item.

   2) Somebody.Else.Proxy supports the MyNameSpace=MyThing item, but
      doesn't support it with the MyParam parameter.
