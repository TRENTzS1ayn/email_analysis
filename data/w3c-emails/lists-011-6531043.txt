Hi Jim,

Yes, I have a problem with marking this issue as closed, so please
don't mark it as closed.

Like Roy, I am opposed to the wording:

> A cache MUST NOT assign a heuristic expiration time to a

> "?" in its rel_path part. 

The strongest wording I would support here would be `A cache should
[lowercase!] be careful in assigning ...'.
