Current versions of Lynx have it implemented it like that.  They
do not "fix your damn links" in the sense of editing source files, because
that would be inapproriate or barred for a large percentage of the Lynx
user base, but for the remainder a user's session the 301's Location
will be substituted for the original RequestURI.  That's why it seemed
like a good idea to confirmed that this is really intended for a 301 on
a POST.
