Cool, although I was kinda hoping for a "Whoa!  We didn't mean for
parameters to be supported on Non-Compliance!"

I guess this means that a client needs to sort out all the Non-Compliance
headers it receives from proxies in a response and determine for itself
how parameters interact.  COND and UNCOND will probably be OK, but I
wonder about other parameters, especially the ever-present "token"
parameter.

I guess I weigh in as thinking that parameters should not be permitted
in Non-Compliance headers.
