I'm experiencing trouble with the POST request. I am currently practicing
Web Client Programming, so any help would be appreciated. I am trying to
submit a site to the following CGI program:

http://saturn.opentext.net/cgi-bin/submit.pl

using the POST method. It works fine when I use a form, but when I try to
do it with a Perl script - no success. The form can be found at:

http://saturn.opentext.net/main/submitURL.html

I am almost sure I did everything right. Could anyone please try to make
this thing work. Thanks in advance.
