there are many more elegant ways to distinguish between
old and new versions of user-written scripts, too, but
my point was to counter the claim that it was _impossible_,
not to invent an elegant possibility.

In general, if there are going to be any changes are
bug fixes, we have to deal with scripts that were written
against older specs. There are ".asis" CERN server scripts
that attempt to emit not just the body and a few directives
but the entire HTTP response. Clearly, if those scripts
are not rewritten but aren't conformant, they can't be
called HTTP. So at some point you _must_ distinguish scripts
(and servers) by their version, and either label older
scripts as "not HTTP/1.x" or else patch up their output.
