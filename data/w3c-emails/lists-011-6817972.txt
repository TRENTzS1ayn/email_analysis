OK. It still seems to me that the correct thing to do is to fix CGI. A
simple thing to do would be to add a version header:

CGI-Version: 1.1

Absence of the header means the script is 1.0 compliant. This is not an
HTTP header - the server would strip it, I assume, and doctor other
headers as needed.

Cheers,

Ben.
