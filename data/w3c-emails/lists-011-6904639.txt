I think this issue is much larger than whether the server know that 
an individual CGI script complies with HTTP/1.1 in what it generates.
This just as easily fixed with out band server configuration choices.
As a separate subject, it may be appropriate for some group to standardize
the CGI API and include a version, but that isn't our task and such a
change won't help this problem...

If a script was written to empirical behavior, it (actually, the target
being referenced) may expect a 302 response to POST to return as a GET.

That server may be accessed by a proxy which changes the HTTP status line
version to 1.1 making any necessary updates to header fields.

If a *client* which sees the 302 status on what is marked as an HTTP/1.1
response adopts rigid 302 handling, an existing HTTP/1.0
server/application will break. Who gets blamed? It works with my old
browser (still if I re-install it, etc.) and not the new one. In the
user's mind the blame rests with the browser, not an out of date server.

The 307 proposal works. Lets do it.
