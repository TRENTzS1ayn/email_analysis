I've checked the EBNF in draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-08.txt for formal syntax and 
context errors. Here is the result:

1) Some formal errors which were introduced by line formatting. They are 
   probably correct in the original (unformatted) document, aren't they?
   (see context-diff below)

2) in 'expect-params',  'Set-Proxy' and 'character':
   Some forgotten '"', '<>' and the like. (see context-diff below)

3> An omitted ')' in 'Accept-Charset' (see below)

4) Mispellings: (see below) 
      in 'chunk-extension': 'chunk-ext-value' instead of 'chunk-ext-val'
      in 'codings': 'content-codings' instead of 'content-codings'
      in 'Allow' and 'Public': 'method' instead of 'Method'
      'Connection-header' is declared instead of 'Connection' 
      
5) The following identifier are not declared at all:
      in 'lifetime' : 'integer'
      in 'keepalive-param' : 'param-name'

6) This identifier is declared in another document. That is mentioned in the 
   text: 
      in 'From' : 'mailbox' (RFC 822 / RFC 1123)

Bye,

Jacob
