A question has come up, is it legal for a server to send a
multipart/byteranges with a single range? This apparently causes some
very ugly code on the client side if it is legal. The following is an
excerpt from section 19.2 of RFC 2068:

19.2 Internet Media Type multipart/byteranges

   When an HTTP message includes the content of multiple ranges (for
   example, a response to a request for multiple non-overlapping
   ranges), these are transmitted as a multipart MIME message. The
   multipart media type for this purpose is called
   "multipart/byteranges".

My reading of this section is that a multipart/byteranges can only be
sent if there are byte rangeS but there has still been some question.

1) Is it correct that multipart/byteranges can only be used if there are
multiple, as in more than one, byteranges?
2) Either way, can we put in a sentence to clarify the matter?

Thanks,
Yaron
