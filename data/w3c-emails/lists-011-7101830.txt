Title: Specification of HTTP/1.1 OPTIONS messages
Author(s): J. Mogul, S. Lawrence, J. Cohen
Filename: draft-ietf-http-options-01.txt
Pages: 12
Date: 1997-08-04

RFC2068 defined a new OPTIONS method for HTTP/1.1.  The
        purpose of OPTIONS is to allow a 'client to determine the
        options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or
        the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource
        action or initiating a resource retrieval.'  However,
        RFC2068 did not defined a specific syntax for using OPTIONS
        to make such a determination.  This proposal clarifies the
        original specification of OPTIONS, adds several new HTTP
        message headers to provide syntactic support for OPTIONS,
        and establishes new IANA registries to avoid namespace
        conflicts.

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.

Send a message to:mailserv@ds.internic.net.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-options-01.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
