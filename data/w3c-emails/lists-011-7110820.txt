Well, this is not really a case where we have to agree on what the most
correct way is.  19.6.1 documents current practice, it is not
normative, so if anything, it should give hints about what to do with
current browsers.

I just sent gzipped content with

 Content-Type: text/html
 Content-Encoding: gzip
 Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="fname.html.gz"

to a Netscape 3.0.1 on Unix.  On saving, the save as filename box
suggested "fname.html", and the unencoded content got saved (the URL
was something without fname.html in it).

Now for the fun part: I then sent the same gzipped html with

 Content-Type: text/html
 Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="fname.html.gz"

and now Netscape displayed and saved the unzipped version, as
expected, but it _also_ suggested a filename of "fname.html".
Apparently there is something in there which chops the .gz from a
filename no matter what.

Based on this, I am very reluctant to add informational text to the
spec about how you should use content-disposition and content-encoding
together.
