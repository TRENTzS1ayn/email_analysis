I suggest that draft-duerst-query-i18n-01.txt, which has now
finally appeared on the anouncing list, be added to this list.
I suggest that it is added after Koen's
draft-holtman-http-safe-01.txt because it deals with the
same topic of form upload and internationalization.
Note that technically, the draft is more related to negotiation,
and is intended to apply independently of HTTP/1.0 or 1.1.

There was originally a plan to have a separate BOF on this
topic, but it unfortunately had to be cancelled because
a lot of specific experts (in particular internationalization
experts from the browser side) were inable to attend.

I therefore don't think it makes sense to allocate much time
to it; two or three minutes would be nice. The main aim at
the moment is to have people to take notice of the problem
and the proposed solution.

Regards,Martin.
