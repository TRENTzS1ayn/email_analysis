Why?

As I understand export regulations, no authentication-only method
is export controlled.  As for patent restrictions, have you
actually done an investigation into these?

I'd like to better understand your concerns here, with regard
to both patents and public-key techniques.  To rule out the entire
category of public-key assisted methods seems extremely
limiting, and a clear rationale for such a fundamental
restriction is certainly missing from the draft.
