That section references only RFC 1806, which describes the
"attachment" and "inline" disposition types.  My recollection of
a long-ago message from Lou is that Netscape based its implementation
on the file upload RFC's "file" disposition type.  What is the
appropriate disposition type to use in HTTP Content-Disposition
headers and META elements, and can information about that be included
in 19.6.1?
