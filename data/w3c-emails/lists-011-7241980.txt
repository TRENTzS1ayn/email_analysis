draft-moore-mime-cdisp-01.txt is intended to move 'content-disposition'
onto standards track. Since HTTP-WG is debating this header and has some
ambiguities with its use in practice, it might be good to bring HTTP's
usage in line with whatever the standard is, and vice versa.

 This is probably an 'issue' for both HTTP-WG and IESG
