RFC 1808 and also draft-moore-mime-cdisp-01.txt say this:

   Disposition parameters are valid for all dispositions.  (In contrast
   to [RFC 1521] content-type parameters, which are defined on a per-
   content-type basis.) Thus, for example, the `filename' parameter
   still means the name of the file to which the part should be written,
   even if the disposition itself is unrecognized.

So it seems that Netscape's client follows the RFC in that regard (or did
so, at the time of writing).

Use of Content-Disposition in file uploads is a different topic, I think.
If a file upload uses this header, it is probably within a 
multipart/form-data structure, and thereby out of scope for the HTTP
protocol.(?)

By the way, is Content-Disposition really a response-header?
It seems to make more sense to say it is an entity-header.
