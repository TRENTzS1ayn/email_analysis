Folks,

There has been an increasing amount of spam sent to the http-wg mailing list.
Several people on the list have asked why I allow spam to be sent.

Firstly, it is difficult to distinguish between spam and legitimate postings.
Secondly the http-wg mailing list is currently open and non-moderated.

There are several solutions:

* We can just delete spam messages.

* The list could be changed to a closed list where only people subscribed to
  the list may post.

* The list could be moderated.

* Somebody could come up with a good way of determining spam, or alternatively 
  legitimate postings to the list.

I'm open to all sensible suggestions.
