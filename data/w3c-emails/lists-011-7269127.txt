In past mail conversations with Netscape developers, Netscape (up to 3.01, I
haven't tried 4.0) only recognizes the Content-Disposition header if and only
if the Content-Type is Octet-stream.  Otherwise the browser tries to make-up a
filename based on the basename of the current URL.

As for C-D in a multipart, I do not see where it is out of scope.  The headers
are in an alternate delivery mechanism that is supported by by the community.
