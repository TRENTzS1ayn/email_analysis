Larry, Phillip, Paul, John, and other authors of the draft,

I apologize for raising an old issue with the WG,
and for implying that the work behind this was not
well considered.  I just looked at the draft as a
standalone document, and did not find clear support
or explanation for the resulting design.

The combined responses of John, Paul, Phillip, and Larry
provide a much clearer reason for the design decisions,
however I might disagree with the outcome.
My concern comes from the fact that the rationale
for restriction to this method is not captured in
the draft.

So, without further insult, or re-hashing of old issues,
I'd suggest that the draft be amended slightly to
include more of the careful considerations of the
authors.  (specific suggestions at end)

In questioning this rationale (in obviously a
too-nasty way) I stimulated the following responses:

Paul wrote:

This should be captured in the draft.  It definitely makes
the work sound more diligent.

Paul:

I think including accurate factual statements of weakness is very
important.  Opinions on proper forms of certification and
key distribution tend to be a little more controversial, and
I'd avoid using "strong" and "weak" in this regard in such
documents.

The speed requirement should be in the draft.

Ok.  Sorry I implied you guys were neglectful, and I hope
you'll not hold my rudeness against me.  I probably wouldn't
have said what I said if the draft contained a full rationale.
It seems important to capture careful reasoning in
print to insure that future readers also don't jump to
conclusions.

Ok.  But "conspiracy theories"?  My statement was simply that
the draft had a "hidden agenda", which is true, for readers
who didn't follow the working group from the start.  Frank, Paul,
and Philip have made the agenda clear in their responses.
I think the draft should incorporate their points.

Specific suggestions
--------------------
The method was chosen for a variety of reasons, as discussed
in the draft, but the discussion should also include at least
one paragraph that incorporates the following reasons
(restated appropriately by the authors):

1) to be compatibile with and standardize on existing practice.

2) because implementations of public-key based methods
were found to be too slow.

3) because no unpatented public-key alternatives were known
to the authors, and

4) because patent licensing was out of the question,
because of (...)

5) to avoid export regulations (specifically ...)

Also, there is discussion about brute-force attack on the
encrypted password database, but a potentially larger
threat is an eavesdropper performing a brute-force attack
on the challenge and response messages.  The document
should describe this weakness too.

Thanks.
