I'm not sure what would be difficult about turning off cookies for commentURL requests.

Keep in mind that most people on this list know/care about cookies and their content. We're a unique user group who has a vested interest in cookies. I don't think the average user knows/cares about cookies to this degree and we may be getting a bit carried away proposing that commentURL be implemented.

The commentURL may be considered the fine print that no-one will spend the time to read anyway. I also don't think content providers are going to want to share the meaning of their cookies (perhaps for marketing purposes).

It is for this reason that I believe comment should be yanked.

Having both is a waste of parsing code.
