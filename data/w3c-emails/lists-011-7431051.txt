A request-line MUST contain a method.
After that request-headers can follow.
But can every request-header be combined with every request-Method?

Waht does the 'PUT http:..
       Accept: ..'
 mean?

Is there a document that describes which header can go with which
Start-line ?

I thought that request-headers can be seen as parameters for 
request-methods.
