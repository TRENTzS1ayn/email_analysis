In most cases, yes, but the relevant question is why they are not cached.
The reason given by all of the cache maintainers I talked to at the
Geneva, Chicago, Boston, Paris, and Santa Clara WWW conferences is that
attempts to cache those responses led to poor hit frequency on the cache.
In other words, it is a performance optimization and does not need to
be written into the protocol.

Why?  Why is it "necessary" to force a cachable response to be non-cachable?
HTTP/1.0 had its own mechanisms for indicating cachability, and the presence
or absence of "?" or "cgi-bin" or "htbin" does not indicate anything.
It is a fundamentally bad idea to associate any URL pattern with a particular
HTTP functionality, because it breaks the separation between those two
protocols.
