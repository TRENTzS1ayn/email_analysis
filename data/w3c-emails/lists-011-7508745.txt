I truly wish people would check the specification before making
such interpretations.  An HTTP/1.1 response is not required to have
a content-length or a transfer-encoding.  A response without one of
those length indicators is, as in HTTP/1.0, delimited by closing the
connection.  See section 4.4 of RFC 2068.
