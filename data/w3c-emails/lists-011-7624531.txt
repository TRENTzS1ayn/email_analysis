  As David W. Morris points out, I misquoted in my response; to
  correct...

  There is no such thing as the 'entity version of the transaction'.
  Indeed, to make the statement even more concise, there is no such
  thing as the 'entity version'.

  The requestor has a version, and sends it (which may, at the
  requestors option for whatever reason, be less than the highest
  version it could use); the responder has a version and sends it, but
  the response itself must always be valid according to the rules of
  version sent by the requestor.  What could be simpler?
