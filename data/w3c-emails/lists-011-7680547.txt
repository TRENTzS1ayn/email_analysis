In an earlier round of discussions about this, when that false
claim was checked against reality, and the consequent problem of it
leading to inappropriately chunked POSTs was raised, the suggested
workaround kludge was your second, i.e., for the client to send an
OPTIONS request, and proceed with the chunked POST only if it doesn't
get back a 400 from the broken proxy.  That'll work with the CERN proxy,
but I don't know about Squid, or if any other proxies are similarly broken
in reality (from Josh's original message, it seems likely the Netscape
proxy also passes through the origin server's status line for the response,
without changing the minor version number to it's own).
