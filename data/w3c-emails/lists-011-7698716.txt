I am not complaining about the workaround - I agree that it is better to
have a working solution than to have none but comply to the standard.

I think it still complies conditionally, it's just a SHOULD.

I was more examining the standard, not your solution.  If a working
workaround for those two problems would *require* violation of the SHOULD
in 2145 2.3 last para, then this would be a good reason for relaxing that
SHOULD requirement - because Apache should not be "punished" for such a
workaround.  As it is (if I understand correctly), the workaround could
be changed, at least in principle, so as no to affect compliance.
There may be other good reasons why the SHOULD should be dropped, it just
turns out that this example isn't a good case for it.
