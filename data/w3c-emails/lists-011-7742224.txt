I stand corrected.  There does exist at least a hypothetical example
where the "capability semantics" of the version header can be of use.
The functionality seems very limited given the problems it has caused
and the existence of an OPTIONS header which might be better suited for
the purpose, but at least this semantics is not intrinsically  useless.

Perhaps it would be helpful to have a sentence in the specification
saying "The capability semantics of the response version header is
intended (solely?) for the benefit of clients which wish to implement
certain features not compatible with the HTTP version with which they
are conditionally compliant."  Had I been aware of this I would not
have claimed it had no discernible use.
