Are repeated pop-up warnings a protocol problem?  Seems to me they're a UI
problem, not a protocol problem.  The browser _could_ (though indications
are the browser companies don't see the value in this) provide a better
set of cookie-rejection options to, for instance, avoid bugging the user
with repeated pop-ups.
