when a client is 1.0 and the server is 1.1, then this
would be true, the response header has no meaning except the
server's highest version (for subsequent responses) since it
can assume a 1.0 entity respondse since it gave a 1.0 request.

However, when a client is 1.1 and the server is 1.0, the client
cant make assumptions about the reponse, it uses the response
version to notice that it is talkig to a 1.0 server.
