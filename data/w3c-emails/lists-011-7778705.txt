OK.  I don't know what's the proper terminology, but in effect
it's punting down to an HTTP/0.9 response, so if the UA uses the rule,
"Assume an old, non-compliant HTTP/1.0 proxy is interposed if you don't
get back a 200 status.", the OPTIONS probe should work.

Your example, in another message, of a UA which sends a "minor
= n" request but wants to know if it can use any "minor > n" functionality
which it has implemented thus far is a very realistic case, and gets at
the reasoning behind the versioning rules (based on my recollections of
previous outbreaks of these debates :), so I agree with John that it would
help to spell out that reasoning rather than leaving it in a "That goes
without saying, dummy!" category.  That's the case which is most
problematic when an old HTTP/1.0 proxy is interposed and passes through
an origin server's HTTP/1.[> 0] response status unmodified.  If you get
back Connection: close, you don't know if it's a direct response to your
HTTP/1.0 request, so you can't avoid the overhead of an OPTIONS probe.
If the UA did send an HTTP/1.1 request, then it could infer that something
is fishy.  Is there a reason to worry about these things in HTTP/1.1
except in the case of chunking (though that's an enhancement hoped to
be widely implemented ASAP, so I don't intend to minimize the issue)?
