Umm, not to further complicate things..
We discussed this at the \wg and afterwards in an offline discussion,
and it seems that if we assume that proxies will UPGRADE the request
to their highest version, then leaving things as is will be livable.
This is what 2145 seems to say..\

(this allows a proxy to use 1.1 when ever possible to the origin
server and be able to satisfy 1.0 and 1.1 clients on cache hits
with no ambiguity.. )

The only case still uncovered is the chunked upload..
Since that is a less common and more expensive operation, would
it be wise to say that before you do a request like that, you
should or must check the server version with OPTIONS?
