Speaking only for myself, I don't like them because they're too
often used only to track user behavior rather than provide me
some service. 

In that case, I'd like to save cookies and replay them, only if my
request URL can contain a small advertisement, ala' Yahoo, et al's
pages. That way, I too can recover the cost of maintaining state for a
_commercial_ entity, for _their_ benefit.

Until then, I'll turn them off. Less state on both ends ought to
make the processing response time faster, if nothing else.
