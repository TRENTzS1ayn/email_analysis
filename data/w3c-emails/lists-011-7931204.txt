Yes, of course you're right, if it were per-cookie instead of per-server.
If there were a generic "don't send cookies" command, that would not convey
any state information.

As Marc Hedlund pointed out, we don't need anything in the protocol
for this at all -- the same UI mechanisms that would have to be built
for that could entirely handle the problem. 

Sorry to waste time by bringing this up -- the dangers of "thinking out loud"
in a group like this.
