That statement was nothing more than a personal opinion "shared"
with implementors on the list.  It is based on the following reasoning:

(1) This WG consistently has backed off from getting involved
with a "CGI standard", so being "CGI/1.1 compliant" can't be a rigorous
requirement, and it seems "risky" to assume that the HTTP/1.1 protocol
overtly addresses all needs of CGI scripts.

(2) One might infer that the basic needs are met, because a
number of the WG participants care about meeting them, but Roy recently
posted a message saying:

"I have a feeling that chunked requests will only be usable by
 specialized applications.  A normal CGI script cannot accept
 chunked, because CGI/1.1 itself requires a Content-Length."

any he's far more familiar with the thousands of lines in the -08 draft
and associated LAST_CALL drafts than I. :)

(3) If the UA were to issue an OPTIONS request concerning
CGI compliance, the response could say no more than one about
cookies:  "I hope so, but who knows what the author of the script
put into it?!?"


So, it seems "safer" to stick with unchuncked, HTTP/1.0 POSTs,
for now.
