Instead of debating which is more useful, might it not be sensible to
consider sending BOTH in a clearly labelled fashion.

I think this issue can be tricky.  Keep in mind that a 1.1 server
responding to a 1.2 proxy is free to send an entity with a
1.1 version header, but using ANY 1.2 features it wants.  Indeed
it was precisely to facilitate this that the "capability semantics"
of the version header was designed.

Compare this with sending both.  If a 1.1 server sends an entity to a
1.2 proxy which says the server version is 1.1 but the entity version
is 1.2, then it is completely clear that the server is only
conditionally compliant up to 1.1 but it is using 1.2 features so the
entity sent is only guaranteed to be useful, as sent, for a 1.2 agent.
