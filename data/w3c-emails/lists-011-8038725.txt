It would actually be reasonable behavior for a proxy-only server,
i.e. a server which is not also configure to act as an origin server,
to respond with an error status to all requests which don't use the
absoluteURI form for Request-URI.  And the non-absoluteURI form is
required for the OPTIONS probe, to make sure it is really the next-hop
proxy who answers.

This leads to another question.  Does the proposed OPTIONS probe
actually *work* for an Apache/1.[23]* server acting as proxy?  As Roy
has revealed Apache-as-proxy is one of the cases where HTTP/1.1
response status is improperly forwarded.  I suspect (but cannot test)
that the same server would respond as HTTP/1.1 when checked with
OPTIONS, making the probe worthless.
