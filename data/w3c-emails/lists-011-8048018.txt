Ah!  An implementation issue, not a terminology issue. :)

It *is* an HTTP/1.1 server, so one would not predict a serious
problem during this transition, just as the shortcut had no apparent
problem for the old HTTP/1.0 proxies during the HTTP/0.9 -> HTTP/1.0
transition.  It would become a problem for an HTTP/1.1 -> HTTP/1.2
transition.  But one can also predict that it will be fixed ASAP,
and hopefully the current Apache servers will all have been replaced
by then. :)

By "serious" problem I mean that sharing of worthwhile information
fails (just to be clear about my terminology :).
