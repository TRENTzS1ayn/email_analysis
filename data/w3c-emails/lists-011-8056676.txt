Ok thanks, that's a start.

Now it remains to be shown for what this would be useful.  (It also
remains to be seen whether Josh agrees with your definition :) )

As given by your formal definition, the "entity version" (which should be
cassed something else, see below) can be trivially derived from the
message.  It just requires tables of all headers defined by the various
protocol versions, nothing else.  Therefore it is totally redundant.

No.  The entity is the entity-body together with the *entity*-headers,
*not* all headers.  According to the Official Guide to HTTP-ese.
I don't think that is what you mean.

So your formal definition above has failed to describe what you mean.
There is one thing which cannot be trivially derived from the message
itself as given, and the definition does not account for it.

Anyway, the property of the response which you express as an implicit
Connection token is unambiguously defined one way or the other, each
time such a response message is received, by the version number in the
status line.  So again this is redundant information.

As defined so far, I don't see any use for it...
