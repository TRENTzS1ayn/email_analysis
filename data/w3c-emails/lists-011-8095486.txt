According to the "New Features in Apache 1.2" page, 
  Aside from the optional proxy module (which operates as HTTP/1.0),
  Apache is conditionally compliant with the HTTP/1.1 [...]
I am not sure what this means, i.e. does it still act as an HTTP/1.1
server when the proxy is used, aside from the version number question,
and as far as a client needs to know.  For the concrete (although 
currently rather theoretical) question about accepting chunked encoding,
would the proxy decode a request body before forwarding it.
