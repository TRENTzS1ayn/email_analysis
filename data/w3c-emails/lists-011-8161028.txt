Small clarification...the Apache proxy does downgrade responses to
HTTP/1.0, but stores them in the cache with the original version,
meaning that it only screws up when the response is being delivered
from the cache.

Note that www.apache.org is *not* a proxy.  Apache when operating as
a proxy is a completely different beast (protocol-wise) than the
origin server, even if they are listening to the same port.
