What I meant by that is the side of the Apache proxy that thinks it
is an HTTP/1.1 origin server, rather than the proxy code itself.

BTW, in case I didn't mention it, I think combining a proxy and an origin
server into a single application is a terrible idea.  Don't let the
CERN example fool you into supporting it, even if the ex-CERN users
are constantly begging at your door.
