Consensus in Munich (which does not include many concerned with this
issue) was that comment/commentURL is to be taken out of the spec, which I
believe is the right thing to do. How is this formally done? Let's do it.

Why it shouldn't be in RFC 2109:
- RFC 2109 is concerned with the functionality of cookies/stateful
sessions.
- It is not the protocol's place to include this type of explanatory
information to the user (if it belongs anywhere, it belongs in another
spec related to privacy concerns and cookies; as suggested by Larry
Misinter).
