I agree -- one mechanism for handling private information would be much
better than separate mechanisms for cookies, Java, etc.  It should also
be pursued by another working group, so that http-state can handle the
rest of the revisions to the cookie spec.  This has been a tremendously
contentious issue, which should be handled in general purpose fashion
rather than on a case-by-case basis (which is what commentURL does).


Thanks for writing the above, Larry -- I was going to ask you exactly
why you objected to commentURL, but your email stated it very clearly
(and changed my mind to boot).
