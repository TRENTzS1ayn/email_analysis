You are agreeing with a misunderstanding or misrepresentation
of what is in draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-03.txt.  Efforts to deal
with the "trust" issue within it *consistently* have been rejected,
for a variety of reasons, and instead are "postponed" to future efforts
to address this contentious issue:

Sorry, I'm not willing to entertain the idea of credentials
and trusted parties for this version of the spec.  Maybe it's
reasonable for the future, but lacking a complete description
of the credentials infrastructure, your proposal isn't practical
now.

I believe Jaye's proposal can be defined as an overlay to
RFC 2109 (or its successor).  Since (I presume) the use of
certified cookies will be optional, there will still need to
be a definition of what happens with uncertified cookies.
It will take awhile to work out the details of Jaye's proposal,
and I think tying the progress of RFC 2109 to jaye-trust-state-00.txt
(and its successors) will delay a state management standard
needlessly.
From a purely procedural standpoint, it's easier to get
agreement on smaller things than bigger ones.  Imagine, for a
moment, that we try to merge RFC 2109 and jaye-trust-....  As
long as the full document is under discussion, the whole thing
will be subject to tinkering (and arguing).  Better to nail down
a substantial portion of the document, namely RFC 2109, and set
it aside as done.

I would rather not have the standards merged. Jaye's proposal
is something I am extremely interested in implementing. 2109
is something I would rather not have to deal with. By keeping
the standards separate I get to more easily pick and choose.

What I actually had in mind for RFC2109' and jaye-trust-...
was more like this:  RFC2109' would be much like state-man-mec-01.
There wouldn't be any specific forward references to new mechanisms. 
When/if jaye-trust-... becomes an RFC, it would make reference to
specific sections of RFC2109' and how it supersedes them.  For
example, there might be a section that says that if a certified
cookie carries a trust level that is at or above a configured
level in the user agent, then the rules about unverified transactions,
which otherwise might be violated, would be satisfied.  (Obviously
the words would be much more detailed.)
-- dmk@bell-labs.com (Dave Kristol) 21-May-1997

My preference is for Set-PICS-Cookie (or some other header name)
be a strict add-on to RFC 2109 (or successors).
-- dmk@bell-labs.com (Dave Kristol) 30-May-1997


and so on and so on, through draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-03.txt!!!!!

There is not such thing as a "trusted cookie spec" -- subject
line for this thread notwithstanding.  That is a figment of Larry's
and now also your imaginations, probably due to unresolved approach-
avoidance conflict.  But the bottom line is that its still avoided.
