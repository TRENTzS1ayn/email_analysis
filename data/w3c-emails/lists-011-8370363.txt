RFC 2109 was a product of the HTTP working group. As with all working
group products, someone or some group actually will go off and write
a specification, and then the working group will review the
specification.
The review is open. What happens in the minds or conversations among
those who develop the specification is not. 

Section 4.3.2 "Rejecting Cookies" and 4.3.3 "Cookie Management" talk
directly about the motivation for the features therein. 4.3.2 says
"To prevent possible security or privacy violations", 4.3.3 says 
"Privacy considerations dictate that the user have considerable
control over cookie management." No other rationale is given.
The RFC itself is the best authority for what the "primary motiviation"
is for rejecting cookies, and it says so clearly. (I said 'disallowing'
but should have said 'rejecting', and perhaps my miswording is
the source of your confusion.)

In any case, the RFC itself is pretty self-explanatory.

Yes, the arguments for "commentURL" were as a response to difficulties
with "Comment" in 2109. Personally, I'd rather see "Comment" removed
than to continue to add capabilities to it.

I'd stop "obstructing" this, except that a room full of people in Munich
seemed to nod when I suggested changing direction here.
