The state subgroup was formed out of http-wg; see
<http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1995q4/0144.html> and
following messages in the "Revised Charter" thread; and the minutes of the
December 1995 IETF (Dallas), which directly mention the subgroup
formation: 
<http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1995q4/0465.html>.

The state subgroup had several conference calls on which I took minutes; I
can probably dig them up if needed, though commentURL did not arise out of
those discussions.

I still think this whole discussion is totally pointless without buy-in
from vendors.
