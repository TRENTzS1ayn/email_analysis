I'm definately coming late to this discussion, but I have some strong
thoughtsto offer.

99.2% of the browsers in use today including all versions of netscape and IE
reissue POST redirects with a GET.  It would be incredibly fool hardy to
try and change this behaviour now.  It is far easier to swap the meaning of
303 and 301/302 than it is to fix every CGI in the world as well as every old
browser in the world.   I doubt that any commercial vendor is willing to
release a product that will break a large number of sites simply to claim
compliance with this spec.

How is this issue going to get resolved?  This tread died out almost a month
ago yet there is no solution yet.  The current situation is unworkable.
