See the appended, additional message from that set, also highly

  There are several pages on the Web ("The Revolving Door" comes to mind)
  which, on the basis of form input, redirect you to one of a number of
  different pages.  These pages then need to be retrieved using GET.  This
  usage appears to be much more common than a redirect where the client is
  supposed to POST again on the target system.

  At a very early stage of development, Enhanced Mosaic would actually do
  another POST after a redirect.  In every case that this happened, it
  generated incorrect results (like an "Action not allowed" response).  I
  think that switching to GET after a redirect is current practice for most
  browsers.
