My memory was the consensus in Munich was just to swap the codes,
rather than crufting up the protocol more.  

The discussion was of order:

Either introducing a new code, or doing the swap will work fine,
but given the cat isn't really out of the bag (yet), that people
present preferred not to have yet another wart in the protocol.

The people present included both apps area directors, and representatives
of both Netscape and Microsoft.

Anyone else at the meeting have a different memory of the discussion?
