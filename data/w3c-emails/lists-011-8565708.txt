I agree.


>     which means that there would be more than one set of goals:

  origin servers -- Compatibility, thread management and memory usage
  proxies        -- Compatibility, tendency to kill pipeline
  browsers       -- User Agent testing scripts, cache behaviour, speed

Also, we should keep-away from virtual protocols (RSVP over IP)
and network bandwidth reservation.

My feelings here are that this is a LINUX like activity: This should be
done over the net, and immediately -- let's create a list
of servers, their download locations and installation notes,
-- Let's move this to a different list (or create another list)

Open items:


1. A definitive list of the available for download HTTP 1.1 compliant
servers (IIS4, Apache, Jigsaw, etc.)

2. HTTP 1.1 compliant browsers (communicator, ie, etc.) list
and download sites.

3. Participating webmasters list

4. Hardware inventory for the servers from (3)

Once this is in place, we can draft up a testing plan.
I can set up a couple of servers for this to handle 
a list as soon as (or if) we hit consensus.

Who's for an HTTP 1.1 free pizza and stone soup party?
