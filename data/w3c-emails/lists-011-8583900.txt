I think we were really thinking more of an 'interoperability test'
than an 'interoperability demonstration'. The goal is 'figure
out whether people's HTTP/1.1 implementations work with each other,
and if not, what's wrong'.

A secondary goal is 'document interoperable use of each HTTP/1.1
feature with independent implementations', in order for us to
move to 'draft standard' status. That means that a checklist going
down HTTP/1.1 headers and seeing if they're emitted, responded
to correctly, etc., in various combinations would be a good idea.

I think it's important that organizations be able to test
implementations anonymously, so that there's no press leakage or story
telling.

Larry
