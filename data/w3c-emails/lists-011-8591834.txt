Here is an excerpt from the meeting minutes I sent to Larry.  My notes
confirm what you recall.

 1 301-302 Problems with redirecting requests.

 Josh Cohen reported on the conclusions reached in the offline
 discussion about this issue.  The general conclusion reached was that
 the text in the -08 draft should be changed, either by swapping the
 302 and 303 codes, or by allocating a new code and declaring 302
 obsolete.  The swapping option was preferred.  It was decided to send
 mail to the list soon, proposing the preferred solution, so that this
 issue could be closed.  Yaron Goland urged the working group to close
 this issue quickly.

Note that is was not decided, as far as I recall, *who* should send the
message referred to above to the list.  I have not seen such a message
yet.
