  Having checked with my boss, I can now do this one better.  Any
  vendor interested in doing interoperability testing with our 1.1
  origin server anonymously _off_ the Internet should contact me.  I
  can produce a binary version of our server that we can provide you
  to experiment with.  All we ask is that:

  - You don't give it to anyone else.

  - Any problems you find with it you tell us, and only us (if we
    disagree about whether or not something is a problem we can bring
    the question to this list together).
