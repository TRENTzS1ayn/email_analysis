We have (at least) three kinds of agents:

  clients, proxies, origin servers

and probably 'proxy' has several variations. Let's suppose
we have C1, C2,..Cnc, P1, P2, P3, and O1, O2, ... Ono. We should
test each HTTP operation with at least a reasonable set
of combinations of headers and header values through all
nc * np * no combinations client, proxy, and origin server.
We should test chains of 0, 1, 2, ... n proxies, against
HTTP/1.0 versions of legacy clients, proxies & servers.

I'd like to test entity tags, if-match, vary headers, 
caching, cache timeout, last-modified, redirects, etc.

We should do some stress testing, aborted connections, persistent
connections, connections in the face of (faked) network failures.

I think we could manage to get 6-7 clients, 8-9 proxy servers,
and 10 origin servers.

We probably should generate some kind of dummy test client,
dummy test proxy and dummy test server for systematically
running through various error messages.

I don't know how we can test cookies.

Let's plan on making this a regular event, rather than getting
it all right the first time.

I'd rather mainly plan to do it on the net rather than a physical
event.
