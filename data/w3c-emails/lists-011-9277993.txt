  So far, the response to my survey questions has been underwhelming.

  I am hoping that this is because there was not a sufficiently
  concrete proposal.  If it was because you just haven't gotten to it,
  feel free to do so.  In any case, I'd like to put forward a somewhat
  more structured idea in hopes that it will generate some more
  interest.  I don't consider any part of the following to be cast in
  stone; please suggest improvements.

  ================

  Each Thursday from 16 October 1997 through 20 November 1997
  inclusive will be a Test Day; anyone who plans to participate must
  send mail by 23:55 GMT on the preceding Tuesday to a central
  registrar.  The registrar will forward the information by email on
  Wednesday to all who have signed up.  Each participant provides:

    Organization:

    User-Agent or Server string: (may be approximate)

    HTTP Role: [origin, proxy, tunnel, client, robot, ...]

    HTTP Version:

    Address: (DNS host names and/or IP addresses for the HTTP
              implementation)

    Time: (GMT times the system will be active or available)

    Contact Name:  (person to contact with an issue)

    Contact Email:

    Contact Phone:

    Contact Hours: (GMT times the contact is available, should overlap
                    the span in Time, but may be a subset)

    Notes: other relevant information, possibly including URLs for
           information on where to find background material.

  A single organization may register as many participating systems as
  they need, but should register separately for different roles or
  substantially different configurations so that other participants
  can distinguish them easily (for example, my company will probably
  make available one origin server that is using a clock and one that
  is not).

  Note that HTTP Version is included; it will be useful to have 1.0
  (and even 0.9) implementations participating in all roles,
  especially if they are instrumented to provide traces.

  Some ground rules:

    - Participating systems may be configured to allow access only by
      announced participants for that week.

    - Participants will, on request, make a reasonable effort to
      provide whatever relevant log or trace data they have to other
      participants to resolve problems.

    - If a problem or possible issue with another participant
      implementation is found, that issue will be communicated to the
      contact for that implementation promptly.  Only if the
      involved participants disagree on the correct behavior or if
      the involved participants agree to do so will the issue be
      brought to the working group mailing list.

    - Any other disclosure of problems found with other
      implementations during these tests is poor form.

    - Communicating positive results to other participants is
      strongly encouraged.
