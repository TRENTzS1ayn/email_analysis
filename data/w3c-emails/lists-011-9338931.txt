After reviewing both drafts and dredging my mail logs for the on-list
debate, I have to side with Jeff Mogul's take on the issue, both in
terms of analysis and in his recommendation of "Interpretation C".
I understand Roy Fielding's concern about heirarchical proxies and
bandwidth, but from my company's experience I have to believe that the
correct approach is to always return the right response no matter how
much bandwidth it wasted.
