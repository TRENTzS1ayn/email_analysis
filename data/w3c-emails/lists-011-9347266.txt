Hi All,

I'm a new member of this mailing list and and also new to the HTTP protocol.

My reason for joining this list is becuase I have some questions I hope you
can help me with.

I have recently been working on a program which connects to HTTP servers
and downloads pages (in a simular way to a browser) so far this has been
quite easy I have browsed the web and got information on HTTP commands and
managed to get my program to download pages that are potected with basic
authentication (pages from my own web site). 

I have something like this..

GET /private/index.htm HTTP/1.0
Authorization: Basic KryjDHwsyuH286fkOl=

However I would now like to push things to the server in the same way as
the browser does when you fill out forms (POST/PUT) however I seem to be
totally stumped.

Can anyone help?  Just a basic example of what commands are sent to the
server when a form is filled out on a browser would be enough.

Thanx In Advance.
-NICK-
