Hello,
I am software developer developing wide range of applications
in different platforms and technologies for last eight years. 
For the last one year I am actively involved in developing web 
based applications.

I had some thoughts on making browsing more friendlier in
this diversified world. I would like to share my thoughts here.
I hope I am doing the right thing. If this is not what I should
have done please ignore this mail. Or if this is already 
addressed, please let me know how this is handled.

In current scenario, there is no information to the web server
from where the request is coming from, what I mean is the
geographical location (apart from IP address) and also the
language of preference of the user. 

So, my thought was to add a line of info, which will provide 
the language of preference and geographical location if 
provided by the request originator (If browsers can extract 
this info from user's preferences). This information can 
be used by the 'site's to automatically redirect the request
to appropriate page which will serve the proper pages.

Possible use of this extensions would be in the 
sites of following organizations:

* Multinational companies can have a single web site which
routes the users automatically to their countries local sites.

* Information providers with 'local' interest, like yellow
pages, sale information, advertisements of local interest etc.

This extension would really make the information on the web
more friendlier and 'locale' and would increase the popularity
and accessibility.


Thanks,

- Sanjath
