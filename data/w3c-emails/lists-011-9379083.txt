Language preferences are a part of http and html, and html
markup has been defined to address some internationalization
issues.

Multilingual sites like you describe are not universal, but
they are possible with some clients and servers available today.

Geographic location, so far as I know, hasn't been a widely
considered factor in the more general issue of content negotiation.

I suppose it might help implement an Internet pizza server ;)

There are privacy issues around both location and language.
