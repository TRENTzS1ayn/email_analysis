I would like to strongly encourage EVERYONE engaged in HTTP/1.1
implementations to participate in the interoperability tests.

I would like to develop a checklist of 'HTTP features' implemented
and TESTED FOR INTEROPERABILITY so that we can document the 
interoperable implementations of HTTP/1.1 features.

Digest authentication, pipelining, status codes, etc.

If, in the course of development, you created some 'test harnesses'
for testing our products, could you perhaps point them at other
people's servers?

Larry
