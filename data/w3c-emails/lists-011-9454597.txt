I'm hoping we can resolve this soon, by widening the discussion
from "Roy vs. Jeff" to a larger group. It would be very useful
for HTTP/1.1 implementors to be explicit about their plans and
expectations. Is there some "conservative in what you send
and liberal in what you accept (or expect)" possible compromise
here?
