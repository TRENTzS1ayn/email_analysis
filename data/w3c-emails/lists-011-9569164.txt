You mean the client IP address? I was only thinking on having
the server IP name recorded together with the cookie, 
and then the client could make a reverse DNS lookup to locate
the cookie. Hmm, maybe it does not work for proxies...
Then you could do something relevant to the DNS part of the url
that has been issued...
