Friday 10 October is coming up soon; is there a comprehensive
requirements summary I have missed?  I remember seeing a proposal, but
it was geared towards getting feedback on the format.  There was not
much discussion, and nothing since.

Does this mean that nothing has happened or that some work is happening
privately and just has not seen the light of day yet?
