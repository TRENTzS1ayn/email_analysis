Why just TWO classes?  Within this expanded idea of a "transport" protocol
(which I accept) I would suggest that "transport" protocols can be
identified at several levels within an extended protocol stack.

As new "applications" are constructed and become widely deployed, I would
hope to see layered architectures within those applications which separate
issues of control, data transport, information representation, user
interface, etc.  Hence these new applications would define protocols which
themselves can be used as a basis for future developments.

I think what you describe is just a step in a continuing evolutionary
process of building new applications upon the infrastructure of previous
applications.
