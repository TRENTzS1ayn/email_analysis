Of course;  I wasn't trying to overturn anything, just draw attention to a
possible consequence of the current approach.

In private discussions, it has been suggested to me that language issues
are a poor basis upon which to develop a "quality" rating system -- there
is just too much subjectivity involved.

It was a *premise* of my posting (one with which you may well disagree)
that the quality factors were used to simply rank alternatives.  It had
been suggested to me in offline discussion that other document selection
systems which attempted to perform arithmetic manipulation of quality
factors gained limited benefit from such manipulations (unfortunately, I
don't remember details of the example system offered).

You make a good point here -- thank you for pointing it out.
