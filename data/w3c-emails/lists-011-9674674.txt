I don't agree with this premise, but we have discussed this before.  I
do want to comment on the reasoning below however:

Your reasoning assumes that the sender has to send out the source
quality value of a variant as soon as the variant itself is sent.  If
you wait sending source quality values until all variants have been
sent, the problem does not exist anymore.  And I see no logical reason
why you could not wait: the recipient can't do anything until the last
source quality value is received anyway.
