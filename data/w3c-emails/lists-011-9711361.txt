To quote one of the Appl. Area Directors:  "The point of serializing
these efforts is to focus the working group's discussion."  In other
words, you can nail down the wire protocol without getting side-tracked
by arguments about privacy stuff, and vice versa.  So you could do one
first, then the other, but neither would progress to RFC until both
sets of issues had been settled.
