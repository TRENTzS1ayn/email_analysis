I'm not sure I see the point of splitting the document if the wire
protocol document can't progress w/o the privacy portion. Furthermore,
I believe portions of the wire protocol are meaningless w/o the privacy
portion.

And, given that there were privacy concerns to begin with which motivated
the privacy related restrictions, I think we would need concensus
from everyone who feels strongly about the privacy restrictions that
the wire protocol can go forward w/o the privacy specifications.
Otherwise, there is no point in splitting the document because it doesn't
address the composite issues which motivated the specification in the
first place.
