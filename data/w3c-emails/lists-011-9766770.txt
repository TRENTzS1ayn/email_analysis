Dave -- I think this is an excellent idea.  Policy makers, users, and
advocates alike have been concerned with the privacy implications of
cookies.  The lack of a clear discussion that those outside the technical
community can follow has produced confusion, some misinformation, in
addition to legitimate concern.  I don't know if what you have in mind
would fill this role, but I do believe a clear discussion  of the privacy
implications is important.  Thanks.
