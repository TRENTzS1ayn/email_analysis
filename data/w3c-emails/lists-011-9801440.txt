I understand the concerns regarding unsigned cookies but at the same
time I do not believe we can create restrictions that are not arbitrary.
For example, the two hierarchy level restriction. As such I believe the
best we can do is state "You want security? Use a signature."

How many systems do you know that go out of there to specify security in
situations where the user intentionally chooses not to use any security?
