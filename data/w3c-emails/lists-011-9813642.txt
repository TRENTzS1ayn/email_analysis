I agree that the two-dot rule you refer to is a compromise that neither
fully protects privacy nor consistently ascertains the need to do so.  It
was the best solution we found, and the other privacy restrictions in the
RFC were intended to make up for this compromise.  I do not agree that the
privacy restrictions are arbitrary, though I would be foolish but to agree
that they are controversial.

Security is not the same thing as privacy.

There are plenty of systems that protect privacy even if the user does not
explicitly request privacy protection.  That is my understanding of the
intent of the privacy restrictions in the cookie rfc.
