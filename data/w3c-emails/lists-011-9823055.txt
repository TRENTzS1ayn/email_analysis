To members of the HTTP-WG@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com mailing list:

Please do not post additional messages on the subject of
'cookies' UNTIL THERE ARE NEW DRAFTS.

When there are new drafts, we will discuss them one at a time.
I reserve judgement as to the order.

Larry (attempting to moderate WG mailing list traffic).
