The combination of the wire protocol and privacy concerns regarding cookies
led to quite a divergence
from the technical landscaping of the draft in working group discussions.
That is why splitting the two
issues out seams most reasonable. At least this way it will be crystal
clear what is at issue in a discussion:
the semantics of the protocol or the political/privacy/security/whatever
ramifications of cookies.

All the wire protocol portion would need to address in order to accommodate
its other half is a
mechanism (if necessary) for allowing whatever is decided (if anything) in
the privacy draft to take shape.

If nothing more than a tool to facilitate concise discussion about the two
directions of the current draft,
it should be split.
