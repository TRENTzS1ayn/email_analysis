I'm unsure what you mean by "led to quite a divergence from the technical
landscaping of the draft..."  Were the privacy provisions all present in
Netscape's original proposal?  No, but some were.  And if you're implying
that the privacy concerns were never discussed adequately on the list,
that's simply not so.
