Privacy - I get scared whenever a public organization tries to decide
what appropriate "privacy" is. That is a consumer decision, not an IETF
one. The IETF's job is to provide secure interoperable protocols, not to
decide for users what the appropriate level of privacy is. Consumers
make choices, they choose to use one product over another. It is in that
choice that they choose how to protect their privacy. That choice
includes choosing products which default to accepting all cookies.

2109 - The problems with the current spec have nothing to do with
complexity. They have to do with an attempt to patch a fundamentally
broken protocol. Building a cookie mechanism on signed cookies provides
a protocol which delivers security without interfering in the UI and
feature decisions of software makers.
