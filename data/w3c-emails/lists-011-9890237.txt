A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

Title: Simple Hit-Metering and Usage-Limiting for HTTP
Author(s): J. Mogul, P. Leach
Filename: draft-ietf-http-hit-metering-04.txt
Pages: 35
Date: 15-Oct-97

        This document proposes a simple extension to HTTP, using a
        new ``Meter'' header, which permits a limited form of
        demographic information (colloquially called
        ``hit-counts'') to be reported by caches to origin servers,
        in a more efficient manner than the ``cache-busting''
        techniques currently used.  It also permits an origin
        server to control the number of times a cache uses a cached
        response, and outlines a technique that origin servers can
        use to capture referral information without
        ``cache-busting.''

Send a message to:mailserv@ds.internic.net.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-hit-metering-04.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
