This came up in a private exchange a few months ago, but it isn't
resolved in url-syntax-08.

According to RFC 1034, Sect. 3.1, the string "foo." is an "absolute
domain name." (Note the trailing '.'.)  url-syntax-08 provides no valid
way to use "foo." as a hostname in a URL, as in
http://foo./bar

The problem is that grammar non-terminal "toplabel" can not end in
'.' as it's currently specified.  I think it should allow the final '.'.
