A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol Working Group of the IETF.

Title: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-
level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia
information systems. It is a generic, stateless, object-
oriented protocol which can be used for many tasks, such as
name servers and distributed object management systems,
through extension of its request methods. A feature of HTTP
is the typing and negotiation of data representation,
allowing systems to be built independently of the data being
transferred.

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.

Send a message to:mailserv@ds.internic.net.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
