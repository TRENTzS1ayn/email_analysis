Title: HTTP Traffic over Satellite
Author(s): R. Pohlmann
Filename: draft-pohlmann-http-traffic-satellite-00.txt
Pages: 3
Date: 14-Oct-97

Internet use over satellites (LEO, MEO and GEO) has not
received enough attention.  Satellites have an inherent
broadcasting ability useful for transmitting Internet
traffic.  They can send information to many locations
simultaneously depending on the coverage beam of the
satellite.  The issue of Internet use over satellites needs
to be addressed so that future implementations of networking
protocols can be used with this medium.  The vast majority
of Internet traffic is TCP traffic resulting from the HTTP
protocol so this issue will be addressed here.  It is hoped
that this facilitates the transition from the use of
terrestial networks, to networks incorporating satellite
links.
