Having run one of the clients in this test I'd like to second this
request. Ideally, if the folks who provide servers could even give a
rough idea beforehand of what's on their server, that would help me (and
I presume other clients) in preparing some tests. For example it would
be useful to know what request methods can be tested and on which URLs
(this includes the URLs for various forms).

Also, since I've noticed that a number of problems turn up in conjuction
with dynamic content (cgi scripts, SSI, etc). I would therefore like to
see more of this. Specifically, cgi's which produce a Content-length
header, cgi's which don't, cgi's which return 3xx responses, cgi's with
varying cache-control headers, etc would be useful. I know this means
extra work for all those putting up servers, but those of us with
clients have some work trying to put together, run and debug tests
against the servers (I'm not complaining, just pointing out).


  Cheers,

  Ronald
