  I believe that the problem is somewhat more general than
reauthentication.  There are times when the web application developer
would like to force the client to discard credentials whether or not they
should then be reaquired.  The simplest example is the often-asked
question: "How do I get the browser to discard the credentials when the
user presses my 'logout' form submit button?".

  We've been going back and forth on the http-ext list about whether this
is the same requirement or not...
