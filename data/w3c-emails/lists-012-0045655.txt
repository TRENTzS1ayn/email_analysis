A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.


Title           : Don't Go Postal - An argument against
  improperly overloading the HTTP POST Method
Author(s): J. Cohen et al.
Filename: draft-cohen-http-ext-postal-00.txt
Pages: 
Date: 16-Feb-98

As time goes on, more and more groups are extending HTTP's functionality. In
using HTTP, a decision is made to either use a new method name for new
functionality or to overload an existing one such as POST.  Our belief is
that in most cases, overloading existing method names, with POST as a
particularly troublesome example, is a bad idea.  We, as a group of
individuals, suggest that the default requirement for new HTTP functionality
must be to create a new method name.

Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address.  After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
"get draft-cohen-http-ext-postal-00.txt".
A URL for the Internet-Draft is:
ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cohen-http-ext-postal-00.txt

Internet-Drafts directories are located at:

Africa:ftp.is.co.za

Europe: ftp.nordu.net
ftp.nis.garr.it

Pacific Rim: munnari.oz.au

US East Coast: ds.internic.net

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.

Send a message to:mailserv@ds.internic.net.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-cohen-http-ext-postal-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
