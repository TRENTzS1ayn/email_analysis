Hi,

 We're looking to implement something along the lines of the
"reauthentication"
or server provoked client retry that I've been going on about on the
http-ext
list.

We intend to publish it as an experimental track document.

I spoke with some of the editors this morning, and have read through 
 draft-schulzrinne-http-status-00.txt

Being that there isnt an active IANA registry yet, and we need 
a response code number, we'd like to pick one and move forward.

According to schulzrinne, x00-x49 are HTTP managed for http stuff.
Since this is a potential http extension, I think it can fit into 
that definition.

What I propose is that
 we will use 449 as a response code. 
 So, in the absence of a IANA registry, I would like to announce our use
 of 449.
