I've started the physical production of the draft (rev-02) at this point.

Rev-02 represents a milestone, with all issues resolved, and lots of 
editorial cleanup work.  It does do some reorganization of sections, so 
many section numbers will change for the first time since RFC 2068.  It 
is concievable that this draft could be the draft standard, so it will 
be the draft to read carefully, when I've issued it.

If people can hold off new issues until after I issue the draft
in a day or so (and escape for a bit of vacation), it may help me
(and you) to keep things straight.
- Jim
