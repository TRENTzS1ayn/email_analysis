Perhaps related, Ronald Tschalaer was testing our proxy implementation
for us last week ;-), and discovered that we will (if configured to),
add a From header-field to outbound requests.
(the From header we add is administrator configured, intended to be
analogous to mailto:webmaster@host.org)

Ronald had a concern that this could words around "From" say client,
and that this could somehow cause trouble (not the least of which would
be two From header-fields in our implementation.

It had not occurred to me before, but I think this could mess up
Digest.

Comments?
If no-one else volunteers, I can write up some text to clarify this.
