I've found some more problems.

13.3.3 Weak and Strong Validators

    A cache or origin server receiving a cache-conditional request, other
    than a full-body GET request, MUST use the strong comparison function to
    evaluate the condition.

The term "cache-conditional request" is nowhere defined.

14.25 If-Match

    A server MUST use the strong comparison function (see section 3.11) to
    compare the entity tags in If-Match.

Actually the "strong comparison function" is described in 13.3.3.
