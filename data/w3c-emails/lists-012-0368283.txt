    13.3.3 Weak and Strong Validators

A cache or origin server receiving a cache-conditional request,
other than a full-body GET request, MUST use the strong
comparison function to evaluate the condition.

    The term "cache-conditional request" is nowhere defined.
    
Probably the phrase should simply be "conditional request" (it
appears several other places in the draft).  The term "conditional
request" is informally defined in 13.3.
