Neither "has to do" anything.  The introduction introduces a bunch of
terms that are necessary for common communication about the HTTP
environment and its participants.  There are many things that can
be abstracted together to form the "user agent", just as there are
many things that can be abstracted together to form an origin server.
I included "gateway" specifically because people kept confusing
such things with a proxy.

I have a ton of ideas on how to rewrite the introduction to make the
abstractions a little more clear, and another ton of ideas on how to
reorganize the entire specification to make it readable, but have neither
the time nor the patience to restart the standards process.

BTW, the chain of communication is the only form described because
all other forms can be reduced to a chain for the purpose of discussing
the HTTP semantics.
