Hello,
We have a cgi program that streams documents across the web using HTTP 1.0. 
 When we stream an HTTP Document to Internet Explorer 3.02 that has a 
content type of application/msword or application/vnd.ms-excel the plugins 
for Word and Excel both try to load the URL a second time after it has been 
streamed to the browser.  In essence the document is sent twice.

Does anyone know of a solution or reason for this behavior?  We have one 
machine that this does NOT happen on, so there seems that there may be a 
way to configure IE or Word to not call the URL twice.

Thanks in advance.

Mark
