I am looking for a Web browser that pipelines multiple requests over
a persistent connection. The browsers that I have checked (Netscape
Navigator and Communicator, and W3C Amaya) do not pipeline requests
even when using a persistent connection (at least that's what appears
to be the case based on a tcpdump trace).

I would appreciate any relevant information/pointers.

Thanks.
