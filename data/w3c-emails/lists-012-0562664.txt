I just watched it do two GETs on one connection:

Requests:

Host: localhost
Connection: Keep-Alive

GET /Admin/lgmast.gif HTTP/1.1

Referer: http://localhost/
Accept-Language: en-us

There were three GETs altogether, and one went by itself on a second connection.
I haven't seen MSIE put more than two requests on a connection.

IE 4.x does not pipeline requests.
