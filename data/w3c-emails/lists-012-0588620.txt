I really can't tell with the crude trace tool I'm using.

Pipelining != persistant connection ... are you saying that the
second get was sent before the first response was completed? Or that
one connection was used for two gets in sequence with the second GET
on the connection issued after the first response was received?

I can't speak to pipelining, but I recently had to watch IE's use
of connections 'externally' (I watched current connection stats, not
a wire trace) and performance wise it looked like IE was using
connections > 2 times based on knowing the total number of objects
retrieved vs. current connections and netstat and perfmon stats.
