I find decision tables are a useful way to analyse such problems.

(My reference is over 25 years old: "Programs from Decision Tables", E.
Humbey, Macdonald/American Elsevier computer monographs, ISBN
0-444-19569-6/0-356-04126-3.  It's probably not still in print.  It does
contain a number of references to decision table articles published in the
1960s in Commications of the ACM:  August 1967, September 1970, January
1966, November 1966, October 1968, January 1965, February 1964, June 1970,
November 1965, June 1965, February 1971.  All of these pre-date even my
library of "Communications".  Strangely, I'm not aware of any more recent
references.)
