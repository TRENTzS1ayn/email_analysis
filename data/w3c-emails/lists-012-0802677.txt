It doesn't say anywhere in the definition of PUT that the entity-headers, in
addition to the entity-body, should be associated with the request URI.

I proposed to add the following paragraph near the end of section 9.6

Unless otherwise specified for a particular entity-header, the
entity-headers in the PUT request SHOULD be applied to the resource created
or modified by the PUT.
