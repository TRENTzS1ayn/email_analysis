It is my sense from list postings that a TRACE or OPTIONS request which
referenced a specific resource which a server handed to an external
application such as a CGI program should be handed to that program 
for handling.

That is:
   OPTIONS /cgi-bin/somescript HTTP/1.1
or
   TRACE /cgi-bin/somescript HTTP/1.1
should be handled by the application which would respond to a GET or HEAD
of the same resource.

Is that a fair summary of the WG's expectations in this case? A long scan
of my memory and a check of the archives and latest draft didn't pop up
anything. But I was sure I'd seen something on the list in the last few
weeks to this effect.
