Right, this ought to be a SHOULD.

Interestingly enough, this "bug" basically goes back to RFC1945,
where it says:

      c) If the resource has not been modified since a valid
         If-Modified-Since date, the server shall return a 304 (not
         modified) response.

RFC2119 says that "SHALL" and "MUST" mean the same thing, although
I'm not sure that was the intention in RFC1945.
