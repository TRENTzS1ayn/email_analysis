At http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Issues/.  As usual, it is
available there in plain-text, postscript and Microsoft Word with and
without change bars, either uncompressed or gzip'ed.

As of when I submitted this draft, there were no outstanding issues
with the specification I knew of, either technical or editorial.  This
is the second draft for which this is true.

We expect the next draft of the Access Authentication specification by
tomorrow (Friday).

It is likely this draft will be the Last-Call draft for draft standard 
of HTTP/1.1, though experience reminds me that it is possible there will 
be one final draft to react to any comments and/or deletions required 
by interoperability reports (to satisfy IETF procedural requirements), or 
to resolve dependencies between the HTTP specification, the access 
authentication and URI specifications.  

Working group members should have already read Rev-02.  If you haven't,
you have been negligent.

I also expect everyone who drafted text to resolve issues for the
specification to check that I correctly edited those changes into this
draft, and to let me know of any problems.

At some (unpredictable) time in the next two weeks or so, I will become
unavailable for a week or so. Nothing like completely unpredictable deadlines
to cause one to lose sleep (whew! dodged that bullet).
                        Your HTTP/1.1 Editor,
                                Jim Gettys
