Apparently a decision, the discussion about I missed, was made to
remove the syntactical description of URIs from the HTTP specification.

Probably a good move, but that leaves the draft dependant on what is
currently recorded as a private reference. See ref [42] in draft 03.

I assume this is an internet draft and not just a private document.
What is the name/status of the latest draft?
