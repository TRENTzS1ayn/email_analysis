To: HTTP Working Group<http-wg@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com>

We have reached the point in the HTTP Working Group where we can make the last
"LAST CALL" on working group documents:

<draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-03.txt>, March 13, 1998, Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1
<draft-ietf-http-authentication-01.txt>, March 13, 1998, HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication
<draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-08.txt>, February 16, 1998, HTTP State Management Mechanism

In order to actually move these forward as DRAFT STANDARD, we have to document at least
two interoperable implementations of each feature. We are working on completing that task
in the next few weeks.

Your careful review of the documents and the status of implementations of these protocols
 is requested.

The working group LAST CALL on these documents will end on Friday, March 27, 1998; barring
any major issues arising, we will then forward them to the IESG for consideration.

Other documents that were considered in this working group are either being considered
for publication as Experimental Protocols, or have been taken up by other working groups
(primarily HTTPEXT and CONNEG). Once we have completed these, we will be done.

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

Larry
