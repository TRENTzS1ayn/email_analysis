Both are 1.x header fields.  If the recipient understands cache-control
and max-age, then it will ignore Expires.  Otherwise, it will ignore the
cache-control.  Therefore, it is best to send both.

There is nothing wrong with sending an HTTP/1.1 response to an HTTP/1.0
client.  There are some features of HTTP/1.1 that cannot be used with
an HTTP/1.0 client, but that's different (and aren't related to caching).
