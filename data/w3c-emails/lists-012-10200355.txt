Is there anyone know how to use "Content-Range:" and "Range:" in the HTTP 
version 1.1 ? Because i already write like this In Visual Basic 6. and it 
didn't work :

strcommand = "GET /index.html" + " HTTP/1.1" + vbCrLf
strcommand = strcommand + "Host: www.stts.ac.id" 
strcommand = strcommand + "Accept: */*" + vbCrLf
strcommand = strcommand + "Accept: text/html" + vbCrLf
strcommand = strcommand + "Content-Range: bytes 0-50/*" + vbCrLf
strcommand = strcommand + vbCrLf

When i invoke this program into a webserver that support HTTP 1.1, it
still download all the content of the webpage ( not just the first 50
bytes ). So, i need help from all of you that can help me solve my problem
!!
