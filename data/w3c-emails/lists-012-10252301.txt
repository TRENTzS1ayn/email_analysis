Hi all,

Looking at the definition of Chunked tranfer coding
in draft-ietf-http-v11-rev-06.txt (section 3.6.1), one
reads:

"The chunk-size field is a string of hex digits indicating the size
of the chunk."

Shouldn't this read "the size of the chunk-data"?  The chunk
itself is defined as

       chunk          = chunk-size [ chunk-extension ] CRLF
                        chunk-data CRLF

However, looking at how Web servers (Apache, IIS) implement chunked
transfer coding, it realy looks like chunk-size represents the size
of the chunk-data itself...

Am I missing something?

Thanks for any clarification,
