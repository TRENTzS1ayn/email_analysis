Smartcards are not a requirement for PKI. I have installed many PKIs
and very few use smartcards.

Actually management of password systems in a large enterprise is far
from easy.

Management of passwords in a small system is no simpler than
locally issued certificates.

Either way, I don't think that the HTTP working group should spend
any more time trying to make passwords work when applications such
as SSH have demonstrated that public key based systems are more
feasible and easier to manage.
