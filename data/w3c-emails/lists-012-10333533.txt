Promise I'll take this thread off-line after this note unless anyone
else is at all interested.

Yes, but in many situations involving "public"/shared PC's there doesn't
seem to be much of an alternative. Walking around with diskettes containing
client certificates won't fly at a lot of places even if they are password
protected. Not only are the diskettes easily copied, but they'll often
sit on networked PC's that have virtually no real security built into
them (or at the very least configured). Now the protection of the client
certs depends on passwords that are probably easily guessed in many instances.

Yes, but in either case it's already considered a "solved" problem
or at least one that's relatively under control. Password systems
are the devil one already knows and the devil one is stuck with anyway
while supporting legacy systems. While I'm sure a lot of forward
looking companies are using PKI there are a lot more that aren't.
I notice the W3C members only archives are password protected (and
not even over SSL it seems ?).

Mine is not to say what the working group should be working on
and once again profound apologies if I've wasted anyone's time on
this. I just wanted to point out that since HTTP *does* support
password authentication there *seemed* to be a bit of a hole in
its support of password change/expiration. I was hoping (and am
still hoping) someone would point out how that hole is not there.
I also still believe that people will be using centrally stored
passwords at least 10 years from now (Y2K programmers now know that
10 years is not such a long time, after all).

Assuming I'm not missing anything, my recommendation to our
customers would be PKI (though, they'll laugh at me: we have a hospital
customer with 10,000 more or less public PC's with twice the number
of users), use some change password HTML page technology with all
its incumbent problems or use a hacked version of the publicly
available Netscape Communicator that supports the sort of headers
I had suggested in my first note. I suspect most will go with the
second alternative as being the least attractive but requiring the
least work and/or money. Less work almost always seems to trump
most other considerations.

Thanks again for your comments.
