While I'm sure this thread is off-topic for http-wg,
I agree with Alex that passwords are here to stay,
and I agree with Phillip that PKI is too.

The big question is:  How will passwords be used?

I sincerely doubt that the dominant form will be
PINs for smart cards, and I know we can do better
than simple local key files encrypted with a 
password/phrase.
