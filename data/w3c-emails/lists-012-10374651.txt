That's the question I would have asked myself until recently.
Doesn't help (well, just a slight delay) - see Shamir and van
Someren's paper "Playing hide and seek with stored keys", delivered
to this year's Financial Cryptography conference: "We describe efficient
algebraic attacks which can locate secret RSA keys in long bit strings,
and more general statistical attacks which can find arbitrary cryptographic
keys embedded in large programs. These techniques can be used to apply
lunchtime attacks on signature keys used by financial institutes, or to
defeat authenticode mechanisms in software packages." Shamir is the S in
RSA.
Useful tips on how to recover cryptographic keys from Windows NT can be
found at Peter Gutmann's pages:

If I trust the certificate alone, then I am mistakenly trusting a
program, not an individual ... then I have delegated authentication
to that program.

I don't have a perfect answer. I would at least add passwords. And not
use NT.

Unfortunately, there is no plateau with security, and no soundbyte
solution.
