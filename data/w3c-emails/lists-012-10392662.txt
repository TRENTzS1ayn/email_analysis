Since this usually gets swapped out at some point, the swap file
would seem a much easier point of attack. How easy this is depends
on implementations. Windows would appear to be easy. Systems with
protected memory space such as AS/400 or various specialized trusted
systems would appear to be immune - but Shamir was exploring the
possibility of "lunchtime attacks" on client systems, which is
virtually synonymous with Windows.
