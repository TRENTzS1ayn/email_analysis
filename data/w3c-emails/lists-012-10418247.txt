Great!  Is the current MIME type still "multipart/x-mixed-replace" (i.e., is it
still considered experimental?)?  Is multipart/replace widely implemented?

You can do this now by sending a single response with a multipart/replace
body.  All it costs is keeping a connection open.  The more general need is
for notifications that do not require an open connection, but that is a
different story.
