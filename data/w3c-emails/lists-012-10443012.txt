Last week, I gave a talk at the 1999 USENIX Conference
on "What's wrong with HTTP, and why it doesn't matter."

Larry Masinter suggested that "many members of the HTTP
working group would enjoy seeing your talk slides."  Or
perhaps many members of the HTTP working group will
flame me for them.

At any rate, sooner or later these will be online
at www.usenix.org; meanwhile, you can find them at
     ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/WRL/mogul/usenix1999it_mogul.ps
     ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/WRL/mogul/usenix1999it_mogul.pdf
depending on what format you prefer.

There are a few slides at the end of the file, on caching,
that I brought in case they were needed to fill some time --
they weren't.

Please:
   (1) do not send me email if you have trouble retrieving,
   printing, or displaying these files.  I'll ignore such email.
   
   (2) do not expect me to respond to critiques of these slides,
   or questions about what I really meant, or what I said
   that isn't on the slides.
   
   (3) remember that these slides reflect my personal opinions,
   and not necessarily anyone else's.

-Jeff
