Surendra Reddy and I prepared some Internet-Drafts on a possible Event
Notification Protocol, but I think the effort got mired down in trying to
come up with the support for a general workflow protocol.  I'm still
interested in a fairly lightweight ENP (TCP/IP-only, request-response only
(not store-and-forward also)), as it would help optimize a project we have
here at work.  I don't know when I'll have time to get back to it -- maybe
in the 2nd half of this year.
