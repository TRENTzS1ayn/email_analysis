The IESG has received a request from the IETF Steering Group Working
Group to consider Applicability Statement for HTTP State Management
<draft-iesg-http-cookies-00.txt> as a BCP.

The IESG will also consider HTTP State Management Mechanism
<draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-10.txt> as a Proposed Standard.

The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks, and solicits
final comments on this action.  Please send any comments to the
iesg@ietf.org or ietf@ietf.org mailing lists by July 23, 1999.
