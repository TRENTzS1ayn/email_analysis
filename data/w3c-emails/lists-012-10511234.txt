It really isn't a new mechanism in the sense that this kind of change from
one protocol to another was exactly what the Upgrade header was included in
HTTP to accomplish; it's just that the specifics of how to use it were not
spelled out in the spec.

The CONNECT mechanism is really trying to do something different.  It
creates a tunnel through an existing proxy, but doesn't signal the protocol
to be used end-to-end on that connection.

Part of the goal here is to show how secured and unsecured traffic in any
protocol can share a TCP well known port, so that we can get away from
assigning two ports to each protocol.
