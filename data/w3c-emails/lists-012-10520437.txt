Title: A Taxonomy of Feedback for Multicast

When distributing information through multicast, it is often
neccessary to solicit feedback from receivers. This feedback can be
to report on reception quality, indicate loss of packets, or
acknowledge receipt of data. There is a range of feedback mechanisms
possible, ranging from polling to periodic multicast feedback. This
document presents a taxonomy of these various mechanisms, with a
discussion of the pros and cons of each approach and a discussion of
applicability.

In the body type:

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
