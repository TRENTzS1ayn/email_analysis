Hello,

I've taken a look at the BNF in the HTTP 1.1 / v03 document, and there 
no internal inconsistencies left. But I would suggest to state explicitely
in the text, that the following BNF-identifier refererences to other
documents, like you have done it in the URI-Section:
  challenge
  credentials

This is not i big issue, since one can guess that from the text, but for
the sake of consistency I suggest the following changes:

1)
Add this (for instance) to section 11 (Access Authentication")
    This specification adopts the definitions of "challenge" and 
    "credentials" from that specification.

2) Typographic change
Replace in 14.22 (From)
    The address SHOULD be machine-usable, as defined by mailbox in RFC 822
    [9] (as updated by RFC 1123 [8]):
by
    The address SHOULD be machine-usable, as defined by "mailbox" in RFC 822
    [9] (as updated by RFC 1123 [8]):
or even
    The address SHOULD be machine-usable, as defined by "mailbox" in RFC 822
    [9] (as updated by RFC 1123 [8]). This specification adopts the 
    definition of "mailbox" from that specification.
