No: the problem is that establishing a connection to a separate port
allows for man-in-the-middle attacks at connection establishment times;
you are just making attacks easier using different port numbers.

The new IESG/IANA policy is therefore to no longer allocate independent 
port numbers for secure connections.  This is the stronger motivation
than conserving port numbers.
