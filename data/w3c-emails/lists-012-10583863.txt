There is nothing about the proposal that prevents that; I may run my secure
server at http://www.example.com/ and the secure one at
http://www.example.com:2000/ or the other way around.  My server may use the
IP address or a Host header value, or a part of the URL path to determine
that the request needs to be upgraded to a secure connection.

In any event, separate ports are orthogonal to separate processes; one does
not imply or require the other.
