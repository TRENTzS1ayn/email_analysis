Gentlemen:

As a web measurement analyst, one of my worst problems is dealing with
caching.  Why do we use the code 200 for everything?  Why not design the
spec in a graduated fashion:

If browser has url in its local cache, it still sends a get request to the
server, but an option says "I already have it, just letting you log the
request". The success code is a 209, "user has non-expired data in cache".

If a non local cache has the data, same system.  The option can be
different, and we can even use a different code (210), but for the most
part, we should just let the 209 mean "cached request".

This solves many problems:
1) path analysis of a user's visit
2) advertising requests (not perfectly, given the IAB's recent standards,
but better than nothing for smaller sites)
3) pages per visit calculations are accurate
4) this is a minor increase in bandwidth compared to not sending the
request at all, and is far superior to eliminating caching.

Thanks for your time,

Michael
