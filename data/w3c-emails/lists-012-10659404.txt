Despite the Subject line, Yaron's comments apply to the above I-D,
not to the Applicability Statement.

I would like to redirect any follow-up discussion to
http-state@lists.research.bell-labs.com, where we have been conducting
the discussions about cookies.  Also, please forgive me, but I am on
vacation for a couple more weeks, and my brain is shut down.  I will
try to address the issues Yaron raises when I return.

Please note that the draft in question is dated July 24, 1998 [sic!].
