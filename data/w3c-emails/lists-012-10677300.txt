At the time these documents were forwarded, it was my belief that
there was rough consensus for 2109 and, subsequently, state-man-mec.
The objections were to the mandatory default behavior necessary to
achieve the desired protections of the security considerations
section.

I believe it is still in the best interest of the Internet to publish
these documents, and that (unless there have been significant reversals
of previously strongly-held opinion) they still represent the
"rough consensus" of the community.

As for the specific comments:

This is covered in the last paragraph of section 2.2.1.

yes, that's the context. What's the problem?

You object to the word "marginal", but its usage in this context
is consistent with the intent and your statements. And the list
of advantages need not be listed exhaustively.

Well, its hard to equate the lack of a single flaw into "flawless",
but perhaps a "primarily", as in "it is not primarily a flaw in the
protocol itself" would satisfy your concern.
