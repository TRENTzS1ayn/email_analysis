Koen, a careful reading of RFC 2026 notes that "consensus" is not
interpreted as "without disagreement", and that it outlines the
nature of the types of disagreements that might hold within a working
group. Although the specified default for cookie privacy was
in dispute in the working group, it was my judgement that the objections
were neither that

> (a) his or her own views have not been adequately considered
>   by the Working Group,

since the views on the default privacy behavior were considered
at length, and

> (b) the Working Group has made an incorrect technical choice
>   which places the quality and/or integrity of the Working Group's 
>   product(s) in significant jeopardy. 

since the disagreement was not about quality or integrity, but
rather about privacy policy and commercial viability, in an
advertising-dominated Internet, of the specified default behavior. 

Anyone who is not satisfied with the resolution of this dispute
can follow the dispute reoslution procedures outlined in RFC 2026,
but I maintain that, as far as the IETF process is concerned, the
working group reached "consensus" (albeit rough) on the entire
document.
