Hi,

I just want to know that will mobile IP (in which situation hosts can
attach to different networks without changing their ip addresses) bring
some problems to HTTP proxy, since it may or may not save bandwidth if a
host keeps on using the same proxy after it is connected to a new
network Also since the ip address of the host is not changed how can it
find out the proper proxy it should use just through application layer
protocol.
