Hello!

I?m new to the list. I joined it because I?ve a urgent question. I start a
cgi-script from a frame which is part of a frameset. Is there any
possibility to redirect the output of this script to the _top-frame? I found
a solution which uses JavaScript, but I don?t want to force my Users to turn
JavaScript on.
I think a clean solution would be to include a line like

Target-Frame: _top

in the HTTP-response header of my cgi-script, but I couldn?t find such a
command in the HTTP-RFC?s.

Thanks in advance for any helpful comment on this!

Greetings, Stefan Borggraefe!
