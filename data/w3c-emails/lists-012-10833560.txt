Yes, exacly, there have always been objections to the default behavior of
the third party cookie filter, that was my main point.  The level of
consensus on the rest of the specification has been considerably higher.

It is my understanding that a lack of consensus on the security
considerations (in this case a lack of consensus on how much privacy is
needed by default) implies a lack of consensus on the whole specification.

Note: these are my specific nitpicks of iesg-http-cookies.  My main
objection to publishing the current draft as a BCP lies somewhere else,
see my original message.

The first SHOULD NOT in that section is fairly definite, and I am mainly
objecting to that one.  The second SHOULD NOT weakens it, and one can
indeed argue that the last paragraphs gives even more wiggle room, even if
it does not contain any uppercase keywords.  A bit of rebalancing of
SHOULDs will probably resolve my problem.

The section implies that Content-Location can be used to maintain state on
its own in some way, outside the context of redirects.  In fact, I just
recall that HTTP redirection uses 'location', not 'content-location', so
really content-location has little to do with any currently feasible
method of maintaining state.

I am suggesting a way to improve the presentation.  "marginal" does not
sound right to me, even if you believe it to be consistent with what 
I want.

I said that I believe it _is_ a flaw in the protocol, your proposed
restatement would not work to satisfy my concern, which is about weakening
the level of what is acceptable in an ietf standards track protocol.
