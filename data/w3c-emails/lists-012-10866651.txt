I agree ... 'non-cacheable' is supposed to preclude any possibility that
the data would be found in a cache and in particular a disk cache where
it might be examined. 'non-cacheable' is supposed to mean that it would
never be valid for a caching proxy to return in response to a request.
No second guessing, ever.
