Will someone from Netscape who knows/is responsible for and
knowledgeable about technical details of Netscape-Enterprise server (3.5.x +)
get in touch with me soon?

Email to "Mike Belshe" (mbelshe@netscape.com), who had submitted 
public report as part of HTTP/1.1 Feature List Report Summary 
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Forum/Reports/#Public
bounced.

This is regarding a security problem that we have discovered with this server.

cheers,
