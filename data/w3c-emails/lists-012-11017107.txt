I think the experience from the current use of User-Agent shows that people
in practice tends to overload simple tokens with as much information as
possible. Although it is slightly different from the Upgrade header field
tokens, the exchange of metadata about the communication should be light
weight and not necessarily cost an extra RTT. Solving this using first
class objects is much to be preferred - hence the push for HTTP extension
framework.

Duh - I was looking at draft 07 where it wasn't mentioned. I am glad it is
now.

I agree - it was the point in the draft about transition from proxy to
tunnel that I was objecting against.
