Some of the editorial notes got left in the text version.  That's what
all the

notes mean.

Also, this gem comes from Tony Finch:

It looks like some characters are missing in section 4.4 paragraph 4:

   4.If the message uses the media type "multipart/byteranges", and the
     ransfer-length is not otherwise specified, then this self-
     elimiting media type defines the transfer-length. This media type
     UST NOT be used unless the sender knows that the recipient can arse
     it; the presence in a request of a Range header with ultiple byte-
     range specifiers from a 1.1 client implies that the lient can parse
     multipart/byteranges responses.

I particularly like "...MUST NOT be used unless the recipient can arse
it".

Tony.
