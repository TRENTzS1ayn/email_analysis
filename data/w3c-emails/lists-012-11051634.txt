Yes.  Oops.  draft-bos-http-redirect-00.txt seems to assume a fragment
is allowed in redirects.  The HTTP syntax should be

   Location       = "Location" ":" absoluteURI [ "#" fragment ]

The CGI syntax also allows relative references, since those are interpreted
internally by the server (unlike HTTP).
