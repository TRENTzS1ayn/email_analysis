Well, let's see. 

- I don't think it's appropriate to have a fragment
  with a 201 Created response, e.g., to a POST.

- I don't know what it would mean to return a fragment with a 300
Multiple Choices, since the choice decision is intended to be made
on resource characteristics and not fragment characteristics (?).

- I think we're mainly concerned with 301/302/303/307, but I don't think
it makes sense to POST to a URI with a fragment.

- I don't think it's appropriate to return a fragment with
 305 Use Proxy.

In addition, we should specify the behavior in the case where
there was a fragment with the original URI, e.g.,
  http://host1.com/resource1#fragment1
where /resource1 redirects to
  http://host2.com/resource2#fragment2
is 'fragment1' discarded? Do you find fragment2 and then
find fragment1 within it? We don't have fragment combination rules.
