Attached is that message from Dan Connolly that mysteriously failed to
reach the list.


attached mail follows:
Henrik and anybody who's interested...

I'm doing some writing about the HTTP 1.1, and I was frustrated
that I can't make hypertext links to specific sections, and
in general, it's sort of a pain to navigate. So I scratched
the itch with a little perl script.

I just updated
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/
$Id: Overview.html,v 1.169 1999/07/31 16:24:46 connolly Exp $

to point to a hypertext version of the HTTP 1.1 draft standard:

Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1
derived from RFC2616 by way of 
rfc2html.pl $Revision: 1.5 $ $Date: 1999/07/31 16:45:29 $ by
Dan Connolly
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html


The generated HTML is split into sections:
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec1.html
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec2.html
...

About the perl script:

==============
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2html.pl

#!/usr/bin/perl
# $Id: rfc2html.pl,v 1.6 1999/07/31 17:03:21 connolly Exp $
#
# Usage:
#  perl rfc2html.pl rfc2616.txt >rfc2616.html
#   also creates rfc2616-secN.html for each section N
#
# Features
#  splits by section
#  marks up paragraphs and definition lists
#  marks up section headings with anchors
#  marks up TOC with hypertext links
#  marks up indendet sections as <pre>
#  creates well-formed XML output
#
#
# TODO
#  update XML namespace declaration per XHTML spec
#  add link types (e.g. rel='bibref')
#  markup ul, ol in body text as such rather than as <pre>
#  markup references section with links to other RFCs and docs
#  generalize &convert() params: title, short title, basename,
bibsection
#     for other RFCs
