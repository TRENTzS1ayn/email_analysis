If it is that a CGI script can set the location header field with a value
containing a fragment then yes.

Btw, I have seen several servers sending relative Location header field
values. This does make sense but does it break any existing applications we
know of?

Regarding allowing fragments, I believe the same is the case for
Content-Location:

       Content-Location = "Content-Location" ":"
                         ( absoluteURI | relativeURI )

should be

       Content-Location = "Content-Location" ":"
                         ( absoluteURI | relativeURI ) [ "#" fragment ]

I don't like introducing a lot of "sanity rules" for when they are allowed
and when not. I think that proxy redirection (305 Use Proxy) is the only one
that shouldn't be allowed.
