The fragment (or view) is a function of the media type of the representation
chosen and hence does not have to be defined the same way across the set of
representations available for content negotiation of any particular
resource. For example, a fragment in HTML pointing to page 3 does not have
to be defined the same way for PS.

It is therefore functionally correct that Content-Location can contain a
fragment. The problem is of course that HTTP servers currently do not see
the fragment under normal circumstances because clients do not send it but
this is the same as for the Location header field. In fact, I consider this
a bug in HTTP :)
