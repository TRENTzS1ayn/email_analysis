A fragment is a fragment of a media type.  Content-Location refers to
the resource, not the representation of the resource as a media type.
A resource is not a media type, and therefore a fragment is not appropriate
for this field.

This is different from Location because Location is redirecting the
user agent to a different view, not identifying the resource included
in the message.
