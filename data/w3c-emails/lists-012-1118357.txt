I've had an (unsubmitted) I-D for "proxy cookies" in my back pocket for
several weeks.  Once the dust settles for regular cookies, I would like
to submit it.  (That's why I delayed -- to avoid intertwined discussions
on htt-state.)  ietf-http-ext seems like it might be a good home for
proxy cookies as a work item.  Comments?
