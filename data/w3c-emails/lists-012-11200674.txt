This is a meaningless distinction.  Consider this thought experiment:  we have
two HTTP servers, A and B.

Server A can and does parse the chunked encoding.  But it sends a 411 "Length
Required" response with a "Connection: close" header in response to any
request that does not include a "Content-Length" header.  This is a compliant
server.

Server B understands no transfer-coding except "identity".  It cannot receive
or decode the "chunked" transfer-coding.  It sends a 411 "Length Required"
response with a "Connection: close" header in response to any request that
does not include a "Content-Length" header.   This is a non-compliant server.

If we look at these servers as black boxes, observing their behavior only
through their external interfaces, they are virtually indistinguishable
(unless we look at the product tokens or something).  So it's meanless to say
that all HTTP/1.1 applications that receive entities must understand (be able
to receive and decode) the ?chunked? transfer-coding.
