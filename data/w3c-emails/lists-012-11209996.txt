But the behavior, as seen from the client, is the same in either case!

No, the 411 specifically says "The server refuses to accept the request without
a defined Content-Length. The client MAY repeat the request if it adds a valid
Content-Length header field containing the length of the message-body in the
request message."  The 411 means that the client must provide a Content-Length
header, not just the length information embedded in the chunked transfer-coding.
Of course, if the client does provide a Content-Length header, then it must use
the "identity" transfer-coding.
