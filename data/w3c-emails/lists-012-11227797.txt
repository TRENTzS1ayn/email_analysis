If the purpose of the text was to delineate one lame example from another,
then I'd agree with you.  The reason it is there is to prevent an HTTP/1.1
application from mistakenly thinking the chunked encoding is *no* encoding
and saving the chunk-sizes as part of the data.  As far as the protocol
is concerned, recognizing Transfer-Encoding chunked, and responding with
411 and connection close, is equivalent to parsing the chunked encoding.

Nobody is going to prevent you from building a server that responds with
411 to every request without implementing chunked.  It would be a dumb
thing to do, but the standard doesn't prevent people from doing dumb things
(only things that won't interoperate with others via HTTP).
