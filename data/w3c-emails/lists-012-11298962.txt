We might make replying '411 and connection close' to a chunked encoding
'conditionally compliant' rather than 'compliant' because otherwise,
as has been pointed out, there are inteorperability problems.

This isn't an errata, but it belongs on the issues list.

On the other hand, a server can legally also reply '200 OK' to every POST,
and just ignore the data. A server can legally reply '404 Not Found' to
every GET, too! So the fact that there are some stubborn implementors
doesn't mean we should change the standard.

There is still a 'call' for an HTTP implementation guide; it isn't in the
charter of the HTTP working group, but this kind of advice might belong
there.
