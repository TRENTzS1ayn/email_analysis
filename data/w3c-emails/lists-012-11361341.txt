I don't want to implement a new protocol service using CGI.  But I'm worried
about things like proxies refusing to forward chunked requests.

I haven't kept up with the Jakarta thing, but it will be interesting to see if
the Apache Java servlet implementation supports chunked POST.

No.  It is what mod_cgi requires.  Apache implements chunked in the core,
where any module can make use of it if they so desire.

As I've said many times before, implementing a new protocol service
using CGI is a bad idea.  Making HTTP requirements based on the limitations
of CGI is even worse.
