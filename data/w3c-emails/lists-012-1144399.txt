To: HTTP Working Group<http-wg@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com>

In addition to a series of private requests to the listed implementers of HTTP/1.1,
I would like to request that any others with partial or full HTTP/1.1 implementations
take the time to fill out the form
        http://www.agranat.com:1998/

as pointed to by

       http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Forum/Reports/

Filling out the form may help with the review of the specification, as well.

We're in working group LAST CALL; soon after the close (Friday, March 27), a final
draft will be prepared (reflecting comments received) for sending on to the IESG.

Thanks,

Larry
