To:<http-wg@hplb.hpl.hp.com>

As you may be aware, I have submitted an Internet-Draft,
draft-nottingham-http-roles-00.txt.

I'd very much appreciate comments from the http-wg, as I see it as primarily
in that domain (with some overlap to wrec and the cgi efforts).

I've already gotten a few comments, and I should make some clarifications.

* The draft is an applicability statement, not a protocol specification.
* My goal is to clarify responsibility for protocol implementation between
servers, publishers, and facilities like CGI, PHP, NSAPI, ISAPI, Cold
Fusion, etc.
* Some of the measures it calls for will place some additional load on the
server; this is an intentional decision. I believe that server vendors have
sacrificed protocol compliance for benchmark speed, which in the long run
doesn't do anyone any good.

This is probably a hard pill to swallow for server vendors; I understand
that some of the things it calls for will be difficult to implement. I'd
like to use the draft process as an opportunity to work them out.

The draft is available at:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-nottingham-http-roles-00.txt
Please have a look at the references as well, as they help motivate the
document.

Any comments or help would be greatly appreciated. I'm particularly
interested in help with defining WebDAV PROPPATCH extensions that will allow
manipulation of HTTP-related metadata (such as Cache-Control and Expires
headers, and content negotiation hints).

Cheers,
