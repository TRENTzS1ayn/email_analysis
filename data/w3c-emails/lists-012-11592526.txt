Well, I just want to caution against optimizing for a pathological case
at the expense (e.g., reduced responsiveness) of normal cases.

Anyway, it's not that important anyway, since we're only talking about
the default behavior.  Mark's draft provides that:
   There MUST be a method by which content generators can specify that
   content is not to be buffered; this MAY be performed by a pseudo-
   HTTP header that is consumed by the server.
So, if I don't want my responses buffered I can turn off buffering (in
theory).
