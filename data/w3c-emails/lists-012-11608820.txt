First message to the list..

I bumped into HTTP POST version issues about a month ago, and am looking
for a definative reference to some data that defines the standard HTTP POST
formats for  HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1

I managed to figured out by brute force that the HTTP version was required
on the POST /url line in order to get the server to support multple
headers.  But upgrading the version from 1.0 to 1.1 caused the servers
(Apache and NES) to abort with "invalid protocol" messages.

Web searches, RFC reads, and consultation with Netscape and it's affiliates
has not produced an answer.

Any help would be greatly appreciated...

Wilbur
