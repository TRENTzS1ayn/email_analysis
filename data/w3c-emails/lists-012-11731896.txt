So how do you build technology? At eCal, we get people to do it.  :-)

Seriously, though.  Engineering is more than coming up with the best
technology; it's also coming up with something that can be built by real people
with real, human failings.  Protocols that are too complex for the people who
need to implement them will lose out to simpler protocols, if only because the
implementations of the complex protocols will be buggy and late.
