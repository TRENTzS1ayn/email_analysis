Agreed, but the problem here is that _my_ decision on
what the Right Thing to do isn't necessarily going to
be the same as everyone else's ... who knows, I might
even get it wrong ;-) Maybe it's not a big deal, but 
this does seem to open up a hole for interoperability 
problems to sneak through.

Granted this is probably moot (interoperability problems
of this sort pale into insignificance when measured
against all the broken UAs and servers out there), but
it'd be nice if there was an annex to RFC2616 which 
taped it down.

Indeed ... apparently fixed now.

Cheers,
