Actually, RFC 2616 should have said simply

    Characters other than those in the "reserved" set (see RFC 2396 [42])
    are equivalent to their ""%" HEX HEX" encoding.

The reason being that excluded characters will not appear in a valid URI,
and thus it doesn't matter if encoded excluded characters might
mistakenly be compared equal to their non-encoded character.

Thanks for the report,

....Roy
