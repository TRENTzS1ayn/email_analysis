Hi all,

I 'ave been writing a proxy server,this is working fine for both GET
& POST method,I need to add functionality for HTTPS ,which is been used in
hotmail mail.
The browser request contains CONNECT method,is it a http
method,becoz i 'ave not seen the method in RFC.Is it a https request?
Any ptrs to resources for https will be helpful.

TIA,

Mani.
