Hi all,

my name is Matteo Pampolini, I'm an italian communications researcher
engineer and I'm involved in Internet applications and services development.

Currently I'm working on a method for tracing broken links inside an HTML
page: is there anyone working on the same topic? I searched the W3C site
but I found nothing about it.

I have a quite simple proposal on how to perform such a task, should I write
a detailed document and submit it to this list?

Sorry for this last question but I'm new to this mailing list, so I would like
to know exactly how to behave.

Thanks a lot,
