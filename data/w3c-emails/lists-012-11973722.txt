Are there plans for http-wg to meet at the next IETF? If so, I'd like to request that discussion about draft-nottingham-http-roles-00.txt be considered (I plan 
to have 01 available before the draft deadline). I'm of the opinion that it's most appropriate here, but I'm open to discussing alternate forums.

Thanks,
