The HTTP working group is expected to close as soon as the last of the
existing drafts are moved to RFC.

While there is value in documenting some implementation concerns for HTTP,
your draft is not appropriate for the IETF standards track.  The reason is
because IETF standards specify the protocol, not the means by which servers
are implemented to conform to that protocol.  Phrasing a bunch of
implementation concerns as if they were protocol requirements is not
appropriate, however well intentioned and useful the document may be.
