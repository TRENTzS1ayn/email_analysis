OK. I was thinking that it may have qualified as an Applicability Statement, as in section 3.2 of RFC 2026. Looking back, I see how that's probably taking 
too much license with what's there, at least for http-wg.

In any case, I'm happy if people just start thinking and discussing this stuff, irregardless of the status of the doc. If there is another more appropriate 
place that this sort of thing could live, please tell me.

Thanks,
