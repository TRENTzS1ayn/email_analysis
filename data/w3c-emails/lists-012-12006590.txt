Well, it probably deserves a clarification. What I vaguely recall
is that we were trying to leave room for non-HTTP based proxying,
e.g., where you asked your proxy

       GET news:comp.infosystems.www HTTP/1.1
       Host:

Clearly not the interpretation you read into it. Does anyone else
recall what we really meant?
