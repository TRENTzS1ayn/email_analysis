I would like to propose:

1) If a client is issuing a 1.1 request and the client has obtained
positive knowledge, possibly through an out of band mechanism, that all
proxies and the origin server in the request path are 1.1 compliant or 
better, that it may omit the host header when absolute URIs are used.

2) Clients are permitted to use absoluteURIs when talking to 1.1 servers.

Does this seem reasonable ?
