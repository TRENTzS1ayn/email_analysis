The problem is that, even if you find out that foo.example.com is a 1.1
server, you can't be certain that that will remain true.  There's the usual
problem of people upgrading their software, of course, but there's also the
issue of load balancing.  If not all the machines that handle requests to
foo.example.com are running 1.1 servers, then any assumption about whether
the one you're talking to is 1.1 or not will break eventually.  Similarly,
there might be a heterogeneous proxy farm somewhere along the path.
