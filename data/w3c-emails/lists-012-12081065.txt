Roy,

I didn't intend to 'make over' the advice to look like protocol requirements, but I freely admit that they can be interpreted that way; I 
chose to do it that way because it seemed the most natural and clear way to do so. My logic was that the requirements set forth 
in it were only in the scope of the document, so that a product could be referred to as compliant with it, over and above protocol 
compliance. This will hopefully be more clear in a future draft of the document (if there is indeed any point in further revision).

I apologize if it's not politic to submit this to the IETF, but it seemed the best place to start (as I don't have the cash to join the 
W3C). I am (or at least I was during the writing of this draft) very much an outsider. If someone has a suggestion about where 
this document would best reside (whether that place is in the http-wg or not, as there does seem to be some dissention), I'll be 
more than happy to talk about it (as I've stated before).
