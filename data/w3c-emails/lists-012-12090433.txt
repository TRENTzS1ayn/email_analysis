Sorry, that wasn't intended as a criticism of you -- just the current
format of your draft.  If it were actually a protocol spec, I'd be
congratulating you on following the proper form and making it easier on
the reader.  What I am worried about is misinterpreting implementation
guidance as protocol requirements.

I think it is a worthwhile document, provided that it emphasizes rationale
and not requirements.  For example, there is very good rationale for having
the server constrain the i/o interface to conform to the protocol, and there
are many examples you might use to explain the rationale, but the protocol
requirements do not change as a result.  However, phrasing that rationale
as "a server MUST do ..." is stating a protocol requirement even if the
scope of the document excludes protocol requirements.

I'm not a W3C member, so I wouldn't encourage that path either.  What I
meant is that W3C does theoretically include implementation conformance 
among its members as part of its spec writing scope.

Larry is the one who decides what is or is not appropriate for this forum,
and it seems that he wants to discuss the document here regardless of its
eventual publication status.  I agree with his reasons, though again I would
prefer that the format be changed so that it won't be misinterpreted.
