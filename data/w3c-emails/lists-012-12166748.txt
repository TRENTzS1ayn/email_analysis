Hi,

RFC 2616 defines a http proxy and a tunnel. But I'am confused on how a http 
tunnel works.

A proxy works by taking a request from a client and connecting to the origin 
server indicated in the request.  Here the client is configured to go 
through the proxy.

How does a http tunnel work. Is the initial connection similar ?
Does a client (browser) need to configured differently when it goes through 
a tunnel or is it same as the configuration required when it goes through 
the proxy ? Are there to separate tcp connections for each request even in a 
tunnel ?

Thanks in Advance,

Regards,

Vinit Kumar
