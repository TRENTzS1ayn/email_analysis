Actually, the client may or may not know about the proxy.

The difference is in the behavior of the intermediate system (proxy or
tunnel).  A tunnel just forwards the request and the response
unmodified.  A proxy at least adds its own identification to a Via
header, and may also respond from a cache, require proxy authentication,
or any number of other proxy-specific functions.
