The client always knows about the proxy -- that is what distinguishes
a proxy from a gateway.  A "reverse proxy" is a gateway.

Some tunnels are activated by a proxy request, some are simply
port forwarding TCP firewalls (either on the client side or the
server side, or both), and others are gateways to other servers.
The important thing from HTTP's perspective is that once an
intermediary becomes a tunnel, it is no longer conscious of the
HTTP communication -- only of bytes being relayed from one connection
to another.
