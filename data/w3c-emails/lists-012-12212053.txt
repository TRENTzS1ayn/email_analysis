CONNECT really just asks a proxy to create the origin server connection
and then switch to tunnel mode for the pair of connections
(client-proxy, proxy-origin).  What the client does over it is up to the
client.  Usage of CONNECT is not limited to https; for https you must
begin with the handshake.
