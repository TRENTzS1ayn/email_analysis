For tunnels that are activated by a proxy request, A browser has to be 
configured to go through the proxy.So a request from a browser to a HTTP 
Proxy or a HTTP tunnel(activated by a request) is one and the same. What I 
mean is that, even if the intermediary is a HTTP tunnel, the client always 
talks to the tunnel thru one part of the connection and a tunnel will 
forward that on another connection to the ORIGIN SERVER. Even the origin 
servers response will come to the intermediate tunnel which get forwarded to 
the client on the other connection.

These requests or the responses MAY contain some hop-by-hop header 
information such as Keep-Alive, Connection Header (close), Max-Forwards 
etc..  While a proxy can take care of them ,what will a should a HTTP tunnel 
do? A http tunnel would'nt even look at the response or at the request(apart 
from looking at the URL to see where the forwarding connection should be 
established).

How does a HTTP tunnel take care of persistant connections and request 
pipelining?
