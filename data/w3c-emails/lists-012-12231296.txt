This looks like an opportunity to expand my understanding
on https proxies as well. When a client issues a CONNECT
request to a proxy, the proxy creates a connection to
the remote site, and the proxy returns an HTTP 200 
response to the client. From that point, the client
and remote site exchange data through the proxy. My 
question is what is that data? Does the client have to
issue a full SSL handshake over the connection, or can
the client just send data. In other words, what happens
after the CONNECT from a client's perspective.

Doug
