Yes.  In doing it this way, the client would be accepting the fact that
a slow response from one origin server would delay any others pipelined
behind it, but other than that there is no reason not to do it that way.

Similarly, an origin server might receive multiple requests on the same
connection from a proxy that were from different User Agents.
