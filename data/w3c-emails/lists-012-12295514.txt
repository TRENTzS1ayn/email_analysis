Hey,
  
 Since we're talking about proxies....
Im curious to know what others think the right thing
according to the intent of the 1.1 spec to do is
in this situation:

If you have two chained proxy servers:

client -> proxy1 -> proxy2 -> origin server

If proxy 2 challenges for proxy-authentication (in its realm),
should the challenge go back to the client if proxy1 doesnt intend
to satisfy the challenge ?

My understanding was that the intent was that this situation was
to be covered.  By this I mean a client can auth to a proxy up the chain.
The spec is somewhat ambiguous, it says the proxy-auth headers are 
hop-by-hop, but then mentions that chained proxy-auth can work.
