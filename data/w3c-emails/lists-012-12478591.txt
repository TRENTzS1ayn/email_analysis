I'd just define a new 3xx code and use that.

No, you are confusing the requirements.  A cache that doesn't understand 206
won't cache it because of the MUST NOT on unrecognized codes.  A cache
that does understand 206 will look at the cache-control field.

These are forward-looking requirements: we don't know what the semantics
of the new code may be, and this is the only way to specify proper handling
of future sementics in the presence of intermediary caches.

I think the WAP folks are confused in any case -- it would be foolish to
mark a client-specific redirection response as cacheable by anything
less than a fully-compliant 1.1 proxy with Vary, which itself is so rare
that they should just assume that their new code will be understood by
any cache that might gain from caching it.
