If one client is led to believe that they have received a representation
of the requested resource, while another client is led to believe that
they have received instructions on how to navigate to such a representation,
then the navdoc is not safe for a shared cache.  If, however, the target
of the request is supposed to be navigation instructions, then the
response should be 200 (and thus be cacheable by default).
