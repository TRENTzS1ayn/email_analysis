Two questions regarding draft-ietf-http-authentication-01:

1)  Section 3.2.2, request-digest description:

If the "qop" value is "auth":

   request-digest  = <"> < KD ( H(A1),     unq(nonce-value)
       ":" nc-value
       ":" unq(cnonce-value)
       ":" unq(qop-value)
       ":" H(A2)
       ) <">

    Shouldn't that be

If the "qop" value is "auth" or "auth-int":

    ? Otherwise the calculation of request-digest isn't defined for
    qop auth-int.


2)  Section 3.2.2, "MD5-sess" description:

This creates a 'session key' for the authentication of subsequent
requests and responses which is different for each session, thus
limiting the amount of material hashed with any one key. ...

    How long does a session last? I.e. when should this session key be
    discarded? When the server sends a new nonce or new algorithm?



  Cheers,

  Ronald
