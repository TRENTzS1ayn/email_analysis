To:"IETF HTTP List"<http-wg@hplb.hpl.hp.com>


The secretariat didn't forward this announcement to this list, so I
will.

The only change from version -04 is the addition of the standard
boilerplate and references  regarding the keywords (MUST, SHOULD,
MAY, etc).

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.
This draft is a work item of the Transport Layer Security Working
Group of the IETF.

Title: Upgrading to TLS Within HTTP/1.1
Author(s): R. Khare, S. Lawrence
Filename: draft-ietf-tls-http-upgrade-05.txt
Pages: 13
Date: 05-Jan-00

This memo explains how to use the Upgrade mechanism in HTTP/1.1 to
initiate Transport Layer Security (TLS) over an existing TCP
connection. This allows unsecured and secured HTTP traffic to share
the same well known port (in this case, http: at 80 rather than
https: at 443). It also enables 'virtual hosting,' so a single HTTP
+ TLS server can disambiguate traffic intended for several hostnames
at a single IP address.
Since HTTP/1.1[1] defines Upgrade as a hop-by-hop mechanism, this
memo also documents the HTTP CONNECT method for establishing
end-to-end tunnels across HTTP proxies. Finally, this memo
establishes new IANA registries for public HTTP status codes, as
well as public or private Upgrade product tokens.

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the
username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
"get draft-ietf-tls-http-upgrade-05.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-http-upgrade-05.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail
readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.
