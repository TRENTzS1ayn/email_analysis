Hello all,

To get straight to the point.  I think the stated is the reason Pragma exists. 
 It is a perfectly apropos usage and addresses the problems discussed on 
BugTraq directly and efficiently.  However, this does not completely address 
the issues in implementation of the clients and their treatment of these 
WebMail systems nor the treatment of proxies concerning those systems.  Perhaps 
a poll of those providers would glean some information concerning the current 
treatment or their client expectations as to the treatment of the 'un-trusted' 
content types.  In any event, this seems to be at least a relevant and 
appropriate use of Pragma as stipulated in RFC 2616.
