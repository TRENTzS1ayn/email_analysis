Because that means parsing and modification of the HTML.  Doesn't scale to
any future content type ... I for one prefer security features out of band
to the channel or in this case processing layer of the client.

But I'm not sure this is a complete solution as proposed in any case. At
what point does not having scripting enabled prevent reasonable rendering
of the content?  Should plugins be enabled? What about content within
frames (or iframe) within the file which reference other servers? Meta
refresh tags which redirect to new content?
