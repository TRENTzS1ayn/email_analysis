I was/am opposed to having two independent specifications present in the 
same document; it leads to questions about which is correct. I felt it 
was better to clarify the text to remove the ambiguity.

I would not oppose publishing the pseudo-code as an informational RFC
document, with a disclaimer that the base specification rules.
