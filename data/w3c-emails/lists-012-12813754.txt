Larry,

I think you are coming real close here.  We are definitely looking at an issue 
of 'levels of trust' that must be understood by client implementations and 
end-users.  I suppose another MIME type would address the issue and allow some 
freeform for a time as to how to handle unsafe content.  For me you have made 
it no longer as perplexing a conundrum as before:

1.  A change in the way WebMail systems are implemented (which could include 
protocol changes) or;
2.  A change in the functionality of browsers at some level (read HTML 
parsing).

and,

I think the intent of the HTTP/1.1 support was for backward compatibility, only 
yes?  The 1.0 header request Pragma was a way of addressing "no-cache".

Here is where the 'levels of trust' (that's the bug-a-boo) would be important 
(to me).  It would be good not to limit the description here to merely 
"unsafe", per se I think I see your point clearly.

I don't know about that; if its not safe to a later 'aware' recipient is 
probable and good, but older clients would not be able to discriminate.  That 
could set up an interesting situation where browsers are updated or 
trust-levels are upgraded; Excellent though.
