Maybe Im misreading your words, but I think you missed
part of larry's point.  By using a new MIME type,
older browsers would implicitly discriminate.
Today, a browser that gets an unknown mime time, which this
new one would be, it will prompt the user to save it to disk
instead of showing it.

This would effectively prevent it from being displayed
or executed without user consent.
