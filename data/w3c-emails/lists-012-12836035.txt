Yes, that is true, my concern was/is with just that point.  After the item is 
saved many users attempt to open that 'troublesome' downloaded page.  The only 
thing I am saying is the content after saving to disk can still contain 
'malicious' scripting code and the browser could not then successfully 
discriminate unless the file name was some how also unlinked from the types 
'compatible' with the browser (read viewer) and parsed without scripting.

I say yes, Josh, you are correct that part was not clear.  Thanks.

Yes, user consent is a primary factor here (always), as well as _expected 
behavior_.  One should consider what a user would do concerning unknown types 
that are nominally displayed in their client, it could get confusing to say the 
least. A user may just map an association back to the browser at worst 
(education of the user is also a key issue) perhaps as you mentioned this is 
not an effective track (http-wg), but I am still not sure.
