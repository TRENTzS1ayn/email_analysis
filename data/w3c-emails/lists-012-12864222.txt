> So, does anyone have any info on browser support for pipelining?

According to "Persistent Connection Behavior of Popular Browsers" 
[1]:

  "Both Navigator and Explorer support persistent connections 
   to Web servers and proxies. However, neither supports request
   pipelining on a persistent connection."

I found that by rummaging around in the Web Characterization 
Activity area of the W3C web site [2].
