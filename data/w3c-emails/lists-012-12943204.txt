That's a reasonable notion.  However, in practice it might be a bit
complicated (i.e.; server side includes in GETs of html documents
might
cause changes in  "state" variables.).

It seems that the tradeoff is between speed and
being-nice-to-less-then-careful-clients.
For now, I'll stick with sequential resolution, and then 
consider how to detect circumstances where 
sequentiality can be loosened.
