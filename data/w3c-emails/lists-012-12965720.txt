Not at all. I don't see anything there, or anywhere else, which
states that GETs idempotence is optional.

All it says is that GET "SHOULD NOT have any significance other 
than retreival". That's a *very* long way from permitting side-
effects. It allows but discourages, for example, a server
making a rude noise when it handles a GET ... but that's not 
state.

Cheers,


Miles
