There are no TCP/IP level or connection level policies implied as far
as I know.  The implied policy is to get the page again, and get a
copy fresh from the origin server, without any intermediate cached
copy being used instead.  This implies that a new HTTP request has to be
sent, but not necessarily that an existing persistent connection has
to be broken.

Hope this helps,

Koen.
