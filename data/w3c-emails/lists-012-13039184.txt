Hi,

I would like to know how to get the length of the entity body for an
HTTP packet. I know that there is a header field called "content-lenght"
but that this one is not enough to get to know the actual length for any
possible case. Can anybody explain me what actions should be done in
order to derive the length of the entity body from the HTTP header
fields and for any possible situation?

Thanks a lot!

Jordi
