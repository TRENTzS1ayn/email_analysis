See the definition of what a resource is:

   resource
      A network data object or service that can be identified by a URI,
      as defined in section 3.2. Resources may be available in multiple
      representations (e.g. multiple languages, data formats, size,
      resolutions) or vary in other ways.

It means it will accept them for that resource, and only that resource.
The server may also accept range requests for other resources, but that is
not implied by the accept-ranges header.
