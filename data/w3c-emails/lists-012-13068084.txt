Thanks !

I have gone through that part of the RFC and now a question arises to me.
Suppose the following case:

A- Our message includes a message-body, which means that condition 1 in
section 4.4 is false, and
B- There is no Transfer-Encoding, which means that condition 2 in 4.4 is
false, and
C- There is no Content-Length field, which means that condition 3 in 4.4 is
false (note that this is possible since from section 14.13 we have that
applications SHOULD (only SHOULD) use this field to indicate the
transfer-length when it is not prohibited by rules in section 4.4) and
D- The content-type is not "multipart/byteranges", which means that
condition 4 in 4.4 is false, and
E- The server is not closing the connection, which means that condition 5
is false.

I think that according to the RFC the previous situation may happen and, if
so (somebody may help me here), we cannot determine the transfer length
since 4.4 does not specify this case. I think that the key point is in the
SHOULD condition of section 14.13. If instead we use a MUST in this
section, then we can break condition C.
I would appreciate any comments, thanks!!!
