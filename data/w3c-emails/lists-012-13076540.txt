Your point A is where the problem lies.

If you don't send a Content-Length, and you don't send a
'Transfer-Encoding: chunked', and your Content-Type is not some kind
of 'multipart', then your message does not include a message-body;
it ends at the CRLF following the last header.  If you are a client,
then anything you send following that will be interpreted as the
beginning of a new request; if you are a server then I have no idea
what clients might do.

SHOULD does not mean 'you can ignore this rule' - it means that you
don't have to do it to be compliant, but you aught to unless there
is an excellent reason.
