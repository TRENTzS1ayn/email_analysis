A while back (I think it was late 1998), one of the Authors posted an
address (http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Garage/3246/http11rq.txt)
for a draft of a HTTP/1.1 Requirements Summary.

What has become of this document, both in terms of where it is, and status?
It would be most useful...

Cheers,
