Hi,

I am doing some analysis on the performance of an HTTP server for my research. Does anybody has or know where to get some information concerning real traffic statistics? More specifically, I would like to know what's the traffic percentage of each HTTP method (GET, PUT, HEAD,...) in a real world network. Any other statistics regarding HTTP traffic (such as number of bytes or packets per method-request ...) would also be of great help.

Thanks in advance!

Jordi
