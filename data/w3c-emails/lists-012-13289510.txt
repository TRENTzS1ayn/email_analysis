Ah... my problem was, that the request then gets to the origin server as: 

FOOBAR /random/uri HTTP/1.1
Host: origin.server.com
Authorization: Digest blah blah 
      digest-uri="http://origin.server.com/random/uri" blah blah

And I read 3.2.2.5 to mean "digest-uri and Request-URI must match
octet-by-octet", where here they don't. Reading it again doesn't give the
same impression, though... the above request should not give a 400
response?

My mistake, sorry.
