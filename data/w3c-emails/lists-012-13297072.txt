Folks,

As some of you know, we have been pushing addition of a delta encoding
mechanism for http/1.1. The early paper on this was in SIGCOMM'97
      
Potential benefits of delta encoding and data compression for HTTP 
    http://www.research.att.com/~bala/papers/sigcomm97.ps.gz
    
3 ID's have been written and recently revised:

    Delta encoding in HTTP:
    http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mogul-http-delta-03.txt
    
    Instance Digests in HTTP:
    http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mogul-http-digest-02.txt
    
    The VCDIFF Generic Differencing and Compression Data Format    
    http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-korn-vcdiff-01.txt
    
This message constitutes the last call before we ask the IESG to consider
this as a Proposed Standard. If you have any concerns/questions, please send 
me email.
    
cheers,
bala
