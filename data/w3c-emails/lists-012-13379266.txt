I just started checking out IE browser 5.0 for the Mac. Whereas in 4.5
there was a switch to get it to use Http 1.1 in proxy requests, no such
switch remains in the current version. 

I'm wondering if the microsoft browsers are going backwards on http 1,1
conformance, just as they lost digest authentication from IE 3 in later
releases.

Can anybody shed some light precisely what the status of IE's conformance
to HTTP 1.1 is?

Can anybody explain why 100s of MS hackers are unable after years to
achieve 100% conformance?

Does this reflect the lack of competition for MS in the browser arena?
An explicit management strategy?

Perhaps this suggests a remedy as well: IE A, B, and C
and suggest a remedy?
