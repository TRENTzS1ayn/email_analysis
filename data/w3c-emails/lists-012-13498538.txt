That's not what I meant.  Is this just a question about what to put
in the field value, or is there some functionality/semantics desired
behind the server interpreting this value (which we have discussed
in the past as being a bad thing).

The syntax for host is defined by reference to RFC 2396, which in
turn is updated by the IPv6-within-URI specification (RFC 2732),
so the answer for HTTP syntax has already been defined.
