Wouldn't that become a contradiction with the extension scheme?
In other words, that requirement along with your example of

      Cache-Control: no-store, community="UCI", max-age=30

would require that the recipient ignore max-age even if it did
understand the community extension.  I think that is why we decided
to use relative constraints rather than absolute constraints in the
language above.
