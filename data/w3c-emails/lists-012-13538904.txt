But the existing text already handles that situation as a
condition on the meaning of max-age, and the extension rules
already allow new extensions to modify the interpretation of
other cache-directives.

It seems to me that adding a further MUST requirement will just
raise the issue of which section has precedence, particularly since
implementing the extension mechanism itself is not a MUST requirement.
That is what I meant by a contradiction.

I think we both agree on what is desirable from the implementation,
but I think the existing text is less confusing than the proposed change.
Is there another alternative?
