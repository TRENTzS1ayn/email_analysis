If they are that concerned about it, then they should not fill out
forms that were not delivered securely.  If the form was delivered
over an unsecured connection, it may have been modified in any
number of ways to subvert the apparent intent of the form.  Browsers
don't normally expose the ACTION attribute of a form - an attacker
may have changed that, or modified field names - the possibilities
are endless.  Encrypting one exchange in a multiple exchange
transaction is no security at all.

The concern is with the well-known ports - a much much smaller
space.
