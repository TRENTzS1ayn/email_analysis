OK, assume the form was delivered on a secure server. Then it gets
submitted to somebody else - a virtual host on a payment processing
server - to actually process the transaction. This is very common. The
action URL will use regular http .
How does the security upgrade get triggered ?

One more thing to consider :
Let's say you are browsing a site and the connection got upgraded to TLS
. Then you sit idle for a while, and your keep-alive connection times
out. You are on a different part of the site now, filled with normal
http:// links. You click on one. The client has to reconnect. How does
the security get restored ?
