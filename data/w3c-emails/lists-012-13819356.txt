That's one problem.

Another, which affects both chunked transfer encoding and the
multipart technique, is that a proxy is at liberty to set quite
a short idle-timeout (say 30 secs to a couple of minutes) to 
protect itself from hung origin servers and double-sided DOS 
attacks (malicious client on one side, malicious server on the
other).

Cheers,
