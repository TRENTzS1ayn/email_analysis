Hi,

I am currently working on a project on persistent connection and
non-persistent connection.
I found that
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Forum/Reports/#Public
Gagan Saksena mentions a test on Netscape 5
I cannot find Netscape 5 on their website

In addidtion, I will appreciate any related information about persistent
connection and non-persistent connection

Thx
Jacinle Young
