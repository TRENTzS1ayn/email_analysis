Servers that don't support it ignore it, because RFC-2616 doesn't provide an error code to
mean "I don't understand that Upgrade:".  (I just tried it on Apache 1.3.9 and 1.3.12, NES
3.6, and IIS 5.0; they all behaved exactly the same with and without "Upgrade: foo".) This
means that a client that sends the Upgrade: all the time won't break anything; it will cost
a few extra bytes, but not the extra round trips you're talking about.
