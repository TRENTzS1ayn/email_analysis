hi,

HOL blocking means Head Of Line blocking
What i mean is
consider
Alice send out a request for a large latest hit MP3 file and then a request
for a small text file
which both resides on the same server.
so the response for MP3 file will block the second response and the response
that follow in the persistent connection case.
