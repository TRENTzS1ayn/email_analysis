The W3C is finishing up their Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P)
specification:

    http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-P3P-20000424/

This specification appears to cover things that should be of interest to both
the HTTP and WREC working groups. Accordingly, I would like to ask that
interested parties review the current specification. Comments can either be
sent to the appropriate WG mailing lists or to the Application Area Directors
(myself, ned.freed@innosoft.com, and paf@swip.net).

Thanks!

Ned
