Looking for a http-proxy that would run on Linux, accepts local http
requests and tunnels those as https through an ssl connection to web
servers.
Remember that this set-up was popular a few years ago when strong
encryption was not available for the browsers outside the US.
Looking for an open source version that runs on Linux.

Any pointers/suggestions are appreciated.
Thanks, Frank.
