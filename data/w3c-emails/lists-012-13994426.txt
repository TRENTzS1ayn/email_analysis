See RFC 2616 ( http://www.innosoft.com/rfc/rfc2616.html#sec-4.1 )

Quoting:

----
Request (section 5) and Response (section 6) messages use the
generic message format of RFC 822 [9] for transferring entities (the
payload of the message). Both types of message consist of a
start-line, zero or more header fields (also known as "headers"), an
empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) indicating
the end of the header fields, and possibly a message-body.


        generic-message = start-line
                          *(message-header CRLF)
                          CRLF
                          [ message-body ]
----
The CRLF that separates the headers from the body is not part of
either.  Since it is not part of the body, it is not included in the
content length.
