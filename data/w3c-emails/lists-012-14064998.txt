Combining multiple header fields works just fine, with one exception: the
Set-Cookie header field. Some browsers don't handle multiple cookies in a
Set-Cookie header field (i.e. they require a separate header field for each
cookie to be set). Furthermore, because a number of sites use broken cookies
which contain commas in the value, parsing a combined Set-Cookie header field
can be a little tricky.
