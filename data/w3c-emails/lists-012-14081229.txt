I've been reading RFCs 2616 and 2617 about caching authenticated
responses, and have possibly found some inconsistencies.

#1.     The very last sentence of Sec 14.9.4 (under proxy-revalidate)
says: ``...such authenticated responses also need the public
cache control directive in order to allow them to be cached at
all''

Yet, Sec 14.8 lists three cache-control directives that allow a
shared cache to reuse an authenticatd response: s-maxage,
must-revalidate, and public.

#2.If must-revalidate alone is enough to allow an authenticated
response to be cached, and if proxy-revalidate is the same
as must-revalidate for a shared cache, is proxy-revalidate
alone enough to allow an authenticated response to be cached?

If so, should proxy-revalidate be listed in section 14.8?

#3.RFC 2617, Sec 3.2.2.5 says:

    when a shared cache ... has received a request containing
    an Authorization header and a response from relaying that
    request, it MUST NOT return that response as a reply to any
    other request, unless one of two Cache-Control (see section
    14.9 of [RFC2616]) directives was present in the response.

I believe this is referring to section 14.8, rather than 14.9,
and "two" is not the right number?

Finally, Sec 14.8 doesn't mention if a non-shared cache needs to treat
an authenticated response specially.  I assume that a non-shared
cache can store and reuse an authenticated response by default.
Should that be made explicit?
