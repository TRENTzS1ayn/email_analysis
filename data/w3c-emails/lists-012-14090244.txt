The best solution for maximum security whould be:

Authenticated request
=====================
Shared-Cache
Do NOT cache the response, because it requires uses to authenticate, and may
not be accessed by everyone.

Private-Cache
A private-cache is used by ONLY ONE PERSON. This cache may cache the
response (depending on the cache-control header), because it can only be
accessed by one person.
