Something that if you need to authenticate to the proxy, and the response is
private (e.g. private cache-control setting and/or authentication) that the
cached object is stored in the proxy cache, but only be accessable if you
authenticate with the same name???? (Private caching done on a proxy
server?)

Maybe that I'm getting it wrong...


I know that proxies are primarily intend to lower internet bandwidth and
provide security (kind of firewall)...
