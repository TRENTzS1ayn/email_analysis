You might look at Kerberos. Maybe this already provides what you want to
have in the authentication. However there needs to come a standard
describing how to use Kerberos authentication with HTTP.

At least I assumed Kerberos also used tickets e.d. Maybe that it needs to be
a bit modified (e.g. HTTP-Kerberos), because something with certificates (I
don't know how it all works).....

Only a suggestion......
