Folks,

Many apologies for all the nasty spam from Adworks over the last couple of
weeks that had managed to leak through my filters.

The spambot was automagically subscribing to the list in order to post.  I've
fixed that particular loophole (for now).

If you see spam, can you e-mail me directly and I'll try to fix a.s.a.p.

Thanks!
