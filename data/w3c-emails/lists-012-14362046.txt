Hi all,
section 3.6.1 of RFC2616 the definition of a chunk body is given. I wonder
whether or not it is valid to include space characters between the chunk
size and the chunk extensions. Thus, if the following chunk body is valid:
23;ext1<CRLF>
Is the following chunk body then also valid:
23<SP>;ext1<CRLF>
Even more, if both are valid, do they represent the exact same chunk body?

Thanks in advance.

Kind regards,
Alexander.
