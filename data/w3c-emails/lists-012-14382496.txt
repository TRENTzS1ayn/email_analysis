There was in 5-2000 a discussion about the cache-control header in HTTP/1.1.

My question is what should a proxy/user-agent do if it receives the request:

cache-control: private, public, max-age=180, s-maxage=120


According to my e-mail archive it was a discussion Koen Holtman participated
in.......
But I had some trouble and I suppose I didn't receive a lot of e-mails at
that time....
