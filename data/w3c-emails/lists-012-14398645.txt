I didn't see that at time I was writing the mail, but you are right,
I meant response instead of request.

What about "public"???

Ok, that's true. That is why I send this example, to see how you (HTTP WG)
think how to handle this...

Let's if I understand it right:
Meaning your recommendation whould be:

Private Cache (NON-SHARED)
    Cache it (max-age = 180)

Public Cache (SHARED)
    Don't cache it (conflicting cache-control)
    However on the other had, the server did send s-maxage=120,
    so it's caring for public caches.....
