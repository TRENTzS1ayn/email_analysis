To: HTTP Working Group<http-wg@hplb.hpl.hp.com>

The following (erroneous) milestones appear on the HTTP-WG's charter page,
<http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/http-charter.html>:

Jun 96Review additional features for HTTP/1.2

Oct 96Submit HTTP/1.2 to IESG for consideration as a Proposed Standard.

I realize the milestones are wildly incorrect, but there is no HTTP/1.2 (yet),
and these references to it may lead someone to go digging around to try to find
it.
