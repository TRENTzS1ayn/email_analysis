You missed a part. 305 (Use Proxy) MUST include a location header pointing
to the proxy to be used using a URI.

304 MUST include the date header.
Or, if clock-less, it MUST include:
ETag and/or Content-Location
Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary

You'd better read RFC2616 once again, and you see that you make the
incorrect assumptions.

An other possibility is that you mixed the body and entity. Entity
represents the headers and the body the actual data (e.g. HTML document).

The body is not needed, but may be included. Here is no information about.
MS-IIS send a body with a e.g. 301 response. Other servers may not do
this...
