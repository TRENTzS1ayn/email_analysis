Can anyone tell me if the following is a legal header ofr a response
from a web server?


   *** [tid=10e 108] Receiving response ( 30/8/2000 14:59:10 )

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Server: Netscape-Enterprise/4.0
   Date: Wed, 30 Aug 2000 19:02:26 GMT
   Content-length: 148
   Content-type: image/gif
   Connection: Close
   Connection: keep-alive


Specifically, it is the 'Connection: Close' followed by 'Connection:
keep-alive' that is in question.

Thanks in advance
