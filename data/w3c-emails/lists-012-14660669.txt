Interesting combination of headers.  Digging through the specs, section
19.7.1 of RFC2068 seems to allow the sending of `Connection:
keep-alive' to initiate a persistent connection with some legacy
HTTP/1.0 clients.  The `Connection: Close' at the same time forces a
non-persistent connection in the case that the client is a 1.1 client.
Nothing seems to forbid the use of both at the same time.

So I think it is legal, even unambiguous.  But the semantics is
strange, so it probably reflects a bug in the server.
