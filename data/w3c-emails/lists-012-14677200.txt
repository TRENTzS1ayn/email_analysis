No, it isn't...

You can't close a connection and at the same time leave it open.....
You also can't close a door and leave it open at the same time......

  Can anyone tell me if the following is a legal header ofr a response from
a web server?

     *** [tid=10e 108] Receiving response ( 30/8/2000 14:59:10 )

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Server: Netscape-Enterprise/4.0
     Date: Wed, 30 Aug 2000 19:02:26 GMT
     Content-length: 148
     Content-type: image/gif
     Connection: Close
     Connection: keep-alive


  Specifically, it is the 'Connection: Close' followed by 'Connection:
keep-alive' that is in question.

  Thanks in advance
