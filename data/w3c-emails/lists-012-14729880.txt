Amazing coincidence :-) I was going to ask at the HTTP WG Mailing List when
your mail arrived. So let's ask there:

| In section 3.7 "Media Types", the earlier RFC2068 refers correctly to
| RFC2048 in relation to IANA registrations, but the later RFC still
| refers to the obsoleted RFC1590.
|
| Looking at the history of these documents as noted at
| http://www.w3.org/Protocols/History.html#HTTP11
| one finds that _all_ of the drafts (even the one which is described as
| having become RFC2068) are citing the obsolete RFC1590.  However,
| RFC2068 itself had been corrected to cite RFC2048.
|
| As far as I could determine, the documents which set out the
| differences between RFC2068 and the later drafts make no mention of
| this difference - not even the ones which claim to show change-bars
| >from RFC2068.  So it appears that the correction must have been
| slipped-in to RFC2068 at the last moment - and somehow left no tracks
| on the main drafting sequence.
|
| I don't see any mention of this on the HTTP/1.1 Specification Errata
| page at
| http://www.agranat.com/fs/public/lawrence/http_errata.html
| either.
|
| Maybe an item should be added to the errata, calling for the
| reference to RFC1590 to be corrected to RFC2048?

best regards,
