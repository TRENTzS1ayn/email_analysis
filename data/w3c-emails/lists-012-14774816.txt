Reviewed it, and you are right... I did mix it up with the existance
of the proxy-authentication and proxy-authorization headers.
Also when developing for my own a proxy server, MSIE did also send the
proxy-connection header.

Said it all.....
So Proxy-Connection can be retired in HTTP/1.1 and be replaced with
the connection header.

Won't it be good for proxies if getting HTTP/1.0. For HTTP/1.1 look for
a connection header, and either discard the proxy-connection header, or
use it if the connection header is not present?
