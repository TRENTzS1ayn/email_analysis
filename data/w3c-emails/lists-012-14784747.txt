Agree,

But although it's not explicitly forbidden by the RFC, logic sense (you know
what I mean) would forbid such constructions. The cache-control example was
from another discussion, and Jeffrey Mogul (& John Strake) agreed such
responses should not be cached by a public cache, since this points to a
buggy server.
But not how do you explain illegal and legal responses?
If you have software that receives in a response the connection header(s)
above, you would suppose the header is buggy and cannot be used. And since
it's not used by the software, can't we just say it's illegal?
And since it's not in a request...
