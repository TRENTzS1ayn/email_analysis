Hi All,

I have been looking around for a HTTP 1.1 Conformance test, or sombody
that
can perform such a test. I have been unable to find anything.

It would be gretaly appreciated if anybody can provide me with any
information
reagrding HTTP 1.1 conformance testing. I have looked at the WC3 site,
they do not have HTTP 1.1 Conformance test, instead they have
Performance tests.

Regards,

Kristan
