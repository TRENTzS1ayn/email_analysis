This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests and responses.  It
describes three new headers, Cookie, Cookie2, and Set-Cookie2, which
carry state information between participating origin servers and user
agents.  The method described here differs from Netscape's Cookie
proposal, but it can interoperate with HTTP/1.0 user agents
that use Netscape's method.  

This document reflects implementation experience with RFC 2109 and
obsoletes it.

This is now a Proposed Standard Protocol.

This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for
the Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
for improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the
"Internet Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the
standardization state and status of this protocol.  Distribution
of this memo is unlimited.

This announcement is sent to the IETF list and the RFC-DIST list.
Requests to be added to or deleted from the IETF distribution list
should be sent to IETF-REQUEST@IETF.ORG.  Requests to be
added to or deleted from the RFC-DIST distribution list should
