Carl,

Once we start doing any kind of compliancy checking we face the proverbial
"slippery slope".  What comes next?  Seperate tests for things that MAY be
done according to the specs?  Things that SHOULD be?

I think the best thing to do is stay out of the compliancy checking business
all together.

Thanks,

Keith
