Something I was wondering about, does HTTP/1.1 allow this:

You send to a HTTP/1.1 proxy/gateway:

GET http://www.you.com/ HTTP/1.1
host: gateway.me.com

were the intension is to get www.you.com through gateway.me.com

gateway.me.com can be e.g. a caching proxy server or gateway...

Is this actually possible HTTP/1.1-compliant???
(however I don't expect proxies to support this)
