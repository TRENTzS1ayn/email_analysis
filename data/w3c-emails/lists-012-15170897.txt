You are using too many cache-control directives. no-cache is sufficent..
No-store is also enough, causing it not to be stores anywhere.

no-store I would only recommend for sensative data, no-cache for non-sensative data, because it can save some network bandwidth.

using also the must-revalidate and max-age may confuse the cache, as it is *probably* non-compliant.

Maybe that you should also include

Pragma: no-cache

just in case. Using HTTP/1.1 is better....

I expect a HTTP/1.1 cache to interpet the cache-control header included in a HTTP/1.0 response. MSIE does this, I think, but including "pragma: no-cache" is much more reliable...
