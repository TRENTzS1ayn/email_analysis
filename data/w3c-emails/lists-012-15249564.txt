They don't leave connections open and idle long enough for this to be
relevant.  Browsers typically close idle connections in one or two
minutes, even if the server does not.

Communicator doesn't do 1.1 yet.

Q3. Are the popular BROWSERS typically speaking HTTP/1.1, or HTTP/1.0?
I
didn't
notice any config parameters that might have something to do with
setting the
default.

The default for direct connections in IE is 1.1; I believe that Opera
also uses 1.1 by default now.
