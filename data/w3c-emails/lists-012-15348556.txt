What experimentation, if any, has been done with adaptive server timeouts? A
project I'm working on reduces timeouts based on current load. When a
certain point is reached connections are closed immediately until the load
drops down.

I haven't got as far as testing this on a live site so I'm curious whether
anyone has any real world experience.
