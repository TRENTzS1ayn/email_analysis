There've been nine implementation reports so far.

This message summarizes some of the troublesome issues:

The following features are not marked as implemented by two or more
implementations:

H 10.1.2 101 Switching Protocols
H 10.2.4 203 Non-Authoritative Information
H 10.2.6 205 Reset Content
H 14.15 Content-MD5
H 14.42 Upgrade
A 3.2.1, A 3.2.2, A3.2.3, A4.2 (all)

In addition, the following features are claimed to be implemented
by two or more, but have not been tested by two or more independent
implementations:

 H 10.2.2 201 Created
*H 10.2.3 202 Accepted
 H 10.3.6 305 Use Proxy
*H 10.4.3 402 Payment Required
 H 10.4.9 408 Request Timeout
 H 10.4.10 409 Conflict
 H 10.4.11 410 Gone
 H 10.4.12 411 Length Required
 H 10.4.14 413 Request Entity Too Large
 H 10.4.15 414 Request-URI Too Long
*H 13.3.3 Weak entity tags
*H 14.37 Retry-After
 H 14.39 TE

The features except those marked with "*" were
tested by one implementation against another,
but the testing wasn't mutual.

It would be good to focus on broadening the testing
for each of these features, though.
