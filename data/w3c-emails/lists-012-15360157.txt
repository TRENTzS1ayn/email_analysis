     We seem to be diverging into TCP coding.  A read will return zero
length
when the other end has issued a normal close (and all the data has been
read).
A read will return -1 when the connection is ReSeT, or there is a
connection time-out
of any sort.  So the server can too tell the difference between end of data
and
a connection failure.

This is not good.  If this is the server's normal behavior, the client has
no way to distinguish a dropped connection from end of file.  So the client
can never be sure it received an entire message.

If this is the server's behavior for error conditions, this is still not
good unless the server either waits for the entire request (could be a
humongous POST and/or a very slow connection), or only closes one half of
the connection (which, BTW, is impossible in Java, except maybe in the
latest releases).  Otherwise, the client might get a RST while transmitting
the request, and will then never see the error response.

I was looking at IE's (version 5 somthing) traffic yesterday, and it seems
to send two requests per connection.
