I've got a comment.  The draft refers to "Hypertext Transport Protocol
(HTTP)" and talks about using HTTP as "the transport" for RPCs, etc.   I
thought HTTP was supposed to be a transfer protocol, not a transport.
Isn't "HTTP" usually expanded as "Hypertext Transfer Protocol"?  Or is the
distiction between transfer and transport unimportant in this context?
