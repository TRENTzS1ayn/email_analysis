Do you know whether the proxy server is a *1.1* proxy?  More than
likely it is not.  Therefore the proxy won't know about HTTP/1.1, will
send requests as HTTP/1.0 requests because it doesn't know better, and
treat responses accordingly.  And that is why, as Jeff Mogul has already
remarked, the browser should be cautious about how it interprets

HTTP/1.1 headers.
