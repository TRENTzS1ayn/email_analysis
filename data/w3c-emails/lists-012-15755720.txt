Depends on the server, but typically around 256 bytes.
E.g. this instance of Apache response uses 279 bytes:

ab -v 4 http://www.foo.com:81/poweredby.png

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 30 Nov 2000 10:21:44 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.12 (Unix)  (Red Hat/Linux) PHP/3.0.15 mod_perl/1.21
Last-Modified: Wed, 01 Mar 2000 18:37:44 GMT
ETag: "33303-482-38bd6378"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 1154
Connection: close
Content-Type: image/png

<1154 bytes of binary data>

Cheers,
