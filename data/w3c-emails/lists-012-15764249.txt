     You have an HTTP response header (around 250 bytes) which goes
in its own segment and then all succeeding data is sent in TCP segments as a
stream of bytes.
No overhead other than the TCP/IP overhead.

     The latest standard (HTTP 1.1) has provisions for compression and "chunked"
transfers
which change this, but I haven't seen these used in any real-world situations
yet.
