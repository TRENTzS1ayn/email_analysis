Apache will recognize a file with a ".gz" extension as gzipped, and send the
Content-Encoding: x-gzip line.  Netscape will recognize Content-Encoding: x-gzip,
and uncompress the file.  Unfortunately, at least in my installation (Apache
1.3.14, Red Hat 7), Apache doesn't look at the extension before the ".gz" to get
the content-type; "foo.txt.gz" gets marked as Content-Type: application/x-gzip.
