We'll put out the reports some time in the next week or so;
I want to verify the 'public' status of the implementation
reports before doing so. There are many more implementations
listed than have reported at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Forum/#Test.

If you have a list of features you'd like to test against,
could you send it out?

Thanks,

Larry
