You are right, I did know this.

Indeed that's why I favor chunked encoding for dynamic resources. MSN's
(search) server (MS-IIS) transfers the data by just closing the
connection at the end (not sending any indication about the size of the
document) what also decreases the transfer 'reliability' - or better,
you don't know wether you have all or not... HTML or JPEG/GIF you can
guess it, but with many other sources you don't (like TXT)....

Also MSN's server has thus more overhead for the server and waisted time
between the requests for the client...
