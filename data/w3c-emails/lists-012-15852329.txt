P.S.  It doesn't work on IE, despite its "User-Agent:  Mozilla/4.0

Subject:  Push technology





Can anyone tell me where I can find information on this?  I read that HTTP
includes "push" technology to send information, but I can't find any solid
information on the W3 website.  Any help is appreciated.

Thanks,
Peter Foti
