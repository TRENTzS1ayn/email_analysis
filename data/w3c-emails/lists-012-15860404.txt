Hi,

Is it normal for a server to reject the following header because of the
final ';' ?

Set-Cookie: MyName=MyValue; path=/;

...looking in the spec it says the semi-colon acts as a 'separator', does
this mean that if it ends the Set-Cookie header it should reject it or is it
at the discrepancy of the server?

The following works fine:

Set-Cookie: MyName=MyValue; path=/

Thanks,

Jim.
