Sure. I'm looking for servers (better even: URLs) which implement any of
the following:

    H 10.3.6 305 Use Proxy
    H 10.3.7 307 Temporary Redirect
    H 10.4.9 408 Request Timeout

    H 14.37  Retry-After
    H 14.39  TE
    H 14.40  Trailer
    H 14.41  Transfer-Encoding  (specifically: gzip, deflate, and compress)

    A 3.2.1/3.2.2/3.2.3 Digest Authentication with "qop=auth" and "qop=auth-int"

Also looking for a proxy which does:

    A 4.2  Digest Authentication with "qop=auth" and "qop=auth-int"
    A 4.2  Proxy-Authentication-Info

Concerning the low implemented list:

    H 10.1.2 101 Switching Protocols
    H 14.42  Upgrade

I'm not sure what there is to implement here... If any server does
implement these, then what do they accept in the Upgrade header?


  Cheers,

  Ronald
