Sorry I found it... there is a recommendation,

    Microsoft and Netscape just blindly ignore it:

Section 15.6 "Authentication Credentials and Idle Clients":

 "In particular, user agents which cache credentials are
   encouraged to provide a readily accessible mechanism for discarding
   cached credentials under user control."

Which neither do - even though it's a security hole.

                - Erik
