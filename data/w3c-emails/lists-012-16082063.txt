I agree that a "logout" type button should certainly be implemented. I'm
interested in your choice of words however, naming the non-provision of an
HTTP server cache clearance request as a security hole. In my opinion it is
the responsibility of the site to provide some form of timeout security. To
provide an HTTP type clearance of the cache is exposing the agent to what
amounts to control by a third party. Surely this would constitute a greater
threat to security and not be a road to wander down without serious
consideration of the potential future implications?
