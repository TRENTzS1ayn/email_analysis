Dear Tom,

The site cannot easily know whether or not the request was coming from the
cache or the client... unless the cache tells it.

Thus the server always relys on a "third party" (the browser or the
cache)... to manage or respect authentication "state".

It's just an oversight that cookies are "expirable" (they have timeouts and
they can be forced by the server to expire) and usernames/passwords aren't.

In a way, "cookies" are "more secure" than the security mechanisms built
into http.

                - Erik
