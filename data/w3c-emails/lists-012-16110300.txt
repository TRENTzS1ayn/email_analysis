Any control provided to the server should of course be scoped to the data
'owned' by that server, hence no security exposure. Likewise, it should be
possible for a user to expunge ALL data cached from their session, login
credentials, cookies, pages etc. It should be possible for the 'owner' of
the user agent installation to configure the UA to peform this function
automatically when closed, etc.  Again not a security issue if the action
is performed by or directly on behalf of the human user.

And of course, any well designed web application will implement a timeout
stragegy because they can't trust the other end.  Unfortunately short
timeouts which improve security have the strong potential for very
frustrated users who happen to be interrupted by a phone call or other
task while in the middle of an interaction.
