Till here it seems to be all right....

Well, it doesn't point explicitly to the value, thus:
  value = charset | token | quoted-string

Something like this would then have been in the spec

I expect is to be all right what you do.

HTTP has much of it's design from MIME, probably you can use the
quoted-string, and it's compliant withe spec.

However, I don't know if client implementation support it, but I expect they
will, through I'm not sure, nor have any possibility to test this. This is
actually the issue with things like this.

The only server I found: HEAD http://www.freebsd.com/ HTTP/1.1
returned the value of the parameter "charset" without quotes.
I would recommend to simply not use them, just in case...
