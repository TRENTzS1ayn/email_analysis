HTTP is stateless in the sense that all of the information needed to
interpret and handle a request is present in that request and not based
on a prior request's leftover state.  A RID doesn't change that in
principle, though it would certainly complicate the implementation
to handle out-of-order responses.  On the server-side, the ability
to have out-of-order responses makes it easier to partition pipelined
requests out to multiple server instances, which is one of the main
reasons why HTTP is stateless.
