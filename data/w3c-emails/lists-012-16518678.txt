Depends on the value of the href attribute of the base element in the
head element :-)

Request URIs must be absolute, either

/Top/Science/Math/Applications/Communication_Theory/Cryptography/Algorithms/

or

http://directory.google.com/Top/Science/Math/Applications/Communication_Theory/Cryptography/Algorithms/

or some non-canonical forms of that URI.

Let's say it's http://www.abc.com/help/u1/myHelp.html

http://www.abc.com/yourHelp.com

http://www.abc.com/yourHelp.com

http://www.abc.com/www.beta.com/OtherHelp.com

Please read RFC 2396.

Nope,
http://directory.google.com/Top/Science/Math/Applications/Communication_Theory/Cryptography/Algorithms/

Read RFC 2396. If the relative URI (href='...') is an absolute path
href='/...' it completly replaces the old path. RFC 2396 has a lot of
examples on that.

This is no HTTP issue, www-uri@w3.org deals with URIs.
