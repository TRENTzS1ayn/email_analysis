     Seems like a feature which would really help
web-page response time using less resources than multiple
simultaneous connections, but it seems to have never been
adopted.

     I know of no browser that supports it.

     What are the "GOTCHAs" that keep it from being adopted?

     The biggest one that comes to mind is fact that one
of the responses in the pipeline may not have a content-length.
What could be done about that?
