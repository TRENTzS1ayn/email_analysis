     Colleagues,

      I'm interested in having HTTPS provide
low-response time web browsing over long latency
links, such as Satellite. As you know, the extra handshakes
required by TLS tend to increase the response time.

     As such, some colleagues and I have put
together a test bed and are looking at sniffer traces
from various browser/web server combinations to
see whether implementations are using the best
features of HTTP and TLS to achieve low response time.
Initial results indicate that they are not using best
practice.

     I see from the TLS working group that there is
already an informational RFC (2818) regarding the
use of HTTP over TLS, but that this document does not
address performance issues.

     Would anyone on this mailing list be interested
in seeing the results of our testing as they become available?

     Would anyone be interested in reviewing/contributing
to an informational RFC recommending best practice for
low response time?
