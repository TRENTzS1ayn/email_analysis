I beg to differ. The response-digest is the same as the request-digest
except that A2 is computed differently, and the request-digest uses the
nc-value in the computation.

The nonce-count, nonce, and uri have to be kept anyway, so I'm not sure
how much easier it makes things (I just compare the received nc-value
and cnonce against the ones in the request and puke if they don't
match). However, there may well implementations which do this indirect
validation and which would profit from an explicit cnonce, so I think
it can be left in.
