I was looking at the header of GET request sent by Mozilla.
I came across this header field "keep-alive: 300".
This field is not present in the GET request sent by
netscape 4.7 and IE 5.0 .


One more doubt, If this field is particular to Mozilla
browser, as my observation suggests, then How the server
is supposed to understand this field ?
