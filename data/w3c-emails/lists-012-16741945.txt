Anyway, it sounds like it is likely a "good book" and worth having, but I'd 
prefer to get some independent confirmation before parting with the $.

To anticipate the question -- yes, given the reprint of the "flap blurbs" on 
the amazon page..

  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201710889/

..it sounds like it nominally covers the ground I'm interested in knowing more 
about (e.g. Web caching and multimedia streaming, the Apache Web server, Squid 
proxy, and traffic measurement techniques).

thanks,
