Asleep at the switch I see...

I did put an entry in the issues list page called XREF's, to remind you
to check the cross references.

Probably my mistake on the issues list; I did a very quick edit of the 
Issues list late last week to try to bring it up to date (and try out 
the 1.2a version of our Amaya browser/editor on it; Amaya did quite well, 
even on the Issues list tables from H--- that had previously thrown it 
for a loop; you might take it for a test drive :-)).

Let me know what issues should have which state...  (or I can tell you
how to use Jigedit to edit it yourself, Paul, if you want to be adventurous.
Of course, you'll have to find a tool which supports PUT, which leaves
the Microsoft tools out :-(.)
