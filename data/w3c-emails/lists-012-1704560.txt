Imagine for a moment that I have a proxy server.
I start to fetch a page for a client, and return the headers.
There are many objects that don't come with Content-Length (e.g. FTP).

If it is not cacheable I won't buffer it; even if it is cacheable, the
first client doesn't get a Content-Length because I don't buffer the
entire object before sending the response (to reduce latency).

Imagine the request times out, or a shark eats the trans-Atlantic cable
the object is being transfered over, or whatever.  Now, I have to close
the connection to the client, who recieves a truncated object with no
indication of an error (until he tries to use it and finds it is
corrupted).  There is no possiblity of reporting what the problem is
either.
