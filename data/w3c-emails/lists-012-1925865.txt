I 'm working in resolve the problem of copyright, that is violated with
catching. 
If I pay for a subscription, and connect to get information copyrighted,
the page will be cached in the proxy, and every one else could see it.

If the server sends an http header with "no-cache", the problem would be
resolved?
Please, let me know how to get extra information about this issue.

Thanks
M Eugenia Riggi
