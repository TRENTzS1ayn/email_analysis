To the original post ... sounds like an editorial bug in the
authentication draft.  After Larry's post I went digging 'cause I knew
I'd seen a definition in the past of a 'canonical form'.  Here is what
I found in rfc1945 ... (in section 3.2.2):

   The canonical form for "http" URLs is obtained by converting any
   UPALPHA characters in host to their LOALPHA equivalent (hostnames are
   case-insensitive), eliding the [ ":" port ] if the port is 80, and
   replacing an empty abs_path with "/".  

In rfc2068 (3.2.3) we provide a definition of URI Comparison which is
probably a better approach.

Hence I think removal of 'canonical' from the authentication draft
will not change the intent and will align the documents.
