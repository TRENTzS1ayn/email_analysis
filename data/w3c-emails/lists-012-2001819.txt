Either that, or hope the client does some intelligent guessing. Though
I don't think that the situation is that bad. I'd expect most clients
to note the new protection spaces (i.e. the tuples (host, port, scheme,
realm) ) in any case, so that at worst you get a needless round-trip for
the 401; but at least the user won't be prompted for the username/password
again (which I believe is the main reason for the domain attribute).

I've assumed a nonce per protection space (i.e. separate nonces and
nonce-counts above). However, I can't find anything specific in the
spec, so I believe this should be clarified too.
