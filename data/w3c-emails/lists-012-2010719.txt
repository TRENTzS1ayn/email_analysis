     This problem affects any recources that have access restrictions 
     applied to them. As you mention, a pragma: no-cache header (HTTP/1.0) 
     solves the problem, but means that you can not cache the data 
     privately. A cache-control: private header (HTTP/1.1) is better 
     because the data can now be cached on private caches (usually the 
     browser). In the future, an extension to the private cache control 
     header may be avialbale so that shared caches can cache data that has 
     access restrictions, and ensure that that data is not forwarded to 
     people that do not have access rights (see 
     <http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/draft-melve-cachecontrol-00.txt> 
     for info.).
     
     However, you should also consider that if the data is sent unencrypted 
     that people snooping the network connections or those with the ability 
     to snoop the caching directories on the proxies cache, will also be 
     able to view the data. If the data is extremely sensitive, encryption 
     should be used, and the cache-control: no-store header should be used 
     so that the data is not stored on non-volatile storage in an 
     unencrypted form, and is removed from volatile storage as soon as is 
     possible.
     
     Hope thats of use,
     
     
     Dominic.
