I think it would be wise to add an explicit statement to that effect to
the draft.

I don't entirely agree that it's a bug.  Suppose the client sends a
preemptive Authorization header with qop="auth-int" for a URL that
retrieves dynamic content, more particularly something like an NPH CGI
(a CGI that presumes to handle all output itself, including headers,
bypassing the server).  The server will never get the opportunity to
examine and calculate the digest for the returned content (because of
the NPH architecture).  But the server can probably assume the CGI will
not send an AuthenticateInfo header.  And, 500 sounds like the right
response here.
