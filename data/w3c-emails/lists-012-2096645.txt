3.2.2 The Authorization Request Header

    response         = "response" "=" request-digest

Later there's this text:
    The definition of request-digest above indicates the encoding for
    its value. The following definitions show how the value is
    computed.

Unfortunately, there *is* no "definition ... above".  The non-terminal
request-digest has no syntactic definition.  I suspect it should be

request-digest = <"> *LHEX <">


3.2.3 The Authentication-Info Header

cnonce and qop are used in the calculation of response-digest.  The
client is not required to send either cnonce= or auth=.  So I assume
(correct?) that the null string is used for values for omitted
attributes in the calculation.

If (to use cnonce as the example) cnonce was omitted, should
Authentication-Info omit cnonce, or should it send cnonce=""?  Same
question for auth.
