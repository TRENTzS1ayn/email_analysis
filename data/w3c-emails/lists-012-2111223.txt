It might be better to say that Authentication-Info should only be
sent if qop (and hence cnonce) are present.


Another question: Unless I am mistaken, at one point in the long
sequence of digest drafts, the Authentication-Info header could be
supplied by either the server or the client.  It would be useful
for the client to be able to supply the digest of POSTed data
or a file which is PUT.  Being able to assure the integrity of
client supplied data would be very useful.  Did this fall through
the cracks, or am I just missing this functionality somewhere in
the draft?
