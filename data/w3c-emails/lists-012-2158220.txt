In rev3, language was added at the end this section which states:

"The Content-Length field of a request or response is added or deleted
according to the rules in section 4.4. A cache or non-caching proxy MUST
preserve the entity-length (section 7.2.2) of the entity-body, although
it MAY change the transfer-length (section 4.4)."

I believe the second sentence should read:

"A transparent proxy MUST preserve the entity-length...."

given that the definition of "proxy" specifically mentions media type
transformation as a service that non-transparent proxies may provide.
(Media type transformations usually do change the entity length....)
