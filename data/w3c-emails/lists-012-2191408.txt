That's the only approach I could imagine using, short of precomputing
the entire response.  But I wasn't altogether sure it was valid, though
neither can I think of a reason why it is not.  That's why I asked.

I'm in the process of implementing auth-int and it is, to be charitable,
"challenging".  Has anyone else implemented server-side auth-int?  Is
anyone else *planning* to?
