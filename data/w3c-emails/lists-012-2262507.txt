This is not within the charter of the HTTP-WG, but it might be
of interest to people working on HTTP protocol design issues.

Title: Duplicate Suppression in HTTP
Author(s): J. Mogul, A. van Hoff
Filename: draft-mogul-http-dupsup-00.txt
Pages: 24
Date: 16-Apr-98

        A significant fraction of Web content is often exactly
        duplicated under several different URIs.  This duplication
        can lead to suboptimal use of network bandwidth, and
        unnecessary latency for users.  Much of this duplication
        can be avoided through the use of a simple mechanism,
        described here, which allows a cache to efficiently
        substitute one byte-for-byte identical value for another.
        By doing so, the cache avoids some or all of the network
        costs associated with retrieving the duplicate value.
