Section 10.3.3 ("302 Found") of the current HTTP/1.1 draft still says
that the conversion of POST to GET is "erroneous".  It thus still contradicts
virtually universal "current practice", and the decisions reached at the
Washington, DC IETf meeting and subsequent discussion on this list.  This
undoubtedly is an oversight, but should be corrected before it becomes a
Draft Standard.
