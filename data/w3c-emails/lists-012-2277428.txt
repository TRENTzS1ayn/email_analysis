On Fri 3/13/98 5:28 PM, the 'last LAST CALL' for three documents
(v11-spec-rev, authentication, state-man-mec) was issued, and scheduled
to expire March 27.

We've since had several relatively minor issues raised with
the first document (v11-spec-rev), but, more importantly,
we're still looking for more complete implementation reports
of a few features before forwarding this document on as Draft
Standard.

The second document (authentication) has had substantial comments,
which I believe will require a revision and another (brief) last
call. More importantly, we need better substantiation of testing
of interoperability of the independent implementations. We're still
hoping for Draft Standard status for these two documents together,
since v11-spec-rev should not move forward without a credible
authentication mechanism at the same maturity level.

The last document (state-man-mec) has had no substantial comments,
except that there are not independent interoperable implementations,
and it seems possible that we just forward it on as Proposed Standard,
which I will do forthwith.
