I am somewhat behind Dave in implementation (and likely to stay that
way given my current schedule).  I have implemented the new
spec, but so far only with qop=auth.  However, I do have 
Content-MD5 implemented for static documents.

Both of these have barely been tested so I would appreciate
feedback.  The URL is

     http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/testpage/

That document has Content-MD5.  It contains a link to a digest
protected document.
