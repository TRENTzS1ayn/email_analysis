The previous "last call" was pretty sudden. 

One thing that I don't like is

    nc-value         = 8LHEX

It should be 

    nc-value         = *LHEX


Also in Authentication-Info I think it should be 

     auth-info          = 1#( [nextnonce] | [ message-qop ]
                            | [ response-auth ] | [ cnonce ]
                            | [nonce-count] )


instead of 

     auth-info          = 1#(nextnonce | [ message-qop ]
                            | [ response-auth ] | [ cnonce ]
                            | [nonce-count] )

with [] around nextnonce indicating that it is optional.
