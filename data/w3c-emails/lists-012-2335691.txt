How about doing what is done for the chunked TE and using

       lhex-no-zero    = <LHEX excluding "0">
       nc-value        = lhex-no-zero  *LHEX

to forbid the leading zeros.  I think that at least 99% of the time the
nc-value will be a single digit.  It is kind of wasteful and silly to
require an enormous number of 

        nc=00000001

fields.  I suppose for backwards compatibility we should as
servers to tolerate the leading zeros.
