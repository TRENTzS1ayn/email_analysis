I disagree ... there is a large difference between not being able to
resolve a name and not being able to connect to an IP address.
The first order problem resolution for the DNS failure will in may cases
be the user checking the URL they typed for correctness. Failure to
connect to the resolved IP address is also different from connection
refused in terms of recovery strategy.  All of those distinctions are
useful for further problem determination by human analysists. And even
when the automated portion of a client can't distinguish, the ability to
collect failure statistics with distinct failure reasons may be helpful.
