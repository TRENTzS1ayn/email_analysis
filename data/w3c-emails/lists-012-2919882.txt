The only reliable answer is without. But beyond that, the spec is pretty
clear.  Same as GET except for no message-body. So if the client wants
to know why
   GET / HTTP/1.1
   <CRLF>
would have failed, it must try a GET.


The flaw in the HEAD request design is that it should have returned its
result as an entity rather than as a simple modified GET response. But
that change is too late.
