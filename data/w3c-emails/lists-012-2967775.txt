As far as I know there are no general client implementations so it would
seem unwise to assume what they would do and instead provide the protocol
element which gives more power.  With basic, the client which wants to
optimize must make assumptions AND has no way to avoid prompting a user
for multiple servers.  Clients seem to assume that all URLs in the
directory for which authentication was requested and below share the
same credentials.  Thus, there is currently no way other than an
additional round trip for the client to learn that the real world is
broader or narrower than the current heuristic.
