I have searched the open issues and believe that this is a new issue.

It seems that including Content-Encoding or Content-Type in the
trailer of a chunked transfer would be incorrect.  Allowing this would
require that the entire message body be buffered until the trailer is
received, so that the content codings may be removed, or the content
interpreted.  There doesn't seem to be any need for these headers to
appear in the trailer, since this information should be known before the

message transfer begins.  As far as I can tell, libwww would not
correctly
process a message with Content-Encoding headers in the trailer.

If I am incorrect in this, or if you are not soliciting public comments
at this time, please accept my apologies.

Thank you.
