I think there is one situation that 504 doesn't cover and that is if the
proxy doesn't *want* to proxy a certain URI, maybe because it can't
(firewall etc.) or because it is not within it's trust domain etc. What are
existing proxies doing in this situation? Adding this would clarify the
situation a lot:

418 Not Proxying

The server is not willing to proxy or gateway the Request-URI. No
indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. The
client MAY repeat the request using either a different proxy or no proxy at
all.

The 504 (Gateway Timeout) status code SHOULD be used if the server can not
serve the request due to upstream errors.
