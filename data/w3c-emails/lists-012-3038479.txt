I continue to disagree ... there is a distinct difference from the 
perspective of recovery whether the DNS consulted by proxy is unable
to resolve the host name or whether the host fails to respond. Hiding
all failures under a single code does nothing for usability or
perceived reliability.

Why bother .... there is a whole lot less an end user will be able to do
with this distinction over a simple not authorized response than over
a mistyped host name in a URL ... the suggested 418 may be useful to know
but on a priority scale less important to know than better granularity
on conditions covered by 504.
