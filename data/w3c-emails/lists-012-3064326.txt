3.2.2 The Authorization Request Header

digest-response  = 1#( username | realm | nonce | digest-uri |
   response | [ algorithm ] | [cnonce] |
   [opaque] | [server] | [message-qop] |
   [ nonce-count ] )

I don't think the non-terminal "server" is defined anywhere.
What is it supposed to be?

Also, the typography for "[ nonce-count ]" is inconsistent with the
other items (extra spaces).
