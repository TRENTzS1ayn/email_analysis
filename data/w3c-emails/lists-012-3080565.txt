Thanks, Dave. I was just telling Jim that we needed a revised Issues List,
and you've gone and written one. The background focus has been on getting
tested interoperable implementations, including implementations of Digest;
when we have enough implementations, then some of the answers to your questions
will be clearer.

Larry
