I thought Jerrfey Mogul made a good point about wanting to forbid 
identity when compression would be highly desireable (as in the 
case where bandwidth is very expensive).  However, I agree with 
you that since chunked encoding is _always_ acceptable it seems 
somewhat silly to disallow identity in that case.  So...

Perhaps in some cases the amount of data to send is so large that 
the receiving computer won't have enough space allocated in its 
internal representation of the content length to store the Content-
Length header's value. ;-)  I guess also that if you're thinking of 
performance, maybe the idea is that the hex representation of 
chunked transfer is more efficient to convert to binary.  And then 
there's the case of an interrupted transfer.  It's probably easier for a 
client to figure out which characters were received successfully in 
order to request the rest if those characters come in little chunks 
rather than one long stream...

OK, these are a stretch.
