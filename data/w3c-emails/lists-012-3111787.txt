    I thought Jerrfey Mogul made a good point about wanting to forbid 
    identity when compression would be highly desireable (as in the 
    case where bandwidth is very expensive).  However, I agree with 
    you that since chunked encoding is _always_ acceptable it seems 
    somewhat silly to disallow identity in that case.  So...
    
I probably wasn't clear enough in that message.  For Accept-Encoding,
"identity; q=0" is presumably justified by the point I made, but
I finished that message by saying "the rationale that applied to
Accept-Encoding probably does not apply here."  I.e., while I'm
not sure I agree with Dave Kristol that "TE: identity; q=0" is a
"bad idea", I didn't mean to imply that I thought it was necessarily
a good idea, either.
