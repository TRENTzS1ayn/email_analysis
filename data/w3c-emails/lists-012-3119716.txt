Is anyone aware of any effort to derrive a list of client software
packages which include the "Host:" header with requests? It would be
really helpful for my efforts to push server usage away from discrete
IP addresses to be able to speak with some degree of authority.

Nice to know what percentages of requests to major net destinations like
Yahoo, Altavista, Infoseek, Excite, Netscape, IBM, Microsoft, etc. now
include the HOST: header.
