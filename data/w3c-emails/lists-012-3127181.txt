Section 3.7.1 and appendix 19.4.2 allude to the fact that HTTP
supports the use of charset parameters with text types where the
charset does not use octets 13 and 10 for end-of-line, e.g.,
UTF-16. However, are there any implementations that support this,
and has the interoperability of, e.g., UTF-16 been tested?
