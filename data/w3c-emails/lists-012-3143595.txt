I work on a project for anonymous WWW access. It will base on HTTP/1.1
If you send a *big* packet through a MIX-Net (like Mixmaster, can
only work with a constant block size) a Cache-Proxy must connect the
smaller
parts. You can use the Content-Range Field but if some anonymous users
use
the same Range than they will get wasted data.
So we need also a Message-ID or 'Request-ID'.
This Message-ID should be defined for Request and Response and
*randomly* choose by the client/server. If a server, (user?),
proxy or MIX detect a collision
than a warning or error can be response to the client (may be
server?).
