Yes, going beyond pipelining was generally considered too complex to
put in http/1.1.  

I'd like to add though that, as far as I know, most people do not
consider out-of-order responses to be the logical next step in
improving 1.1.  The preferred next step seems to be to add
multiplexing of several HTTP connections over a single TCP connection.
Multiplexing has some additional advantages over out-of-order
responses.  See http://www.w3.org/Protocols/MUX/ for one effort in
this direction.
