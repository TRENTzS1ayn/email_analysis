I talked with Henrik about this...

This is not a correctness problem; it might be painful, but you have all 
the information you need to deal with the message (chunked is self 
delimiting).  What is more, the client would have to have asked for it 
using TE, so it seems unlikely you would do this unless you had a good 
reason.
