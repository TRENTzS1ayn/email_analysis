As always, it is:
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Issues/

Note that all issues from before last call have been moved to a separate
page to reduce confusion.

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Issues/BeforeLastCall.html

Please check to see if your favorite problem has been recorded, and let
me know if I've missed anything.

We anticipate submitting one more draft of each document  based on these 
issues and as the interoperability testing completes, forwarding to the 
IESG for draft standard.

At the moment, it looks like Digest is the pacing item.
