I agree that in general, implementing "common tolerant Internet behavior" is
a good thing. However, there are times that for simplicity, security, or
correctness reasons, certain protocol violations must cause error responses
from servers. One that comes to mind is when CTL chars are included in the
message header without first being encoded or inside of a quote string. I've
seen applications (MapQuest might still do this) that attempt to use control
characters in the URL. For security reasons, our proxy refuses to retrieve
requests that violate the protocol in that fashion.
