We ignore empty header fields (including Referer).
A _really_ anal reading of the BNF for URIs allows "".
Lynx (at least some versions used to) for example send empty Referer
headers, which was the problem that bit us when we were too rigid in
our error checking.

I would agree that unescaped CTLs is bad enough to reject.
