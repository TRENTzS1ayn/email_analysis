It can distinguish this with a CRLF pair.  Because a TRACE request 
cannot contain an entity as per the specification, then anything after 
the CRLF pair (not including additional CRLFs) would have to be 
considered the beginning of a new request.  However, another 
question to ask would be how a server should handle a TRACE 
request when a Content-Length header, for example, is included.  
Should the server simply read in the entity in any event even though 
it's forbidden by the spec (I'd think so, in keeping with being 
lenient), and then just not return it with the response?  Or should 
the server respond with the entire trace?  Or should the trace, in 
this case, be answered with a 400 status code?

I think we all missed the point of TE.  "TE: chunked" is never 
required since chunked encoding is *always* acceptable, correct, 
working group?
