Much later than I promised, I've submitted the first Internet Draft for
proxy cookies.

Discussion should be conducted on the http-state mailing list.  See
<http://www.bell-labs.com/mailing-lists/http-state/> for information
(and archives).

I've also started a web page about proxy cookies:
<http://portal.research.bell-labs.com/~dmk/pcookies/>.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


Title: HTTP Proxy State Management Mechanism
Author(s): D. Kristol
Filename: draft-kristol-http-proxy-state-00.txt,.ps
Pages: 8
Date: 27-May-98

This document specifies a way to create a stateful session, using HTTP
requests and responses, between an HTTP proxy server and its client.  It
describes two new headers, Pcookie and Set-Pcookie, which carry state
information between participating HTTP proxy servers and their clients.


Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address.  After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
"get draft-kristol-http-proxy-state-00.txt".
A URL for the Internet-Draft is:
ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kristol-http-proxy-state-00.txt

Internet-Drafts directories are located at:

Africa:ftp.is.co.za

Europe: ftp.nordu.net
ftp.nis.garr.it

Pacific Rim: munnari.oz.au

US East Coast: ftp.ietf.org

US West Coast: ftp.isi.edu

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.

Send a message to:mailserv@ietf.org.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-kristol-http-proxy-state-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
