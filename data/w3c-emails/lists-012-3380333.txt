Hi,

As most of you know already, the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) WG has
suggested using HTTP as "transport", with the payload in the form of a MIME
object passed with the POST method.

As part of the onging IESG review process, the Application Area Director
Keith Moore has suggested to distinguish IPP traffic from "normal" HTTP
traffic by: 

1) the introduction of a new scheme called "ipp"
2) the introduction a new default port number for IPP servers.

Before the IPP WG responds to those suggestions, the IPP WG would like to
get some advice from the HTTP WG on the implications of such a change.
In particular, we want some feedback on how easy or difficult it would be
to configure existing web servers to accomodate the suggested changes.

Please note that many printer vendors are not in the business of developing
web servers or HTTP servers and are dependent on getting those compoments
from other vendors.

Please respond back to the IPP DL at:

ipp@pwg.org

Thanks,

Carl-Uno Manros
Chair of the IETF IPP WG
