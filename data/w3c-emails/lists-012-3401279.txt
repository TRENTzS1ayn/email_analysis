If this gets down to a point where we HAVE to modify our specification,
then I agree with Josh, it would be much better to differentiate based
on HTTP method than on URL scheme, (IMHO). (But I think its ok as it
stands now)

I think its fine to have a new default dest port 
associated with IPP, but a new URL scheme seems like more
trouble than may be apparent.

For one, even though IPP is a different service than HTTP,
an IPP client *is* speaking HTTP, IMHO.  HTTP is used as
a layer underneath IPP.  So, I think the URL scheme
should continue to be http://..

Using a new URL scheme will certainly break compatibility
with existing proxies.  Proxy server's encountering a new
scheme will fail unless they are modified to understand it.

As I've stated before, I think the best way to differentiate
the service and remain compatible with existing proxy servers
is to use a new method on the request line.
