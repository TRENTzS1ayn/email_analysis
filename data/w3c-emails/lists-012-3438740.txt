I would strongly urge you to NOT introduce a new url scheme. I would
assert that any existing proxy which doesn't reject an unknown scheme
badly broken. At the very minimum, proxies would have to be configured
to accept this new scheme and interpret it as HTTP. A requirement which
will be fraught with failure in the implementation. I'm not aware of any
proxies which would be this simple to adapt so this is speculation of the
lower bound of difficulty generated by using a new scheme.

(I'm also not wild about new HTTP methods as I know of existing proxies
which will reject unknown methods. Don't know of any which will accept
unknown methods. I'm also unaware of any firewall software which examines
the HTTP request method as part of its algorithm but then I'm not a 
firewall expert.)

A new default port may be OK but I believe unnecessary.  In any case, an
installation should be allowed to overload port 80 etc. if desired by
over-riding the default if it isn't 80.

But then I don't buy the basic premis that its necessary to distinguish 
between IPP (or any other HTTP-based content protocol) and HTTP.
