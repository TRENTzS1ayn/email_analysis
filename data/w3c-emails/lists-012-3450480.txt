I know of at least one :-) firewall that not only rejects unknown methods
but also examines the HTTP request method as part of its "algorithm". From a
protocol and security perspective, it appears to be the right thing to do.
If you don't understand the method, how can you properly proxy it? Take the
CONNECT method as an example.

In summary, any proxy that is more than a simple packet passer (supports
CONNECT, protocol conversion, proxy authentication, etc.) runs the risk of
failing to pass IPP if it uses a new scheme and/or a new method. Not that
that's a bad thing... :-)
