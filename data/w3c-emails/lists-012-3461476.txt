You understand the problem correctly.

I don't think that RFC is specific.  There is no discussion of CRLF.
It gives an example in which all CRLF's are invisible and that is all.
I personally would not want to draw conclusions based on the number of
blank lines in the formating of the spec document! I don't think it is
sufficient to just refer to a MIME RFC either.

I don't care how it is done, but we need to be more precise.
