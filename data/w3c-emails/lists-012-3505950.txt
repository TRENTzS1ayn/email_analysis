     I would agree with Josh Cohen and David Morris that introducing a new 
     URL scheme will affect proxies and is a bad idea. I also agree with 
     David Morris that a new HTTP scheme should be avoided for the same 
     reasons.
     
     Using a new default port is okay. The stuff about firewalls being 
     affected is true to the extent that they also had to be opened up for 
     the default ports used for other protocols - It really isn't a big 
     hassle reconfiguring them.
     
     However, I side with David Morris in questioning the need distinguish 
     between IPP and HTTP. Is there one?
