Rob's argument is broadly correct -- as a long term firewall design issue,
method inspection (and occasionally payload inspection) will become the
rule.

However, as a small carrot to today's protocol designers, the vast majority
of the installed base of firewalls do no method / payload inspection on HTTP
data being passed through.   Purely from the perspective of 'reach' there's
no impediment to IPP using it's own method in the short run.
