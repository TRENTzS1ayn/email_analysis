This kind of flamebait is not really helpful to our discussion. Firewalls
serve legitimate technical and business needs as our friends from Microsoft
know, and those firewalls with application proxies look at protocols from a
different point of view than your typical caching proxies. The beauty of it
is that protocol compliant implementations from either the firewall or the
cache point of view will interoperate. The difference is when they encounter
something unexpected. Firewalls by definition must "fail closed" so as not
to make their protected resources vulnerable to attacks; most other software
makes a best effort to pass data. I don't see anything wrong with that
difference.

Once again, if IPP uses existing methods and schemes, it should be passable
through all proxies without trouble. Add a new method and/or scheme i.e.
CHANGE THE STANDARD, and you should expect that existing implemenations will
not understand it and some (not many) may not pass it.
