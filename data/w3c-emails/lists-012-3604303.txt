Rob clarified in personal e-mail that he meant the latest rev of the HTTP
draft.

One of the innovations of HTTP in respect to many other protocols is that
you do not need to modify the HTTP standard in order to add new methods for
use with HTTP. Rather HTTP defines exactly how one is to act if one receives
an unknown method. Thus one can safely add new methods and know that at the
worst one will simply receive a method unknown error from servers/firewalls
and be tunneled by proxies.

Firewall designers understood this simple design goal and thus allowed
administrators to specify which methods they did and did not want to allow
through their firewall. Thus the issue is not forcing administrators to rev
their firewalls to be compliant with some new standard but rather having
administrators brought into the loop in order to approve the use of a new
method through their firewall. Once they approve they need only change
settings on their firewall to permit the new method. It is this very process
that firewalls were introduced to enforce. Administrators realized they
could not possibly control what every server in their network did. Rather
than chasing after every user in order to ensure they were not running
"unapproved" or "insecure" software they configured their network such that
anyone wishing to do anything external to the network had to run through
their firewall.

Thus were IPP to use a new method there would be absolutely no need to alter
the HTTP standard and IPP would be acting in a manner consistent with the
express desires of the administrative community.
