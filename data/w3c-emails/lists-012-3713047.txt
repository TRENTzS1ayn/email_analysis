SSH surely does compress the stream, if you ask it to do so. It is also
possible to use compression with no encryption, which does enhance performance
in some cases (slow lines, fast systems).

I think one of the key issues here is whether there is prior work which
translates HTTP on one end of the stream into something else (thereby removing
the HTTP protocol overhead), and recreates the HTTP request at the other end.
SSH does not touch the protocol, it only transports the data stream (compressed
and/or encrypted).
