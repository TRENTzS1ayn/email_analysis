I'm not an expert in this area, but I'd speculate that the suggestion of
introducing a new URL scheme and a new port number, comes from
considerations of firewalls and security. If one is implementing a policy
of "deny-everything-not-explicitly-allowed", it might be regarded as a
"feature" that IPP would not go thru existing firewalls or proxies until
they were reconfigured.

I guess the reasonableness of this condition depends on the intended market
for IPP, and the default security policy it should be expected to have.

I'd argue that a new URL scheme is a reasonable way to introduce a
different default port; but again the price is that a lot of existing web
clients will give you dumb looks if handed a new URL scheme. But this may
not matter if HTTP is just seen as a transport for IPP.
