I just want to be clear on what I am trying to say:- 

Firewalls are a completely legitimate and valuable tool in the Internet and
I think that issues associtaed with IPP and its penetration or otherwise
through them are extremely important. Having said that I think that the
proxy issue is the more important one because:-

a) This is how most businesses users access the Internet 
b) They invert the firewall model (a firewall blocks, a proxy enables)

If we use a mechanism not carried by the current proxy installed base then
the majority of business users will not be able to use IPP to talk to
'printers' on the Internet. This would be a big change. I do not place a
value judement on this - I merely point out the enormity of the change that
would occur.

I should point out that at one of the first IPP meeting attended by MS we
pointed out that using HTTP primarily as a means of 'stealthing' through
firewalls was totally bogus and this continues to be our position. The PWG
came to an uneasy agreement that the 'firewall issue' was no longer open for
debate since the group divided in two on it and would not be reconciled.
