There is rather more direct prior art here than that being alluded to-
more specifically the HTTP over SCP work performed by myself and Andy
Norman of Hewlett Packard in which was presented a long time before the
filing date (even at W3 Boston on two stages simultaneously :-)

TO make matters worse, the claimed inventors are from IBM RTP. I'm going
to try and find out what they're actually claiming.
