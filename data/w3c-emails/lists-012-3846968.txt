I won't attempt to inject an opinion into the debate over whether there
is "prior art" that might invalidate this patent (#5,754,774).  (I will
point out that people who know nothing about patent law are often
surprised by what is or is not a valid patent.)

But because it's usually pretty difficult to figure out what a patent
is really describing (especially one with 129 claims!), I thought it
might help to point out that several of the authors of this patent
have already published a readable and fairly complete paper:

Barron C. Housel and David B. Lindquist
"WebExpress: A System for Optimizing Web
Browsing in a Wireless Environment"
Proc. 2nd Annual Intl. Conf. on Mobile Computing and
Networking
ACM, New York, November 1996, 108-116

(from which one can infer that they probably came up with
the invention somewhat before the filing date on the patent).

As far as I know, this is the first publication to describe
the idea of "delta encoding" for HTTP (although I don't think
they used this term).

There have been several related documents published by others,
including myself:

Our SIGCOMM '97 paper has some discussion of the related work in
this area.
