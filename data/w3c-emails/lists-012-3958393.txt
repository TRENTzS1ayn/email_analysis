Section 8.1.1 may come across as slightly biaised, because it lists only 
advantages of persistent connections. In practice, these are balanced by 
drawbacks. For instance, if the timeout value of persistent connections is 
larger than the TCP connection timeout, denial-of-service attacks are more 
effective: by using up all possible connections, a malicious user can 
prevent access to a targeted server for a longer period of time. Perhaps a 
quick mention of this issue would make sense in section 8.1.4 (Practical 
Considerations)?
