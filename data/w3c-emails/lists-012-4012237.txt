Presumably, the timeout of persistent connections will be longer than the 
TCP connection timeout (that is, the recommended time to maintain TCP 
TIME_WAIT state, generally 4 minutes). So even though the technique used 
for the attack is the same, the effect will be amplified in the case of 
persistent connections with long timeouts.

Agreed.
