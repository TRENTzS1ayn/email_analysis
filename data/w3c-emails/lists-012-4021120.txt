No, actually, most of the benefit from persistent connections appears
to be in the first 30 seconds to a minute...


I don't think many busy servers will likely keep that long a timeout,
even with persistent connections.  Mogul's research showed that most
the value for "click ahead" occurs in the first few minutes, so a reasonable
timeout for a busy server (one which will likely have to time out connections
at all) is likely shorter than the TCP TIME_WAIT state.

As I said, the attack is the same, and the effect is the same...
