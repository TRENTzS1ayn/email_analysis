     May I ask for a feature in the next version HTTP 1.1
     
     I have read the HTTP 1.1 spec and searched for this and couldn't find 
     a solution.
     
     The closest thing that I found was
     
     Content-Location: URI 
     
     This is what I would like:
     
     Content-Name: URI
     
     The Content-Name would formally name the data, this would give the 
     browser a name to save a file under when the user is prompted in the 
     browser's save dialog box.
     
     Reason for the request: I have a CGI generating a Microsoft Excel 
     Spread sheet dynamically from a database.  The user get's back a 
     Content-type: application/x-xls that it may or may not understand.  
     The user is asked to open or save the data. Currently there doesn't 
     appear to be an HTTP way of setting the name of the data to save to 
     the local machine.
     
     I thought that the browser companies may have added extension-header's 
     as the spec suggests, but I was not that lucky.
     
     
     Thanks,
