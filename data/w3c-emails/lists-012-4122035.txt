This is another plea for implementation reports and/or updates to existing
implementation reports, so we can get these specifications to draft standard.

If we don't have at least 2 interoperable implementations of each feature 
by, say, the August IETF meeting, we'll have to strongly consider dropping 
those features from the protocol. This is required by IETF rules for draft 
standard. Note we need 2 interoperable implementations of each feature; 
there is no requirement that these implementations be shipped as product 
at the time of reporting, or for that matter, ever.  The point of the 
requirement is to show that the specification can be independently 
implemented and that the protocol as specified works.

We've asked for time at the IETF meeting to discuss any such cases where 
we don't meet IETF requirements.  There aren't many more features that 
need implementation and testing, though Digest authentication is more 
of a problem than the base specification.  

Data on all reported implementations can be found at:
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Forum/Reports/ ; the report is
resonably up to date (there is one report I haven't added yet).

Most reports are public; in general, you should be able to find
someone to test features against given the data available on that
page.

Please let me know of any new implementations, or any features that
you've tested since your report (I'm willing to update an existing report
for new features, rather than require you to fill out the very long form
yet again to report a few changes to the status of tested features).

Thanks again to all who have contributed...
