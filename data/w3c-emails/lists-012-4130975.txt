If someone wants to remind me where the latest digest auth spec lives,
I'll have a crack at bringing Apache's digest auth up to speed (if it
isn't already - it's not clear to me from the report whether it is, but
I could've sworn there were some changes since it was last touched).

If there's anything else critical Apache can help with, let me know what
and I'll see what I can do.

Cheers,

Ben.
