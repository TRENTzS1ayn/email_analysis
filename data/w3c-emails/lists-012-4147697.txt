attached mail follows:
In the definition of "#rule", draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-03 states:
    
  This makes the usual form of lists very easy; a rule such as
  "( *LWS element *( *LWS "," *LWS element )) " can be shown as
  "1#element".
    
I'm confused by the presence of the outer set of parentheses in the
former but not the latter rule.  Wouldn't it be clearer to rewrite it as
"( 1#element )"?

Yes, or just use single-quote marks on the outside.
