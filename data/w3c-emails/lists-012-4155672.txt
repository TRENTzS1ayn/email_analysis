Dear Members of the IESG,

An added comment to my previous post, is that I consider that Keith Moore 
has indeed recently given the IPP WG more clear guidance on these issues.

However, the IPP WG has spent several months of sometimes almost religious 
discussions on these subjects (shared with the HTTP WG), so if the IESG 
could come up with some general guidelines for these kind of issues, it 
might save other WGs considerable time and effort in the future.
