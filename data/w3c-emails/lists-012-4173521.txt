Hi Jim,
I tried sending the attached email to the 'http-wg@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com' as
suggested in the HTTP/1.1 Internet-Draft, but it came back with a
'connection timed out' error. Since you are one of the primary authors for
this draft, I thought I could forward it to you.
Thanks,

Subject:  A suggestion for correction on HTTP/1.1 draft

While browsing through your HTTP Internet-Draft "
draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-03", I came across a minor anomaly.

The first paragraph under section "9.5 POST' starts like this:
"The POST method is used to request that the destination server accept the
entity ........"

This is the only place in the whole document that the phrase "destination
server" is used, while every where else the phrase "origin server" is used
to represent "The server on which a given resource resides or is to be
created."(definition from the terminology).
Within the same section(9.5),  a few paragraphs later, a new paragraph
starts like this:
"If a resource has been created on the origin server, ........"  which
implies that we are referring to the same server in the same context by two
different names (I called it an anomaly since 'origin' and 'destination'
have conflicting meanings).

In the context of POST, the phrase "destination server" makes more sense,
but I was wondering for the sake of consistency, we should either change it
to "origin server", or document the new phrase "destination server" in the
terminology section as something that makes sense only under "POST" action.

Overall, this Internet-Draft is excellent and outstanding because it has
been kept very simple and easy to understand, yet  providing a complete
specification. Great work!

Thanks,
