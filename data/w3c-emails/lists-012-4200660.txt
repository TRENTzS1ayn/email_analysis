And for some reason, my mail program refuses to quote attachments ...
grrr.

Anyway, I would note that destination server would be a good english
term for PUT as well. 

But I think that the phrase origin server has a meaning in the
specification beyond direction of the transaction data and is used
in contrast to proxies, etc.  Understood to be one end-point of the
logical transaction where the response originates. Hence I'd vote for
removing destination server and using origin server.
