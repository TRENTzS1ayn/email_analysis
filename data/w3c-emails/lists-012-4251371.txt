If my proxy, while processing a chunked response, exceeds the amount of data I
am willing to buffer, does anything break by me throwing away the contents of
the trailer?  I think, from previous discussion, that the answer should be
"no", but I am concerned about the effects of discarding "Authentication-Info"
and "Content-MD5".

Thank You,
