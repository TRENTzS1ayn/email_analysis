    place, in a chunked trailer, a header field that it did not want to
    risk loss of.
    
Your premise is wrong.  Section 13.5.1 (End-to-end and Hop-by-hop
Headers) defines:

       End-to-end headers, which must be transmitted to the ultimate
       recipient of a request or response.

(that "must" should be a MUST; see issue-list MMS_AUDIT_ITEM_110).
and says:

All other headers defined by HTTP/1.1 are end-to-end headers.

after a short list of specifically hop-by-hop headers.  Thus, proxies
MUST forward all but a specific and small set of headers.

There is no exception here for header fields carried in the
trailer of a chunked encoding; this encoding is hop-by-hop
and so one clearly can't use it as an excuse to delete a header
that would otherwise have to be sent end-to-end.
