Needless to say I disagree with the consensus of the phone
conference.  I can't find any language about this matter in 1945 or
2068, so please point me to it.  Also, the requirement has no teeth
anyway because a system is always free to act as a tunnel, not as a
cache, for certain requests.  

I could change my mind about this issue if someone would provide some
evidence that current practice actually conforms to the proposed new
requirment.  As far as I know currently deployed systems do not, and
the new requirement would only shorten the useful lifetime of the
protocol.

Koen.
