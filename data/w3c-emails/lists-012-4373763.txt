(resend to http-wg%cuckoo.hpl.hp.com@hplb.hpl.hp.com)

It looks as if there are enough items to discuss that I requested
a working group meeting at the upcoming IETF meeting in Chicago.
We're scheduled for

Monday, August 24 at 1930-2200
     other groups scheduled at that time: usefor, policy-BOF, pktway, entmib

The agenda will focus on review of the implementation reports, and
any area director or IESG comments.

It is my hope that 
 - final versions of both drafts will be submitted
 - all of the changes since the last 'last call' will have been discussed
   in the working group in sufficient detail that an additional working
   group last call will not be necessary
 - we will have forwarded the documents to the area director(s) for review
 - Those IESG members who have potential concerns about progressing HTTP/1.1
   to Draft Standard will attend and express those concerns.

Details about IETF meetings are at http://www.ietf.org.
