But those are buggy even with respect to 2068; it's one thing for us to aim
for compatibility with software that conformed to the Proposed Standard, but
to maintain compatibility with something that was broken with respect to
them can be too difficult a standard to meet.

It is only a preference, and does not mandate anything - a browser could
send basic when it might have sent digest; since the server cannot tell what
its complete capabilities are, it makes no difference.  Either basic is
acceptable or not.  Eventually, I hope that digest will be supported well
enough in browsers that I can recommend to my customers that they turn off
support for basic, but we've a long way to go...

That only makes the situation worse by increasing the number of browsers
that don't understand what you are doing.
