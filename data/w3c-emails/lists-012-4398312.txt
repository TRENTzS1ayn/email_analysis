(I'm going through the Authentication issue list
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Issues/ 
seeing if there are actually proposed resolutions of the open issues):

I suggest that this be the correct interpretation, that the null
string is used for values for omitted attributes in the calculation.

# If (to use cnonce as the example) cnonce was omitted, should

I propose that either MAY be allowed, since they are equivalent.
