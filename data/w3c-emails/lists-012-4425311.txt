In the process of changing the SHOULD to a MAY, and the cleanup of the 
first sentence, I realized that most of the section needs rewrite to properly 
cover pipelining of a sequence of requests; as written, it only talked 
about individual requests.  Here's my rewrite for sanity's sake.

Let me know if anyone sees a problem.

Old:
8.2.3 Automatic Retrying of Requests

If a user agent sees the transport connection close before it receives 
a final response to its request, if the request method is idempotent (see 
section 9.1.2), the user agent SHOULD retry the request without user 
interaction. If the request method is not idempotent, the user agent SHOULD 
NOT retry the request without user confirmation. (Confirmation by user-agent 
software with semantic understanding of the application MAY substitute 
for user confirmation.)

New:
8.2.3 Automatic Retrying of Requests

If a user agent sees the transport connection close before it receives 
all of the final response to its request or sequence of requests, if the 
requests or sequence are idempotent (see section 9.1.2), the user agent 
MAY retry the request or sequence without user interaction. If the request 
method or sequence is not idempotent, the user agent SHOULD NOT retry 
the request without user confirmation. (Confirmation by user-agent software 
with semantic understanding of the application MAY substitute for user 
confirmation.)
