 ISSUE: TE-IDENTITY. Action on Henrik: Add OPTIONAL for how the server
handle it. That is, it is optional for the server to look at it but if it
does then it SHOULD send 406 if it can't respond in the transfer encoding.
We shouldn't disallow identity; q=0.

In section 14.39

Change

The TE request-header field is similar to Accept-Encoding, but restricts
the transfer-codings (section 3.6) that are acceptable in the response.

to

The TE request-header field is similar to Accept-Encoding, but indicates
the transfer-codings (section 3.6) that are preferred in the response. The
client is not guaranteed that the server recognizes the information in a TE
request header field.
