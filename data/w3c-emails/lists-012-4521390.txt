After further discussions with Jim, we propose the following resolution:

Clarify the existing possibility of including an etag in a 201 response and
don't do anything about potential other metainformation as this is a
problem in many other places as well. Basically, in HTTP it's hard to know
what is metainformation and what is transaction information.

Action: Add this clarification to section 10.2.2:

A 201 response MAY contain an Etag response header field
indicating the current value of the entity tag for the
created requested variant, see [14.19].

Any objections or comments?

Henrik
