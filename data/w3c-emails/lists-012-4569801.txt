... but have you tested what happens with old servers (and CGI programs) if
you send them new methods?  At least in the case of CGIs they often ignore
the method - in short, you have exactly the same situation faced by Expect,
but more complex.  Don't get me wrong - I like the Mandatory mechanism
because it is so much more descriptive, but I don't think that it is any
better from a backward compatibility point of view (and cannot be made any
better).
