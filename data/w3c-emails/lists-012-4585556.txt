Abstract

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol
for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a
generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks, such as
name servers and distributed object management systems, through
extension of its request methods. A feature of HTTP is the typing and
negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built
independently of the data being transferred.

HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative
since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as
"HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC2068 [33].

At the time of submission, there were no remaining outstanding issues
after a working group last call.  The HTTP/1.1 issues list can be found
at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Issues/.  Linked from this page are
also Postscript and Microsoft Word versions (with versions with change
bars) of this document which are easier to review than this text
document.
