If at first you don't succeed, try try again...  Actually, the problem
is a missing "and" connecting the phrases.

Here's take two:

8.2.3 Automatic Retrying of Requests

If a user agent sees the transport connection close before it receives 
all of the final response to its request or sequence of requests, and 
if the requests or sequence are idempotent (see section 9.1.2), the user 
agent MAY retry the request or sequence without user interaction. If the 
request method or sequence is not idempotent, the user agent SHOULD NOT 
retry the request without user confirmation. (Confirmation by user-agent 
software with semantic understanding of the application MAY substitute 
for user confirmation.)
