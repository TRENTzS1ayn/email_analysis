I agree that the token "close" is defined clearly.

You missed my point: in RFC 2068, section 19.7.1 states that Keep-Alive 
and Persist are connection-token's. Here's the original text:

   When it connects to an origin server, an HTTP client MAY send the
   Keep-Alive connection-token in addition to the Persist connection-
   token:

          Connection: Keep-Alive

I disagree: I don't think different implementations should be allowed to 
use their own proprietary tokens. Allowing this would result in 
interoperability issues.
