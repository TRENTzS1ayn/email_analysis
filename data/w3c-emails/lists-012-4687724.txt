In 4.8 we have:

User agents should consider measures such as presenting a visual
indication at the time of the credentials request of what authentication
scheme is to be used, or remembering the strongest authentication scheme
ever requested by a server and produce a warning message before using a
weaker one.  It might also be a good idea for the user agent to be
configured to demand Digest authentication in general, or from specific
sites.

The standard does not say anything now about what criteria may be used by
the server to choose the offered schemes, and to my way of thinking that
allows for any criteria at all, including UA identity (personally, keeping
up with what browsers send for identity is way too much trouble for me).

Again, I don't think that there is anything in the spec that forbids such a
thing, and it is therefor allowed (and, I think, is a good idea).
