I think I made similar observations as far back as when Digest was
"SimpleMD5".

Expressing preferences with "least-preferred-first" does seem to be an
elegant solution.  Unfortunately, we remain at the mercy of the browser
implementation.  We (webmasters) are relying on the user agent to "do
the right thing" and choose the more secure authentication method.  If
Digest Auth is a required part of HTTP/1.1 (clients), then it's possible
to test whether the client complies (by sending Basic and Digest
challenges and looking for the Digest response).  In that case I would
support "least-preferred-first".
