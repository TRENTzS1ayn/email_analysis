The CGI spec (either the existing 1.1 spec or the new 1.2) just makes the
method available to the program - if the program doesn't look, it doesn't. 
Some of the CGI libraries make this easy to do as well - parameters are
parsed by the library from a GET query string or a POST body transparently,
for example.  I've tried bouncing TRACE and OPTIONS requests off various
URLs that were obviously scripts and many respond as though the request were
a GET. 

I just took a (very) quick peek at the Apache documentation for adding
modules, and found a similar API - the method is passed by the server to the
module, so the core server itself doesn't even appear to have a way to know
what methods might be handled or not.  Pretty good design if you are
optimizing for flexibility.
