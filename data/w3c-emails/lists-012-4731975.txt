Yes.  Actually, I think we had the same discussion about a year ago,
resulting in a substantial change to the definition of the Etag field
from what it meant for RFC 2068.  I am still queesy about that change,
but it does support the usage in 201 that Henrik suggests.

The contrarian in me finds it necessary to point out that this is
just one of many protocol changes that require a version number bump
to HTTP/1.2.  It is no longer the same protocol, and this is precisely
why we have that second number.

Yep.  A more appropriate definition is to include the new properties
of the resource in the body of the response, either as a multipart or
in XML.  But that would require a lot more definition of the response
format, which is something only WebDAV has done so far.
