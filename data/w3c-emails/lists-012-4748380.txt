I think that crosses the line from being a protocol spec to being a
functional spec for a server, which it should not try to be.  There are few
cases where we have put in requirements outside the wire protocol, but they
are mostly governing caching to preserve correctness, or are related to the
security behaviours.  

rom the point of view of this spec, "the server" is whatever is generating
the response to a request - it encompasses the CGI or *API program, and
those components are as much bound by its requirements as any other part. 
Yes, I understand the real world implications of this - and I believe that
those working on a new CGI spec do too.
