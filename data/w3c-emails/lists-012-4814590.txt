OK, then lets stop worrying about the fact that servers invoke brain dead
cgi programs. In any case, the requirement I suggested is there to insure
correct behavior. I tried to use very general language as to the
requirement that base servers take responsibility for what they deliver
on the wire.

It is easy enough to expect the base server to enforce protocol when 
invoking API programs.  The new CGI spec. is only intended to be an
informational RFC. Whether or not a server implements the new CGI
specification, it must ensure that what it returns as an HTTP/1.1
response is infact a HTTP/1.1 response.
