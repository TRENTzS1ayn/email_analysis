And the spec does that now - it does not make any special allowance for
responses that originate with some other component or gatewayed system - if
the response is labelled HTTP/1.1 then the spec makes certain requirements
of it.  What more is needed than that?  When we say MUST, we don't need to
then provide a list of circumstances under which the MUST still applies -
unless we allow for exceptions, there are none.
