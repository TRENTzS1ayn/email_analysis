I don't understand -- the spec says that if qop=auth or auth-int,
   request-digest  = <"> < KD ( H(A1),     unq(nonce-value) 
                                       ":" nc-value 
                                       ":" unq(cnonce-value) 
                                       ":" unq(qop-value) 
                                       ":" H(A2)
                               ) <">
so nc-value is used, and is needed in the Auth-info header.

So, I did the edits that Ron suggested.
