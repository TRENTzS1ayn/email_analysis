I agree the "protection space" for Digest needed to be specified.  I
have a problem with the proposed words above:

I assume "5.1.2 of [2]" refers to the HTTP/1.1 spec.  The words
"canonical root URL" do not appear there, and I am therefore unsure what
was meant.  Since all URLs on a server are implicitly descended from "/"
(no?), wouldn't it be easier just to say that relative URLs are taken to
be relative to "/"?
