I know what Paul is trying to say, and I agree that it would be a good
thing. My question is, is "strongest" unambiguous? Does it just mean
"maximum key length"?

I'm not trying to be pedantic - this is an important part of protecting
against "drop your shields" man-in-the-middle attacks, and I'd like to see
the spec be pretty precise about a user's exposure to server selection of a
"weaker" authentication scheme when a stronger scheme could be used. But I
can't define "weak" and "strong" either!
