This is a MUST on the client in order for it to ensure its own security, not
in order to interoperate. It imposes no burden on servers.

In order to be safe, it is indeed true that the client should never send the
same value, even to different servers. If a server can predict what the
client will send, then we're back in chosen-plaintext-attack land.

I concur with the first part.  Is the second part a requirement on the
client, to avoid sending; on the server, to reject if it sees a
duplicate; or both?  I oppose a MUST requirement on the server to reject
a set of credentials that includes a cnonce value that it had seen
before.

BTW, if this is a requirement on the client, is this a prohibition
against sending the same cnonce value to different servers?
