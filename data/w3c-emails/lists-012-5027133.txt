Are we talking about two different things?  I'm not concerned with
absolute URLs.  For them the protected set of URLs is obvious.

Here's the wording at issue (Sect. 3.2.1):
If a URI is relative, it is relative to [the] canonical root URL of the
server being accessed.

My notion of a relative URL is one that does not begin with '/'.  For
such a URL, wouldn't it make sense to give them an implicit '/' prefix?
