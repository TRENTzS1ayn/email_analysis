Maybe. See next comment.

  I'm not concerned with

I think of two kinds of "relative URLs"  -- "dir/foo.html" and
"/dir/foo.html". The latter is relative to (e.g.) http://www.xxx.com, the
former to the URL of page in which it appears (typically). I don't think the
former belong in a domain list.

How about I say that URI in "domain=URI..." must be an "http_UTL" or
"abs_path" as defined in section 3.2.2 of the HTTP/1.1 spec? 
The former is the usual "http://www.xxx.com:port/dir/foo.html" type; the
latter is "/dir/foo.html".
