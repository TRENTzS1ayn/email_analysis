It's odd that it isn't relative to the requested resource.  Has someone
checked the implementations to see what is normally returned?

In any case, "http_URL" is too restrictive.  That should be "absoluteURI",
since it would allow for the use of HTTP with different schemes
(think http, https, ipp, ...).
