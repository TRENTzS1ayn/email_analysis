The editorial policy of using a note to explain non-normative design
decisions comes from the MIME specs (or at least that's where I got
it from).  Anything that is normative should just be changed to a
non-note.

When I originally wrote "common form" it wasn't associated with a
requirement -- it was implementation advice.  "common form" means
just that -- whatever is commonly used by other applications at the
time of implementation, which might have changed over time.

If you want to spell it out, I'd say the current common form is

   fieldname: fieldvalue

with no extra space or line continuation folding.
