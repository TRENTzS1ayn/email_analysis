Some comments on Paul Bennet's comments:
[It's reassuring to come upon someone else who can be as nit-picky as I
am. :-)]

I was about to say, vigorously, "no", but now I think I'm just confused
about just what the point is of that paragraph.  The paragraph says:

       Request-URI    = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path
[...]
In requests that they forward, transparent proxies MUST NOT rewrite the
"abs_path" part of a Request-URI in any way except as noted above to
replace a null abs_path with "*", no matter what the proxy does in its
internal implementation.

If "abs_path" in the paragraph refers to the non-terminal in the
Request-URI production, then I have to ask, how can it be null in the
first place?  When is Request-URI null?  OTOH, if we're talking about
the "abs_path" that's part of the "absoluteURI", then I might be
inclined to agree with Paul.

That's because we've discussed the possibility that, some time in the
future, it might make sense to include an entity-body for them.
