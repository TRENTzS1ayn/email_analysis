Sorry for the delay --- I've been away a few days.

I don't know whether my server could be considered "deployed", but
here's what it does.  For *any* digest response to qop=auth-int, the
server *always* sends a trailer (and chunked encoding) that contains
Authentication-Info.  The server ignores the TE header.  (You may recall
I argued (issue h2, TE-IDENTITY) that "chunked" should always be
allowed.  This support of Digest auth-int is why.)
