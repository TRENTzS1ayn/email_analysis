     digest-challenge  = 1#( realm | [ domain ] | nonce |
                         [ opaque ] |[ stale ] | [ algorithm ] |
                         [ qop-options ] | [auth-param] )

I'm just a tad nervous that an implementor might assume that "realm"
will be the first auth-param in a digest-challenge, based on

- analogy to Basic (which has only one auth-param)
- the fact that "realm" is listed first in the syntax

Is it worth adding a note that the syntax for digest-challenge allows
the auth-param's to appear in any order?  There other places in this
spec. where we say, in effect, "don't be stupid", so there is precedent.
