Web Caching and Replication BOF (webrepl)
  Thursday, August 27 at 1530-1730
Chair: Patrik Faltstrom  <paf@swip.net>

DESCRIPTION: Ideas on how to replicate contents of webservers (including 
caches) have been floating around in the web community. Replication includes 
several steps -- from prefetching information (pushing or polling), to 
announcement of the availability of new content (again pushing or polling). 
This gets even more complicated when starting to use hierarichal caches.

It is also the case that in this area, the community don't want proprietary
protocols, as one cache should be able to communicate with another one --
even though it is developed by a different vendor.

This BOF is ment to check the interest in the community on this matter, and
see of there is a possibility to try to focus some work on some few items,
that have to be standardized.
