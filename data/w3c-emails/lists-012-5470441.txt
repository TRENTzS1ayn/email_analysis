After a bit of a rush-job, I've changed my test server to support the
http-authentication-02 version of Digest.  Specifically, the calculation
of Authentication-Info is different, and is incompatible with the
previous draft and previous version of my server.

I haven't tested this version of the server as much as I would like, but
I wanted to make it available prior to my going on vacation.
