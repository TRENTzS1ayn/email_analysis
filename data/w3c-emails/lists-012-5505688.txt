Has anyone ever considered that it would be useful to be able
to add an optionnal 'offset' parameter to the GET request ?

This would, for example, allow the implentation of very simple
video and audio servers using just the http protocol (i.e.
the media server would just be the http server).

Currently the only feature missing to do that is the inability to
'seek' in an object (i.e. requesting the object starting at
an offset which is not always 0).

By the way, the same comments applies to the FTP protocol, too.

If you have comments on that, please send Cc to me
(tristan@mpegtv.com).

Thanks.
