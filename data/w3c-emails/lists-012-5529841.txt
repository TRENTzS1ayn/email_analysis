There is no provision in HTTP to do this.  However, some servers
have the built-in capability and you could do it using a CGI script
with any server.

An early version of the the byterange specification did not use
a header and put the range request in the URL.  There are pros
and cons for URL vs. header.  In the end it was deemed that a
header was best.  However, one of the cons is that you loose
a lot of functionality by not allowing a range specification
in the URL.  Of course any server is free to do it in a non-standard
way and, as mentioned above it can be done with CGI.
