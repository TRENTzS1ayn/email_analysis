How about this:

This is the preceding paragraph (for context):

A common use of Basic authentication is for identification purposes --
requiring the user to provide a user name and password as a means of
identification, for example, for purposes of gathering accurate usage
statistics on a server. When used in this way it is tempting to think that
there is no danger in its use if illicit access to the protected documents
is not a major concern. This is only correct if the server issues both user
name and password to the users and in particular does not allow the user to
choose his or her own password. The danger arises because naive users
frequently reuse a single password to avoid the task of maintaining multiple
passwords.

This is the proposed replacement for the paragraph in question:

If a server permits users to select their own passwords, then the threat is
not only illicit access to documents on the server but also illicit access
to any other resources on other systems that the user protects with the same
password. Furthermore, in the server's password database, many of the
passwords may also be users' passwords for other sites. The owner or
administrator of such a system could conceivably incur liability if this
information is not maintained in a secure fashion.
