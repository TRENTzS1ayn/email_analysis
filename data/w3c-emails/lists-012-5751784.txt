Just a (what else?) nit:  the word "illicit" makes me uncomfortable.
How about "unauthorized"?

I'm also inclined to agree with Scott's remarks about "liability".
Perhaps the last sentence should read:

    The owner or administrator of such a system could therefore expose
    all users of the system to the risk of unauthorized access of all
    those accounts if this information is not maintained in a secure
    fashion.
