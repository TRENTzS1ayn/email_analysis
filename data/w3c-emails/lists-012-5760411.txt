Sure will.  It will have a lot fewer mistakes courtesy of your read.

There were some problems generating the plaintext; it is correct in the
postscript.  I'll make sure the next draft's text is cleaner.

I've sent this to Roy Fielding and Dave Kristol to look at...  I don't
breath BNF the way they do.

No, and we're not sure that the spec should do so.  Not clear what
current implementations actually do, either.

Interesting question; but it had to be defined carefully in 300 Multiple
Choices to allow a future content negotiation standard, and I'm not sure
it needs to be so well defined here.

No, it can be any URI, per the URI spec.  This is necessary to allow
gatewaying into other URI schemes.

added comment

"The User-Agent header field (section 14.43) can sometimes be used to 
determine that a specific client has a particular security hole which 
might be exploited. Unfortunately, this same information is often used 
for other valuable purposes for which HTTP currently has no better 
mechanism. "

Made minor clarifications here.  Your suggestion doesn't work,
as it gets cumbersome.  I added "MUST level", "SHOULD level" requirements
instead to clarify this.

The Word and Postscript versions should be fine in this area; I'll try 
 to make sure the text index is clean in the next version. But Word has 
 driven me to distraction with a bug I keep running into that causes it 
 to crash.
