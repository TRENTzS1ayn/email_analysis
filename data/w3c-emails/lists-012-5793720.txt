I added:
"The response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of resource 
characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can 
choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by the 
media type given in the Content-Type header field. "

To clarify this issue.

Agreed.

300 is a redirect, which implies the client isn't done yet.  I guess the
text from the second para. of 300 is okay without the last two sentences
having to do with automatic redirection.
