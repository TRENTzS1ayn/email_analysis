How should the user agent populate the referrer field when issuing a
request after receiving a 3xx redirect response?  Is the original
referer maintained or is it now the URI that resulted in the redirect
response?  There is no discussion of this scenario in the referer or
redirect sections of the draft.

Reason for the question:
Ad Servers sometimes delegate remnant ad impression inventory to
"fire-sale" ad networks using re-direct.  Usually an ad server will use
the referer field to determine on what page the ad will be appear.
