I think that the language "allows the client to specify [...] the
address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was obtained"
in the draft clearly implies that it should be the URI that gave the
3xx response.  I would not be surprised however to see some 1.0 agents
do it the other way around.

Using referer in this case is a dangerous technique for the second ad
server.  It definitely breaks with browsers that do not send referer
at all.  It is better to have a setup in which the first ad server
encodes the necessary information in the request URI for the second ad
server.
