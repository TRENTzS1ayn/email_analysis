A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.
This draft is a work item of the HyperText Transfer Protocol Working Group 
of the IETF.

Title: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1
Author(s): R. Fielding, J. Gettys, J. Mogul, H. Frystyk,
                          L. Masinter, P. Leach, T. Berners-Lee
Filename: draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-05.txt
Pages: 167
Date: 11-Sep-98

   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
   protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
   systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for
   many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and
   distributed object management systems, through extension of its
   request methods, error codes and headers [47]. A feature of HTTP is
   the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems
   to be built independently of the data being transferred.
 
   HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information
   initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol
   referred to as 'HTTP/1.1', and is an update to RFC 2068 [33].
 
   At the time of submission, there were no known outstanding issues
   with this document. The HTTP/1.1 issues list can be found
   at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Issues/.  Linked from this page are
   also Postscript and Microsoft Word versions (with versions with change
   bars) of this document which are easier to review than this text
   document.

Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.

Send a message to:mailserv@ietf.org.  In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-05.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
