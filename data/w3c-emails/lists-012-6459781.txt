I initially wrote the Content-Disposition section, so let me add some
details here.

The Content-Disposition section documents *only* what some popular
current web browsers do.  I was careful not to specify anything beyond
what I could test to heve been implemented.  The section does not
contain any actual requirements for HTTP/1.1 software.  It was added
to answer a frequently asked question.

If we had set out to specify an improved version of
Content-Disposition, something like your proposal would have been in
the specification.  But we did not set out to specify any improvement,
reasoning that others (e.g. the MIME community) could to this if
needed.

That being said, *if* another revision of the 1.1 spec is necessary,
it would be nice to add a pointer to RFC 2183, which updates RFC 1806.

Koen.
