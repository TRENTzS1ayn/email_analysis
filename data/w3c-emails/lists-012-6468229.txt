Try again....

For as long as I can remember, HTTP authentication has had this production
in its grammar:

 challenge   = auth-scheme 1*SP 1#auth-param

When the auth stuff was extracted and merged with the Digest spec, this was
in the Digest section:

     challenge        =  "Digest" digest-challenge

I.e., between the "Digest" and "digest-challenge", instead of there being
1*SP there is "implied *LWS" (see section 2.1 of the HTTP/1.1 spec).

Which is right? Does anyone depend on it being SP instead of LWS?
