Byte ranges (and indeed line ranges) in URLs have been implemented
in the WN server since long before the Range: header.  They are
extremely useful, but are never entered by the user.

As I said this has nothing to do with user entered URLs.  The 
functionality which is missing is the ability to make a link to
a subset of a document.  It can, of course, be done with CGIs,
but at great cost in complexity and efficiency.  

Examples:
It is useful to be able to create links on server A to parts of 
documents on server B without server B having CGIs or a database.
It is useful to create a page of customized links to parts of
a single document (e.g. a mail archive) based on a query.

There are more.

On the other hand I agree that adding extra complexity to the
URL syntax has serious drawbacks also.  At present much of the
URL is opaque and a server can do with it what it wants.  This
is a good thing and allows, for example, WN to implement byte
and line ranges in the URL with its own syntax (which users
never enter because they don't know).

The way to have our cake and eat it too is an extension to the HTML
syntax which allows one to create a link to a URL *and* specify that a
Range header be sent with the request.

Just for your information the WN syntax is 
      http://host/dir/file;bytes=0,500 or
      http://host/dir/file;lines=20,50
