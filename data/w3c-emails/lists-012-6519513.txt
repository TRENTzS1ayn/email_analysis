> Apache does not use HTTP-NG.

You might be interested to learn that we're using a modified version of Apache
in our HTTP-NG testbed.  But we haven't yet got as good an integration as we'd
like, and there are not yet any browsers that speak HTTP-NG, so this is just
FYI, not anything we can recommend to users right now.
