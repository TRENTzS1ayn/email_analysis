Content-Dispostion was implemented in Web browsers BEFORE it was added
to the HTTP/1.1 spec, to document existing practice.  It is indeed
quite useful, when people are downloading code, to be able to provide
a file name for "save as" to work.

Dunno how widespread it was among MIME implementations at the time.
