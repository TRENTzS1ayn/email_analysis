That would invalidate almost all client implementations of HTTP.
There is no technical reason to define the encoding other than to
say it is a shared understanding between client and server that
is outside the capacity of the protocol to determine, and that
interoperability problems may occur if non-US-ASCII characters
are used.  Forbidding it just makes the specification worthless.

Changing this in existing HTTP systems is not an option.  The only way
to add a specific encoding to the username/password exchange is to
define a new authentication method that requires it from the start.
