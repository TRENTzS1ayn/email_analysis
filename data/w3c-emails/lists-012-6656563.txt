try adding a slash '/' after ~wendy..
like: http://server/~wendy/
the browser probably doesnt realize that it is within
a subdirectory.  This can be cause by the server not
redirecting the original URL to a slash terminated
on or to the actual file..
Redirect http://server/~wendy to:
either
1) http://server/~wendy/
2) http://server/~wendy/index.html
