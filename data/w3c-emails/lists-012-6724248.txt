Everything is off of the implementation reports page:
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Forum/Reports/

Ronald's is a client implementation.

I don't think John Mallery has updated his implementation to the current
draft; he claimed to me he was going to start hacking on it a few minutes
ago to update it (probably the base HTTP protocol first, before digest).

Then again, John's been making such claims to me since before Chicago.
(don't hold your breath)...  His proxy implementation isn't as up to
date as his origin server (which is used at the White House, so sees
some serious traffic.

On the other hand, if you poke at him, so he sees there is more
interest, it is more likely to get done.
