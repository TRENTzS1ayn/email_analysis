The IESG has received a request from the HyperText Transfer Protocol
Working Group to consider publication of the following as Draft
Standards:

 o Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1
<draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-05.txt>

   This document replaces RFC2068, currently a Proposed Standard.


 o HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication 
<draft-ietf-http-authentication-03.txt> 

   This document replaces RFC2069, currently a Proposed Standard.


The IESG plans to make a decision in the next few weeks, and solicits
final comments on this action.  Please send any comments to the
iesg@ietf.org or ietf@ietf.org mailing lists by October 14, 1998.
