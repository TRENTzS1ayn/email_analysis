I've just put up a new developement snapshot of my client at
http://www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient/V0.4-dev/ . It's up to date with
respect to the current http and auth drafts.

For those who've never used it: the client itself is just a library, but
there is a simple test application at the above URL too.


  Cheers,

  Ronald
