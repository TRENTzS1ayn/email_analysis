Good point.  In fact, the UTF-8 spec itself is still proposed, so the HTTP
spec can't reference it normatively.

Fair enough.

How about we restrict user-ids and typed-in passwords to US-ASCII for now,
declare encoding of non-ASCII characters in those fields undefined but
explicitly forbid use of localized charsets (e.g., ISO-8859-1)?  Then we
can amend it to use UTF-8 later with a spec that progresses separately
on the standards track.
