Whenever something is retransmitted on the internet, users assume that
the retransmission results from a lost packet. Under the assumption
that all delays are a result of packet loss, a large file could never
be sent across the network in less then a day:->

This example makes the argument for HTTP 1.1, not for path MTU
discovery. I believe that a large piece of the problem seen in this
example is related to the queuing delay from the network to PC over
the 28k phone line. The observed problem is a result of limitation of
the the TCP congestion control algorithm.  This algorithm cannot deal
effectively with multiple concurrent streams from or to a single host,
for it is only connection oriented and not host oriented.

As a result each connection queues at least one packet to the slow
interface.  Then, while the packets are waiting to be sent serially
across the 28K connection, the TCP retransmit timer fires and the
packet is sent again. It is possible that reducing the size of the
packets by using only IP fragmentation instead of including the extra
TCP headers might have made getting 3 streams possible rather than
only 2. The observed phenomenon was certainly not a result of lost
packets.

This example underscores why
