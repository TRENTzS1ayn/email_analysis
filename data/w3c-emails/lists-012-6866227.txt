I got this from wget maintainer. As far as I know, proxies aren't
supposed to append anything to the requested resource.
However, I've been off-line for more than a year and I haven't
digested the most recent HTTP spec. So, could someone tell
me if this is legal?

What seems to happen is this: part way through the download, there is an
error,
eg timeout, and it seems that in addition MS proxy server sends a text
string that gets put
on the end of the downloaded file. Something like:
 "HTTP Proxy error: Connection timed out".

When wget retries, this error message gets left embedded in the
downloaded file.
So the final file looks like:

<-------Good Data--------><---HTTP Proxy error message----><-------Good
data---->

Hope this makes sense. If you'd like me to try and find out more
specific details
of what's going on, let me know.
