On the other hand, the proxy detected an error and attempted to report 
it.  The question to me would hinge on whether the proxy then did
a connection reset or normal close. 

I don't believe that HTTP is well architected for recovering 
partial transfers or in some cases even detecting incomplete transfers
except those initiated by the client. Without architected error recovery,
its all up to the implementation.
