I agree.  Consider the plight of an HTTP server running a gateway.
Suppose the gateway (CGI) produces some of its output but doesn't
finish in a reasonable amount of time.  How can the server report an
error once it has begun its response?  I suspect that's more or less
what happened to the MS proxy.
