I was wondering about this scenario:

User-agent issues a PUT request and transmits the entity to server.
Server accepts it and performs some minor modifications on the
entity, then stores it locally. Content type and/or length could
be changed and it would be nice if user-agen could be notified.
Content-* headers issued with the response apply to the message body
of the request and thus cannot be used.

I was looking at the webdav drafts, but couldn't find anything
there. Is there a document that covers this situation?
