As part of an evaluation of the impacts of HTTP 1.1 for my company's            
VM:Webgateway product, I've been working on locating and summarizing all        
the MUST/MAY/SHOULD requirements in the current level of the spec               
(draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-05). In the process, I've found a number          
of issues that I believe warrant consideration and possibly action.             
Some are just editorial, but some aren't.  In my opinion none of them           
should stand in the way of standards advancement.                               
                                                                                
I'm sending each issue as a separate note following this one, as an aid         
to folks like me who read mail by threads.
