In section 3.11 "Entity Tags", the statement                                    
                                                                                
   "A given entity tag value MAY be used for entities obtained by               
   requests on different URIs without implying anything about the               
   equivalence of those entities."                                              
                                                                                
confuses me to the point of being unable to parse it, let alone                 
summarize it.
