In section 4.1 "General Syntax", the statements                                 
                                                                                
   "In the interest of robustness, servers SHOULD ignore any empty              
   line(s) received where a Request-Line is expected."                          
                                                                                
and                                                                             
                                                                                
   "In other words, if the server is reading the protocol stream at             
   the beginning of a message and receives a CRLF first, it SHOULD              
   ignore the CRLF."                                                            
                                                                                
state the same requirement in different forms.  Unless they're needed           
for other reasons, I suggest either deleting one of them or changing one        
of the "SHOULD"s to "should".
