In section 4.2 "Message Headers", the statement                                 
                                                                                
   "Applications SHOULD follow "common form", where one is known or             
   indicated, when generating HTTP constructs, since there might                
   exist some implementations that fail to accept anything beyond the           
   common forms."                                                               
                                                                                
is so vague as to be impossible to measure, and should therefore not be         
normative and a requirement of compliance. I've brought this one up             
before, so if the general opinion goes against me I won't complain.
