In section 4.2 "Message Headers", the statement                                 
                                                                                
   "It MUST be possible to combine the multiple header fields into              
   one "field-name: field-value" pair, without changing the semantics           
   of the message, by appending each subsequent field-value to the              
   first, each separated by a comma."                                           
                                                                                
is a restatement of the preceding requirement,                                  
                                                                                
   "Multiple message-header fields with the same field-name MAY be              
   present in a message if and only if the entire field-value for               
   that header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e.,                
   #(values)]."                                                                 
                                                                                
placing a requirement upon future extensions to the protocol rather than        
on implementations of HTTP 1.1.  I think the "MUST" should be changed to        
a "must".
