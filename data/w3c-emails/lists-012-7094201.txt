In section 4.4 "Message Length", the statement                                  
                                                                                
   "Any response message which MUST NOT include a message-body (such            
   as the 1xx, 204, and 304 responses and any response to a HEAD                
   request) is always terminated by the first empty line after the              
   header fields, regardless of the entity-header fields present in             
   the message."                                                                
                                                                                
refers to a requirement, it doesn't state one.  The "MUST NOT" should be        
changed to "must not".
