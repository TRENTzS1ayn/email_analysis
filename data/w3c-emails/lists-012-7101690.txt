In section 4.4 "Message Length", does the statement                             
                                                                                
   "If a Content-Length header field (section 14.13) is present, its            
   decimal value in OCTETs represents both the entity-length and the            
   transfer-length. The Content-Length header field MUST NOT be used            
   if these two lengths are different (i.e., if a Transfer-Encoding             
   header field is present)."                                                   
                                                                                
mean that a receiver should ignore Content-Length, or a sender should           
not send it?
