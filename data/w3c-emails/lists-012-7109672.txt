In section 8.1.2 "Overall Operation", the statement                             
                                                                                
   "Persistent connections provide a mechanism by which a client and            
   a server can signal the close of a TCP connection. This signaling            
   takes place using the Connection header field (section 14.10).               
   Once a close has been signaled, the client MUST not send any more            
   requests on that connection."                                                
                                                                                
should probably read "MUST NOT" instead of "MUST not".
