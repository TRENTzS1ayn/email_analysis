In section 8.1.2.1 "Negotiation", the statement                                 
                                                                                
   "An HTTP/1.1 client MAY expect a connection to remain open, but              
   would decide to keep it open based on whether the response from a            
   server contains a Connection header with the connection-token                
   close."                                                                      
                                                                                
does not state a requirement, the "MAY" should probably be "may".
