In section 14.36 "Referer", the statement                                       
                                                                                
   "If the field value is a partial URI, it SHOULD be interpreted               
   relative to the Request-URI."                                                
                                                                                
sounds more like a MUST than a SHOULD. An interoperability problem will         
result if two implementations interpret the referring URI differently.          
If the SHOULD is due to compatibility with earlier usage, that should be        
noted someplace.
