In section 13.4 "Response Cachability", the statement                           
                                                                                
   "Certain cache-control directives are therefore provided so that             
   the server can indicate that certain resource entities, or                   
   portions thereof, MUST NOT be cached regardless of other                     
   considerations."                                                             
                                                                                
does not specify a requirement. The "MUST or MUST NOT" should be changed        
to "must or must not".
