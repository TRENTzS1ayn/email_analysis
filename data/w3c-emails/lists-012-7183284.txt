In section 13.5.2 "Non-modifiable Headers", the statement                       
                                                                                
   "A non-transparent proxy MAY modify or add these fields to a                 
   message that does not include no-transform, but if it does so, if            
   not already present, it MUST add a Warning 214 (Transformation               
   applied) if one does not already appear in the message (see                  
   section 14.46)."                                                             
                                                                                
appears to be in error.  It allows non-transparent proxies to make              
certain changes to messages that do not contain Cache-Control:                  
no-transform.  The discussion of the no-transform directive in section          
14.9.5 doesn't jive, and makes it look like this paragraph should read          
"... that contains no-transform ...", just as the immediately prior             
paragraph does.
