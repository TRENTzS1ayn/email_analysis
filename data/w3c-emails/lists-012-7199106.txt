In section 13.12 "Cache Replacement", the statement                             
                                                                                
"If it inserts the new response into cache storage it                           
SHOULD follow the rules in section 13.5.3."                                     
                                                                                
could be construed as downgrading several MUSTs in 13.5.3 to SHOULDs.           
The "SHOULD" should either be replaced with "should" or this requirement        
should be upgraded to a "MUST".
