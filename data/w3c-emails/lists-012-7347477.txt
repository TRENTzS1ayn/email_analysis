Nit by private mail; since we are so far down stream, I'd like it

  Hi Jim,

I sent you a mail about this a couple months back, but I think I got it
slightly wrong. In the issue list "AUTHVSPROXY" actually has two things,
the second of which has been done. The first, however, still needs doing:

But since it's in the http spec, not the auth spec, section 14.33 of
draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-05 still has the old Proxy-Authenticate
syntax and needs to be changed to

      Proxy-Authenticate  = "Proxy-Authenticate" ":" 1#challenge


  Cheers,

  Ronald
