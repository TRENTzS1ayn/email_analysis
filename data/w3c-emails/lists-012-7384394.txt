Dave,
Content negotiation is hard, ain't it?  I think you
have run into an "infelicity" rather than a true bug, and
that the infelicty is shared between server and client.  It seems
quite likely that the Netscape 4.5 client is using a gzip plugin
or program capable of handling compress, so it would be better
were it configured to send an Accept-Encoding header which
indicated that capability.  The server can't presume that, though,
as someone might have implemented a library which did gzip
encoding but not compress encoding (for licensing or religious reasons).
The infelicity on the server side is that it is sending
out pre-compressed files in a single format.  In the best of all
possible worlds it would always have the non-compressed format
available, or would be applying the compression on the fly based
on the accepted encodings, or even removing the compression on
the fly.  Since the Accept-Encoding header has a default inclusion
of "No Encoding", that would guarantee that *something* was always
available.
Not really a bug in either case, just an infelicity.
regards,
Ted Hardie


PS.  Today is my last day at NASA; mail will be forwarded, but communication
after November 11th should go to me as hardie@equinix.com
