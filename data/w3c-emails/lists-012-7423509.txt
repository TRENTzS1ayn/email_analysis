See section 3.5; I believe it is clear on the topic.

The tokens refer to algorithms; not programs.

gzipAn encoding format produced by the file compression program ``gzip'' 
(GNU zip) as described in RFC 1952 [25]. This format is a Lempel-Ziv coding 
(LZ77) with a 32 bit CRC.

compress The encoding format produced by the common UNIX file compression 
program ``compress''. This format is an adaptive Lempel-Ziv-Welch coding 
(LZW).


Use of program names for the identification of encoding formats is not 
desirable and is discouraged for future encodings. Their use here is 
representative of historical practice, not good design. For compatibility 
with previous implementations of HTTP, applications SHOULD consider ``x-gzip'' 
and ``x-compress'' to be equivalent to ``gzip'' and ``compress'' respectively.

That a particular implementation chooses to use a gzip program that happens
to also handle compress is an implementation issue; it should declare
what algorithms it actually implements.

Note the historical note.  We been here before, and done this folks.
