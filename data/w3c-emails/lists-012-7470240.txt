If you want to bring this to the attention of the IESG, the IESG may decide
to attach a note to the HTTP draft specification that the use of the
"compress"
encoding might be covered by patent claims, and I may need to ask the
implementations surveyed for implementation of content-encoding whether
they have "taken adequate steps to comply with any such rights, or claimed
rights".

However, the "significant implementation and successful operational
experience"
with the use of the "compress" encoding leads me to assert that there
is no barrier to the use of "compress" in advancing to Draft Standard
status.

I'll review this with the area directors, though.
