In section 4.1 "General Syntax", the statements

   "In the interest of robustness, servers SHOULD ignore any empty
   line(s) received where a Request-Line is expected."

and

   "In other words, if the server is reading the protocol stream at
   the beginning of a message and receives a CRLF first, it SHOULD
   ignore the CRLF."

state the same requirement in different forms.  Unless they're needed
for other reasons, I suggest either deleting one of them or changing one
of the "SHOULD"s to "should".
