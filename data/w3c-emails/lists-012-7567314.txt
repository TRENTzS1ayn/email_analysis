In section 4.2 "Message Headers", the statement

   "It MUST be possible to combine the multiple header fields into
   one "field-name: field-value" pair, without changing the semantics
   of the message, by appending each subsequent field-value to the
   first, each separated by a comma."

is a restatement of the preceding requirement,

   "Multiple message-header fields with the same field-name MAY be
   present in a message if and only if the entire field-value for
   that header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e.,
   #(values)]."

placing a requirement upon future extensions to the protocol rather than
on implementations of HTTP 1.1.  I think the "MUST" should be changed to
a "must".
