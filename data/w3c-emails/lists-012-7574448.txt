In section 4.4 "Message Length", the statement

   "Any response message which MUST NOT include a message-body (such
   as the 1xx, 204, and 304 responses and any response to a HEAD
   request) is always terminated by the first empty line after the
   header fields, regardless of the entity-header fields present in
   the message."

refers to a requirement, it doesn't state one.  The "MUST NOT" should be
changed to "must not".
