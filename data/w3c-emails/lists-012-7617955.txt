In section 8.1.2.1 "Negotiation", the statement

   "An HTTP/1.1 client MAY expect a connection to remain open, but
   would decide to keep it open based on whether the response from a
   server contains a Connection header with the connection-token
   close."

does not state a requirement, the "MAY" should probably be "may".
