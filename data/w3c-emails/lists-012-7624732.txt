In section 11 "Access Authentication", the statement

   "HTTP provides several OPTIONAL challenge-response authentication
   mechanisms which MAY be used by a server to challenge a client
   request and by a client to provide authentication information."

is not a requirement, so the "MAY" should be changed to "may".
