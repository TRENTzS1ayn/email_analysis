In section 8.1.2 "Overall Operation", the statement

   "Persistent connections provide a mechanism by which a client and
   a server can signal the close of a TCP connection. This signaling
   takes place using the Connection header field (section 14.10).
   Once a close has been signaled, the client MUST not send any more
   requests on that connection."

should probably read "MUST NOT" instead of "MUST not".
