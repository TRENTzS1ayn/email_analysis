In section 4.4 "Message Length", does the statement

   "If a Content-Length header field (section 14.13) is present, its
   decimal value in OCTETs represents both the entity-length and the
   transfer-length. The Content-Length header field MUST NOT be used
   if these two lengths are different (i.e., if a Transfer-Encoding
   header field is present)."

mean that a receiver should ignore Content-Length, or a sender should
not send it?
