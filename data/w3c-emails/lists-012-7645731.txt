In section 14.46 "Warning", the statement

   "The warn-code consists of three digits. The first digit indicates
   whether the Warning MUST or MUST NOT be deleted from a stored
   cache entry after a successful revalidation:"

does not specify a requirement.  The "MUST or MUST NOT" should be
changed to "must or must not"
