In section 14.36 "Referer", the statement

   "If the field value is a partial URI, it SHOULD be interpreted
   relative to the Request-URI."

sounds more like a MUST than a SHOULD. An interoperability problem will
result if two implementations interpret the referring URI differently.
If the SHOULD is due to compatibility with earlier usage, that should be
noted someplace.
