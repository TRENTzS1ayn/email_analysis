In section 13.12 "Cache Replacement", the statement

"If it inserts the new response into cache storage it
SHOULD follow the rules in section 13.5.3."

could be construed as downgrading several MUSTs in 13.5.3 to SHOULDs.
The "SHOULD" should either be replaced with "should" or this requirement
should be upgraded to a "MUST".
