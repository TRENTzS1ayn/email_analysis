In section 13.4 "Response Cachability", the statement

   "Certain cache-control directives are therefore provided so that
   the server can indicate that certain resource entities, or
   portions thereof, MUST NOT be cached regardless of other
   considerations."

does not specify a requirement. The "MUST or MUST NOT" should be changed
to "must or must not".
