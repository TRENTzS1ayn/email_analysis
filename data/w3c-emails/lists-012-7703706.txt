In section 13.5.2 "Non-modifiable Headers", the statement

   "A non-transparent proxy MAY modify or add these fields to a
   message that does not include no-transform, but if it does so, if
   not already present, it MUST add a Warning 214 (Transformation
   applied) if one does not already appear in the message (see
   section 14.46)."

appears to be in error.  It allows non-transparent proxies to make
certain changes to messages that do not contain Cache-Control:
no-transform.  The discussion of the no-transform directive in section
14.9.5 doesn't jive, and makes it look like this paragraph should read
"... that contains no-transform ...", just as the immediately prior
paragraph does.
