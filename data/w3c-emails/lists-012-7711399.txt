In section 14.23 "Host", the statements

   "A client MUST include a Host header field in all HTTP/1.1 request
   messages on the Internet (i.e., on any message corresponding to a
   request for a URL which includes an Internet host address for the
   service being requested). If the Host field is not already
   present, an HTTP/1.1 proxy MUST add a Host field to the request
   message prior to forwarding it on the Internet. All Internet-based
   HTTP/1.1 servers MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request) status code
   to any HTTP/1.1 request message which lacks a Host header field."

can be interpreted to relax the requirement when requests are not
transiting the public Internet (e.g., between a client and server on a
departmental LAN). I believe the intent is to make HOST a required
request header whenever TCP/IP is the vehicle for the HTTP conversation.
If so, these statements should be clarified.
