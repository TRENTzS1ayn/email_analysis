There's a third class to consider as well, although I don't know of any
examples to cite: the origin-server cache.  While a proxie cache has a
combined client and server, an origin-server cache would not have a
client component (or at least not in use in a given transaction).

Good point.

While this isn't my forte, I believe the text is correct, as it applies
to all server-caches, not just proxy-caches.

>74. Section 13.5.1, pg. 84, 1st para, 1st bullet, has "End-to-end

I don't understand your meaning of "relative clauses", however this case
in particular does state a requirement, that intermediaries forward
end-to-end headers to the ultimate recipient.  This requirement isn't
stated anywhere else in the document, and must be retained.

>78. Section 13.5.3, pg. 86, 5th para., has "all such old headers are
>replaced." which sounds like a requirement: "... MUST be replaced."

The requirement is already stated two paragraphs prior to the citation:

   "Unless the cache decides to remove the cache entry, it MUST also
   replace the end-to-end headers stored with the cache entry with
   corresponding headers received in the incoming response."

>82. Section 14, pg. 91: suggest adding a sentence to each header

While that would clear up some confusion, I believe the document already
contains too much duplication, and duplicated information always runs the
risk of becoming contradictory due to modification over time.

>93. Section 14.9, pg. 99, 1st para., has "When a directive appears

True, however the text establishes a rule for all Cache-Control
directives, now and in the future.
