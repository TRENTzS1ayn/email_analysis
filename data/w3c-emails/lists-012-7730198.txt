Perhaps, but HTTP and the Internet documents its BNF derive from have
always treated SP as a special case, differing from most of the CTLs in
that it has properties of its own (as do CR, HT, and LF).

And as has been mentioned on this list before, these are actually
fixed-point numbers.

Sorry, that changes the meaning entirely.  This paragraph expresses the
header-combination rule, which allows q receiving party to combine
multiple instances of the same header-name by appending the values of
those headers in order and separated by commas.  This behavior is
actually required by the CGI 1.1 specification for passing headers to
CGI programs as CGI variables.  Your rewrite places the restriction on
the receiver, not the sender (where it rightly belongs).  A "MUST NOT"
rewrite should look more like this:

   "Header fields which are not defined in their entirety as a
   comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)] MUST NOT be appear more
   than once in a message"

Still, I find the existing text to be clearer and more to the point.

The document generally treats "multipart/byteranges" as appropriate only
for responses, however you are correct that if someone finds a use for
it in requests there is a contradiction.

RFC 1945 (HTTP 1.0) was a "document current practices" excercise.  HTTP
1.1 places new requirements on implementations, and not all deployed
HTTP 1.1 implementations are currently correct.

Put differently, "Mosaic and httpd defined HTTP 1.0, the IETF defined
HTTP 1.1". ;-)

Yes, Host is required on every HTTP 1.1 request, even for "OPTIONS *".
For example, this allows an origin server to respond differently
depending on whether the Host header refers to "WWW.A.Com" or "WWW.B.Org".
