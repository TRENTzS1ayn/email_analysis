How about rewriting this sentence to:

   "A given entity tag value MAY be used for entities obtained by
   requests on different URIs and does not imply the
   equivalence of those entities."

The point that is trying to be made is that an entity tag can only
be used relative to the same requested resource.  Personally, I wish
Etags were stronger than this, but that is their definition.
