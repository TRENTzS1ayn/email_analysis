At the time we discussed this, it was believed that we could at some
later date add other kinds of ETags with a broader scope (server
unique or even globally unique).

I think the possibility is still open to do this, in a separate
specification. Old clients/proxies would just see the new ETag as
having a narrower scope of uniqueness.
