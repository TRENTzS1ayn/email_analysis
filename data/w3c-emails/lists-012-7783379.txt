Yup.   I see your point...

I think adding quotes around "MUST NOT" makes it clear:

    "Any response message which "MUST NOT" include a message-body (such
    as the 1xx, 204, and 304 responses and any response to a HEAD
    request) is always terminated by the first empty line after the
    header fields, regardless of the entity-header fields present in
    the message."
