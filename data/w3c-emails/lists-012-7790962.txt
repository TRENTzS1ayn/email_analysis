No, in fact, it is a requirement placed on future versions of the HTTP/1.X
family of protocols.  The issue is that there are deployed proxies that
do exactly this kind of header transformation, and the requirement is to
prevent breaking them.  We might wish this isn't so, but it is, and
for this generation of protocol, we're stuck with it.
