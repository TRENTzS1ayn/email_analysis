I'll rewrite the second paragraph to be:

"The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response.
Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain
a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s), since many
pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents do not understand the 307 status.  Therefore,
the note SHOULD contain the information necessary for a user to repeat
the original request on the new URI."

And delete the last paragraph of the section.
