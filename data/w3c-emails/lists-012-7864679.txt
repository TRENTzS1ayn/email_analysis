In fact, I think that all of section 14.20.1 can be removed, with
a single cross reference to 8.2.4 taking its place.  This looks like
something that got left behind when some reorganization took place.
Others should check that my analysis is correct.

I'll add the sentence: 

"See section 8.2.4 for use of the 100 (continue) Status."

in section 14.20.

Thanks for noticing; it will save a third of a page of redundent text.
