No, the existing wording is better because the requirement still holds
even if the use of HTTP is over UDP, T/TCP, or any other future transport
protocol.  The requirement relates to the meaning of identifier components
and not to the transport protocol itself.  The reason for the implied
relaxation is because it is possible to use HTTP on a transport that
has no concept of hostnames (like between a PDA and its base station)
and we don't want a separate specification of HTTP for every transport.
