That's exactly where I was going, although using "TCP/IP" was a poor
choice.  (I meant something like "any protocol that flows data over a
network where said network understands the concept of a 'hostname'", but
that would have pegged the Obfusco-Meter).  In the case of
HTTP-over-SNA, a Host header would look very different, if it could
exist at all.  Certainly other transports could have similar issues.

My concern wasn't over the relaxation of the requirement when using
transports that don't have a "hostname" concept, but rather the way it
was written up.  I also wasn't sure if this was an intentional
relaxation - the statement in section 9 "Method Definitions" is
unequivocal:

   "The Host request-header field (section 14.23) MUST accompany
   all HTTP/1.1 requests."

If the relaxation is intentional, then section 9 is in error.
