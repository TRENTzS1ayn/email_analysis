Right.

That's clearer, and jibes with the MUST in section 9.

Indeed, one could argue that a PDA if RF/infrared/whatever communication
with its base station should send Host headers if the URL includes a
host address for the base station (e.g., running IP-on-the-air ala
AMPRNet).  By the same argument, if the URL requested by the PDA doesn't
include a host address, no Host header is required (although that
violates section 9).
