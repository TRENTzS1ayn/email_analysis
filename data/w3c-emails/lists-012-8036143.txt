A referer (sic) cannot be an interoperability problem in the first place,
as it is only provided to a server as a benefit (at some cost to the
client, I might add).

So it is hard to make a claim that this should be a MUST, as it isn't
mandantory information in the first place, and is just suggesting how
the server might interpret the graciously supplied partial URI in the
first place.

I don't see any need for a change.
