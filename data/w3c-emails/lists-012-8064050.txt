    How about rewriting this sentence to:
    
       "A given entity tag value MAY be used for entities obtained by
       requests on different URIs and does not imply the
       equivalence of those entities."
    
On reflection, I don't think this rewrite is that much easier
to parse, since it's not clear what the subject of "does not imply"
is.

How about
       A given entity tag value MAY be used for entities obtained by
       requests on different URIs.  The use of the same entity tag
       value in conjunction with entities obtained by requests on
       different URIs does not imply the equivalence of those
       entities.
