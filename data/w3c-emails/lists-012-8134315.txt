In most cases, the 'cachable' constraint is not on whether
you store the value in a cache, but whether you USE the
cached value. Now, it may be foolish to cache something that
you cannot use, but perhaps not; e.g., even if the results
aren't exactly cachable, could you use delta-coding on the
next request with an appropriate entity tag?

I don't know whether it's best to say SHOULD NOT and let
implementors figure out the constraints, or to go ahead
and use MUST NOT, but to carefully redefine 'cachable' or
'cached' to mean that the cached value cannot be used,
and thus probably shouldn't be stored.
