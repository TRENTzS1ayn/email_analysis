I believe that the spec makes the above statement somewhere already,
though I just tried to find it and failed.  Jeff?

I have always interpreted these 'are not cachable' lines as useful
reminders of the general rule I just failed to find.  Removing them
would decrease the readability of the document I think.

As far as I can see making these changes does not introduce some new
danger.
