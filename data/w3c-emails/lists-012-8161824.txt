Yes, I see the point, and this was clearly not our intent, as the
following sentence explicitly deals with the case of UA's with
link editing capability, where it recommends relinking.  I also
think that the SHOULD in the sentence about link editing capabilities
is incorrect; it is weasle worded with "where possible", and I don't
think it was originally intended it should be SHOULD.

So I think a proper replacement for the paragraph is.

 "The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and the 
  reference to this resource SHOULD use one of the returned URIs.  
  Clients with link editing capabilities ought to automatically re-link 
  references to the Request-URI to one or more of the new references returned 
  by the server, where possible. This response is cachable unless indicated 
  otherwise."
