I don't understand your meaning of "relative clauses",
however this case
in particular does state a requirement, that
intermediaries forward
end-to-end headers to the ultimate recipient.  This
requirement isn't
stated anywhere else in the document, and must be
retained.

I use "relative clause" in the sense of English syntax; i.e., a
subordinate clause
introduced by a relative pronoun. Since such clauses are used to comment
on or restrict the scope of interpretation of the preceding noun or noun
phrase,
it is not appropriate to embed an imperative in such a clause. It should
be
restated outside of a relative clause; e.g., "End-to-end headers MUST be
...".
