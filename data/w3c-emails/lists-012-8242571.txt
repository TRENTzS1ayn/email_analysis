Sorry, no, we handle space differently than CTL, and the
BNF reflects this.

What I'm saying here is that you define CTL as:

CTL = <any US-ASCII control character (octets 0-31) and DEL (127)>

while, in fact, "any US-ASCII control character" includes octet 32 by
definition
as well as 0-31 and 127. If you want to exclude SP from this syntactic
category,
I'd suggest adding "exluding SP (32)" to this definition.

I'm not the MIME expert of the working group, but I take
this to mean 
that this is just a restriction on which character sets
may be used, and 
implies there are character sets that do not meet this
requirement by 
having external profiling information.  Maybe a MIME
expert can confirm 
this one.

I'm concerned about whether this use of MUST is stipulating a
requirement
for an HTTP implementation or the entity using HTTP. If it is a
requirement on
the implementation, then the implementation would have to maintain
internal
knowledge about which "character sets" satisfy this requirement.

No, entities are always payload.  The requirement is
that you have to
play by MIME rules for that data type, but we
acknowledge the UNIX usage
of newline line terminators means that text document
line terminators
don't play by MIME rules.  The Web has worked this way
(just ship the
bits) from day one, and any arguments that it should
play by MIME rules
for text payload at this date are doomed to failure.

The problem I have here with this is the use of "MUST". Which entity is
responsible for
enforcing "MUST"? If it is true that entities are always payload, then
it would clearly not
be a requirement on the server or client. In this case, the requirement
is on the entity which
is employing an HTTP implementation and not on the implementation
itself, in which case
this should not be specified as a MUST requirement in this context.

I think you should go read the MIME specs to find out;
HTTP incorporating
recommendations for what MIME should do here is a great
way for specs
to end up contradictory.

I'm not suggesting incorporating parts of the MIME specs into this spec;
rather, that
this be more explicit about which parts of the MIME specs are being
referenced.
MIME specifies many behaviors.

I think common sense is in order here. Keep'em short.
Your customers will
thank you (lower latency, fewer bytes).

We've seen people put the kitchen sink in them.

Unless others complain, I plan to keep these as is.

The problem I have here is that common sense is a relative. Without
specifying
any limits (e.g, no greater than 1024 characters in length), anyone can
interpret this
as they see fit.
