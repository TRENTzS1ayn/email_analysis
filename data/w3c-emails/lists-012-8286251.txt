IMO, no fix is required.  In my mind, SHOULD and MAY are very close. 
Furthermore, the wording looks to me like that for Accept and
Accept-Encoding w.r.t. 406 as far as unconditional compliance is
concerned.  And for conditional compliance, servers have the option of
sending an "unacceptable response" in place of an error response.  (We
just went over this territory with my question about Accept-Encoding
(<http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1998q4/0057.html>).
