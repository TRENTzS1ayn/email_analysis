Before it isn't too late (i.e. today), please look over the responses
I (and some others) have made to the issues raised since IETF last call.

I have begun preparation of the draft, and it will be soon too late to
make any changes.  With some luck, this will be the draft that goes to
DRAFT Standard; I'd hate to have made some mistake that would require
another draft, and it is up to you to make sure I don't (other than a
mechanical editing mistake, for which I am alone responsible). I REALLY
want to get a draft in for the ID draft cutoff, and get this to bed.

There are a number of issues that still should have some final
discussion.  These include:

ADAMS3 ADAMS31 ADAMS84 ADAMS84b ADAMS88

Please look at these in particular, and my previous responses, while there
is time.  I don't know if I will get to all of the nits in ADAMS3 in time;
I did look at the ones that Glenn said were significant and respond to
them.

Thank you all for your contributions to the HTTP working group.
You editor,
Jim Gettys
