I did a little digging in the archives on this one.

To find the history of the "charset flap", go to 

http://www.egroups.com/list/http-wg/

and search for a thread that began on June 26, 1996 entitled "DRAFT
Minutes, HTTP working group", and then mutated into "charset flap", and
then "proposed HTTP changes for charset".  This basically details the
evolution of the choice that iso-8859-1 is the "unstated default
charset", and a user agent that sends no Accept-Charset at all is
expected to support iso-8859-1.
