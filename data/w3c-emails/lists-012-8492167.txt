Ah.  Now I understand.  Maybe I was just being dense in interpreting it
to mean the entity sent with the 406, but perhaps section 10.4.7 could
capture your explanation above a little more explicitly to help clarify
it.

Given that the other references (Accept, sec. 14.1; Accept-Encoding,
sec. 14.3) do not include that same language, is it better to eliminate
it from 14.2, OR are there more of these "special cases" (where it may
be preferable for the server to go ahead and return something
"unacceptable") for Accept-Charset that led to have the alternative
explicitly spelled out here?
