For the record: I support this proposed change.  This is exactly what
we need.

I don't really understand Henrik's objections, but I have the feeling
that they are based on the mistaken assumption that the above addition
specifies a top-level requirement which cannot be overridden.  The
addition actually only specifies what the default is if there is no
Cache-Control header in the response.
