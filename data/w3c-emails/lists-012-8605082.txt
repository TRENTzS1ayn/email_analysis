I'm fine with Jeff's updated wording, though I think worrying about
the cached entry corresponding to the new request method should be
part of the definition of cachable rather than having to repeat the
conditional in several places.  In any case, these are just clarifying
what the implementer should be able to figure out on their own.

What does bother me is

which is a bug -- it should say

   An origin server SHOULD return the status code 405 (Method Not Allowed)
   if the method is known by the origin server but not allowed for the
   requested resource, and 501 (Not Implemented) if the method is unrecognized
   or not implemented by the origin server.
