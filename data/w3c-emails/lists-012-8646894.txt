I'm very satisfied with the state of affairs as reflected in the issues
list today (Wednesday - sorry Jim!).  Nice work, as usual.

There is one question I'm aware of (because I raised it ;-) ) that
doesn't appear on the issues list and hasn't provoked any traffic on
this list.  It has to do with the general syntax of headers and a change
between HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 that appears accidental.  See
http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1998q4/0019.html for
the original message.

It's not by any means a show-stopper, but if it was accidentally missed
I'd like to see it addressed.  If it was intentionally omitted, that's
not going to give me any heartburn.
