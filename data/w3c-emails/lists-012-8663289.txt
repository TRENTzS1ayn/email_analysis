I haven't seen an announcement yet, but I sent in Rev06 at about 1:30
yesterday afternoon (the deadline was 5:00 yesterday, the 18th, for
Orlando).  As there is a generally a flurry of final drafts, it often
takes a few days for the IETF secretariat to dig itself out.

As always, it is available in may forms off of the issues list page:
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Issues/.

Note that this draft deals with all issues raised during and since IETF 
last call on the HTTP/1.1 specification for Draft Standard.  Please take 
a final look at this draft to catch any mistakes before any IESG action (it 
is embarrassing to all concerned to find them only after the RFC issues).
I don't know when the next IESG meeting is, but if my memory serves me,
there is a 2 week minimum from the issuance of a draft and any possible
IESG action on that draft.

It is, of course, possible that the IESG could direct another draft, so
it ain't over until the fat lady sings, as they say.

In any case, thank you all for your help.  Keep your fingers crossed
that this is really the last draft for draft standard, but as I said,
I'd much prefer any mistakes to be caught before any RFC issues.

BTW, after the RFC issues, I'd really like to bother to get a good
(compliant) version of the spec available in HTML.  Microsoft Word 97
still generates really terrible HTML; if anyone knows of a *good* path
to get there while preserving cross references, hyper-links, table
of contents, and the index, and something resembling HTML 4.0,
I'd like to hear from them.
