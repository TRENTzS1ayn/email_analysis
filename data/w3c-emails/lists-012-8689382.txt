I have some questioins about Netscape 4.05 and its implementation.

Condition: Fecth Web page directly from server.

When I load a Web page, consisting of 7 GIFs and a source file, the Netscape
open as many TCP connections as GIFs.

If I add more GIFs in the Web page, it open only four TCP connections.

could anybody give me an explaination about it?


Thank you

Dabin
