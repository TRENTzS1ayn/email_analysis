I can't find anything in the Draft that addresses the situation when
both Cache-Control and Pragma: no-cache headers are set, and they are in
conflict. 
For instance, if I use

Cache-Control: must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache

on a HTTP response, it would be desireable to have it cached (and always
revalidated) by HTTP 1.1 caches, and not cached by HTTP 1.0 caches.
However, I can see nothing in the Draft about this, and some
implementations, upon reading 14.32 Pragma, might never cache the
object. While the action is safe, it's not ideal.
 
Am I missing something somewhere? Thanks.
