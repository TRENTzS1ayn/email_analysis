This implication might have held for HTTP/1.0, but is wrong for HTTP/1.1.

Did these servers purport to support HTTP/1.1 for CGI scripts?
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Forum/Reports/ is a survey of
implementations, but we didn't ask implementations to distinguish
whether they supported 'chunked' transfer encoding specifically.

In any case, you left out the most obvious solution: don't use 'CGI'
to implement IPP.

However, it would be useful to update CGI for HTTP/1.1.
