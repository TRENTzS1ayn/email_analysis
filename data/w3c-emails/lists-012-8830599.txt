I can only speak with anything resembling authority on the
CGI aspects.  I find your questions a bit contradictory,
but here's my take on them:

> 1.  MAY a server discard the message body of a POST request with no
> Content-Length?

[Opinion] No.  The message-body is an integral part of
the request, and cannot be silently ignored.  The server
should return a 411 (Length Required) instead.

> 2.  MAY a server discard the message body of a POST request with no
> Content-Length when the destination resource is CGI?

[Opinion] Same answer as for [1].

> 3. MUST a server buffer the message body of a POST request with

Yes, if it accepts the request at all.  The CONTENT_LENGTH
metavariable is a MUST for CGI compliance.

> 4. SHOULD a server buffer the message body of a POST request with
> Transfer-Encoding: chunked and generate a CONTENT_LENGTH when the

No, it's a MUST.

> What if the destination resource is a servlet?

I don't think this applies to CGI.  I don't know what
interface is used by servers to communicate with servlets.
If they use CGI, or a particular servlet implementation
does, then they need to abide by the CGI requirements.

I think that specs that define how applications should juggle
different protocols are a waste of time (MHO).  This is more likely
a HOWTO or FAQ sort of thing, explaining how related aspects
should be handled by implementors.

Of course, if you want to write something up for the CGI-NG
draft, feel free.. :-)
