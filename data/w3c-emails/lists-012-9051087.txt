Hi everybody,

I was wondering if it is possible to redirect a client (configured to use a
proxy) to communicate directly with an origin server, thus, bypassing the
proxy server. In other words, can we force this client to use a partial URL
instead of a full URL. I doubt that a JavaScript program or a META tag can
help in this case. I am still not clear if a "301 Moved Permanently" or "302
Moved Temporarily" message could do the trick.
Thanks in advance for considering my request.
Frederic

PS: apologies to those who have received that message already
