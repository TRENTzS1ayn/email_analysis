I think the answer in all cases is "No".  Usually the client's
configuration determines whether a request uses a proxy.  Typically all
requests go through a proxy except for those in the "No Proxy" list.  I
believe Netscape has a proxy auto-configuration mechanism that can make
more sophisticated choices, but a random web page can't change that
configuration.  A Java applet might be able to connect directly to the
origin server, but you wouldn't use that for a "regular" HTTP request.
