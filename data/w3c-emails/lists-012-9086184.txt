I am wondering whether GET requests are allowed to have an Entity-Body?
I have read through the HTTP RFC several times and have not been able to
find a specific prohibition of this, however several colleagues of mine
feel very strongly that GET requests are not permitted to provide an
Entity-Body.

Thanks ...
