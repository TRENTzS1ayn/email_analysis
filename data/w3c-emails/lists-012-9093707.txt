I can't see any reason why they would not. I have written a small http
proxy, and I check for the "Content-Length" header to see if there is
any entity body, and not the METHOD (except for HEAD :).

Well, it doesn't make any sense for the GET to have a body, since all
the information (both static and dynamic) are stored in the URL. So
maybe there is an implementation of a proxy and/or server that gets all
mixed up when there is a Body in a GET request.

I guess this might be one of those times where you are forced to find
out what the real world implementations do, by doing some testing...;)

If you do find out, could you tell me, since I too would like to know,
and am too lazy to work it out myself...;)

Cheers,
Kal.
