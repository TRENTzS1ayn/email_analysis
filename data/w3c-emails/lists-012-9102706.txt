I don't know if this rates high enough to include on an errata list, but
the BNF in section 3.6.1 "Chunked Transfer Coding" for trailer reads:

   trailer        = *entity-header

when it really ought to read:

   trailer        = *(entity-header CRLF)

The rest of the BNF in this section is very explicit, and chunked encoding
is new in HTTP 1.1, so this might be worth fixing.
