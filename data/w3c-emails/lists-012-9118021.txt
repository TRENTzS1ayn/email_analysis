I don't know who can provide any sort of authoritative response - don't
take mine as being 'from the HTTP WG'; I'm just another HTTP server
vendor.  

First, I think that the note Harry Lewis sent titled "IPP> Chunking
Explanation" [1] sums it up pretty well.  An HTTP server certainly has the
option of using the "Length Required" code for whatever reason it wants
to.  My own judgement would be that a printer design that did not allow for
very large inputs of indeterminate length would be a poor one, and as a
result I would not choose an HTTP layer implementation that restricted me
to CGI.
