Thanks for your reply.  I realize there's probably no authoritative answer
available, but as an HTTP server vendor you probably know more about this
than I do as an printer vendor, so I appreciate your help.

If this is the correct interpretation, then I was misled for a long time by
the paragraph in section 4.4, "Message Length", that says "All HTTP/1.1
applications that receive entities MUST accept the ?chunked?
transfer-coding (section 3.6), thus allowing this mechanism to be used for
messages when the message length cannot be determined in advance. "  I
think it would be very helpful to have a note or warning added to that
paragraph;  perhaps:

All HTTP/1.1 applications that receive entities MUST accept the ?chunked?
transfer-coding (section 3.6), thus allowing this mechanism to be used for
messages when the message length cannot be determined in advance.  Note:
this does NOT mean that servers must accept HTTP/1.1 requests containing a
message-body with the ?chunked? transfer-coding.

Agreed.

You can find web-accessible ipp list archives at

http://www.pwg.org/hypermail/ipp/

and

http://www.egroups.com/list/ipp/info.html

(BTW, none of my messages to http-wg@cuckoo.hpl.hp.com seem to make it to
the archives at

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/

or

http://www.findmail.com/listsaver/http-wg/

Does one have to be subscribed in order to post messages?  I thought there
was some kind of IETF rule against that.)
