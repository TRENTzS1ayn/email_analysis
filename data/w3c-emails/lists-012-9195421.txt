To the HTTP WG from the IPP WG:

I've tried to post this twice before, but it never makes it into the
archives at

http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/

or

http://www.findmail.com/listsaver/http-wg/

The IPP WG would really like clarification on this point:  Is the intent of
the HTTP/1.1 spec to say that an HTTP/1.1 server MAY reject any request
without a defined Content-Length?  This would imply that a conformant
HTTP/1.1 server MAY reject any request with the "chunked" transfer-coding.

To me, the presence of the 411 status code means that an HTTP/1.1 server
MAY refuse to accept a request for the specific reason that entity body is
encoded with the "chunked" transfer-coding:

411 Length Required
The server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-Length.
The client MAY repeat the request if it adds a valid Content-Length header
field containing the length of the message-body in the request message.
