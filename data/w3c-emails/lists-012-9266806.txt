That depends on the servlet API.

No application should use HTTP as a transport.  If it used HTTP as HTTP,
there wouldn't be any need for a separate implementation, but it would
still be desirable to base the service on the best capabilities of HTTP
and not on the characteristics that might be true of some other resources
that are accessible via HTTP.
