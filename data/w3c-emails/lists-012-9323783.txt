Anyone top this one?  http://wearables.stanford.edu/

And of course, it speaks HTTP/1.1...  

The Stanford gadget looks smaller
than Itsy (see: http://www.research.digital.com/wrl/itsy/index.html),

Itsy runs off of triple A cells, at much lower power...,
so Itsy is clearly the champ on hits/joule...
