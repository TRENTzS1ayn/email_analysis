Looks pretty small to me.  But we'll have to get you and Stanford to
compare notes on exactly who is smaller, as theirs is pretty tiny
as well.

So far in the race we have:
Stanford and ULM for smallest size
Compaq Itsy for slightly larger, but much faster.

And we can now generate a bunch more bogus performance metrics, like
hits/joule of energy, Hits/cubic CC/second, and other fun useless metrics
of performance.
