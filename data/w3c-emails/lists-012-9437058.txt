Roy and Carl,

I am now quite worried that there may be many cases of HTTP servers refusing
to accept chunked POST requests.  Rejection is not just because of CGI
scripts.  Apparently, denial of service is a reason that a conforming
HTTP/1.1 server might reject chunked encoding POST.  Doesn't such rejection
jeopardize interoperability with IPP clients that send chunked POST
requests?

First, I'd like to understand more about such denial of service, since I
would think that a server would just timeout if the client didn't send the
next chunk in a reasonable amount of time.  Also if the client sent too much
data with multiple chunks, the server could reject the next chunk with the
413 error code.  So I don't understand the denial of service reason to allow
a conforming HTTP/1.1 server to reject a chunked request and am seeking
enlightenment.

Thanks,
Tom
