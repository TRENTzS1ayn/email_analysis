First an editorial point on Rev 6 of the 1.1 spec:

There seems to be a missing word in the second sentence of
section 8.1.4 Practical Considerations:

   A single-user client SHOULD NOT maintain more than
   connections with any server or proxy.

There needs to be something between "than" and "connections".

Second, I was looking through this section trying to find
out if it's legal for proxies to multiplex requests from
different clients on the same connection to a server.  I
couldn't find a clear answer in the spec or in the
archives.  That is given two clients A and B talking to the
same server S via the same proxy P, what is minimum number
of connections required.  Clearly there must be a connection
from A to P and from B to P.  Can the proxy use just one
connection to S or must it open separate connections for
each client?
