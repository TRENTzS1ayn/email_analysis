I propose that these editorial changes be made by the RFC editor
(if the RFC editor prefers, I can prepare a new version with
these changes.)

=========================
Section 14.11:
   If the content-coding of an entity is not "identity", then
   the response MUST including a Content-Encoding
   entity-header (section 14.11) that lists the non-identity
change 'including' to 'include'.
==========================
Section 3.6.1 "Chunked Transfer Coding"
Change
   trailer        = *entity-header
to
   trailer        = *(entity-header CRLF)
===========================
Section 8.1.4 Practical Considerations, last para.:
  A single-user client SHOULD NOT maintain more than connections with
any
  server or proxy.

change 'more than connections' to 'more than 2 connections'.
=======================
section 3.2.3 URI comparison

   Characters other than those in the "reserved" and "unsafe" sets (see
   section 3.2) are equivalent to their ""%" HEX HEX" encoding.

Change 'section 3.2' to 'RFC 2396 [42]'. The definition of URI syntax
had been removed but the reference was wrong.
======================
Remove "URI. See RFC 2068" from the index.
======================
section 13.15.1

Add 'TE' and 'Trailer' to the list of Hop-by-Hop headers.
======================
section 14.9 Cache Control
         | "max-age" "=" delta-seconds            ; Section 14.9.4

change the reference to 'Section 14.9.4' to 'Section 14.9.3'
=======================
Section 3.2.2 change
    http_URL = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path ]
to
    http_URL = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]]

This is another artifact of the removal of the URI syntax in
deference to RFC 2396.
=======================
Section 8.2.3, first sentence:
change "an client" to "a client"
======================
Section 8.2.4
Delete the phrase
  ", subject to the restrictions in section 8.2.3"

since section 8.2.3 was deleted.
========================
Section 12.2

delete the phrase "(this specification reserves the header name
Alternates)"
since the reservation was in RFC 2068 but has since been removed.
=========================
