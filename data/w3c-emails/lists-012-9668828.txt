Hi,
Anyone can give me a clue about the following question:
For the first SYN packet of TCP connection setup for HTML doc., the
retransmission
timer I measured are about: 3.234 (first retransmission), 6.577(sec. ),
13.169 (third), ....
That is new = 2*previous.
The first timeout for the ACK & SYN from the other side is about 2.95 sec.

But in the following simultaneous TCP connections, I observed that the first
timeout for the ACK & SYN 
from the other side for some connection is about 1.069 sec.

How does TCP start the timer from the response side in Netscape server? 

Thank you

Dabin
