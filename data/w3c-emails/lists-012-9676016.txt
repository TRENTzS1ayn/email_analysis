Congratulations to Larry Masinter on his being named a 1999 ACM Fellow.  

Further congratulations to him (and to all of us, really) on
successfully steering the HTTP specification through the IETF
standardization shoals.

Oh, and while we're at it, thanks to Jim Gettys for the tremendous
amount of fine work he performed to edit the document.
