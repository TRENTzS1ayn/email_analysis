Based on the IETF agenda, it appears that this group is not meeting in
Minneapolis.  Is that correct?  If not, when and where will the meeting be
held?  Is there an agenda available?

Also, could someone please tell me whether it is expected that the draft:
draft-ietf-http-authentication-03 will enter the standards track?

Thank you,
Margaret
