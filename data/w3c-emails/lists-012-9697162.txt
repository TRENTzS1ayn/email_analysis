In the APPS area meeting, I was reminded that we need to
officially deal with all draft-ietf-http-* documents in the
Internet drafts area. Enclosed is a review of the documents
that are currently in the Internet Drafts directory (or, rather,
listed in the 1id-abstracts.txt document).
****************************************
Actions for the Internet Drafts editor:
      remove draft-ietf-http-pep-05.txt
             draft-ietf-http-trust-state-mgt-02.txt
             draft-ietf-http-alternates-01.txt
             draft-ietf-http-req-sum-00.txt
             draft-mogul-http-age-00.txt
*****************************************
I note that we cannot officially close until "HTTP State
Management Mechanism" has been completed:

  "HTTP State Management Mechanism", D. Kristol, L. Montulli, 07/29/1998, 
  <draft-ietf-http-state-man-mec-10.txt,.ps>                               

is marked as awaiting an applicability statement, which I presume is:

  "Applicability Statement for HTTP State Management", Keith Moore, 
  11/23/1998, <draft-iesg-http-cookies-00.txt>                             

***************************
We have two drafts in the RFC editor's queue:

  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1", J Mogul, Tim Berners-Lee, 
  Larry Masinter, P. Leach, R. Fielding, H. Nielsen, Jim Gettys, 
  11/24/1998, <draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-rev-06.txt,.ps>                    

  "HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication", J. Franks,
  A. Luotonen, P. Leach, J. Hostetler, P. Hallam-Baker, L. Stewart, Scott 
  Lawrence, 09/11/1998, <draft-ietf-http-authentication-03.txt>            

***************************
  "PEP - an Extension Mechanism for HTTP", D. Connolly, H. Nielsen, R. 
  Khare, Eric Prud''hommeaux, 12/04/1997, <draft-ietf-http-pep-05.txt>     

This document is obsolete. (I don't know why it's still in the
drafts directory.) There is a possible replacement:
  <draft-frystyk-http-mandatory-00.txt>.
***************************
  "HTTP Trust Mechanism for State Management", D. Jaye, 03/06/1998, 
  <draft-ietf-http-trust-state-mgt-02.txt>                                 

The HTTP working group declined to pursue this.
***************************
  "The Alternates Header Field", E. Hardie, K. Holtman, A. Mutz, 
  11/13/1997, <draft-ietf-http-alternates-01.txt>                          

This document is obsolete; some kinds of content negotiation
were published as Experimental RFCs, but we declined to pursue
this.
***************************
  "Format and Example of HTTP/1.1 Requirements Summary", J Mogul, 
  09/15/1997, <draft-ietf-http-req-sum-00.txt>                             

This internet draft was produced as a part of the HTTP working
group process, but can be removed at this time.
****************************
  "Generation of the Age header field in HTTP/1.1", J Mogul, 09/15/1997, 
  <draft-mogul-http-age-00.txt>                                            

This internet draft was submitted as part of the WG internal
discussion and can be removed.
