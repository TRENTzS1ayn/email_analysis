We have received positive interest from current user agent and server
implementers for draft-ietf-http-trust-state-mgt-02.txt.  However, given
current widespread acceptance of current cookie implementations and
default handling, there is no impetus for implementation.   My
understanding and opinion is, however, that the implementers of the most
ubiquitous user agents will not fully implement state-man-mec-10.txt and
all of its recommendations and defaults without some solution like
trust-state-mgt.

Yes and no.  The applicability statement needs to be revised.  But the
real problem IMO is that state-man-mec is caught in IESG process hell,
with some current IESG members unhappy with wording that was accepted by
former IESG members.
