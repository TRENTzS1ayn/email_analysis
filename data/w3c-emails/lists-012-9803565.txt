Actually, it has.  POST means only that data has been supplied to the
process, to do with as it wishes. As far as HTTP is concerned, the request
was successfully completed.

Either 200 or 400.  None of the others are appropriate because they refer
to specific HTTP interoperability concerns, not to POST data.
