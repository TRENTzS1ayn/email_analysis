HI, 

I wonder if anyone here has statistics on the number of web servers
and browsers that support 
a) basic authentication (I think most does)
b) message digest authentication (I think most doesn't)
and the popularity of people deploying them on today's Internet. 

Also, how widely support of HTTP/1.1 spec is there by web servers and
clients?

Thanks,
Wendy
