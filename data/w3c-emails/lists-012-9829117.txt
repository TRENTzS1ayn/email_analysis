Really???!!!!

I find that statement very surprising.  

It certainly does not fit with my reading of the start of Section 10.2 
  "This class of status code indicates that the clients request was
   successfully received, understood AND ACCEPTED"
and 10.2.1
   "The request has succeeded"

It seems I should understand "succeeded" as nothing more than "delivered
and understood".  

My example of a request rejected because of missing or inappropriate data
has surely no more "succeeded" than an attempt to execute a cgi file with
no execute permission---and none of the servers I have used return "200 OK"
for that....

But 400 explicitly says it deals with requests that could not be
understood because of "malformed syntax".  My worry is when there
is a problem iwht the content of the request.

But my uncertainty applies equally to form data encoded as "GET"....
