In order for items in a protocol to advance to Draft Standard, there
must be at least 2 tested interoperable implementations of both client
and server.  By IETF rules, such items must be removed for draft standard,
and there was no claim last summer that people would get them implemented
and tested.  There were no complaints at the time about this action,
nor were there promises of quick implementation.

Neither of these made the cut, at the time (late last summer).  See detailed
comments below.

The way to make progress on these in the IETF, is to write a separate (short)
internet draft defining them, show that you have the implementations (client,
server, and proxy (if there is any proxy specific behavior),
and they can/could/should progress (given that the headers were in the
proposed standard).  Note that the working group does NOT have to be
"open" at the time; the mailing list (will) continue to exist, and
the only difference in procedural rules is that there would have to
be a one month last call rather than a 2 week last call.  So I recommend
submitting such a draft, and it can be acted on presuming general agreement.

Default-Style is something I've NEVER heard of.  You can write an
ID for it, but do so separately, so that it can be acted on independently
(and not affect the other headers procedurally).  It could progress to
proposed standard in a similar fashion.
Hope this helps,

I don't remember the exact details; maybe Dan Connolly does...

In any case, as I remember we were left with two definitions: one in the 
HTTP spec, and one in the HTML spec, and without knowledge of which was 
exactly correct.

Furthermore, one needs 2 interoperable implementations to progress to
draft standard; at the time the interoperability reports were being
done last summer, there weren't known to be two clients, servers and
proxies.

Great.

Never heard of a "Default-Style" header. What is it?
