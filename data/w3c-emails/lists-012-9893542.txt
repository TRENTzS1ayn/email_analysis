I would rephrase that to make one distinction - every possible entity
returned for a resource is a variant of that resource.  Any particular
entity returned for a particular request is a representation of that
resource.

Only in some theoretical sense, I guess.

Is there some particular rule that seems ambiguous for your case that hinges
on the definition of these terms?
