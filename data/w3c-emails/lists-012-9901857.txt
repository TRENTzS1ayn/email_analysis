Nope, that's backwards.  Each possible entity from a resource is
a "representation" of that resource at the time the message originated.
A representation is a variant if, at origination time, the set of
possible representations has a membership greater than one.  It is called
a variant because the chosen representation varies based on the request
parameters (content negotiation).

A resource is a mapping function based on time, so its value set is
based on the given instant.

A more extensive explanation is in my web architecture paper (submitted
to ESEC/FSE99, so I can't give people a copy right now).
