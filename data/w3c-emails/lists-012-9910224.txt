    A resource is a mapping function based on time, so its value set is
    based on the given instant.
    
I've suggested the term "instance" as a way to describe a member
of this instantaneous value set:

       The entity that would be returned in a status-200
       response to a GET request, at the current time, for
       the selected variant of the specified resource, but
       without the application of any content-coding or
       transfer-coding.

(see http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mogul-http-digest-01.txt)

Without such a definition, it's fairly difficult to precisely specify
mechanisms such as delta encoding.
