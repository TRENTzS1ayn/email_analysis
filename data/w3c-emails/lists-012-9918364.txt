Thank you (all) very much for answering so promptly!

So it seems at least to be consesus, that the definition in the actual HTTP/1.1
document is obsolete :( , but since the terms seem to be used consistently
there, this does not much harm to the document itself.

I'm writing on a text covering some parts of HTTP and CN and I don't want
to use the terms "wrongly".

So the different possible entities produced by some CGI script (maybe
including the remote IP address) would be termed "variant" as well, and this
could be considered a special case of content negotiation? (I know this sounds
theoretically, but this kind of questions are the ones that help me most)

Thanks a lot
