The representation is the information you get when the entity is
extracted from the HTTP message -- it is the data transferred, not
the internal machine representation on the server.

No, it means the definition in the spec is wrong, as I said a couple
hundred times in our teleconferences.  You cannot make a wrong thing right
just because I was outvoted.  These are terms defined by the architectural
model of the Web, not defined by HTTP.
