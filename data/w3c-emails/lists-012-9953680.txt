Roy,

I was not aware that you were somehow advocating a 'right', but
different definition of the term variant all along.  I don't recall
any big fuss about the term any teleconference, but then again I was
not in all teleconferences.

It is generally not a good idea to redefine terms, even if the
original definition is somehow wrong.  Having two incompatible
definitions of 'variant' around can only lead to confusion.  If you
have some interesting concept you want to define a term for, there are
plenty of other, uncontaminated, words you could pick.
