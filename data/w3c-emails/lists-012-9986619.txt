Of course.

What you should not do as a proxy is try to simultaneously use the
same connection on behalf of two different clients; otherwise, you could
have denial of service attacks.

Serial reuse of a connection is just fine. (anotherwards, as soon as you
get all responses back from a set of requests, you are free to reuse that
connection on behalf of another or the same client.

Yup.

Must be in order, as HTTP has no request number to allow a client to
get out of order responses.  This is a basic "bug" (some have claimed
feature, I, and many other claim bug) in HTTP design.

Yup; we know about the typo; will be fixed in the RFC.
