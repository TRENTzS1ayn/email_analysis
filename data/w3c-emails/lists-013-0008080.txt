has anyone tried to use http over udp.
i have a device which has only udp type server sockets. it doenst have TCP 
ones.
I want to reach that device using netscape/ IE (any browser).
since HTTP is based over TCP , my UDP listener at my device's end wont 
receive packets sent over netscape.

Any ideas?
Thanks
Tapan
