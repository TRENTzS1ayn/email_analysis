The issue is that HTTP needs a connection-oriented transport.
Using UDP would mean that you need some sort of connection-management...

So why use UDP?

Note that UDP is a complete different protocol than TCP, even if they have
the same range of port numbers (and have ports).

Subject: http over udp?


has anyone tried to use http over udp.
i have a device which has only udp type server sockets. it doenst have TCP
ones.
I want to reach that device using netscape/ IE (any browser).
since HTTP is based over TCP , my UDP listener at my device's end wont
receive packets sent over netscape.

Any ideas?
Thanks
Tapan
