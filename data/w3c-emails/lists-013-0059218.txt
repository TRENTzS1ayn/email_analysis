They are still used, I think.... (e.g. IE)

The specification expects ASCII characters, but if UTF-8 is compatible with
ASCII and the spec this can be used.

No, solely ASCII, according to the spec. It states ASCII characters, with a
range from 0x00 to 0xFF. Depending on what you are entering, there may be
some more limitations (see spec).

Don't know about UTF-8, I thought IE could use it to encode the URL.

Seems like it. It might, however, be possible to encode them so they comply
with the spec. Still, I'm not sure about this.
