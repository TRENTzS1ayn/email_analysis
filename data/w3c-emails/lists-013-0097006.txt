I would like to write a program that goes to a web site and does an HTTP GET
and instead of coming back with an HTML page, I would like to come back with
a directory listing of files.  The HTML page will contain links to the files
in the same directory but instead of having to parse the HTML page for the
file names I would like to just get a directory listing as this would make
the downloading of these files easier.  Does anyone know of a way to do
this?
