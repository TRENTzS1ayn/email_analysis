Hi
I am using http 1.1.I am making a persistent connection from java client to 
apache server.I am able to make it but I don't want to use transfer encoding 
as chunked(which is there by default).Is there any way I can do it.Where I 
need to change it.If you need some more detail please let me know.

-Manish
