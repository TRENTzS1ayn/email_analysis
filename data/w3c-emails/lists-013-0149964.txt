Thanks for the response.It really helped in clearing some of the doubts.I am 
now having one more problem.I am using java socket and my server is apache.I 
am using http 1.1 ..I am having a problem with server closing the 
connection.Basically I want to have some way for server to send a message 
whenever its closing the connection.Is there any way it can be 
handled.Basically I want to differenciate between the case when server 
closes the existing socket(Only particular socket is not valid) and when 
server is down(No socket will work).
