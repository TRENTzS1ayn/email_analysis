Hi
I am using http 1.1..My client side code is in java and server side is 
apache server.I am sending back response in xml format.My problem is now I 
am using transfer chunked encoding and having persistent connection. I don't 
know how to handle the chunked response.How we should handle different chunk 
of response like what will be the delimiter for one chunk and all this.No 
where on net I could find the real time example. Can somebody explain me how 
we do handle it.It will be really nice if somebody can send me the example 
chunk response which will have more then one chunk of response.I tried with 
my code but It always come in one chunk.I tried for larger response also but 
it never comes in more then one chunk.Is it being handled internally and we 
will always get one chunk only.
I badly need to know it.Somebody please help me with it.

TIA
-Manish
