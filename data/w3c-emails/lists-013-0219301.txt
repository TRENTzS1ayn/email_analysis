Yes, they're extensions, but all widely-used 1.0 implementations use
them, to the best of my knowledge. More to the point, many "1.1"
server implementations won't chunk some content, depending on how the
entity is generated, leading them to close the connection.
Conversely, if the generation engine supplies them with a
Content-Length header, they not only will not close the connection,
they won't chunk it, giving the desired effect.
