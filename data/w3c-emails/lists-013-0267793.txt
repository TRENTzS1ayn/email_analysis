Some HTTP proxies will provide aditional request headers to indicate the
originating IP address (e.g., squid's forwarded_for directive) but such
information is rare, optional, and cannot be trusted (unless you control 
the proxy server that is adding the request header). Even when the 
information can be trusted, it often refers to unroutable address space.
