Hi ,

As per the discussions, it seems that PROXY can tunnel protocol on HTTP
Then why every proxy has different port for different protocols
(like FTP,SMTP,SOCKS etc).
Why not other protocols are tunneled over HTTP?

If my application (written in say VC++), wants to use HTTP-tunneling
what necessary and sufficient conditions it should have at Client and Server
ends.

There is still confusion on PROXING and HTTP-TUNNELING.
If HHTPS uses HTTP-TUNNELING and HTTP-TUNNELED data cant be seen by anybody,
why encryption is needed for that data (Digital certificates for HTTPS)?

Thanks in advance.

Yog
