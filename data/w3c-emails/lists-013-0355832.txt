FTP is for compatiblity with FTP programs, like WS_FTP. These don't support
HTTP, only FTP. Proxies commonly don't support incomming FTP connections.
You can access FTP through HTTP, even through the protocols differ.

SMTP is not comparable with HTTP in any kind. It handles mail transmission
instead of file/hypertext transport.

SOCKS is not comparable with HTTP in any kind. It's designed for incomming
and outgoing TCP and UDP traffic through a firewall.

These protocols are for very different different goals than HTTP is.

>Why not other protocols are tunneled over HTTP?

It's not practical. And also security may suffer.
ICQ, for example does support tunneling through HTTP, however I doubt it's
used frequently. SOCKS is a better alternative for this...

HTTP tunneling supports only TCP outgoing, however SOCKS support TCP and UDP
incomming and outgoing, even as knowing the IP address and port where that
is opened for transactions.

You make a TCP connection to the proxy and request the proxy to make a
tunnel to a server. The data send through the HTTP tunnel (like most(!)
tunnels) can be read by everyone. A protocol like SSL or TLS adds the
security (others cannot write and optionally not read). Over a security
protocol HTTP is send.

HTTPS is simply HTTP send over a security protocol, like SSL, TLS or others.
