I used to do my own dns but then i set a router up and never have been able to get it to work again so i resorted to dns2go. I run a mail server and a website on damadtech.com.
 For my email users they have to use www.damadtech.com:"port" to get to the signin for the email due to the fact that dns2go doesnt support subdomains yet.
My website is on default port 80 and i was trying to set up a virtual host for www.mail.damadtech.com to reroute itself to www.damadtech.com:3000 is there anyway possible to do that with apache and still have my website work? The following is how I've tried so far with no success:

    Port 80
    ServerName damadtech.com

    NameVirtualHost *

    <VirtualHost *>
    DocumentRoot c:/www
    ServerName www.damadtech.com
    </VirtualHost>
    
    <VirtualHost *>
    DocumentRoot c:/www/redirect
    ServerName www.mail.damadtech.com
    </VirtualHost> 


c:/www/redirect contains a perl redirect if I can ever get the subdomain to work. If anyone could lend a hand it would be well appreciated.

Thanks alot,
Jon
