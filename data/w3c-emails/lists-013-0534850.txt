Hi,

I too am interested in any information about conformance test suites for
HTTP/1.1.  I've recently been involved in a client implementation, and
found planning the conformance testing a very manual task, mainly because I
could locate no resource other than the RFC that listed (in brief!) which
RFC MUST/SHOULD clauses apply to each class of application.

It's interesting to contrast this with the WAP Forum's conformance
specifications, which are found at the end of each of their specs.
Furthermore there's a test suite produced and administered by OpenGroup.org
which tests clients against each clause.  I'd be very happy to discover
that an organisation somewhere has produced a similar HTTP/1.1 client
conformance suite.

G'day all,
           I'm just getting to the end of an http implementation, and am in
testing for conformance to the spec.  I've interpreted the spec to the best
of my ability, and I'd like to cross reference this list against another.
Does anyone know the url to a document summarising the spec?  This seems
like such an academic exercise, I figured that there would be an .edu site
with this info...
