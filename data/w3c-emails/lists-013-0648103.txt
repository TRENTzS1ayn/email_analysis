> Title: An Abstract Model for HTTP Resource State
> Author(s): M. Baker
> Filename: draft-baker-http-resource-state-model-01.txt
> Pages: 
> Date: 05-Nov-01
> 
> The documented semantics of HTTP 1.1 methods, in particular POST,
> are not well understood, as demonstrated by debates such as whether
> IPP should have used POST or a new method, how to properly bind SOAP
> to HTTP, and the ever more common use of POST for tunneling new
> protocols such as XML-RPC.  This note attempts to define an abstract
> model for the state of HTTP URI scheme addressable resources
> consistent with HTTP 1.1, but hopefully more descriptive.
