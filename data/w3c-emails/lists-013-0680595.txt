hey ,

thnx very much for the information. do you have something about a
flow-chart of http (or shttp)
I need to know what is happening from the moment I press enter after I
entered an URL in the AdresBar
not like "it goes to the server and then to the DNS" but more like the
realation with TCP/IP,SSL and certificates.
I'am on a Reseach and I need this information. can you help me with it?

Thank you

Greetings
