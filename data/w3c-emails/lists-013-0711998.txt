That was the approach taken by the P3P WG. My motivation for asking
was that, at the time, there was no clear way to put a stake in the
ground and claim a header, from a W3C perspective. The default was to
use the HTTP extension framework.

We eventually got advice that it would probably be good enough to
publish an RFC, but it ate up a lot of time to get to that point. Of
course, we probably just didn't ask the right people. ;)

An index certainly would be a nice thing.

Thanks,
