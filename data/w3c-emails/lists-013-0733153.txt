Jeff, 

The thread started here:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xml-dist-app/2001Dec/0109.html

I've been meaning to do this for some time. If there's support, I'll
be glad to be the poor soul. I agree that it shouldn't be coupled
with SOAP's other registrations (as it appears to make people in that
WG equally nervous).

Larry, would you mind expanding upon this:
> That there is no registry for other protocol elements (headers and
> error codes) is not an accident.

Cheers,
