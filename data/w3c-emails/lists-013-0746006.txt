This is IMHO rather about the fear that we get a HTTP Header Registry with
numberous of useless headers, obstructing the creation of new useful
headers. Using RFCs or a registry provides some advantages and
disadvantages.

The use of RFCs means that headers are generated with a useful description
how they operate. It takes a lot of time for new headers to be documented,
but I think this might be worth the effort, but only in some cases.

On the other hand, creating a registry makes it possible to get a long list
of mostly useless headers, you don't know where to use them for. If you want
to set up a registry, ensure that you make some good RULES for adding
headers to the list. Make sure the list doesn't get poluted: all the useless
names.

A domain name registries (e.g. the .nl domain) runs out of name-space,
resulting in strange, stupid and funnie names. Even sentences without spaces
are registered.

Most companies just use there own headers for there products and I don't
think they conflict with others. A registry ensures this doesn't happen.
Some examples could be:

- header names are reviewed. They must be supplied with a name and
(generalized) description (of working). If agreed to the header, it's put on
the list.
- naming rules: add e.g. company or product name in the header

General purpose headers must be published in RFCs, so others can use them.
These don't follow the restrictions for the registry. I suppose you could
combine both, in order to benefit from the little time needed to register a
header on the registry and RFCs for general purpose headers, usable for
multiple applications. This combines both strengths, but requires a
registration policy...
