I think that the requirement is not merely that the header is
"useful" but that its interaction with the rest of HTTP has
been analyzed and documented. Lots of header extensions are
poorly considered and not interoperable as documented.

The original motivation -- to allow "SOAPAction" as a HTTP
header by putting it in a registry that would be established
by the XML protocol group -- is pretty suspect. They don't
need a "registry" to allow SOAPAction, they need to document
how SOAPAction is used, what it means, and how to implement
it interoperably. Is it end-to-end or hop-to-hop? Is it allowed
in trailers as well as headers? Is it only allowed with requests,
responses, only some methods or with all? How does it interact
with other parts of HTTP semantics?

So I think that "Values and their meaning must be documented
in a RFC" is not adequate for HTTP headers. "Values and their meaning
and interaction with the rest of HTTP must be reviewed in
a standards-track update or extension to HTTP".

Of course there are lots of headers and extensions that aren't
documented in standards-track RFCs, but then those headers and
extensions aren't standard.

Otherwise, you'll see "Safe:" and "Accept-Additions:" in the
header registry.
