No, it can't.  That is why it should never be implemented.  Since there
exist some buggy clents that send it, the proper thing to do in a proxy
is strip the header, just like many of the other undocumented bugs in
client implementations.

That field was created by some folks at Netscape and has never been part
of any draft of any version of HTTP.
