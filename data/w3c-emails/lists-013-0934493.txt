Apologies.. I have read a few sources, which showed the values as
constant.  I've a few documents from different sources, which all listed
the same field values.  

>No, it can't.  That is why it should never be implemented.  

We've got a proxy server on this network which uses the header
substantially.

Does this mean that we should implement parsing of the header, but not
send the header?   If we strip the header, do we still read it?  If not,
what are we supposed to do?

TIA...
