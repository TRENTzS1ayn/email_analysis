G'day people,
    I'm working on the bit of code to figure out multipart messages.
After reading over a few of the RFC's, I was wondering if there are any
good urls people know of which provide intepretations of the standard.
I'm working on this part by myself, so I'd like to see someone elses
interpretation for verification purposes.  
 
Thanks in advance...
