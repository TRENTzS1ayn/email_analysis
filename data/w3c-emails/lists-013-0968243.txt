Hi all,
I don't know it is a suitable group to ask you this question. But I hope someone of you can help me.
In my application I would like to accept request from a web browser, process it upon the link and do something, for example  show a form, a message to user at server ( not to browser- it sends browser nothing). 

All ideas are appreciated 

thanks in advance!
