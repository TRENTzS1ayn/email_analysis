A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts directories.


Title: HTTP Authentication Credential Caching Extension
Author(s): M. Nottingham
Filename: draft-nottingham-http-auth-cache-00.txt
Pages: 6
Date: 22-Feb-02

This note proposes an HTTP cache-control extension mechanism that
allows caching of authentication credentials, thereby allowing
authenticated resources to be served from cache without incurring the
cost of a round-trip to the origin server more than once during the
freshness lifetime of the credentials.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

To remove yourself from the IETF Announcement list, send a message to

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address. After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
"get draft-nottingham-http-auth-cache-00.txt".

A list of Internet-Drafts directories can be found in
http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html 
or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-nottingham-http-auth-cache-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
