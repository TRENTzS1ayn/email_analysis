"ietf-http-wg@w3.org" looks like it's shut down.
However, the original issue remains: this mailing list now silently
drops email from non-subscribed addresses and I'd like to move it.


Section 9.5 of RFC 2616 says:

   The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the
   entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource
   identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.

Now, later on in the section it notes that POST covers other cases, e.g.,

      - Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a
        form, to a data-handling process;

but some people have taken the first sentence to be somehow
definitional. ("is used" turning into "is only used" rather than
"may be used").

So I would suggest changing this wording -- and even putting up an
 errata -- that "The POST method is used to request that the origin
 server accept the entity enclosed in the request as data to be
 processed by the resource identified by the Request-URI in the
 Request-Line."
