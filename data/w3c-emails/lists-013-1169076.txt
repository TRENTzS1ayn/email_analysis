Maybe I am not understanding you.  It seems to me that if a client,
for example, regularly places an order and receives and acknowledgement
there is a possible replay attack.  

If an intermediary attacker intercepts the order he can impersonate
the server and offer a nonce from a previous transaction.  The client
then submits the order which is grabbed by the attacker and then the
attacker replays a previous acknowledgement with the dates changed.  A
similar attack might involve sending a fake 304 when in fact the
resource has changed.  This is what hash dates is supposed to prevent.
Am I missing something.
