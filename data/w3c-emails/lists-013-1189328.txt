I like the stated idea, but I don't see it reflected in the
specification fragment above.  What am I missing?  The date-related
pieces are still embedded in transaction-info, which is part of
entity-digest.  So it hasn't been separated out, and is therefore
subject to the vagaries of proxies.  OTOH, if it's made exclusively part
of a separate attribute, dheaders, then there's the possibility of its
being stripped by a MITM.
