  I think that this is a workable solution, if a verbose one, but I
  suppose that really is a good idea, and it minimizes the long term

JF>                                        ; format is <"> *LHEX <">

  Which leaves us with only whether or not to accept Pauls proposed
  change to use H(H(A1)) rather than H(A1).

  Paul - would you please give us a paragraph on the rationale for
  this; if we're going to do it I think that we will want something in
  the spec for how to use the capability it provides...
