One other question.  Dave Kristol asked me what keeps a man in 
the middle from stripping the digest from the response.  I said
the digest-required field.   But I'm not sure I'm right.  It looks
like only the server can use digest-required now.  Do we want to
let the client require a digest also?  If so how?
