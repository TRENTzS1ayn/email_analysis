  There appears to have been an omission in the syntax for the
  Authorization header - it was in my original draft for
  digest-required.  The text is correct in
  draft-ietf-http-authentication-00:

    3.2.2 The Authorization Request Header

    ...

       If the value of the digest-required parameter is "true", the
       response to this request MUST either include the "digest" field
       in its Authentication-Info header or the response should be an
       error message indicating the server is unable or unwilling to

  but the digest-required syntax got left out of the syntax for the
  header field.  The Digest-response production should be

     Digest-response   = 1#( username | realm | nonce | digest-uri
                             | response | [ digest ] | [ algorithm ]
                             | digest-required | opaque )
