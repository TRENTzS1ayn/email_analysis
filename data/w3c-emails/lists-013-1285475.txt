Here are suggested changes to the BNF in the authentication
spec.  The BNF for "entity-digest" and "Authentication-info"
are the only ones changed.  The differences are that in entity-digest
H(A1) is replaced by H(H(A1)) as suggested by Paul Leach and
the response status code is added as suggested by John Mallery.
In Authentication-info a new field dheaders is added to solve the
problem that proxies might changes headers.  I think these changes
can be characterized as largely fixes to interoperability
problems between authenticating agents and proxies.
