It's time for me to be stupid again.

The dheader-content gets digested in transaction-info, and it gets sent
in the clear as part of Authentication-Info.  Is there any expectation
(or requirement) that a receiver will validate the individual pieces of
dheader-content?  If not, then the sender could put arbitrary garbage in
dheader-content, and as long as the same garbage appeared in both
places, the bits will come out right, but nothing useful will have been
accomplished.
