The receiver is expected to re-calculate the entity-digest and compare
that with the value of the entity-digest sent in the
Authentication-info header to make sure they agree.  The sender could
indeed have sent garbage and have it check out, but only if the sender
knows the secret password (or more precisely H(H(A_1)) which is the
hash of the hash of the password).  This is because both the shared
secret and dheader-content are ingredients of the entity-digest.  All
that we can hope to do is assure that the response was sent by someone
who knows the password.
