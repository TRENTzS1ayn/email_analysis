Dear Dr. ietf-swap@w3.org,

I have been appointed to serve as the General Chair of the Summer 2002
edition of the SSGRR series of international conferences.

The SSGRR-2002S (Summer) conference on
"Infrastructure for e-Business, e-Education, e-Science, and e-Medicine" 
takes place in SSGRR (Scuola Superiore G. Reiss Romoli), the delux 
congress and educational center of the Telecom Italia Group of companies.

Programming-related papers (C,C++,JAVA,etc...) are of special interest for
this conference, and your contributions are welcome!

This is in L'Aquila near Rome, Italy, from July 29
(Monday) at 5pm (start of the Grand Opening) till August 4 (Sunday) at
10am (departure of busses to the Rome airport Fiumicino and the
railway station Tiburtina).

Most of the past participants beleive that this was one of the most
interesting, most useful, and definitely THE most hospitable conference
they ever attended.

The SSGRR-2002S will be open by Jerome Friedman from MIT
(laureate of the NOBEL PRIZE) and Travor Gruen-Kennedy of Citrix
(listed by some sources as one of the world's TOP-25 contributors to the
development of the Internet).

For details, see the WWW site of the conference
(www.ssgrr.it/en/ssgrr2002s/index.htm).
Among other things, this WWW site also includes the full-blown version
of the invitation letter-contract, with all relevant details
(www.ssgrr.it/en/ssgrr2002s/invitation.htm).

The soft deadline for you to decide if you are coming is May 25,
2002 (in the worst case you should respond before May 31th). By that 
date the place for you is unconditionally reserved. After 
that date, you will be accepted to the conference only if the existing 
240 places are not filled.

Before May 25, 2002, please send only the following: (a) TITLE,
(b) AUTHORS, (c) AFFILIATION, (d) ABSTRACT, and (e) STATEMENT THAT YOU
WILL COME 100% (answers like "maybe" will be treated as NO answer from
you). The full paper is due on June 20, 2002.

The early registration price for the 6-day stay at SSGRR is EURO1200
(if you represent an institution) or EURO1440 (if you come as an
individual). Coming without a paper costs you extra EURO600 or EURO720,
respectively. Deadline for the early registration is June 30, 2002.

If you come with an accompanying person, the early registration extra 
cost is EURO300, for 6 days of bed and breakfast, in an external hotel
(please note that the best external hotels are 4-star, and not nearly 
as comfortable as the accommodation in the SSGRR complex). The SSGRR 
complex includes only single-bed rooms, and therefore available only 
to those who come without an accompanying person.

If you have any questions, please check the WWW site of the conference 
and especially the part entitled FAQ(Frequently Asked Questions). If 
you still have questions or there is something that we can do for you,
please write to Organizing Committee 
at ssgrr2002s@rti7020.etf.bg.ac.yu (preferred)
or if absolutely necessary, to myself directly (vm@etf.bg.ac.yu).

Sincerely yours,

Professor V. M. Milutinovic,
General Chair of the SSGRR-2002S
(galeb.etf.bg.ac.yu/~vm/)

P.S. No matter if you will attend the SSGRR-2002S conference or not, 
please let us know if you like to be invited to the Winter edition 
of the year 2003 (SSGRR-2003W) to be held in the same place 
from January 6, 2003 at 5pm till January 12, 2003 at 10am. 
Shall we reinvite you?

Of course, if you wish not to receive again information about

your name from our list.
