In either case, imbeded LWS must be allowed to follow the spirit of
possibly continued header values and headers which may be too long.

Also, they encoding rule should probably be something like:

1.  Compose the subset of headers to be digested 
2.  Combine into a single string with CR/LF between headers
3.  Encode the whole string.

In otherwords, encode exactly what would have been sent over the wire
from the server.  Then all existing rules for separation, etc. just
apply after decoding.
