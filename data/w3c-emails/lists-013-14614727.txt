Web Intelligence (WI) has been recognized as a new direction for
scientific research and development to explore the fundamental roles
as well as practical impacts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) (e.g.,
knowledge representation, planning, knowledge discovery and data
mining, intelligent agents, and social network intelligence) and
advanced Information Technology (IT) (e.g., wireless networks,
ubiquitous devices, social networks, wisdom Web, and data/knowledge
grids) on the next generation of Web-empowered products, systems,
services, and activities. It is one of the most important as well as
promising IT research fields in the era of Web and agent intelligence.

The 2004 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence
(WI'04) will be jointly held with the 2004 IEEE/WIC/ACM International
Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology (IAT'04
http://www.maebashi-it.org/IAT04).  The IEEE/WIC/ACM 2004 joint
conferences are sponsored and organized by IEEE Computer Society
Technical Committee on Computational Intelligence (TCCI)
(http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~xwu/tcci/index.shtml), Web Intelligence
Consortium (WIC) (http://wi-consortium.org), and ACM-SIGART
(http://www.acm.org/sigart/).

Following the great successes of WI'01 held in Maebashi City, Japan
and WI'03 held in Halifax, Canada, WI 2004 provides a leading
international forum for researchers and practitioners (1) to present
the state-of-the-art of WI technologies; (2) to examine performance
characteristics of various approaches in Web-based intelligent
information technology; and (3) to cross-fertilize ideas on the
development of Web-based intelligent information systems among
different domains.  By idea-sharing and discussions on the underlying
foundations and the enabling technologies of Web intelligence, WI 2004
will capture current important developments of new models, new
methodologies and new tools for building a variety of embodiments of
Web-based intelligent information systems.
