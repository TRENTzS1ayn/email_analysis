Excuse me, have you considered reifying the entire 
http message = Headers + request-line | reply-line + entity body.

This was the idea behind the wrapped method suggested by your coauthor
Hallam-Baker.

Whether or not you have the wrapped method, distinguishing transport
header from entity headers should be helpful.

This is quite easy using dynamic generation and chunking.

Of course, it benefits from re-entrant servers/clients.

BTW, Everyone reversed encodings of base 64 since it is dead easy.
