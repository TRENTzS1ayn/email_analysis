The charter looks good to me. I have one small concern that, if others
agree, could be easily resolved.

These two sentences together make it sound lke the protocol will be for
client-server channels only. As the HTTP WG has discovered, calling
something a "client" or a "server" can cause all sorts of problems when you
later have "proxies". Further, we may want STLP to work in peer-to-peer
situations.

I suggest we reword the first sentence to read:

Several methods of providing a secure and authenticated channel
between computers on the Internet above the TCP layer have appeared.
