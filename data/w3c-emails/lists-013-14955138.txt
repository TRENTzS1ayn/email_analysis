I'm not sure how to say this in the charter in a clear and concise manner,
but I thought this was intended as an actual mechanism for passing data,
i.e. the example being ssl3 used for a web browser to exchange data with a
web server.  Note the ongoing data transmission.

I thought photuris was only for the negotiation phase and was not intended
for use in sending the actual data -- the model being that photuris did the
negotiation then something else (esp?) did the data transmission.
