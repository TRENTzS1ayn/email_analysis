Does the scope of the TLS working group include interaction with firewalls
and/or proxy servers? I think it should, as I think it will be difficult to
have a generic (i.e. non-protocol based) solution to this problem.

If scope includes this, it should be reflected in the draft charter.

I suggest adding the following language in the change bars be added to the
following paragraph of the draft:
