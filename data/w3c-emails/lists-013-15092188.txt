Perhaps I don't understand IETF procedure, but I am puzzled as to why
there is now a second mailing list.  It's not like the original
TLS list is getting too much traffic.

In fact, it's not getting enough traffic... for one, I can't find any
reference to any mail that included the URL for the STLP "strawman".

Where is it?
