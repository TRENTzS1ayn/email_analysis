Thanks Tom,

I have no dispute with the events you describe, but process integrity would
have been better served if you or Win had described this intent up front,
and answered the queries by other folks who, like me, could not figure out
what was going on.  This was especialy true in light of the press reports of
"Draft submitted to IETF."  I believe that what you are saying is that no draft
was "submitted," but rather "made available for review," albeit with rather late
instructions as to location and ownership.

All the above reflects my personal belief that this particular BOF-cum-WG
should stretch to maintain the status of "Caesar's wife;" and also reflects
my concern at the questions being raised by others last week.

Thanks again for your prompt response.
