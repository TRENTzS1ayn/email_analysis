There has indeed been some unfortunate confusion surrounding the
discussion paper, but it's difficult to comprehend some of the ideas
being bandied about lately - "sub-rosa" dealings, a Netscape-Microsoft
conspiracy to bypass the IETF ?!?, etc.

As I see it, two mistakes were made:
1 - the creation of two mailing lists, ietf-tls@w3.org and tls-draft@w3.org,
    when one would have been sufficient
2 - the discussion paper was widely distributed both by hardcopy and
    email to people who had previously commented on either SSL or PCT,
    but was not posted to either of the above lists nor to the SSL
    or PCT lists.

Tom Stephens has addressed both of these:

But to further dispel any Watergate-type speculation ("What did he
know and when did he know it?"), here is the cover letter I received
with the original stlp paper.  The tone of the letter is clearly
inclusive, and may help to clear up any lingering misunderstandings.

My only criticism of this working group is that the chairman has
not yet taken an active role in moderating the discussion.  Perhaps
that will change soon.
