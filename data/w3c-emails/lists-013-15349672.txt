I am responding to David Kemp's comments about password authentication
separately, because I believe the topic is important enough to deserve
separate treatment.

password-based security is always free not to support it; in fact, it
takes an explicit decision by both parties to share a password before
password authentication even becomes possible.  People who make that
decision are, in my view, no different from those who accept 40-bit
encryption, or proprietary, relatively unstudied RC4 over
heavily-analyzed (triple-)DES; we cryptographers might prefer that they
choose otherwise, but we recognize that security must sometimes yield to
other practical priorities.
