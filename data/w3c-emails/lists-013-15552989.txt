I agree with most of your points about passwords.  However, the scenario
that you draw about extensions would imply that we should think about
mechanisms by which extensions to TLS may be made cleanly -- reserve some
record type numbers that are vendor-specific, and mandate that the rest
be not used except as officially sanctioned blah blah blah when/if TLS
gets revised.  If we don't do this, then we risk creating compatibility
problems in the future.
