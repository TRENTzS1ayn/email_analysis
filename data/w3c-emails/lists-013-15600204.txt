What is apparently being proposed here is that pre-encrypted data be
handled through a new handshake.  If this is to be done, then the
handshake itself must be modified to allow transmission of specific,
fixed encryption and MAC keys, as opposed to the normal derivation
process, which produces keys dependent on random challenges and the
like.  (The adapatation of the "change cipher spec" message in the STLP
document is just such a modification.)  Obviously, the addition of
another public-key operation to the server's load should be avoided if
possible; the natural solution is therefore to deliver the keys used for
pre-encryption using keys exchanged and derived through a normal
handshake.  Hence the method used in PCT v2, and in the STLP document.

Unless I've misunderstood the proposal, it sounds like we agree....
