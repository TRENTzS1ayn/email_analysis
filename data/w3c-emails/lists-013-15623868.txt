> What's wrong with public key cryptography?

A great deal, but I'm sure you already know most of it.  It's big, it's
slow, it's expensive to license (for a few more years anyway), it requires
an infrastructure that is not in place (partially due to licensing issues
of the underlying technology), it presents usability issues (you can type
your password into any machine anywhere, but have to somehow carry your
private key around with you) and on and on.

Public key is also the "wave of the future."  When "the future" will be
remains to be seen, despite repeated assurances of RSN.  It's a great
technology, but mandating use of it and nothing else seems rather
presumptuous and arrogant.
