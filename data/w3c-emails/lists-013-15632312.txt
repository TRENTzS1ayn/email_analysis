OK, the following is just a request for information; a reality check
for myself to see if I'm missing something fundamental here.  I have
the uncomfortable feeling that we are talking past one another rather
than communicating.

Consider the following thought experiment:

* PCT 2.0 protocol, using password authentication, where the password
  can be only a 4 digit number (10,000 possibilities), and no
  public/private key pairs at the two endpoints

* 2 Princeton students with a copy of a PCT session sniffed off
  the wire (no active attacks allowed)

Can they, or can they not break the session in a minute or so by
exhausting over the password space?
