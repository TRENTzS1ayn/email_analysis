I haven't looked at PCTv2 recently, so a caveat.  However, if you just
think about how SSL and PCT work wrt exchanging a master key and hashing
down to read/write keys that are 40-bits, one could imagine the passwords
be protected by a >>40-bit key (probably not the master key directly,
but perhaps something else derived from it).  Network eavesdroppers that
wish to perform an exhaustive search of the space of passwords must also
determine this other key, which is difficult.

This may not be a kosher way to do things wrt export, however, since
one could imagine that secret messages are transmitted in this way (the
password is the message) which are protected by >40-bit crypto.
