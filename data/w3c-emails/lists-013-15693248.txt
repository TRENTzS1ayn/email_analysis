I agree it does no harm to double-encrypt (presuming the result isn't an
import/export
issue) and wasn't intentionally suggesting support for special handling of
pre-encrypted
data.  The ability to use renegotiation with  NULL-WITH-NULL CipherSpec before 
sending the file and resuming with the previous CipherSpec when it's done
seems a small
price if double-encryption were undesired.
