since when is ssl3 "current standard practice"?  last I checked SSL2 was
current practice.  I do not think it is at all reasonable to use either PCT
or SSL3 as some sort of "current standard practice".

I *wholly* agree that PCT and SSL3 and in fact other mutatations of one or
the other or both or something completely different are *completely* valid
proposals.
