The key difference between the SSL3 handshake hashes and your proposed
MAC is that the SSL3 handshake hashes use two redundant MACs
alternating MD5 and SHA.  In order to construct a hash collision you
must have two messages that collide in both MD5 and SHA simultaneously.
I contend that this makes the SSL3 handshake hashes
collision-intractable.
