While I agree that an extension mechanisim might be useful, I think
there's more utility in keeping the standard simple to understand
and implement.  An extension mechanisim that allowed vendor-specific
extensions would probably require yet another negotiation, if you don't
want to repeat the HTML problem of conflicting vendor-added
features- i.e. "do I write my TLS to talk to Microscape's TLS
extentions, or Netsoft's?").  Adding another negotiation would increase
the complexity of the TLS standard.   Look at the RFCs, it's the simple
standards that have been successful and widely deployed, while there are
many super-flexible but complicated standards that have few implementations.

I think it would be better to create one simple TLS standard, then add on
additional standards or IANA registration schemes for things like
password-exchamge protocols, additional CipherSuites, support
for pre-encrypted data, etc. rather than trying to do everything now.
