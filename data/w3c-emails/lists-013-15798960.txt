  I think you misunderstand the purpose of using both MD5 and SHA for
the handshake hash.  If SHA were compromised we could just deprecate
all cipher suites that included SHA, without having to immediately
change the base protocol, since the handshake hash includes MD5 as
well.  If the handshake hash were just SHA, then we would have to change
the protocol if it fell.
