By 'STLP' do you mean "Microsoft's proposal" or "the eventual
standard that the TLS working group produces"?

"STLP" has become overloaded- some people take it mean Microsoft's
"strawman", others are using it as the name of the standard
that this group is discussing.

I'd like to suggest that we use a diferent name for the standard
that the working group is supposed to produce.  I have been
calling it "TLS", I would like to propose that we call it that.
Using a name that is not owned by any corporate entity should
reduce the amount of political manouvering that is going on.

While I applaud your willingness to meet and to accomplish
things, I'm not sure that calling a meeting like this doesn't
voliate the spirit of the IETF.  Only a few of the people who
have an interest in the working-group would be able to attend.
I think it would be more in keeping with the spirit of the IETF to 
do as much as possible via the mailing list, where all can participate.


Having said that, if there's a meeting in the bay area I won't miss it.
