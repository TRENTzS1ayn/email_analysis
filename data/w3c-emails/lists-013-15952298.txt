Since the STLP strawman was clearly labeled as a "discussion draft"
and "incomplete" and yet the media still immediately started calling
it the Microsoft proposal, I don't think any name, including "TLS",
would be immune from political influence.

I'm agnostic on the choice - everyone here calls it "STLP or TLSP or
whatever" anyway.

As someone who won't be able to attend, I believe a face to face
meeting would be valuable to speed things along.  Other venues (hallways
at IETF and USENIX) don't allow many of the interested parties to attend,
yet that's where much of the work gets done.  As long as the results
of the meeting are reported out and those with objections have opportunity
of reclama, I don't think a meeting violates the spirit of the IETF.

Remember that the intelligence of a committee is inversely proportional
to the square of the number of participants.  A properly-composed
small group may be able to move things along smartly, in both senses
of the word.
