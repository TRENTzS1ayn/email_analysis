The machine handling "http-wg@hplb.hpl.hp.com" is
going to be decommissioned, and we're going to reactivate
this mailing list (ietf-http-wg@w3.org) as a replacement.

You're already on it!

You can unsubscribe by sending a message with

         unsubscribe

in the SUBJECT line (only) to
            ietf-http-wg-request@w3.org


for more details http://www.w3.org/Mail/Request.html 

There continue to be occasional issues on HTTP,
a new to review proposed errata. Moving HTTP/1.1
to full Standard may be a ways off (because of
dependency on other specifications that are not
yet Standard), but will also be a future topic.

Thanks very much to Andy Norman for his many years of
hosting http-wg@hplb.hpl.hp.com / http-wg@cuckoo.hplb.hpl.hp.com

I will send a separate mail to the old http-wg list(s)
inviting people to (re)subscribe here. If you get
this message, you're already subscribed and do not
need to do anything.
