I won't be able to be on the West Coast that week (I have too many meetings
and other commitments in and around Boston). However I would be willing to
"Teleparticipate" if the meeting can be arranged for Monday or Tuesday (I have
an all day commitment on Wednesday and will be traveling on Thursday and
Friday [by bicycle]).
