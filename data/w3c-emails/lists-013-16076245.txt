SSL 3 is NOT just a paper protocol. It exists in products currently in
Beta. There are at least 5 independent implementations currently
interoperating. I know of at least 4 more implementation efforts that
are underway (2 in Java and 1 in Perl).

In what way is SSL 3 not open?

Thousands of hours have gone into the development of SSL 3 (by engineers
both inside of Netscape and out). Much of that time was devoted to
analysis of the cryptographic properties. I can only assume that a
similar amount of work went into PCT v2.

The Microsoft strawman draft of STLP has not had that kind of analysis.
The amount of work to come to the same degree of confidence in a
protocol or implementation grows exponentially as the design gets more
complicated. It's a sad fact that while adding feature A or feature B to
an existing design, no compromise in the security of the system will
result, but adding both can open an overlooked covert channel.

The STLP strawman is more complicated than either SSL 3 or PCT 2. I
don't think it is a reasonable starting point if we hope to make the
schedules outlines in the charter.

It would be naive to expect a day or two of meetings to be able to
resolve some very difficult issues.

While security is no longer my primary focus at Netscape, I will find
the time to try and address some of the issues related to MACs,
pre-encrypted files, etc.
