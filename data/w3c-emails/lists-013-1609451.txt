Oops, sorry, this one slipped by my radar until now.  I'll
redirect my response to ietf-http-wg@w3.org.

I'll all for cleaning up the definition of POST, but IMO, proceeding
with text that has most often been cited by those who tunnel over POST
(IPP, SOAP), is the wrong way to go.

I could perhaps go for this definition if it were amended to say
something like; 

 "The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept
  the entity enclosed in the request as data to be processed by
  the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.
  The entity SHOULD NOT include any instruction or direction to
  perform an action other than simple form-like submission."
