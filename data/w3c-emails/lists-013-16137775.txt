Taher,

Please pardon me for not knowing the details about the process using
which SSLv3 was created.  I had heard about the SSLv3 in draft form
while at MS (the current[?] evil empire), but it was already quite far
along, and must have missed any call-for-participation that went out
earlier.

My other points about the direction of IETF and needing to decide on
how weight to give to the effort already expended by various companies
or researchers, as well as about care in using security/cryptography
terminology still stand.
