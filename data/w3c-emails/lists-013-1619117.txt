HTTP has been plagued by this debate for a long time.  I'd prefer to
make the spec clearer with respect to correct implementation of the
protocol as measured by success in interoperability.  The existing
wording clearly fails this test (in that it attempt to create some
sort of abstract notion using the term 'subordinate' in a way most
people don't seem to understand).

Your suggested wording adds a 'SHOULD NOT' that is not motivated by an
interoperability issue - it is an expression of a policy preference:
that other protocols should not be tunneled over HTTP.  As such, I
don't think it improves the clarity of the specification (especially
since it does not make that motivation clear, leaving the reader to
wonder _why_ one should not use it in that way, and because 'simple
form-like submission' is hardly a tight distinction).

I think that the changes Jeff suggests in his post are clear and
policy neutral - just what is needed.
