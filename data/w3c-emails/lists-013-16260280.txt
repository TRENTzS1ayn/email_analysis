Barbara;

Of course we did put in the comments that interested people seemed to agree 
on. However, when you receive conflicting comments from different groups of 
people, it is really hard to go one way or the other and somehow a decision 
needs to be made.

I hope that through our discussions in the next meeting and in the IETF that 
we can resolve those differences that are actually hard to accomodate 
together in a single spec. It is and was always our objective to generate the 
best solutions that meet the fucntionality, security and efficiency (perhaps 
in that order) for the community and we actually did take the initiative to 
go to the IETF to get to the point where we have an industry standard. 
However, as you know the better standards are the ones that have actually 
been implemented and used.

I am expecting that the IETF will actually produce a different protocol from 
the current SSLv3, and always committed to supporting the effort, however, we 
actually have quite a bit of experience in implementing SSL both ourselves 
and by helping others resolve spec ambiguities and we hope that the IETF 
group will take that into consideration. I actually wished that you had 
forwarded the PCT objectives and comments to us before coming out with PCT -- 
perhaps you would have been surprised with our reaction.

The one thing I still do not like is separation of algorithms in defining 
cipherspec. I hope we can come to some agreement.

Cheers,

Taher
