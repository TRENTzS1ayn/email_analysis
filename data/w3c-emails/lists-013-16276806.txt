As Barb indicated in her posting, the meeting to discuss the TLS
protocol is set for Wednesday, May 29th at the Garden Court Hotel in
Palo Alto, California.  In order to ensure we have a large enough
meeting room, please send me an RSVP by 5/24.  

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding
accommodations, transportation, etc.
