No, that would be over-constraining the protocol (adding a requirement
that isn't necessary for interoperability just means people will ignore
the requirement).  POST is still the place for spill-over semantics.

However, I do think that the definition should include ALL of the things
for which POST is used, including the semantics of usenet news and mail
for which this method does continue to apply and for which Larry's
suggested definition isn't sufficient.  There is absolutley nothing
wrong with the definition supplied in RFC 2616.  It should not be changed,
and certainly isn't errata.
