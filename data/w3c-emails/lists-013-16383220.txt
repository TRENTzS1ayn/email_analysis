Tom,
Two questions about the meeting on May 29:
1. Do you have particular expectations of the participants?  For example,
   you might expect them to have read the 4/8 Microsoft paper and be
   familiar with SSL V2, SSL V3, and PC V1 specifications.  How about PCT
   V2?  Hannah?  A list such as used by recent W3C Security work group
   meetings might be useful to avoid making it a grand education session.
2. Do you have an agenda?  Or a prioritized list of discussion topics?
   Looking at the notes that preceeded the announcement of this meeting
   does not help much.  (I have some ideas, you may have a different list.)

Thanks - Mark
