Mark,

I hope to post a list of proposed discussion topics within the next
couple of days.  This list will be compiled from the topics raised on
this list to date.  If you or anyone else wishes to suggest topics for
discussion which have not yet been posted to the list, then please post
your suggestions and I will incorporate them into the document.  On the
morning of 5/29, the meeting attendees can decide which of the topics
should be addressed at the meeting given the limited amount of time we
have available to us.

>2. Do you have an agenda?  Or a prioritized list of discussion topics?
