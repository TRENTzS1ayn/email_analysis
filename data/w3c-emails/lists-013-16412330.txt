This does not work against a stream cipher that incorporates feedback of the 
resulting ciphertext into the key stream.  Such ciphers are vulnerable if 
you reuse the key, but require much more sophisticated techniques to break.
Arguing whether such techniques classify as differential cryptanalysis is 
at best nitpicking.

To quote ISO 8072, the Transport Service Definition, connectionless mode
transmission occurs "without any requirement to maintain any logical
relationship among multiple transport-service-data-units".  Sounds like
UDP to me.  To which ISO model were you referring?

Regardless, if there is no extra complexity associated with making the
protocol appropriate for UDP, what are your objections to doing so?
Nitpicking about terminology that isn't even relevant to the topic of
discussion is an annoying waste of time.
