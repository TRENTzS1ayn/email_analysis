I don't see how this method "does continue to apply" when it isn't
used in any of the methods I've ever seen for submitting email,
forms, weblogs, Wikis, etc.

Can you find an example of this, actually? I think the example
is bogus. I've certainly never seen one. (Yes, it's easy to make
one, but we're talking about "common usage" not "possible usage").
In web forms I've seen for web submitted mail, Wikis, Blogs,
etc., the Request URI is not the URI of the resource, and the
entity enclosed is form-data, not a new subordinate entity.
