I would like to make a suggestion on how we might approach the conflicting
goals of quick-time-to-market and using a standards process to develop a
standard.

Here's my idea:

1. take the SSL3 spec, as-s plus errata, and make that a "best current
practice" or "informational" RFC.  This would produce the following:

  - it would get something out IMMEDIATELY which would satisfy the vendors that
    are sqeaking about quick results
  - it would document throught the IETF RFC process the current protocol
  - it would require (relatively) little work, since only the editing for RFC
    formatting rules would have to be done.

Note that since there are said to be 8 known current implementation we could
ask those 8 implementors to review the doc and that we we'd know that this
document really is best current practice.

2. follow a more conventional standards process to develop a TLS standard,
rather than simply running as fast as possible to get "SSL3.0bis" which is
what seems to be happening now.  By a more conventional process I mean:

  - develop a set of requirements (for example enumerating interests in non-web
    applications, pre-encryption, specific crypto options, passwords, etc.)
  - develop an architecture (i.e. decide and document how this would relate to
    key management schemes, public key infrastructure schemes, ipsec, ppp sec,
    etc.)
  - develop a protocol.

This would take a while.  However, since a bunch of smart people put a lot
of work into SSL3, SSH, PCT, etc. I think there is a fair chance that what
comes out the other end will look a lot like the current protocols.
