There were some follow-on discussions on these topics after our IETF 
meeting.  Another proposed resolution process was proposed as a result 
of these discussions and a summary of it will be sent to the list.  I 
think that Win plans to do that.  I'll be happy to do it; however, I 
think it's better if Win does.

Regards,
Eric
