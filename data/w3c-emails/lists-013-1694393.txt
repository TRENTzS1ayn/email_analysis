Are you sure? I'm surprised at that. The RFC says 502 means:
   The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid
   response from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to
   fulfill the request.
I would have thought "invalid response" means a response that is
contrary to (non-conforming with) the specification. I would take
it to mean the upstream server actually responded, but incorrectly.
How do you define "invalid response"?
