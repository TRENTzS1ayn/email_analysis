Yes, I am sure.  ECONNREFUSED is a response, but not an HTTP response.

Why does that matter?  The purpose of HTTP status codes is to define the
range of automated action that can be taken by the user agent in reaction
to the response.  The rest of the information is in the text of the 502
message body.

You will find that what the user agent needs to do for no-connection is
identical to what it needs to do for other 502 situations.
