To me, the absence of any HTTP-level data does not constitute an
HTTP-level response; ECONNREFUSED is a (valid) TCP-level response, which
implies that no HTTP-level response will be received, so there is
no HTTP-level response that has been received that one could ascertain
the (in)validity of.

I didn't say I was trying to distinguish between temporary and
permanent failures. I'm trying to identify failures that I believe
may practically (not theoretically) be worth retrying, and that
are guaranteed to preserve at-most-once semantics.

At any rate, I have my answer, HTTP 1.1 simply does not convey the
information I seek. I won't trouble this list further on the subject.

Pity that there is a special code for a rare case, and no code for the
common case of ECONNREFUSED.
