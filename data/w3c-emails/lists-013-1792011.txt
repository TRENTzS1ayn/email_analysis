Bob,

Could you at least describe the differing behavior you are seeing
between implementations?  I think it would be wise to clarify the spec
to get implementations to "do the same thing" if we can on similar
failures.  Any time we are getting different implemeters reading the same
spec and producing different behavior in the same circumstance, it is showing
a shortcoming in the spec.

And while HTTP is not TCP specific, I can't see any reason why some
header could not be invented to convey TCP specific failure information,
if you wanted to explore an extension to HTTP further.
Thanks,
- Jim
