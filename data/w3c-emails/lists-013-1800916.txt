Proxy-agent: Netscape-Proxy/3.52
returns 500 for ECONNREFUSED
returns 500 for unknown (no DNS entry) host

Server: Squid/2.2.STABLE5
returns 503 for ECONNREFUSED
returns 500 for unknown (no DNS entry) host

I suspect y'all have access to a broader set of proxy servers than I do.

"connection refused" and "unknown host" are not TCP-specific concepts...
