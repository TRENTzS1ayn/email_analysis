My understanding is that since auth-scheme ends with a token and
auth-param starts with a token, LWS is implied by the BNF:

   implied *LWS
      The grammar described by this specification is word-based. Except
      where noted otherwise, linear white space (LWS) can be included
      between any two adjacent words (token or quoted-string), and
      between adjacent words and separators, without changing the
      interpretation of a field. At least one delimiter (LWS and/or
      separators) MUST exist between any two tokens (for the definition
      of "token" below), since they would otherwise be interpreted as a
      single token.

However, for consistency and readability reasons, it should probably
be made explicit, like in the challenge case:

      challenge   = auth-scheme 1*SP 1#auth-param


Alex.
