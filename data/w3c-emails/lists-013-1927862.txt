I have seen a discrepancy in server implementations on
spacing in the the content-type header.

The example in 2616, 14.17 includes a space between
the ';' and the parameter, while the grammers in
3.6 and 3.7 don't seem to allow this.

Is there some implied whitespace rule here, or should
there be no space in the 14.17 example?

Thanks,
Keith
