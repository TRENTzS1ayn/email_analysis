"qs" is somewhat special, see below.

Well, after reading RFC 2616 again, I have to agree with this view.

In addition, the "qs" parameter does affect Apache's negotiation
algorithm when used within an AddType directive, so you would not have
to struggle with .var files - this can be a major benefit. Of course,
the "qs" parameter should not be included in the Content-Type header,
but so far I haven't seen any client that complains about it.
