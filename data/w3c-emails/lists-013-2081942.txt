You may be able to mark them with "Cache-Control: private" to avoid
the above problem. Also, as somebody suggested to me off-list, you can
try a must-revalidate cache-control directive so that the content is
cachable by shared caches but the server has some control based on
client request headers. The latter option requires must-revalidate
support in caches and may cause the same IE problems you mention
above; simple but not a very robust solution.

Good luck,

Alex.
