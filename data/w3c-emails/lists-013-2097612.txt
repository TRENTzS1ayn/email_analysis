This draft will be submitted as the initial values for the HTTP header
registries; please have a look over it for accuracy and completeness
(accuracy is more important at this stage). Much of the data is
machine-generated from the RFC2629 citation library [1]. Please contact me
directly if you have any corrections or questions.

The draft is long, so it may be easier to browse the HTML version [2],
generated from the same page.
