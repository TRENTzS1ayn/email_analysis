Is the :port segment intended to be optional in the request-URI used in
a CONNECT request? The text in RFC 2817 implies it is always used, but
it is actually optional in an 'authority' segment according to RFC 2396.

(I tried a couple of proxies and they behave differently if the :port is
ommitted: Traffic-Server assumes port 80, Squid assumes 443)

Regards,

joe
