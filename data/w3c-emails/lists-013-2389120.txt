Yes. You may want to name your header field starting with "X-" to
avoid possible but unlikely collisions with [future] "official" header
field names and to follow a tradition. For example:
X-Rajmahendra: foo=bar

You probably want to keep the value syntax simple so that
intermediaries do not have trouble parsing or forwarding the values.
If possible, avoid things like quoted strings with special delimiters
inside, etc.
 
If you header has a hop-by-hop semantics (see RFC 2616), you must list
it in the Connection: header field.

You do not need to register it.
