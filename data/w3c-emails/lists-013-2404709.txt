I'm confused by this paragraph in section 14.39 of 2616:

   The TE header field only applies to the immediate connection.
   Therefore, the keyword MUST be supplied within a Connection header
   field (section 14.10) whenever TE is present in an HTTP/1.1 message.

Since TE is already defined as hop-by-hop in section 13.5.1, it implies
that any hop-by-hop headers used MUST be supplied in a Connection
header, which is incorrect.

Why is there a MUST that TE specifically is included in a Connection
header? Is it really for compatibility with RFC2068-compliant proxies,
which don't know that TE is hop-by-hop?

Regards,

joe
