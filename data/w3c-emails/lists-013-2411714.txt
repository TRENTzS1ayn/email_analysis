Joe,

The MUST clause wording is clearly buggy. The clause should
either be deleted or reworded to specify a different reason.

FWIW, in our compliance tests, we saw only one HTTP proxy
obeying this MUST and sending
Connection: close, TE
when forwarding chunked messages. On the other hand, the same proxy
was forwarding TE header passed to it, violating another, far more
important MUST!

Alex.
