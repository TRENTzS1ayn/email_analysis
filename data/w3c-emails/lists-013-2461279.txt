Hello

I'm doing a webdav server for a internet explorer client and I have a
problem when the client sends put for create a new resource because it don't
sends the body. I try to send continue (HTTP/1.1 100 Continue) but this
didn't works. How I can get the body ?


This is what client and server sends:

Client:
HEAD /prueba1.txt.txt HTTP/1.1
Accept-Language: es-ar, en-us;q=0.2
Translate: f
Content-Length: 0
User-Agent: Microsoft Data Access Internet Publishing Provider DAV
Host: 192.168.0.1:81
Connection: Keep-Alive

Server:
HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND

Client:
PUT /prueba1.txt.txt HTTP/1.1
Accept-Language: es-ar, en-us;q=0.2
Translate: f
Content-Length: 0
User-Agent: Microsoft Data Access Internet Publishing Provider DAV
Host: 192.168.0.1:81
Connection: Keep-Alive

thank,
