I am not a WebDaV expert, but from pure HTTP point of view, you do get
a body. It is a body of zero length as indicated by the value of the
Content-Length header field of the PUT request. In other words, it
seems like the client wants to create an empty (zero length) file
named "prueba1.txt.txt".

The HEAD request is irrelevant. I am guessing that the client is
trying to check whether the file already exists (instead of relying on
various If-* HTTP headers to do the right thing?).

Finally, please note that your response probably violates HTTP. It
does not have a Date: header field, to start with. Are you running a
clock-less server? Also, you use persistent connection (default) but
the transfer-length is unknown (no transfer encoding or content length
set).


HTH,

Alex.
