Section 5.1.1 is essentially a table-of-contents for request method
specifications. For example, "GET" is described in Section 9.3. Thus,
I think the RFC wording is acceptable.

As far as I can see, RFC 2616 does not prohibit use of entity bodies
in GET or HEAD. Thus, according to the section 4.3, there might be a
body transmitted with those requests:

   The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the
   inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in
   the request's message-headers. A message-body MUST NOT be included in
   a request if the specification of the request method (section 5.1.1)
   does not allow sending an entity-body in requests.

How many servers/proxies would be confused by GET bodies is a
different question.

HTH,

Alex.
