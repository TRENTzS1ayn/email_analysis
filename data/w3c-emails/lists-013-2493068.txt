issue 119 "MESSAGE-BODY",
and thread started with
http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1997q3/0393.html


It looks like we didn't actually close this issue well enough,
since it's still being raised. Certainly the archive record is that
the intent was (for compatibility) to disallow bodies for
GET, HEAD and DELETE, but possibly allow bodies on other
methods unless explicitly disallowed (for extensibility's
sake).
