Aha! This answers my question nicely, thank you.  I was unaware of the 
existance of the Last Call document.

The reason I brought this up was because I was running into a problem 
where a piece of client software was adding a "Content-Length: 0" header 
to all GET requests it sent.  All the webservers that I tried it on 
completed the requests without complaint but when a (transparent) squid 
proxy was added into the mix it stopped working (with a 411 response 
code, of all things).  I wasn't sure which end of the problem I should fix.

Thanks!
