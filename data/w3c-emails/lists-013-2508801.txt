The discussion at the above URL implies that some part of the RFC
prohibits bodies for GETs. Could anybody point to that part? I do not
see anything prohibiting bodies in Section 9.3 "GET".

Hmm.. I am surprised you are sure now, but perhaps I am missing
something in the RFC that the above URLs helped you find. To me, it
still looks like the RFC does not prohibit (and, hence, allows) bodies
for GETs. Please clarify.

Thanks,
