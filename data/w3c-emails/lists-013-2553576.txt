Roy, you're mixing server and client responsibilities. It's
quite possible to mandate "must not send a body with GET" for
clients and also mandate "must parse and ignore message bodies
with GET" for servers.

I think this was mandated for legacy reasons.

While this is mandated for future extensibility.

I don't think the two are incompatible.
