Section 4.3 of RFC 2068 says

    The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the
    inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in
    the request's message-headers. A message-body MAY be included in a
    request only when the request method (section 5.1.1) allows an
    entity-body.

and in RFC 2616 it says

    The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the
    inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in
    the request's message-headers. A message-body MUST NOT be included in
    a request if the specification of the request method (section 5.1.1)
    does not allow sending an entity-body in requests. A server SHOULD
    read and forward a message-body on any request; if the request method
    does not include defined semantics for an entity-body, then the
    message-body SHOULD be ignored when handling the request.

In both cases, the first sentence is unambiguous.  The example you gave
had neither Content-Length nor Transfer-Encoding.
