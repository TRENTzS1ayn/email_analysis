Please don't mix up SMTP and 'Internet mail'. SMTP is push, and stateful.
'Internet mail' is a 'protocol' (in the sense that it is a
collection of conventions for communication) consisting of
several actual protocols at layer 7. 'Internet mail' as a whole
may be called stateless (there are states at a still higher level,
in that mails get identified as replies to other mails,...).
'Internet mail' as a whole requires both pull and push
(if only one is done, the email won't reach the recipient),
and therefore cannot be called either 'pull' or 'push'.


Regards,    Martin.
