Hi there,

RFC 2616, Section 13.2.4 "Expiration Calculations" contains
the following MUST:

   The cache MUST attach Warning
   113 to any response whose age is more than 24 hours if such warning
   has not already been added.

The context of that MUST is expiration calculation and, hence, cache
hits. On the other hand, attaching a Warning to misses may help in
case there is a non-1.1-compliant cache upstream.

Did the author(s) intend for the above MUST to apply to HIT responses
only?


Thanks,

Alex.
