If the body of the POST request is the result of filling out a form,
then the contents are name,value pairs as you expect.  They will be
url-encoded just like the GET request would be, but the name,value
pairs are in the body, not the end of the url.

Most CGI programs I have seen parse EITHER the end of the URL (query
variables) for the GET method, OR they parse the body text for the POST
method.  BUT NOT BOTH.  It is possible to send such a request, but
I don't know how to get a standard browser to do it.  If you are writing
your own sender, you could build such a request, but most CGI programs
will ignore the url query variables.

Hi

How the POST request is sent internally? Is the body of POST  request is sent as (name, value) pair?

Also can i send a POST request along with some parameters, some thing like below?

----------
POST /servername/some_virtual_directory/somefile.asp?id=x&name=y
Some headers...

and then body..
-------------


thanks,
regards,
