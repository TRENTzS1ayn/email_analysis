The format for forms submission is not in the HTTP specification,
it's in the HTML specification. Other forms languages might
use different formats and protocols for transmission of forms data.


HTML 4.0.1 http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13
specifies how different attributes of the FORM element
(method, enctype) control how the form data is encoded,
at least when the 'action' is a HTTP URI. There are only
3 cases specified:
 method get, enctype application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 method post, enctype application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 method post, enctype multipart/form-data

There is no combination of parameters in HTML 4.0.1 defined
that will generate combinations of url encoding and
form-data. While some forms processors will also accept ';'
instead of '&' as a field separator in
application/x-www-form-urlencoded, it isn't mandated
in HTML 4.0.1.

Of course, other kinds of forms are possible, and compatible
with HTTP, but not necessarily with different HTTP server's
predefined modules for handling HTML forms.
