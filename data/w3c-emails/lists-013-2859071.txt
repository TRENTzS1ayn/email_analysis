RFC 2616 BNF defaults to case-insensitive for string literals:

    "literal"
       Quotation marks surround literal text. Unless stated otherwise,
       the text is case-insensitive.

but the HTTP version string is defined as

    The version of an HTTP message is indicated by an HTTP-Version field
    in the first line of the message.

        HTTP-Version   = "HTTP" "/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT

    Note that the major and minor numbers MUST be treated as separate
    integers and that each MAY be incremented higher than a single digit.
    Thus, HTTP/2.4 is a lower version than HTTP/2.13, which in turn is
    lower than HTTP/12.3. Leading zeros MUST be ignored by recipients and
    MUST NOT be sent.

Personally, I never had any intention that the "HTTP" be case-insensitive,
and I am not aware of any clients that send it lowercase, nor any server
that would accept it as lowercase.  Doing so is a waste of cycles.  So,
I'd like that paragraph above to say:

    The version of an HTTP message is indicated by an HTTP-Version field
    in the first line of the message.  HTTP-Version is case-sensitive.

Servers would still be allowed to process it as case-insensitive under
the general robustness principle, but clients are no longer given the
excuse of "But it says in the standard ...".
