Apache server and some proxies seem to handle "http/" just fine.

True, but so are many (if not most) of the HTTP parsing requirements.
I would think that errata is for fixing errors, not optimizing.

If you disagree, should "implied LWS" and similar WasteOfCycles
requirements then be removed to optimize and simplify parsing?  Most
clients don't use and most, if not all, implementations fail to
support related BNFs anyway.

In the ideal world, I would support such simplifications, but it seems
to me that changing the existing protocol in such a way without also
changing the version number is not a good idea. There are already
several "subsubversions" of HTTP/1.1 that we have to deal with.
