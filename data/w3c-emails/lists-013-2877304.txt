> Apache server and some proxies seem to handle "http/" just fine.

No, they don't.  It just seems that way because you have no means of
determining their internal interpretation.  Apache will consider the
client to be a broken HTTP/1.0, or simply respond in HTTP/0.9.

Errata is for fixing specification errors.  Given that I wrote that
section of the specification, I know it is an error, and therefore it
is errata unless someone can explain why it is a necessary "feature".
