Jeff,

Thanks for a clarification! It looks like the answer depends on
whether "it is interesting" to add this Warning to a miss. That is, whether
there is any "use" in attaching such a Warning. You think it is not useful
because cache heuristics do not apply to misses. I think one could consider it
being useful because the Warning could be about upstream cache's heuristic,
not about the cache adding a Warning. See below.

The only reason I can think of is the "garbage in, compliance out" principle:
the proxy should improve the "quality" of responses it forwards.  Imagine that
there is a non-HTTP/1.1 cache upstream that cached the response for more than
24 hours. Imagine that the requesting client agent supports Warnings but does
not analyze response age. If a compliant proxy adds a Warning (that the
upstream cache should have added, but did not!), the user will get a useful
Warning.

The above scenario is quite artificial, of course. I am not sure whether it is
good enough to say that the MUST in question should apply to misses.

Thank you,

Alex.
