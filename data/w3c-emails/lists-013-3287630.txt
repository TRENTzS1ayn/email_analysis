The short answer to your question is that Lou Montulli invented cookies 
at Netscape sometime in 1994 to facilitate electronic commerce applications.

I suggest two resources:

1) The Cookie Central web site (cookiecentral.com) contains lots of 
information about cookies, though I don't see any specific section on 
history.

2) My paper, "HTTP Cookies:  Standards, Privacy, and Politics," 
available at <http://arXiv.org/abs/cs.SE/0105018> (and published in 
roughly the same form in ACM Transactions on Internet Technology, Vol.1, 
#2, Nov., 2001) covers the evolution of the HTTP standard, which isn't 
exactly what you want.  (However, look at the first section of the 
Appendix.)
