Is it a "MUST" requirement for HTTP/1.1 clients to support chunking ??

Or Is the chunking capability to be advertised by the client before the server
can send chunked encoded response ?
If yes, then which header is used for that (by the client to advertise
capability) ?
I know the server sends "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header in the response

Thanks in advance for all your replies
