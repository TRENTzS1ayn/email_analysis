Yes, it is. RFC 2616 says:

   All HTTP/1.1 applications MUST be able to receive and decode the
   "chunked" transfer-coding, and MUST ignore chunk-extension
   extensions they do not understand.

Support for the above MUSTs varies, and there are known buffer overrun
bugs in some older versions of popular clients and servers. Many
_servers_ have quite poor support for chunked _requests_, but you
probably do not care about that.

The only required "advertisement" is "HTTP/1.1" request version.
Clients MAY include TE request-header to indicate that it supports
[other] transfer-codings and/or trailers. However, the "chunked"
transfer-coding is always acceptable, regardless of TE header presence
and value. Some clients send "TE: chunked" anyway. Some HTTP/1.0
clients send "TE: chunked" to indicate that they can accept chunks
despite being HTTP/1.0.

The client should advertise its "trailers" capability though:

   The presence of the keyword "trailers" indicates that the client is
   willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding, as
   defined in section 3.6.1. This keyword is reserved for use with
   transfer-coding values even though it does not itself represent a
   transfer-coding.

HTH,

Alex.
