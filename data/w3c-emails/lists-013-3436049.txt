Hi,
     I had a doubt. Can SSL implementation be part of the HTTP stack
implementation? In that case, for secure HTTP connections, is it OK if we
just specify https in the url or should something additional be done.
     If SSL implemenation is separate, how do we integrate HTTP
implementation and SSL implementation?

Regards,
Srikant.
