Let's not forget the context of this thread. Diwakar Shetty asked to
explain the rationale behind the RFC wording.  Whether the problem RFC
2616 tried to address still exists is pretty much irrelevant. The
problem was very real at the time persistent connection handling was
redesigned!

Many existing systems violate major HTTP/1.1 MUSTs. One of the most
popular proxies (Squid) is still HTTP/1.0. It is questionable whether
it is better to install a "simple mostly working HTTP/1.0 system" or a
"complex mostly working HTTP/1.1 system". There is little excuse for
selling seriously broken HTTP/1.1 implementations with known bugs, but
that is not the subject of this thread :-).
