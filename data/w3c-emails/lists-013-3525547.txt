The book is referring to HTTP/1.1 proxy and not HTTP/1.0 proxy
If interested, one can refer the book "Web Protocols and Practice" by Balachander Krishnamurthy and Jennifer Rexford, Addison Wesley, May 2001
ISBN 0-201-71088-9
Page no. 289 in the para for "Semantic requirements on an HTTP/1.1 proxy

It concludes at the end...."HTTP/1.1 proxies are not permitted to establish a persistent connection with HTTP/1.0 clients

But it was the HTTP/1.0 client which sent the "Keep-alive" in the first place
Hence it is not pure.
It intentionally wants to keep the Connection alive
Hence, the client can detect the end of message using "Content-length" sent by the origin server, as mentioned by Scott

Perhaps another issue to ponder over would be the different use of "Connection" in HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1
