Sure. They are the same resource. But if the resource is modified multiple
times within a clock interval, the server (Apache) will return the same weak
entity tag, so user agents may not get the latest modification if they do a
conditional GET. I'd say that in the case where another client actually did
succeed to modifiy the resource twice (in the same clock interval) using
PUT, this is wrong.

OK. So I conclude that a generic authoring client (one that has no concept
of semantically equivalent entities) MUST NOT use weak entitty tags to
protect itself from lost updates upon PUT. Correct?

Interesting.
