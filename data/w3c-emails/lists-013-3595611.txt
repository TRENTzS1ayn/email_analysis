Hi There,

I was browsing through RFC 2616 for HTTP1.1
One of the smart feature it mensioned was of PARTIAL DOWNLOAD.
Means browser can specify a range of bytes (e.g 100-200 bytes of img123.gif)
in the HTTP header and webserver will send only those bytes.

I have following query about PARTIAL DOWNLOAD

If the browser is capable of accepting say 100KB at a time (This 
is most likely scenario in case of browsers on Mobile phones)
then is it browser's responsibility to make request for every 100KB 
of that object(which is to be downloaded) and the webserver will send requested 
bytes? 
OR
Is it the server who will send the requested Object in chunk of 100KB
with seperator and as Multipart response?

Any quick help in terms of sample code, URL will be highly
appreciated.

Thanks for you Time.

With Regards,
Yog
