your first scenario is much closer.. the server will send only a
subset of the document.. if the client wants other subsets it must
make multiple requests. Also note that the server is allowed to just
send you the whole document even if you only ask for part of it.

imho, your issue appears to be one of flow control, which isn't really
what the range mechanism was meant for. (but then I'm not one to talk,
I've done an experiment to try and interleave different documents from
the same web page across the same persistent tcp stream using range).You should
really use your transport protocol to accomplish what you're
after. (e.g. in TCP advertise a 0 rwin and you won't get any more data
until you've consumed the last chunk.)
