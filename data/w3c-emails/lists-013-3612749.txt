The client (browser) may request a specified range of the object; if
it wants another range, it must make another request.  The request is
made using the Range request header (see section 14.35 of RFC 2616).

Note however, that since a server MAY ignore a Range request header
and return the entire resource, a client that has a limited capacity
cannot always rely on getting a subrange response.  The Content-Range
header is included in the response if it is a subrange.

There is a mechanism (the 'Accept-Ranges' response header) designed to
allow the server to declare whether or not it will support range
requests for a resource - I don't know how widely it is implemented.
If it is implemented by the server, then an OPTIONS or HEAD request to
the URL of interest would return an Accept-Ranges header, without
having to deal with the entire object.
