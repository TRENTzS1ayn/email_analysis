The server won't know what the size limitations in the client are
unless the client communicates them in some way.  You have two
choices:

A) Express the limitation using TCP flow control (the client should
   limit the TCP window to what it can accept).

OR

B) Express the limitation using HTTP Range (your choice 1).  I have
   seen this done in exactly this application.  See Alexs comments on
   the possible problems with proxies that don't honor Range (is there
   any emperical data about how deployed proxies respond to this?).

Note that neither of these has anything to do with the authentication,
and both are client side driven.
