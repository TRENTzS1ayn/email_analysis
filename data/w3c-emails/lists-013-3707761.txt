IIRC, a popular open-source Squid proxy would do one of the following,
depending on the Squid version, hit/miss status, and complexity of the
Range expression:

- tunnel the Range transaction through
- respond with entire [cached] entity
- convert Range request to a regular GET,
  possibly cache the entire response, and
  extract requested range(s) to be sent the
  the client
- respond with requested [cached] range(s)

I bet that other deployed proxies use a combination of the above
techniques as well. Keep in mind that some proxies are "transparent"
and some are "reversed", making a naive client unaware of the proxy
presence. This makes it difficult, if not impractical, to auto-adjust
client behavior depending on the environment.
