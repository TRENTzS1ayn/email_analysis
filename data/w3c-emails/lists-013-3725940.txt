As you already know, the above has nothing to do with transfer sizes
(assuming your authentication and authorization scheme does not require
large transfers and can fit into a few HTTP headers of reasonable
size).

The important question is: do you control the client? That is, do you
have to support every client out there OR do you expect your own piece
of software to run on the client? If you do not control the client,
then you should not worry about its limitations (the client should);
you should simply support any HTTP client.

Another missing piece of information is the details of "accepting only
few BYTES at a time" interface. Is it the rendering engine that can
accept only a few _content_ bytes? Is it the HTTP stack that can
accept only a few _response_ bytes? Is it the transport protocol that
can accept only a few _payload_ bytes?  Can the transport protocol be
forced into buffering no more than a few bytes?  Etc. etc. In most
cases, the right solution will not depend on HTTP.

If a client cannot accept more than 100KB of content, it is
responsibility of a client to deal with its own limitation unless you
are assuming that the client _and_ the server know about the
limitation and work around it together. In the latter case (custom
client and custom server), the question becomes moot because it is the
responsibility of the entire client-server system to handle the
limitation.

Of course, one may be able to address the limitation on the server
side as well, but, in general, it is not the server _responsibility_.

No, it is not the server responsibility unless you want to implement a
custom workaround to support broken clients or something like that.
Moreover, sending a huge response with many small multiparts may not
address your "browser can accept only few bytes at a time" problem --
see above for entity-content versus HTTP-response versus
transport-payload concern. It is not clear whether the buffering
limitation you describe happens before or after HTTP response is
parsed and multiparts are merged.
