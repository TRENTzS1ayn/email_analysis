Noted. Then you can forget about doing any tricks to limit response
sizes. Leave it to the client, the server, and HTTP. Just make sure
your code supports any HTTP client you care about. RFC 2616 and other
specs define what a client can do; the server API (and CGI specs)
define what your module or CGI needs to do.

Is there any reason you want to authenticate or authorize range
requests specially? If yes, you need to tell us relevant requirements
so that we can help. If no, the presence of Range header is irrelevant
to your authentication and authorization code. You are simply
authenticating or authorizing any request that the server asks you to
handle.

Same as (1). Is there any reason you want to authenticate or authorize
range requests specially?

When client sends Range request header and the server honors it. Both
events are probably irrelevant to authentication and authorization
code. In general, authentication and authorization would depend on
other request headers.

This has nothing to do with authentication and authorization, right?
You need to define "complete download" first. If by "complete
download" you mean that an entire entity was _sent_ to the client,
then you have at least three cases to take care of:

1) The server is generating a "200 OK" response,
  sending entire entity to an authenticated and
  authorized client. In this case, you can check
  that the entire response left the server (no
  aborted connections and such).

2) The server is generating a "206 Partial Content"
  response, sending one or more pieces of an entity
  to an authenticated and authorized client. To check
  whether the entire entity was sent, you would probably
  have to establish and track some kind of a "session"
  with the client (a download state that pure HTTP lacks).

  Alternatively, you can assume that no client will do
  two partial downloads for the same content in parallel.
  Then you can use authentication information as session
  identifier. This assumption will not hold in all real-world
  environments, of course.

  Note that it is probably  impossible to guarantee that a
  client cannot fool your "session" tracking code simply
  because you cannot distinguish one client session from
  another client session originating from the same client
  (without client-side support which you said you lack).

  Once you assigned a session ID to a sequence of responses,
  you can maintain a response "coverage map", marking pieces
  that were sent to the client. Once there are no holes
  in the map, the download is complete.

3) The server is not sending any content to a client.
   It could be a response to HEAD request or perhaps a 100
   Continue message. Your code should skip such responses.

If by "complete download" you mean that an entire entity was
_received_ by the client, then you cannot track that reliably without
client-side support.

Perhaps your requirements are such that your authorization code must
know how much content the client has received so far (e.g., some kind
of pay-per-play scheme). The above logic can be adjusted for that as
well, with similar caveats.


HTH,

Alex.
