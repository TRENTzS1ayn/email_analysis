The above requirement does not necessarily imply that you need to care
about partial downloads. A standard httpd access log would contain the
above information.

In such case, you cannot. HTTP does not maintain state for you. Your
preconditions (you tell us that your application cannot, essentially,
maintain any state, for whatever reason) imply that you cannot link
two partial responses together. Thus, you cannot maintain status for
anything other than a single transaction (one request, one response,
ranged or not).

You need to re-evaluate your preconditions (whether your CGIs are
allowed to maintain state; whether you can prevent the server from
serving partial content)  and/or re-evaluate your goal (whether you
really need to distinguish between partial and full downloads rather
than, say, just count unique URLs requested by a user).

Whenever a request with Range header containing several
non-overlapping ranges is received by a server that can handle range
requests.

As I said, the server always responds with a single message to a
single request (100-Continue notifications aside). Ranges are
irrelevant here.

GET / HTTP/1.1
Range: bytes=500-999,7000-7999

I do not think I can explain it much better than the RFC. See sections
14.35 and 19.2, to start with. If you have specific questions,
somebody on this list will probably be able to answer them.
