That is my understanding as well. Note that chunking support is an
HTTP/1.1 MUST.

For completeness sake, note that a combination of chunked encoding and
non-persistent connection is also legal:

Connection: close
Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked

Yes, unless the connection is not persistent.

I do not think it is that simple. You must not send Content-Length
header if you are using non-identity transfer codings -- the value of
Content-Length header (if it is given) must match _both_ entity-length
and the transfer-length. See RFC 2616, section 4.4 for details.

HTH,

Alex.
