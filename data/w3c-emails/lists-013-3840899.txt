Hi, I recently found the following message posted on here, its from 2001:

>hi

The answers pretty much were all no.  My question is about the same.  Has a way been found around the IP masquerading of proxies?  Would something as simple as a hidden field in a form that contains the IP from the remote computer make it through the proxy?  Or is there a much more complex solution?

Thanks

Remi
