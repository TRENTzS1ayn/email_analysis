Yes, in general. However, not all remote computers have a (single,
unique, static) IP address. Some remote computers have no IP address.
Not all browsers will let you access client IP address. Not all users
are humans using browsers.

IMHO, the _correct_ solution is (usually) to avoid relying on IP-level
information because it may not be available, is not reliable, easily
spoofed, and has virtually nothing to do with HTTP or even the Web.
