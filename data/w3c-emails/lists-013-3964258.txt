Although I am not big expert on this, but here is some information for you.

You are right, RFC 2617 doesn't specify any character set. RFC 2617 is a
revision of RFC 2069 which predates RFC 2277. So I suspect that when the RFC
2069 was revised, nobody noticed this issue.

RFC 2831 (Using Digest Authentication as a SASL Mechanism) which is based on
RFC 2617 had to deal with this as well. RFC 2831 has a phrase "The directive is
needed for backwards compatibility with HTTP Digest, which only supports ISO
8859-1." which suggests that ISO 8859-1 is the default for HTTP. RFC 2831 had
to add a new "charset" directive and a complex rule to convert UTF-8
usernames/passwords [that can be fully expressed as ISO 8859-1] to ISO 8859-1.
This is a mess :-(.

So, although I tend to agree with your choice to use UTF-8, however it seems
that the reality is a bit more complicated than that.
