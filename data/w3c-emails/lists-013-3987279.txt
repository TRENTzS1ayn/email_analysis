I just took a look at the spec to try to come up with specific
language for this.  

Section 3.2.2.2 A1 add:

   The passwd value used should be encoded using UTF-8.
 
I don't think it's an issue for the user-pass string or
username-value, since these are just literals that are passed in the
clear to the server anyway.  Can't the server just use them as is?
