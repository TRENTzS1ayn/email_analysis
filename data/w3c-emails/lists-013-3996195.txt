I believe this might be a problem as it might differ from existing
implementations.
Making passwords UTF-8 before MD5 yields a complete different result from using
ASCII and then MD5 for Digest. This is also true for Basic (using Base64).
I would expect implementations to currently use the ASCII character-set.

This does indeed not solve the issues regarding languages using another
character set. I don't have any details how current implementations do this.

HTTP (including HTTP/1.1) is much older than BCP 18 (RFC 2277), so I don't
believe its recommendation is used.
