The topic was discussed in the HTTP working group in September 1998.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg-old/1998SepDec/0040.htm
l
and the end of the dialog was:


   How about we restrict user-ids and typed-in passwords to US-ASCII for
now,
   declare encoding of non-ASCII characters in those fields undefined
but
   explicitly forbid use of localized charsets (e.g., ISO-8859-1)?  Then
we
   can amend it to use UTF-8 later with a spec that progresses
separately
   on the standards track.


However, this apparently didn't make it into the spec. I think that
as far as 'errata', what's missing is a pointer to the discussion and
this particular 'resolution'.

I admit that it's not a great resolution of the issue (we basically just
avoided it), but that's at least a baseline: HTTP isn't as functional
as one would like in this area.

I'm less sanguine about mandating new behavior at this point, for
the same reasons given in 1998. So I'm not sure there is a "fix",
unfortunately.  Clients can do things that servers won't understand,
and servers can expect clients to do things that they can't.
Non-ASCII user names will be unreliable until new behavior
is proposed and accepted by the community.

The notion (in 1998) is that someone would write a spec that would
progress independently on standards track (or at least thru Proposed
and Draft) so that we can update HTTP to full standard some day.

Although I am not big expert on this, but here is some information for
you.

You are right, RFC 2617 doesn't specify any character set. RFC 2617 is a
revision of RFC 2069 which predates RFC 2277. So I suspect that when the
RFC
2069 was revised, nobody noticed this issue.

RFC 2831 (Using Digest Authentication as a SASL Mechanism) which is
based on
RFC 2617 had to deal with this as well. RFC 2831 has a phrase "The
directive is
needed for backwards compatibility with HTTP Digest, which only supports
ISO
8859-1." which suggests that ISO 8859-1 is the default for HTTP. RFC
2831 had
to add a new "charset" directive and a complex rule to convert UTF-8
usernames/passwords [that can be fully expressed as ISO 8859-1] to ISO
8859-1.
This is a mess :-(.

So, although I tend to agree with your choice to use UTF-8, however it
seems
that the reality is a bit more complicated than that.
