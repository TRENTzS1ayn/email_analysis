Sorry, I don't have a good example handy. Maybe someone on the HTTP_WG
mailing list does.

Subject: HTTP chunk transfer


Hello!
 
    I've read some stuff on HTTP chunk transfer mode but I don't really
understand what my HTTP messages should be to transfer an entity to a
server. Could you write me an example of message to transfer an entity
with chunks? For example an entity which size is 2048, what are the
message (first, next, ..., last) that will be sent to the server if I
use 512-sized chunks?
 
Best regards,
 
Pierre
