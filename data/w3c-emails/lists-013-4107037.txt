Here is an example (extracted from a test trace) of an HTTP response
message transferring a 20-byte entity (cygpjmlomtdjwfelowxv) using two
10-byte chunks:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n
Transfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n
Date: Tue, 07 Jan 2003 17:32:17 GMT\r\n
\r\n
a\r\n
cygpjmlomt\r\n
a\r\n
djwfelowxv\r\n
0\r\n
\r\n

All necessary details are in the section 3.6.1 "Chunked Transfer
Coding" of RFC 2616, of course.

HTH,

Alex.
