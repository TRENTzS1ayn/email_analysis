Have I missed something?  Are the answers that propose CONNECT 
over-thinking the question?

To connect to an HTTP application through a proxy, send an absolute URI
(RFC 2616) to the proxy.  For example, if the application server is 
app.com and the proxy server is proxy.com, send this request to proxy.com:

GET http://app.com/the-rest-of-the-URI HTTP/1.1
Host: app.com
[more headers]
