In section 8.1.2, you can read the following:

> Once a close has been signaled, the client MUST NOT send any more
> requests on that connection.

Is it just me, or that "MUST NOT" would forbid pipelining? A pipelining 
client MAY send more requests, but they will be ignored by the server 
and it should be prepared to that possibility (section 8.1.2.2 mentions 
that a client MUST be prepared to the server closing the connection 
before it handled them all).

Thanks!
