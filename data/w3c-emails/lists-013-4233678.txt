Upgrade is a hop-by-hop mechanism, so forwarding the 1xx response not
only is not required in this case, it would be broken.  The RFC has (I
think quite detailed) discussion of how to avoid problems with
proxies, so long as they fully support CONNECT.

The part I'm most curious about is whether or not they actually use
the port number specified in the request.  At one point (quite a while
ago now), I found that some proxies ignored it and always connected to
443.
