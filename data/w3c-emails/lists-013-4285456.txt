Hi :-)

Thanks for your replies. It will take me some time to read and
understand all the stuff you mentioned. Up to now I only quickly went
over the TOC's and from that I am not sure if it really is what I meant.
The pdf linked by Jeffrey gets pretty close to it but as I said before,
I am not yet sure. I will get back to it at latest after finishing my
exams for this semester. 

Bye Tim
