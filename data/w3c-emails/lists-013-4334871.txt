    And how much would compression reduce the data transfered? Not

    more than the 36% redundancy.

Good question.  We couldn't answer it directly, because our
traces don't include the actual contents, and so we couldn't
compress the data to see what would happen with compression.

However, indirect evidence suggests that adding HTTP-level
compression wouldn't change the results very much, because
most of the bytes (and especially most of the redundant bytes)
were in image formats that are already compressed.

Your trace may vary ...
