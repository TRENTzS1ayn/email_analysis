proxy 100 (Continue) issue

I am trying to resolve the issue of 100 Continue to make our proxy 100% 
rfc compliant but am facing this
hurdle as to whether the client after recieving a 100 Continue response 
sends only the message body
(without request headers) or resends the request without Expect header. 
Please comment on this.
