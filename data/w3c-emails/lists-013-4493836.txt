Hi,

I'm trying to implement a proxy server. The proxy server does nothing but 
just forwards the request to the destination server.

My question is:

1. For implementing a proxy as simple as this ( just forward request back 
and forth), do I have to bother myself with the HTTP protocol versions etc.

2. I understand from a bit of googling  that I should be removing the 
'Proxy-Connection' from the request header so that we won't have to worry 
about a broken link even if the upstream proxy does not support it. Is there 
anyother field like this that I should deal with ?  Does this apply to both 
HTTP 1.0 as well as HTTP 1.1 ?

Any help or pointers would be of great help.

-Thanks
