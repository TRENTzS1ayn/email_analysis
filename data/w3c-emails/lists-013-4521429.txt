Then why do you need a proxy? And why can't you use an existing proxy?

You probably will want to do that, although if you close all connection
always you can probably ignore it for starters.

Proxy-Connection is not a standard header and it can be good to remove it,
the headers you should remove even for this simple proxy can be found
in ?13.5.1 in rfc 2616 (which can be found at 
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt).

Setting "Connection: close" and removing any "Keep-Alive", 
"Proxy-Authenticate"
and "Proxy-Authorization" should probably work for most sites. 


For HTTP/1.0 (rfc 1945) there are no hop-headers mentioned so If you do 
HTTP/1.0
you should be able to forward all headers and still follow the 
specification. In that
case you should make sure that the request your proxy forwards is HTTP/1.0.
