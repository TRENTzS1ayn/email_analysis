Firstoff, thanks for all the response. I've provided my answers
with some more questions inline (enclose between >>>>)

-Thanks/Sub

There are a few questions you need to answer before we can
help you with the design and minimal feature set:

1. Will your proxy forward all requests to one configured
   server? Or will it need to look at requested URLs and
   forward requests to corresponding servers?

>>>>>>>>>>>>
Yes. My proxy server would always forward it to one configured server. I don't have
to lookup the request header. 
>>>>>>>>>>>>


 2. Is performance important? Do you want your proxy to cache
   responses?

>>>>>>>>>>>>
No. I don't have to provide any caching feature.
>>>>>>>>>>>>

 3. Will you proxy do anything other than forwarding messages?
   That is, why do you need a proxy?

>>>>>>>>>>>>
The reason I need this proxy is because, I want a way to forward all requests
to a centralized server. And I want to write one on my own. 

The end server that I would be sending the request to is HTTP 1.1 compliant. But,
I doubt if the server properly implements 'Keep-alive' etc. 

My question is, if there din't exist a proxy between the browser and the server,
won't the browser and the server handle all these differences ? In which case,
how should a proxy now make a difference ? Can't I just forward the request
or just tunnel it as if it were HTTPS, and be assured that it works?

>>>>>>>>>>>>

Your answers will determine how much HTTP corners you can cut. If it
turns out that your proxy needs to support HTTP/1.1, then you would
have to handle versions and *Connection headers correctly, among other
things. In that case, I would not recommend just removing
Proxy-Connection; a lot more work needs to be done to survive in a
general HTTP environment (RFC 2616 defines most of what needs to be
implemented in that case).

Alex.
