I am currently writing an application using HTTP/1.1 protocol to send a file to a HTTP server via the HTTP PUT request.

I know that there is a general-header item "connection" that could be used with the value "close" to notify that the client wants to close the connection after the request.

My problem is that if the server returns a 401 response ( or the proxy a 407 response) I don't want the connection to be closed before I anthenticate to it.

So I have decided not to include the connection header item before my job is finished and I would like to know what kind of request I could send to the server with the "connection: close" item.
