I do not know of any ready-to-use tool for testing HTTP/1.1 compliance
of origin servers. I bet there has not been one built yet. However, my
team is actually looking for folks who need such a tool. Our
Co-Advisor test suite already has nearly complete RFC 2616 MUST
coverage for HTTP intermediaries, and we want to add test cases for
origin servers (there is a significant overlap in coverage since
intermediaries MUST comply with most server-side requirements).

If you do not need immediate 100% coverage and are willing to cope
with fast but gradual increase in the number of test cases instead,
please contact me off the list.

Thank you,

Alex.
