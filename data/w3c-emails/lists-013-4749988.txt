Once the response is underway, it is not possible for the client to
interrupt the sending server other than by closing the connection.

What a client, concerned about the size of a GET response, can do is
to send a HEAD request to the server first and examine the 
Content-Length
(hopefully known by the server) in order to decide.

Hope this helps.
