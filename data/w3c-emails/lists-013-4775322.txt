Hmm. Maybe one could exclude sensitive header such as
Authorization, Cookie and Proxy-Authorization from TRACE responses.
After all, 2616, ch. 9.8 says that the complete request SHOULD
be send back. So, it's not a MUST and implementation might have
a good reason for not doing so. Making life harder for such
exploits seems like a good idea and it would allow to keep TRACE
in the server.

On the other hand - as it is stated also in the report - there is no
protection against XSS-enabled clients.
