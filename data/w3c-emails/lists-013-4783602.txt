The entire value of TRACE lies in it being an exact copy; otherwise
it's pretty worthless as a debugging mechanism.

This exploit does not expose any user or application that is not
already sending authentication credentials in clear over the net.
Digest Authentication already solves this problem, and provides the
session tracking (via the server nonce) that applications want as
well, without exposing anything either on the net or to XSS clients.

Trying to repair this "new" problem by changing TRACE is like fixing
an abdominal bullet wound with a Band-Aid.
