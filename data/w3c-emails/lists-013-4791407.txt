I am trying to understand the intended scope of the "implied *LWS"
rule in RFC 2616.

   implied *LWS
      The grammar described by this specification is word-based. Except
      where noted otherwise, linear white space (LWS) can be included
      between any two adjacent words (token or quoted-string), and
      between adjacent words and separators, without changing the
      interpretation of a field.

It is not clear to me whether the above wording implies that word is
token or quoted-string and not literal. Here are two specific examples
to illustrate the confusion.


   message-header = field-name ":" [ field-value ]
   field-name     = token
   Authorization  = "Authorization" ":" credentials

Can one use implied LWS rule to write:

Authorization    : scheme param=value

and expect compliant agents to honor the Authorization header?
Is the Authorization field name a token or a literal?


Moreover,

Request-Line   = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF
HTTP-Version   = "HTTP" "/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT

Can one use implied LWS rule to write:

GET / HTTP /     1   .   0

and expect compliant agents to parse the version part correctly?


Thanks,

Alex.
