It sounds like you've been sending a minimal HTTP/1.0 request to these
servers, and tried simply changing the HTTP/1.0 to HTTP/1.1 in the initial
request line. HTTP 1.1 also requires requests to provide a Host header.
Read the RFC for details, but I think you'll find that most servers accept
properly-formatted HTTP 1.0 or HTTP 1.1 requests -- probably HTTP 0.9,
also, but let's not go there. ;-)
