Probably.

Google does use HTTP/1.1 (though in checking that, I discovered that
thier server does not support either OPTIONS or TRACE).  If they are
not responding as you expect, then you are probably not constructing
the request correctly; there are differences.  See RFC 2616:

  ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2616.txt

(most likely you are not including a 'Host' header - it was not
required in 1.0, but is in 1.1).

It has far better control of caching, and properly supports persistent
connections; if either would be useful, then certainly.
