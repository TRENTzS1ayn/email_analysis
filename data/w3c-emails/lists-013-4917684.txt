I do not know if we can ask basic questions in this group but if you can
post the header which created problem you can get an answer

Subject: Is there a HTTP 1.1 help list / forum / group?



Hi,

I posted a question yesterday in this list concerning help with formatting
a HTTP/1.1 GET header which wasn't working (1.0 works fine) and was told I
probably needed a 'Host' header, it turns out I already had this --
unfortunately I'm still having problems.

I am reluctant to seek further 'a fairly basic question' help in this list
as it seems to be a highbrow discussion list and not the place to ask 'help
I am stuck' questions. Can someone recommend another list, forum or
newsgroup where I can post a 'help, what am I doing wrong' question please?
I've done multiple web searches trying to find one and have come up with
nothing. There seem to be several protocols.* newsgroups but no
protocols.http unfortunately.

Thanks and regards,

..matthew
