I am interested to see the flow of a chunked response comes from a Origin
server can any one suggest a site which does chunked encoding

Is it possible to get a connection :close header with chunked reponse.If
such a thing happens what should/will be the behavior of the client/proxy

Note: I will just send one request .I will not be doing any stress testing


Thanks & Regards
Vijay
