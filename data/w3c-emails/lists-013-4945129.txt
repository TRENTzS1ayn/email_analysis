sure it's possilble. If you've read the last chunk (the 0 chunk) and
then the connection closes all is good.. if the connection closes
before you've read the last chunk then the response has been truncated
and you should do something about it.. what to do it up to the
client. If you're a cache then marking it uncachable seems like a
smart thing to do with it for starters.

even if the server is going to close the connection, chunking
dynamically generated content is still smart beacuse then the client
doesn't need to rely on overloading the semantics of EOF to separate
an error from end of response body.

from your messages the last couple of days it seems that you're
working on an http/1.1 implementation. I'd suggest you go buy _Web
Protocols and Practice_ by Krishnamurthy and Rexford - you'll find it
invaluable in answering all of your questions and, in addition,
teaching you about the questions you should be asking that you haven't
thought of yet.
