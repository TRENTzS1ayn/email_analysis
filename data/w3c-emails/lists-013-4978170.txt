Alex, thanks for help.

My application sends binary data so I decided
 to use for POST data posting
"Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
For preventing data modifying by proxies I decided to use no-transform
directive.
For requests
 "Cache-request-directive: no-transform"
And for responses
 "Cache-response-directive: no-transform"

Best Regards,
Konstantin
