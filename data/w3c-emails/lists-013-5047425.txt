Hello again!

I did a little bit more debugging and see that
 if timeout expired ISA server in response returns following:

Via:1.1 TEST-W2K-SERVER
Connection: close
Proxy-Connection: close
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 3591

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
...

I didn't checked this situation because I expected
HTTP/1.1 xxx OK
in response.

Thanks for your help,
Konstantin
