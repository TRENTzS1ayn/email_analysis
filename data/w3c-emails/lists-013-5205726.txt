Hi, my name is patrick. I'm a student doing a project on embedded system. I've wrote a httpd for the embedded system. I've added Digest authentication to the httpd for access control of the web resources. 

When I test the httpd with Mozilla and Navigator 7.1 in redhat 8, everything works fine.When I test it with IE5, IE6 and navigator 7.1 on win98, my Digest authentication fails. I used a HTTP sniffer to trace
the HTTP transaction and discovered that the Authorization header field in the request were truncated. The Authorization header was the last header in the request.


My httpd only supports a subset of the HTTP1.1 headers. Is there anyway or method to make the browser send only the authorization header and on others like Accept, Accept-language etc?
