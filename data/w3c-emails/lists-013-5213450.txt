I assume you mean that the HTTP header did not fit into a single TCP
packet (was split across several packets), and that your program does
not handle partial reads from the network socket.

Not in general. You can install a header-stripping proxy in front of
your server, but that is probably not what you are after. If your
httpd cannot handle partial reads, you should fix it.

Also, please note that the browser is not the only agent that can add
HTTP headers to requests. HTTP intermediaries such as caching proxies
do that as well, further increasing header length.

HTH,

Alex.
