Keep in mind that caches aren't obliged to cache when headers allow it; 
they may have strategies that they believe work better.

In my experience, browser caches are pretty simplistic, and very 
conservative. They may have the images inheriting freshness information 
from the page they're referenced from, or they may interpret the 
refresh tag as a forced refresh for everything on the page.

Cheers,
