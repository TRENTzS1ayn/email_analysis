I believe you are right.  I did a few tests and it seems that a
browser sends a new GET request if you press the reload button and
that includes all images in the page, which seems to inherit the
refresh from the page.  Looks like the browser always bypasses the
cache when the reload button is pressed, no matter the content of any
cache headers.  I presume that a page with a "meta refresh" tag
behaves as if the reload button was pressed.

Thank you Mark, Robert and Alex for your comments.
