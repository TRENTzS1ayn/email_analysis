I'd like to here what people think about the behavior of the current Apache reverse proxy, which rewrites the host header and adds the three x-forwarded-* headers.

What is the status of these x-forwarded-* headers?

Are there some specs to which implementations should adhere, or is this an Apache ideosyncracy
(bug)?
