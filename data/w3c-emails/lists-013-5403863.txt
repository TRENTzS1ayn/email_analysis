They're X- headers; unofficial, albeit oft-used by reverse proxies (aka 
surrogates, gateways, etc.). X-Forwarded-For is quite common; 
X-Forwarded-Host and -Server are, I assume, to account for multiple 
virtual domains and/or multiple gateways in a farm.

As to its behaviour, everything that happens between a gateway and the 
upstream server is between those parties, more or less. These headers 
are pretty straightforward (although there are some potential security 
issues), but there are other issues brought about by using a HTTP 
gateway that's based on proxy software; e.g., those highlighted in
   http://www.research.att.com/~edith/Papers/HTML/usits01/

Cheers,
