So, what happens if there is more than one reverse proxy in the chain?

X-Forwarded-For looks like the ip number of the reverse proxy.

X-Forwarded-server looks like the  virtual host (potentially), as you suggest.

What is not clear to me is why Apache can't just pass through the HOST header as
received and use the VIA header to convey the reverse proxy information to the
upstream server.

Why is a reverse proxy any  different than a forward proxy? Shouldn't the
VIA header do the job? Do we really need to differentiate the IP number from
the server domain? Shouldn't the later suffice?

These headers are pretty straightforward (although there are some potential security issues), but there are other issues brought about by using a HTTP gateway that's based on proxy software; e.g., those highlighted in
