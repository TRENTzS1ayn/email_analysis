I would phrase it differently: there is no general way to cancel
effects of a request once a portion of a request message has left the
client. Certain servers may start acting before receiving the request
body or even before receiving complete request headers. Specifics
would depend on the server and what it is that you actually want to
cancel, of course.

Even if you control the client and the server, it is probably
impossible to know for sure that the client did not cancel! HTTP
intermediaries will prevent you from relying on TCP properties such as
reliable delivery. David's suggestion to redesign the interface is
probably the only option.
