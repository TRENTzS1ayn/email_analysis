I am currently investigating a problem that occurs in this type of scenario:

browser -> proxy1 -> proxy2 -> server

Proxy1 is actually a Squid proxy, it is passing though the end-user
authentication to proxy2.  The problem occurs because proxy1 is reusing
connections to proxy2 for requests from different users, but proxy2 is only
authenticating the first request on each new connection.  This means that
subsequent requests are not being authenticated, and these requests are
being treated as if they originated from the first user to use the
connection.  

Which proxy is at fault?  I understood that one of the intended benefits of
persistent connections was that a proxy would only have to authenticate the
first request on each connection, which is a huge performance benefit.  But
ths assumes that a downstream proxy that passes through user authentication
will not re-use the connection for different users.  Having said that, so
far I have been unable to find any specification that says a proxy need only
authenticate the first request on each connection.

I'd appreciate any thoughts on the matter,


Rob Maidment.
