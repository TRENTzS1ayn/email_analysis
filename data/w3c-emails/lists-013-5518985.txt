Just to throw some more fuel on the fire, this is an excerpt from WRL
Research Report 95/4 "The Case for Persistent-Connection HTTP" (Jeffrey
Mogul, May 95):

"A persistent-connection model for Web access potentially provides the
opportunity for other
improvements to HTTP [20]. For example, if authentication could be done
per-connection rather
than per-request, that should significantly reduce the cost of robust
authentication, and so might
speed its acceptance."
