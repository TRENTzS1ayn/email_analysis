FYI, this is a feature of Squid.  An admin can configure Squid to
forward the Proxy-Authorization header (without consuming it).

I would suggest that in this particular case, since both Squid and
"proxy2" are breaking the rules, the problem is solvable by disabling
server-side persistent connections in Squid.
