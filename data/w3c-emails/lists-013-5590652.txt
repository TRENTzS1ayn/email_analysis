Thankyou for all the contributions on this thread.  

I over-simplified the proxy1 (Squid) role in the scenario slightly for the
sake of clarity, so I'll explain exactly what is going on:  Squid is
authenticating the users, using the Basic authentication scheme I assume.
It then consollidates these users into 5 roles-based groups.  When Squid is
asked to authenticate with the upstream proxy (proxy2), it responds with one
of 5 user IDs, to indicate which group the user falls into.  Proxy2 then
applies a security policy based on the group.  So proxy1 is not literally
passing through the end-user authentication; it is responding to upstream
authentication differently depending on which user is making the request.

The problem occurs because proxy1 re-uses persistent connections to proxy2
for users in different groups, and proxy2 only authenticates the first
request on each connection.  So subsequent requests may have the wrong
security policy applied.

Thanks to your responses, I now realise proxy2 is at fault since it is
individual requests that should be authenticated, not connections.  I've
also learnt there may be a workaround by disabling server-side persistent
connections in Squid.

As a matter of interest, if the roles were reversed would Squid authenticate
every request, or only the first request on each connection?  

Thanks again,
Rob.
