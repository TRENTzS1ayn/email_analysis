What you propose requires a change to client behavior in a way that
potentially reduces the integrity of the user interaction for all sites
because you have a specific site you believe has a valid reason for
allowing handling the redirect w/o user interaction.

I don't believe endorsing this change in client behavior would be a good
idea. Adding a new header or header parameter which declared a server's
good intentions might be a reasonable approach. The client designers could
then choose to honor the declaration or perhaps prompt the user once and
remember that a specific server was approved, etc.
