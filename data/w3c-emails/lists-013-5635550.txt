Well, that good reason should be user authorization. Obviously you could
remember this authorization for that specific redirect.

What you basically don't want to happen is your POST or PUT going to a
different site. I couldn't imagine someone wanting to do this anyway.
This is also the reason why browsers warn (and they should be doing this)
when switching secured/unsecured.
This is where the potential hazard is, commonly with authentication, using a
secure site and the rest on a unsecured site. These redirect from secure to
unsecure and I don't want this to happen with my POST containing my
authentication information.

Perhaps the definition:
On retreiving .... the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect when
sending data, such as POST, PUT or web authoring functions and SHOULD NOT
automatically redirect otherwise, unless the request is GET or HEAD, in
which case a browser MAY redirect.

Still, I'm interested in a (practical) sitiation where one needs to redirect
a non-GET/HEAD request?

[Hopefully not going anywhere or duplicated. Still had the old WG mail
