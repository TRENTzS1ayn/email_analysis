Hi,

My current understanding is that header fields (say Accept: and
Connection: ) can fit inside a request header in any order.  Is this
correct?  If yes, is there a method by which one can enforce that a
certain field appear in certain order.

More generally can the HTTP Server have a say in the ordering of
request header fields?

Thanks,
Srikanth
