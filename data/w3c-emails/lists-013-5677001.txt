There is no way to enforce an order of the headers.

The server has no say over the data it receives, except that it could deny
or accept the request. One should look at the entire request as a whole and
not scan through it expecting ordering.

Next a proxy is allowed to relocate headers or compact them if it wants to.
For example, multiple 'Accept' headers could be compacted into a single
'Accept' header.
