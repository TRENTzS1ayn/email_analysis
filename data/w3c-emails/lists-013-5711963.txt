    No.
    
Scott is basically correct, but if someone out there misreads
this as "HTTP header field order does not matter at all" then
this is a mistake.

RFC2616, section 4.2 says:

   Multiple message-header fields with the same field-name MAY be
   present in a message if and only if the entire field-value for that
   header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)].
   It MUST be possible to combine the multiple header fields into one
   "field-name: field-value" pair, without changing the semantics of the
   message, by appending each subsequent field-value to the first, each
   separated by a comma. The order in which header fields with the same
   field-name are received is therefore significant to the
   interpretation of the combined field value, and thus a proxy MUST NOT
   change the order of these field values when a message is forwarded.

Note the "MUST NOT" in the final sentence.

For example, on a path with a proxy the client sends a request with:

HeaderX: A, B, C, D

or it could send the same request with:

HeaderX: A, B
HeaderX: C, D

It is legal for the proxy to convert that second form to

HeaderX: A, B, C, D

but it is NOT legal for the proxy to convert it to

HeaderX: C, D
HeaderX: A, B

because then the ultimate recipient would see "C, D, A, B"
instead of "A, B, C, D".

This only applies to "message-header fields with the same
field-name"; section 4.2 also says:

   The order in which header fields with differing field names are
   received is not significant. 

and so it is definitely legal to reorder (for example)

Accept: text/plain
Connection: close

to become

Connection: close
Accept: text/plain

P.S.: Alex: does your proxy validation suite check for that
MUST NOT from section 4.2?
