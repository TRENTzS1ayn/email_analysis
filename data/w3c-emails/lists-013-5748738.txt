Doesn't matter what your Agent knows, what matters is what any user-agent
is entitled to do. Better that your agent has a documented non-conformance
than to relax a protocol requirement.

Furthermore, since your agent has this trust relationship hard coded, I
would assert that the 'user' decision to accept a redirect has been made
and there is no protocol issue.
