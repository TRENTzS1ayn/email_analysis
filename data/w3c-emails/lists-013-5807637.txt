OK, that's clear. I was thinking about the case where OPTIONS is 
supported and implemented...

I think it would be nice if the spec would clarify what "supported in 
general" means... Specifically for the "Allow" header: does it mean

- the methods listed in the Allow header are supported by all resources?
- methods not listed in the Allow header aren't supported by any resource?
- something else...?

To me it seems that "OPTIONS *" is effectively useless except for the 
thing above -- testing compliance to a specific HTTP version. I think a 
spec revision should just state that.
