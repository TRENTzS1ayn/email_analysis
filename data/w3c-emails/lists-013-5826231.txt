I think the wording in RFC 2616 is unclear about requiring
that servers implement OPTIONS *. There's no explicit
language to that effect, but it does say (9.2 para 4):

   If the Request-URI is an asterisk ("*"), the OPTIONS request is
   intended to apply to the server in general rather than to a specific
   resource. Since a server's communication options typically depend on
   the resource, the "*" request is only useful as a "ping" or "no-op"
   type of method; it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test
   the capabilities of the server. For example, this can be used to test
   a proxy for HTTP/1.1 compliance (or lack thereof).

So there seems to be some assumption that HTTP/1.1 compliance
has something to do with implementing OPTIONS (otherwise how
could it be used as a test for HTTP/1.1 compliance?).


For a response, '501 Not Implemented' seems better than
'400 Bad Request'.

I'm not in favor of giving 'WebDAV servers' special dispensation.

Yes, for the reason of the above paragraph "a server's communication
 options typically depend on the resource".
