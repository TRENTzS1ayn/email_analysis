Support for all methods but HEAD and GET is optional. Thus, support
for OPTIONS is optional. The explicit requirement is in section 5.1.1
"Method" of RFC 2616:

   The methods GET and HEAD MUST be supported by all general-purpose
   servers. All other methods are OPTIONAL; however, if the above
   methods are implemented, they MUST be implemented with the same
   semantics as those specified in section 9.

A server that considered OPTIONS to be a "bad request" can be a
compliant HTTP/1.1 server.

The RFC is not being clear or precise in the "compliance" example you
quoted. Using OPTIONS, one can only test whether the agent claims to
be compliant (i.e., uses version HTTP/1.1 in response). I bet that is
the intent of the above example in the RFC.

Being optional, OPTIONS method has little practical value when it
comes to testing formal compliance.

Neither is accurate (because there is no error on the server side and
the syntax is correct from client point of view). I agree that 501 Not
Implemented is better. Many implementations respond with 400 Bad
Request if they care to respond to unknown request methods at all.

HTH,
