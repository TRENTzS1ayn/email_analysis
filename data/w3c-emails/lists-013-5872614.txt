That would be my interpretation as well, but I think the wording of 
RFC2616 is really too vague here.

Yes.

Well, that's what got us here (WebDAV using it for that). However the 
issue here is that the "OPTIONS *" request in reality get's never passed 
to the various 'modules' inside a server that would need to be able to 
respond it (for instance neither Apache/mod_dav nor Tomcat/Webdav 
servlet set the special "DAV:" response header defined for OPTIONS in 
RFC2518).

Any chance to get that onto the RFC2616 issues list?
