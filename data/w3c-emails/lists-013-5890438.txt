I do not use MS IIS, but it sounds like you may be missing the
application on the server end to accept (do something with) POSTs. On
general-purpose web servers, one cannot POST to a directory or a file;
there has to be a program (e.g., a CGI script) on the server side for
processing of POST requests.
