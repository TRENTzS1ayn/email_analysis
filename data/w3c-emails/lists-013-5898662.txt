In my experience, you need to convince one of the original authors or
anybody Scott Lawrence trusts that a certain change is warranted. If
you succeed, the change will be posted to
http://purl.org/NET/http-errata with a link to the discussion on the
list.

The change does not have to be an "errata" or "issue" with the
protocol itself.

Your best bet is probably to post a specific wording to this list and
wait for a reaction.

Alex.
