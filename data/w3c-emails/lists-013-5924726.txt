Given Jeff's comments, would it make any sense for those who need a
working OPTIONS to specify their own extension method (e.g., FEATURES)
and publish a small RFC instead of patching RFC 2616?
Draft-ietf-http-options could be a starting point. One problem would
be with proxies that do not pass extension methods on, unfortunately.
But some do not pass OPTIONS as well, so it is not such a "new"
limitation.

Adding some extension header to OPTIONS, to signal new well-defined
functionality would be a similar approach that does not require an
extension method.

Alex.
