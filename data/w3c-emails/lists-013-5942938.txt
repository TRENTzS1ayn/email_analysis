Agreed. So I think what we want to replace is 
<http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc2616.html#rfc.section.9.2.p.4>:

"If the Request-URI is an asterisk ("*"), the OPTIONS request is 
intended to apply to the server in general rather than to a specific 
resource. Since a server's communication options typically depend on the 
resource, the "*" request is only useful as a "ping" or "no-op" type of 
method; it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test the 
capabilities of the server. For example, this can be used to test a 
proxy for HTTP/1.1 compliance (or lack thereof)."

Any proposals for replacement text?

Julian
