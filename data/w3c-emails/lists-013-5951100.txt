Specific text is essential - I'd suggest some form of exactly what
text you would replace with exactly what it should become, because
it's the only way to get it reviewed.  Don't wait long - to quote from
the errata page:

   New drafts of [RFCs 2616 & 2617] are being prepared now,
   incorporating all of the following corrections, in preparation for
   requesting that they be advanced to full Standard status. If you
   have an issue with any of these resolutions, or if you think that
   you've found another, you should post it to the HTTP Working Group
   list and get the issue discussed there as soon as possible.
