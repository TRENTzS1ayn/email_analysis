As I think I mentioned before, the IETF revised policies on us
in RFC 2434, in the time between when we submitted the draft
standard and its approval.  No one noticed this change at the time.

In sections 3.5 and 3.6 of we define content and transfer coding
values that require registration.

RFC 2435 requires us to specify whether new values need to
be reviewed, for what purpose and/or if they need approval.
We are silent on the approval process.

>From looking at section 2 of 2435, I believe we are 

In 3.5 we now say:

"New content-coding value tokens SHOULD be registered; to allow
interoperability between clients and servers, specifications of the
content coding algorithms needed to implement a new value SHOULD be
publicly available and adequate for independent implementation, and
conform to the purpose of content coding defined in this section."

Unless there are complaints, I plan to revise this to say:


"New content-coding value tokens SHOULD be registered; to allow
interoperability between clients and servers, specifications of the
content coding algorithms needed to implement a new value SHOULD be
publicly available and adequate for independent implementation, and
conform to the purpose of content coding defined in this section. New
registrations are reviewed and approved by the IESG according to these
criteria."

Since other standards bodies may define documents that might be very
appropriate for content and transfer codings, it seems to me that just
leaving it to the IESG to evaluate is the correct approach.
