That was indeed a point I had not considered.

Regarding Normalization Form KC versus KD I think that one thing that 
should be considered before one of them is selected is that the IDNA RFCs 
(3454, 3490, 3491, 3492) are already using KC.

Implementationwise, I would prefer to use a single normalization form in 
the network related code. Of course, the actual code overhead depends on 
how much code is needed to implement the different normalizations, and 
whether or not other parts of the code also needs the other forms.
