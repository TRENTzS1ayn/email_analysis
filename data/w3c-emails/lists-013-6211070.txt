I agree that such behavior is logical; however, the text that
you just sent out says:

   If the "algorithm" directive's value is "MD5-sess", then A1 is
   calculated only once - on the first request by the client following
   receipt of a WWW-Authenticate challenge from the server.

So... when you get a nextnonce, do you recalculate A1? Is that what
you mean by "start using it?" Or do you calculate A1 "only once -
on the first request by the client following receipt of a
WWW-Authenticate challenge from the server," as the forgoing text
indicates?
