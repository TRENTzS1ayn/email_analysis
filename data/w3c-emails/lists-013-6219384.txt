It might also be a good idea to point out (in the revised version
of RFC2616) that there is a <soon-to-be?> BCP

"Registration procedures for message header fields"
Klyne, Nottingham, Mogul
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-klyne-msghdr-registry-07.txt

According to the IETF ID Tracker, the IESG has approved an earlier
draft as a BCP (back in May) but there are some minor revisions
that require "AD followup".  I think it would be safe to add a
non-normative reference, given that this ID is far enough through
the IESG process that it should have an RFC number long before
the Full Standard for HTTP/1.1 could be an RFC.  (Yes, it might
be naive to trust the IESG process this much.)

I would suggest putting something in 4.2 (Message Headers)
along the lines of:

All HTTP header field-names SHOULD be registered
according to the procedure in [draft-klyne-msghdr-registry-07].

I believe that one of my co-authors on this I-D has already
prepared an initial list of field-names including fields from
all extant HTTP-related RFCs.
