A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.


Title: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1
Author(s): J. Gettys
Filename: draft-gettys-http-v11-spec-rev-00.txt
Pages: 163
Date: 2003-12-3

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level 
protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information 
systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for 
many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and 
distributed object management systems, through extension of its 
request methods, error codes and headers [I36]. A feature of HTTP is 
the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems 
to be built independently of the data being transferred.

A URL for this Internet-Draft is:

Internet-Drafts are also available by anonymous FTP. Login with the

type "cd internet-drafts" and then

or ftp://ftp.ietf.org/ietf/1shadow-sites.txt


Internet-Drafts can also be obtained by e-mail.

Send a message to:
mailserv@ietf.org.
In the body type:
"FILE /internet-drafts/draft-gettys-http-v11-spec-rev-00.txt".

NOTE:The mail server at ietf.org can return the document in
MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail
readers
exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
"multipart" MIME messages (i.e. documents which have been split
up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
how to manipulate these messages.


Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version of the
Internet-Draft.
