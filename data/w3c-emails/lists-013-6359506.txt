The server is free to close the connection whenever it wants to, and
it's not uncommon to see a close following an error.

You might want to look at a network trace to see exactly when the TCP
connection closes relative to when you are sending the next request.
In any event, the client is responsible for opening a new connection
whenever it needs one.
