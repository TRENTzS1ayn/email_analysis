I am working on the next version of the HTTP PATCH method proposal:
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dusseault-http-patch-00.txt

We've had some discussions amongst WebDAV people of the best way for 
clients to discover server feature support.  In this case, the client 
wants to discover:
  - if the server supports PATCH at all
  - if so, what delta or diff formats can be used on this resource.

For that purpose, is a new header on OPTIONS still considered to be the 
way to go?  Can a server omit this header on responses to OPTIONS * if 
it only supports the feature in part of its namespace?  (E.g. if a java 
servlet supplies support for this feature only in the namespace hosted 
by that servlet)

Any other comments on the draft are welcome as well.

Thanks,
Lisa Dusseault
