That's "Allow".

I think we shouldn't put this into OPTIONS. It can easily be sent back 
as response to a PATCH request with missing content-type. In which case 
there wouldn't be any change at all for OPTIONS.

I don't see how the set of accepted content types can be ever relevant 
for the whole namespace. In practice, clients will never be able to rely 
on all resource on a server to provide the very same feature set, thus 
will have to discover that on the resource being PATCHed anyway.
