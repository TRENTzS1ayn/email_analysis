At Xythos we sometimes logged the traffic going to Sharemation (a 
WebDAV/Web server) and found a significant number of OPTIONS requests 
-- probably the most common after PROPFIND and GET.

In researching my WebDAV book I found that Microsoft Office (using 
Network Places or the MSDAIPP agent) uses many OPTIONS requests to 
confirm that the server is reachable and supports WebDAV, before 
attempting to PROPFIND in some situations.  Also, "cadaver" uses 
OPTIONS to detect WebDAV support and log the user in before attempting 
PROPFIND.  There are partial traces of these interactions in chapter 8 
of my book.
