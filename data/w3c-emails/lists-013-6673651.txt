Would it solve all these use cases if we provided a "Source: <url>" 
header?  The job of the server is then to take the Source resource, 
apply the patch body, and save it at the destination (the request URI). 
  I'd probably define this so that if the Source header were missing, 
then the Request URI is both the source and the destination.

Would anybody else find this useful?

Bear in mind that I'm not trying to solve all use cases.  Narrow use 
cases are a great thing to actually make progress and get to standard.  
This may be one of the situations where it's pretty safe to extend the 
use cases and functionality but we'll see.
