    Is there a binary delta format being used, or planned, for delta
    transmission of cached documents?
    
    What I mean is that if I have a cached entity with etag "abcdefg", and
    I request it with If-None-Match, then maybe a server or cache could
    send me the delta between what I have and the current entity - just to
    reduce bandwidth.
    
    If there's such a standard being proposed or even still being
    designed, it would probably be good to pick the same binary delta
    format.
    
IETF Proposed Standards:
    RFC3229: Delta encoding in HTTP
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3229.txt

    RFC3284: The VCDIFF Generic Differencing and Compression Data Format
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3284.txt

RFC3229 lists a few other possible formats, but vcdiff seems
to be the consensus (among experts in the area) for the best
choice.
