You may want to note in the draft that, in many cases, the atomicity
requirement is expensive because it requires copying the entire
content or "trying to patch" first, before actually patching, while
holding the file lock.

To avoid copying, a special --dry-run feature of the library/program
that supports the given patch format would be needed. In fact, as the
"internal error" part of the example below illustrates, copying may
always be required for safe operation when the patch library/program
does not guarantee atomicity:

lock
if patch --dry-run
then
if patch
then
unlock
report success
else
internal error!
revert to original content?
...
fi
else
unlock
error, report to the client
fi
