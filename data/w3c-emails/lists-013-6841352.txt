Is there a diff format that accommodates all of these:
- text patching with fuzzy offsets (like Larry Wall's patch)
- binary patching based on offsets
- patching not based on offsets

If yes, use it at a SHOULD level. If not, then it looks like it would
be a mistake to pick a "winner" at this time.

Looks like out of PATCH scope to me. Can be done in a separate
document if needed.
