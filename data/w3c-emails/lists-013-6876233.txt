I also have my doubts about random-access I/O support.  The HTTP/WebDAV
model is to do whole-resource operations, and since PATCH is all in one
method that still qualifies.  With WebDAV support, a client would be 
advised
to LOCK the resource and GET it, perform random-access I/O on the local
copy, then PUT/PATCH and UNLOCK the file.  Without WebDAV support,
client should do the same but using ETags rather than locks.
