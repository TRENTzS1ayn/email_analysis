I doubt that a different method is needed besides PATCH, but perhaps a
simple alternate diff format that can express these random-access I/Os
would be appropriate.

Honestly I don't know what the answer is since I have no expertise on
the specific diff/delta algorithms that are being discussed.  I would
just like to see a base-line format that can express these types of I/O
patterns in an easily implementable manner.

Thanks,
