Nothing.

 From a simple DAV p.o.v., simulating file i/o (skip, write, truncate) 
may be enough.

DeltaV probably would benefit more from a "true" patch format, such as 
gdiff.

Note that the former case seems to be a subset of the latter.

No. But it maybe in Subversion. Is a Subversion developer following this 
thread? Greg S.?

Yep, but that's something we don't want as REQUIRED support. Let's focus 
on the simple things first, and then let extensibility take care of the 
rest.

If normal HTTP compression works fine, there's no reason to complicate 
the method.
