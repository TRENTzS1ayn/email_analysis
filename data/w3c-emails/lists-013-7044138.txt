The above is not really a requirement. Content-Type is not a REQUIRED
header. Content-Encoding is only needed for encoded content. The
presence and transfer-length of request body is determined according
to these rules (see Section 4.4 for details, subject to errata):

   2.If a Transfer-Encoding header field (section 14.41) is present
     ... then the transfer-length is
     defined by use of the "chunked" transfer-coding (section 3.6)

   3.If a Content-Length header field (section 14.13) is present, its
     decimal value in OCTETs represents both the entity-length and the
     transfer-length.

   The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the
   inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in
   the request's message-headers. A message-body MUST NOT be included in
   a request if the specification of the request method (section 5.1.1)
   does not allow sending an entity-body in requests. A server SHOULD
   read and forward a message-body on any request; if the request method
   does not include defined semantics for an entity-body, then the
   message-body SHOULD be ignored when handling the request.

There are other related MUSTs.

IMO, any body is "entity body" from HTTP point of view. There are just
different entities being embodied.

As far as I can see, the above request will not be handled correctly
by intermediaries (they will drop its body). You need either
Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header.

HTH,
