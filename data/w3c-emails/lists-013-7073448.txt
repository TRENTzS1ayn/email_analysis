No, it is not my opinion. Content-Type is a RECOMMENDED not REQUIRED
header.

According to RFC 2616, the presence or absence of Content-Type header
does not indicate presence or absence of request body (there is a gray
area of multipart/byteranges codings, but let's ignore that). A client
SHOULD send Content-Type header if request has a body.
