I have done this for two reasons:

 * the server's response didn't have a content-length, but my proxy
wanted to have a persistent connection with the client.. The proxy can
chunk and stream the response simultaneously. 

 * to add some other kind of transfer-encoding in addition to chunked.
Commonly, this would be gzip.
