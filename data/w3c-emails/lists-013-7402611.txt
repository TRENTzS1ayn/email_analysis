Oof. I should have been more careful when writing HTTP header names.
Sorry. What I meant to say is that it is safe to respond with chunked
HTTP/1.0 response to an HTTP/1.1 request:

GET / HTTP/1.1
...

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
...

You are absolutely right that TE request-header has nothing to do with
the ability to use chunking with HTTP/1.0 messages.

Alex.
