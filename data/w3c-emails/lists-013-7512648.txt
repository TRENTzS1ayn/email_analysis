If I understand this article correctly, it sounds like MS IE will remove support 
for Basic Authentication.  While we all agree that cleartext passwords are evil, 
this sounds to me like it will create a major compatibility problem at sites 
that use Basic.  And note that it covers Basic over SSL, too, where the 
passwords would *not* be cleartext.
