Michael,

Is this not really a rendering problem?

This remark includes the "%01" problem,
and user perception that the leading
part before the "@" is the web site.

The first is a problem internal to the
browser, and should be fixed.

The second is a rendering problem, in
that many users do not know the difference.
Therefore, it is more useful to present
the url to the user without the credentials
portion.

If the embedded credentials are permitted
in a valid url, and that url is embedded
as, for example, the href of an <a> tag,
and the browser does not retrieve the
referenced resource, then the browser 
is broken.

Removing this valid behaviour will, in some
cases, break many months of work. I am
involved in one such case.

Bob
