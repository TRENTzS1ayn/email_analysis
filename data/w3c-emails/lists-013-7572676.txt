Ok, uncle :)

I see what I believed and what is fact are
two different things.  I really should not
have been so lazy about pulling up 2616.

My apologies to one and all.

I guess it's back to the drawing boards 
for my stuff. Whether it currently works
or not is moot (sniff!), if it is non-compliant
then, I guess I gotta suck it up.

Best Regards,

Bob
