Well, I've had second thoughts.

It has occurred to me that we are really looking at
two different things, both being referred to as
URL's.

3.2.2 is really more akin to a formal specification
of what the request-uri of 5.1.2 should look like
in the HTTP protocol. Certainly, it specifies that
the host is mandatory, yet hosts are often omitted
in HTML documents.

Howver, there is nothing inherently wrong with
username:password appearing in an *HTML* document,
and the browser subsquently interpreting that
information to form a Authorization: header
in response to a WWW-Authenticate: challenge. 

As we all know, http://username:password@www.example.com is not
sent literally over the wire.  And neither is
http://www.example.com:8080/index.html?var=something,
but rather 

GET /index.html?var=something HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com

and the client *knows* automagically to 
connect to port 8080.

To make a long story short, as long as the
over the wire protocol is respected, is there
really anything proscriptive in 2616 with regard
to the appearance in an *HTML* document? The only
thing that username:password@ causes in *HTTP*
when the browser finally gets around to it,
is the addition of:

Authorization: blahblahblah

in response to WWW-Authenticate.

To go really far out in left field, there is
nothing in 2616 to stop an html author from
displaying the username/password on the page
and asking the user to key it in when challenged.
Nor does it say that IE cannot store a username
and password for the "remember password function".

If the argument is that 3.2.2 prescribes the
semantics of the href attribute of the HTML <A>
tag, then there is a lot of broken HMTL code
out there because it quite common to use
either root relative, or relative URL's in
href attributes.  The fact that common browsers
know what to do about this would be due to
their interpretative abilities.  By extension,
username:password@ is also an interpretive
ability.

And it's all in the HTML, it's got nothing to
do with HTTP over the wire.  At least in
practical terms.

BTW, it was mentioned in a forum elsewhere
that this change would break a lot of
Paypal payment links. I don't know myself
because I do not have a Paypal vendor account.

What I am really asking is that the distinction
be made between what HTTP is, and running 
HTTP from HTML documents.  A minor distinction,
but perhaps a useful one.

Respectfully,

Bob
