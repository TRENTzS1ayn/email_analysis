HTTP clients are not obligated to limit the number of concurrent
persistent connections.  For example, a client may use 1000 concurrent
persistent connections without violating any HTTP MUST.

Many clients open more than one connection to decrease real or
perceived response (download) time in case a large object or another
delay slows down responses on one connection.
