Clients can of course do what they wish so you really need to ask this
question on a Mozilla related list.

Multiple connections may happen when the client discovers that the
existing connection is busy. Probably other logical reasons.

You should also confirm that Mozilla is configured for HTTP/1.1 for
proxies. Could be that you code thinks the connection is open but
Mozilla believes it closed. How long an existing connection continues to
be used is up to the both ends of the connection. I would expect it to be
on the order of 30 seconds of idle time but that is my personal design
style.

PS. It would be helpful if you configure your mail client to sent the
subject in plain ascii ...

After reading RFC 2616 I though that client (I use Mozilla 1.5) will maintain persistent connection as long as possible (and will sending requests to this connection as long as possible) but when I set as a proxy my proxy server and send request to fetch some web page, client makes persistent connection between him and proxy, and some requests goes by this connection (as I expected), but for some other requests client wants to make

My question is why client makes new connections to proxy when another persistent connection between same client and same proxy exists. Thanks
