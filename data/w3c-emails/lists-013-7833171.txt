One of the reasons is usually that you can start displaying the page if 
you have the top (of a long page)
and the images at the top.  If I remember correctly mozilla will not 
pipeline on the main connection
for a page (they will reuse the main connection as an ordinary 
persistent connection when the main
page is fetched). They do this since the page is normally large, and the 
images in it are many and small.
If they do not pipeline on the main connection, they want several 
threads to start getting the images
that are needed. 

If they can start display the page correctly  quick and load the rest 
with only the scrollbars updating
the user will think that the browser is faster giving a more happy user.
Of course the total time to download a page with images takes a bit 
longer for each extra connection,
but experienced user time is not equal to total time...

I may be wrong about how mozilla is doing  things now though, but I 
still belive that they do it like
this (or has tweakable options for this).
