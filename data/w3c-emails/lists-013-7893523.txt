I think the current work in this area is being pursued in
the W3C Device Independence activity
http://www.w3.org/2001/di/Activity 

which has produced, e.g.,

http://www.w3.org/TR/CCPP-struct-vocab/ 

rather than relying on additional parameters for MIME types.
I'm browsing around the W3C site, though, and can't seem to
find the current status.

Anyone else know?
