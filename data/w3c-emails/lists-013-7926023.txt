I am not quite sure what your exact needs are, but Measurement Factory
helps open source projects to become HTTP/1.1 compliant. In fact, one
of the first two proxies to become compliant was an open source proxy
called RabbIT. Please contact me off-list with details, and we will do
our best to help.
