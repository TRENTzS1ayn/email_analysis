Has there been an IETF last call for
draft-gettys-http-v11-spec-rev-00? I cannot find one in the archives.
ID Tracker lists says the draft status is "ID Exists", suggesting that
there has not been an IETF last call yet.

Can anybody post an update on the draft current status and plans?

Thanks,

Alex.
