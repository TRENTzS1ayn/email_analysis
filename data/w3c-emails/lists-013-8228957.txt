I have  one more question about this topic. I detected, that after 
creating couple of multiple connections between client and proxy, client 
sends requests for different www servers to one particular client-proxy 
connection (is it ok ?).  My question is how HTTP1.1 proxy (maintains 
proxy-www_server persistent connections) recognizes which proxy-www 
connection should be used for incoming client request (and when it shoud 
create new proxy-www connection). Thanks
