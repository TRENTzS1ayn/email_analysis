Yes.

The proxy should examine each request (regardless of what connection it
is on) and determine what origin server it is for.

Note that a successful CONNECT request changes this by switching the
connection into a transparent tunnel - the proxy should not examine or
alter anything in that connection; just relay bits through it until the
connection is closed by the endpoints.
