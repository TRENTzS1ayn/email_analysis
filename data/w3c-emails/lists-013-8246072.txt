I can't imagine how can proxy make tunnel, because one client-to-proxy 
connection can handle with many requests which are for many different 
www servers and also new connections to new www servers can come from 
this connection anytime after first CONNECT request from this connection 
was established. So I think that proxy should examine everything and 
everytime in that connection. It would also mean, that server side 
tunnel would have many ends and there would be no possibility how to 
determine when proxy server should close connection to client, isn't it ?
