I think the SWAP draft proposal (K. Swenson, August 7, 1998) made a
bold step in the right direction by trying to make WorkItem and
ProcessInstance more like each other.  But it appears that the way
it is presented has caused some confusion.  Rather than saying "a
WorkItem is a kind of ProcessInstance" (highly counterintuitive,
since user WorkItems tend to be simpler and have fewer properties
than workflow ProcessInstances), how about turning it around and
trying "a ProcessInstance is a kind of WorkItem"?  That is, all
requests for service under SWAP, whether to a user or a workflow
system or an application server, are WorkItems which the service
provider is free to implement by whatever means they wish.  Some of
these will actually be workflow processes, i.e., ProcessInstances,
which can have more information associated with them (e.g.,
subactivities) than vanilla WorkItems.  Maybe people can comment on
which way they'd like to see the two things related (possibly
improving on the names), or propose yet another alternative?
