I don't think it is appropriate to extend HTTP for SWAP
in the same way that HTTP was extended for WebDAV. WebDAV is
a set of extensions to HTTP for Web distributed authoring and versioning,
and the extensions being supported are appropriate for things
which might otherwise be accessed via web protocols.

I think SWAP's situation is much more like IPP's, where the
services are being accessed over the Internet are not otherwise
Web resources that one would access using a web browser, and
that using a single generic POST method (going POSTal), and putting
the actual operation in the body, makes more sense.

This design choice is somewhat of a religious debate, unfortunately:
it's clear that the first-order functionality of a protocol can be
expressed either way, and that the design considerations are second-order,
yet the design choice has a major effect in the description of (although
not the implementation of) the protocol.
