Can we use XML for moving binary data (not text) from one system to another.

An example of this would be a company merging with another company and both
organizations utilize COLD-ERM technology

If both companies utilize different COLD-ERM vendors, it isn't easy to
migrate data between the systems.  As a result, we are developing a new TIFF
style transport method to move the data between the systems as an AIIM/ANSI
standard.

Several of us on the AIIM/ANSI committee have the following question we are
hoping someone in SWAP can answer:

The question is:

We know that we can use TIFF, but can we use XML instead?   The twist is
that COLD-ERM data usually is based on AFP metacode, etc. and can include
graphics as a template. As we understand XML, it doesn't support non-ascii
formats which would prevent us from using XML.  Is this a correct statement
or can XML support our needs as well?????


Thanks for anyone's input/feedback on this question.
