You absolutely can move binary data within an XML document; but you must
encode it into text format so that there are no illegal characters
within your data.  There is no recognized standard way to encode/decode
your data, so you decide how to encode and decode your own data.
Suggested way is probably MIME/base 64 encoding.

Here's an article that sums up the issue:

and some other links on MIME:

Subject: Re: Using XML for binary data 


Unfortunately I am not up on my XML, however, I believe
that the XML/RPC people have some clever solutions to
this sort of thing.  Basically they use XML as the
marshalling format.  I am supposing anything you
can send over email can work with this using uuencode. 

One of the techniques we use sometimes in the Endeavors project
is to just to RMI serialize a Java object that was dyanmically
built up from a set of data values, pass it as a bit bucket using
a POST method, and then catching it on the HTTP server side using
a Java servlet to decode and initiate/load/execute/fetch data
and code as appropriate.  It's one way to do mobile workflows,
although we tend to prefer non-binary dependencies/designs.

Java turns out to be a great mechanism for mixing and 
matching, even graphic and data formats as you seem to be doing.
