I'm a little confused about something concerning the placement of
custom methods for SWAP in the HTTP header.  
Hopefully someone out there can point me in the right direction.

I know that the SWAP methods, like PROPFIND or CREATEPROCESSINSTANCE
are supposed to replace common HTTP headers like "GET" and "POST" - but when
I try to send these SWAP methods to my IIS server - It doesn't see them!  

Is there some config I have to do to get IIS to see methods other
than the standard HTTP methods?  


thanks in advance,
rich
