If you just want to do PROPFIND, IIS 5.0 supports WebDAV PROPFIND.

You can implement an ISAPI to receive new methods, or an ASP can even
receive new methods. If you want to install something that supports an
entire namespace you need to use the metabase to register it as a *
scriptmap for that namepsace.  I don't know the gritty details about how to
do this, but I hope this points you in the right direction.

Good luck,
Lisa Lippert

I'm a little confused about something concerning the placement of
custom methods for SWAP in the HTTP header.  
Hopefully someone out there can point me in the right direction.

I know that the SWAP methods, like PROPFIND or CREATEPROCESSINSTANCE
are supposed to replace common HTTP headers like "GET" and "POST" - but when
I try to send these SWAP methods to my IIS server - It doesn't see them!  

Is there some config I have to do to get IIS to see methods other
than the standard HTTP methods?  


thanks in advance,
rich
