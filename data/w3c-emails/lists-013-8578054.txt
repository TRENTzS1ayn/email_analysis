Until there is a standard, there is no standard.

You can always implement things NOW however you want. The only question
is whether you will find the resulting interoperability satisfactory.

Has anyone reported the minutes from the SWAP meeting at the last IETF?
I couldn't make it (a conflict with another WG which I couldn't miss),
but the report I heard didn't make it sound like good news.

The price of early adoption is the likelihood of having to change things.
