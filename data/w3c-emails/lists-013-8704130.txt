Trail Blazers have their own set of risks and rewards.  Keith Swenson wrote
some proof of concept code and sample data, but he was in the process of
releasing that when he left Netscape.  To my knowledge that code has yet to
be made public.

Look at it this way, if you go first, and succeed within the spec as it is
now, you become the expert.  If you have to make some changes to surmount
one problem or another, well you could be elected chairman of the technical
committee.
