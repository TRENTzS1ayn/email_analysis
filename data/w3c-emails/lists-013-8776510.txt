Here is the second iteration of SWAP Wg charter. I have removed
IN-SCOPE and NOT IN-SCOPE goals from the charter. Goals document,
which will be published as an informational RFC as first document
, describes goals of this working group. I also made some changes
to the milestones to make it more realistic. It is time for us
to move forward to work the goals document.

Apprciate your comments/suggestions.

Description of Working Group

There is no standard way to communicate and interoperate across
heterogeneous workflow engines in order to coordinate and execute work
process instances across those workflow engines. Most of the solutions 
exist today are vendor specific. This means that Workflow vendors need 
to support multiple protocols to enable interoperability between worflow 
systems.
 
The goal of this working group is to develop the goals and requirements for 
Workflow systems interoperability.

The further goal is to define an application level Workflow Interoperability
protocol. Workflow interoperability goals document defines the scope of the
protocol.


Deliverables

The final output of this working group is expected to be four documents:

1. A workflow interoperability goals document, which describes the scope
    and limitations of the protocol.

2. A requirements document, which describes the high-level functional
   requirements for Simple Workflow Access Protocol, including rationale.

3. A scenarios document, a description of how this protocol can be used
   effectively.   

4. A protocol specification, which describes methods, request bodies, and 
   response bodies, to implement the  Simple Workflow Access Protocol
   requirements. 

Goals and Milestones


 Oct 98  Publish Simple Workflow Access Protocol goals document as Internet
 Draft.

         as Internet-Drafts.
