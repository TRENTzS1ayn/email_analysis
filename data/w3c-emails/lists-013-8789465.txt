I am looking for volunteers(upto 3 positions) to serve as editors on the
SWAP goals, requirements and scenarios documents. I expect that work on
these documents  can be handled via email, with some conference calls.
Volunteering for this work will require actively tracking list discussions
as well as document authoring responsibilities.

I'm also looking for volunteers to serve on the SWAP protocol design team.
The  intent of having a design team is to address the drawbacks of
performing protocol  design in a large group, while not losing the
benefits of large group review. As a result, this protocol document will
be developed by the design team, but is  always subject to feedback and
approval from the working group, which is the final arbiter of consensus
on the draft. Members of the design team will be expected  to travel to
design team meetings (probably one meeting every 1-2 months at 
the beginning, while the design is being hammered out), and will also be 
expected to actively track mailing list discussion on the document.  Some 
specification authoring responsibilities are also likely.

So, if you're interested in any of these positions, send me an email at 
skreddy@us.oracle.com.
