To pick up on Christer's point - what exactly is the relationship between
the SWAP WG and the Coalition - I could be on the wrong mailing lists but I
have seen nothing for some time which even remotely suggests X-fertilization
of strategy, scope and ideas.

>Description of Working Group
>
>There is no standard way to communicate and interoperate across
>heterogeneous workflow engines in order to coordinate and execute work
>process instances across those workflow engines. Most of the solutions
>exist today are vendor specific. This means that Workflow vendors need
>to support multiple protocols to enable interoperability between worflow
>systems.
>
>The goal of this working group is to develop the goals and requirements for
>Workflow systems interoperability.
>
>The further goal is to define an application level Workflow
Interoperability
>protocol. Workflow interoperability goals document defines the scope of the
>protocol.
>
>
>Deliverables
>
>The final output of this working group is expected to be four documents:
>
>1. A workflow interoperability goals document, which describes the scope
>    and limitations of the protocol.
>
>2. A requirements document, which describes the high-level functional
>   requirements for Simple Workflow Access Protocol, including rationale.
>
>3. A scenarios document, a description of how this protocol can be used
>   effectively.
>
>4. A protocol specification, which describes methods, request bodies, and
>   response bodies, to implement the  Simple Workflow Access Protocol
>   requirements.
>
>Goals and Milestones
>
>
> Oct 98  Publish Simple Workflow Access Protocol goals document as Internet
> Draft.
>
> Nov 98  Submit revised versions of Requirements, Scenarios and goals
documents
>         as Internet-Drafts.
>
> Feb 99  Submit goals document as an informational RFC
>         Submit revised protocol specification document as Internet Draft
>
> Jun 99 Issue WG last call for requirements, scenarios and protocol

> Jul 99  Submit requirements and scenarios documents as informational RFCs
