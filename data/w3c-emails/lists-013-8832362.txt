For what it's worth, my feeling is that SWAP should examine and
consider leveraging work done by other groups (including wfmc), but
should not be required by its charter to use such efforts, or even to
"harmonize" or "cross-fertilize" with them.  WG consensus, not the
charter, should guide whether such work is used.

Other IESG folks, or IAB folks, may have other opinions.
