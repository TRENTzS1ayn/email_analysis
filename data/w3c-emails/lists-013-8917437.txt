It's fine if the work is technically sound and the WG wants to go that 
way, but I'm not going to impose that constraint,  and I'll lobby hard
to keep other IESG or IAB folks from imposing that constraint.

It's been my experience that other standards organizations, especially
"industry standard" organizations often produce large amounts of garbage.
This isn't a comment on the WfMC stuff, since I haven't evaluated it.
But in general I'm not going to insist that an IETF working group adhere
to the work of some other body, unless that work is known to be of 
unimpeachable quality.
