I understand, and accept, the IETF position, but I do not believe the WfMC
is closed - there is a unique opportunity to bring together internet
expertise and workflow expertise and deliver something of real value - BUT -
my perception is that there is a degree of NIH in both camps. From a
pragmatic position, I do not want to be in a position of having to develop
and support two interoperability standards - but this aspect of the
standards is, IMHO, the only bit worth doing so I want to see it done right
and for the good of end users.

What are the proposals (and I aim this question at AIIM/WfMC) for bringing
these two areas of work together.
