I would add that one of the benefits of an IETF effort is the input we as
proponents of SWAP, will get from IETF members that are not part of WfMC.
It has been suggested that the WfMC IF4 with MIME, HTTP(i.e. SWAP) AND OMG
BO bindings are adequate.  But without the OMG member's input or the IETF
input how can we ensure we have considered all the aspects?

It's fine if the work is technically sound and the WG wants to go that
way, but I'm not going to impose that constraint,  and I'll lobby hard
to keep other IESG or IAB folks from imposing that constraint.

It's been my experience that other standards organizations, especially
"industry standard" organizations often produce large amounts of garbage.
This isn't a comment on the WfMC stuff, since I haven't evaluated it.
But in general I'm not going to insist that an IETF working group adhere
to the work of some other body, unless that work is known to be of
unimpeachable quality.
