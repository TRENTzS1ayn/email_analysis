We're looking at hybrid systems where there are both
manual and automated processes. The product gets ordered,
the credit card gets verified, the factory workers assemble
the product, the documentation gets printed automatically, the
package gets assembled and shipped, the credit card gets charged.

Some of the steps happen with a potentially long delay, while others
happen quickly enough to complete as a request/response.
If we can use SWAP to allow tighter integration of business processes,
it will help organizational efficiency. I'm not sure there's a clear
dividing line between 'synchronous' and 'asynchronous'; we're just
trying to decide whether the action usually happens more quickly than
the mean time between network partitioning.
