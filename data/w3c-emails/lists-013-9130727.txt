Its the latter case. Because think of critical processes in certain
industry (e.g.chemical industry). Your aim is to provide secure maintenance

of the system, so you support the maintenance process with workflow. Before
you start with the work at any part of your production place, you have to
fulfill some prerequisites (e.g. no pressure in the system e.t.c) for 
security reasons. If the acknowledge of the fulfillmemt of this is returned
to the workflow engine, the next step, the start of the maintenance is
offered. At the same time, an error in the prerequisites or in the planning
of the maintenance is detected and the start-of-maintenance-step is
suspended. If the suspension of this step will be invoked asyncronously,
somebody might start with the work and security problems arise. This step
has to be canceled immediately an not delayed 'for better times'.
This example might not be the best example, but you have the need for 
syncronisation in every workflow. An other example is an original print of 
some document (e.g. an insurance policy) where you can have only one
'original print'. If the print is started and at the same time there is a
change issued, the print action has to be suspended or the change-step has 
to be suspended, iff the print action can't be suspended. This can't be
done
asyncronously.
Of course, there are problems if your connection to the remote system is
lost, but that's another problem.
