Sorry, let me clarify.  You are correct in that SWAP is intended 
as a 'service' to 'service' protocol.  By 'service' here we mean
something that answers a request to a Web URL.  But in an
given specific interaction, one of those workflow servers is the 
"client" sending a request, and the other is the "server" which 
handles the request and sends a response.  

Now, in fact, similar to to the OMG workflow RFP, SWAP supports
some aspects of IF2, IF3, and IF4, but the intent is for a 
persistent service to talk to another persistent service.
