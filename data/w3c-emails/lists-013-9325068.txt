Hello all,
I was hoping someone could help me clear up some confusion I have
regarding these two SWAP Interfaces.
It looks to me that a Worklist may be similar to a request for a "to-do
list" or a list of workflow tasks assigned to 
a particular user of the workflow system.  Does this sound correct?

WorkItem really confuses me.  The SWAP document mentions that this
interface is a type of process instance - but one that does not have any
preprogrammed activity.  Could anyone expand on this?


thanks in advance,
richard heim
