> Problem Statement
>
> Currently all services or processes on the Internet are well suited for
> short
> lived interactions between users and systems that provide information and
> services. There is no standard way to support long running interactions
> on the Internet. A standard protocol is needed to integrate work providers
> and
> asynchronous services across the Internet and provide for creating the
> work,
> setting up the work, starting the work, stopping the work, being informed
> of
> exceptions, being informed of the completion of the work, getting the
> results
> of the work, checking on the current status of the work and getting a
> history
> of the execution of the work.
>
> Workflow service is a good example of a generic service which when invoked
>
> can take anywhere from minutes to months to complete, so this protocol can
> be
> used to initiate workflows without being concerned with how the workflow
> system
> accomplishes it.  Secondly, workflow services are used to invoke and
> coordinate
> external asynchronous services, and this protocol allows a standard way to
> plug
> generic services from anywhere on the Internet into a workflow process.
>
> Description of Working Group
>
> The purpose of this working group is to provide a simple protocol to
> invoke,
> monitor, control, and be informed about a generic asynchronous service.
>
> An ad-hoc group has analyzed the functional needs of several
> organizations,
> and has developed requirements for Simple Workflow Access Protocol.
> These requirements encompass the following capabilities, which SHALL BE
> considered by this working group:
>
> IN-SCOPE GOALS:
>
>    * a standard way to start, stop and monitor a generic service
>    * query the status of the service,
>    * pass data values to the service
>    * pause or resume the service,
>    * retrieve preliminary results of the service,
>    * subscribe and receive events from the service.
>    * basic auditing functions
>    * internationalization
>    * security considerations
>
> NOT IN SCOPE:
>
> Many decisions have been made to reduce the scope of this working group.
> This working group will limit its scope to the IN-SCOPE goals and will
> not address the following issues, unless they are critical for successful
> completion of the IN-SCOPE goals:
>
>     * exchange of process definition
>     * transactions
>     * statistics gathering or monitoring of processes other than
> retrieving
>       the status of the specific instance of a service.
>     * administration functions such as installation or general
>       management of a service
>     * presentation of data to humans in HTML or other types of form
> layout.
>
> Deliverables
>
> The final output of this working group is expected to be three documents:
>
> 1. A requirements document, which describes the high-level functional
>    requirements for Simple Workflow Access Protocol, including rationale.
>
> 2. A scenarios document, a description of how this protocol can be used
>    effectively.
>
> 3. A protocol specification, which describes methods, request bodies, and
>    response bodies, to implement the  Simple Workflow Access Protocol
>    requirements.
>
> Goals and Milestones
>
>  DONE    Hold the first meeting on May 4 & 5, '98 of the ad-hoc
>          group. Review the initial version of the specification document.
>          Review the charter for the working group, and decide on a final
>          form to be used to propose the formation of the working group.
>
>  DONE    (Aug '98) Submit initial version of the requirements document
>  as an I-D.
>
>  Aug 98  Initial version of the scenarios document distributed for review
>          within the working group.
>
>  Nov 98  Submit revised versions of all  Requirements, Scenarios and
>          Protocol documents as Internet-Drafts.
>
>  Dec 98  Meet in 43rd IETF in Orlando, review requirements and Scenarios
>  documents.
>
>  Jan 99  Submit all Requirements and Scenario drafts as Informational RFCs
>
>  Feb 99 Issue WG last call for protocol specification
>
>  Mar 99 Meet in 44th IETF, and review the final specification
>
>  Apr 99  Submit SWAP specification as a proposed standard
>
> Current Internet-Drafts
