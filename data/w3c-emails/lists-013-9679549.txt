Workflow systems have become both more widely deployed and more
adaptable in the last decade of the 20th century.  Workflow systems
traditionally were monolithic and required the installation of client
software on the desktop. With the advent of Java, commercial software
quickly moved towards applet-based clients and to more distributed
systems.

More radically, workflow systems are increasingly taking advantage of
Internet technologies to become more open.  One example is the
Workflow Management Coalition (http://www.aiim.org/wfmc/mainframe.htm)
initiative to promote XML-based interoperability among workflow
systems, which builds on earlier work on the draft Simple Workflow
Access Protocol (SWAP) initiative.  At a higher-level of abstraction
are efforts to develop adaptable agent-based workflow systems
(http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/~paj/ijcai-wflow-wshop/).  These efforts are
intensifying as the coordination of work among organizations becomes
an important component of electronic commerce

We solicit papers on workflow and process management systems that
leverage the technologies and openness of the Internet, including
agent-based systems.  We distinguish workflow and process management
systems from collaborative systems in that the latter supports the
sharing of information whereas the former also facilitate and automate
the coordination and execution of processes, particularly for
electronic commerce.  Novel approaches, technical evaluations, and
case studies of commercial deployments are invited especially.
