The IETF did not turn out to be the right place to do this work.  The work
on an XML format for encoding process information has been carried on by the
WfMC in a new spec called Wf-XML.  This is a subset of the original SWAP
proposal, but the working group is pledged to proceed to fill in the rest of
the functionality.

SWAP then becomes simply the sending of this format over HTTP, which is an
example transport protocol mentioned in the spec.

check http://www.wfmc.org/ for details and to get a copy of the spec.

What is the status of SWAP?  Its requirements, specifications and goals
were supposed to be implemented in September 1999.  If implemented, what
is the RFC number? I need this information in a hurry for my research
work.

Thanks,

J. Myerson
