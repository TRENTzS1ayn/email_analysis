RE: XML's Role in E-Commerce and Enterprise ComputingThe problem with this
approach is the missing functionality of the HTTP protocol. SWAP was
building on the WebDAV protocol and I think WfMC has missed that point.

No longer do we have a standard protocol which would allow open interaction
between workflow servers, but a self serving set of APIs to allow the
suppliers to retain control of the market. There is too much missing from
the drafts; too much functionality will be proprietary extensions.
  -----Original Message-----
  SWAP then becomes simply the sending of this format over HTTP, which is an
example transport protocol mentioned in the spec.
