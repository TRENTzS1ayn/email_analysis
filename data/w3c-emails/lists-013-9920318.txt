The Apache-derived Magi Project (magi.endeavors.org) is actively working 
on realeasing an installable server, a Wf-XML derived implementation & 
parser, a SWAP implementation that leverages our close ties to HTTP and WebDAV, 
and an embeddable workflow engine--all open source.  Currently you
can download the server and the open MagiDAV implementation.

I think you'll see all the  pieces fall into place and the drafts will 
evolve as people get hands on experience playing around with implementations.
