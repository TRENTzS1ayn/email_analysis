With greetings,
To whomsoever it may concern
-------------------------------------------
We into a devlepoment programme for a generic workflow
engine based on SWAP.
The problem we are facing while coding on the server
part is as follows:

In the document WFMC-TC-1023(dated 1-May-2000 version
1.0) the TRANSPORT LAYER BINDINGS section
proposes the use of HTTP method POST for sending the
data encoded iin XML from the client to the
Server.

But if we go on the lines of WebDAV or SWAP internet
drafts the usage of protocol specific methods 
is suggested.
Example PROPFIND is method which the client sends to
the server for getting the properties of the RESOURCE.
Even the presentation my Mr. Surender Reddy(chairman
SWAP workging group) has a slide 
which i am sending as attachment.
The attached slide basically throws light on the
Method CREATEPROCESSINSTANCE.


The confusion is that we are not able to decide to
which STANDARD to stick to.
The other thing we may do is to CONSIDER both the
situations while coding the SWAP API.

I will be highly obliged if you throw some light on
this issue.

Thanking you,
Praveen Reddy,
