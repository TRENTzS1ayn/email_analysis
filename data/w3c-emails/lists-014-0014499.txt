The *date* was certainly not brought up in the BOF, especially since this is  
te crucial, debated expectation of "unification by Montreal". This was not an  
oversight, though; the charter discussion explicitly avoided milestone issues  
that evening.

Separately, though, I thought I'd note that the WG's 'final draft' is only  
the beginning of the stdization process. Final drafts are submitted to the  
IESG with a recommendation to Proposed; then a Last Call is held. Later,  
evidence of its success can be brought to the IESG to promote it to STD  
status.

Besides, I can think of a pretty cool logo for STP -- STLP can't even be  
pronounced! :-)
