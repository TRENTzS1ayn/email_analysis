These are "guess" dates at this point. The point is that if we were to 
get an RFC by the end of the year -- a "final" draft needs to be 
available soon. 

My guess is that the sooner this get resolved the better -- with the 
right technical soltion of course. We also have enough combined 
expertise that this is not totally out of the question.
