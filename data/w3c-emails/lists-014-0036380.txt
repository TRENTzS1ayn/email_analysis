I'll throw something on the table: why just TCP-based sessions? Why not UDP?

I'm not overly hopeful of *secure* SNMPv(whatever) coming along "soon".
I suspect many management stations have the same stack problem as our
web browser systems. 

I'd like to see something in the standards space to address alternative
solutions to this issue. [Unfortunately I'm way behind in plowing 
through the mountain of existing IDs, etc., so if there is anything that
does address this, I'm interested in pointers.]
