Hi David,

Paul's reply-quoting was of a message that I sent to the IETF mailing
list and CC'd to Paul.  Indeed, that message started off with

I'd like to make some comments on the technical side of what was
discussed at the IETF mtg, and repeat some points made there here,
both to clarify and add emphasis to the points and to make sure they
go into the WG email/web archive.

Now, -I- never got a copy of my own email from the mailing list, but
the message did make it into the TLS web archive -- see
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-tls/>.  Maybe the mailing
list software is buggy -- but my message that Paul quoted was
certainly -not- one-to-one private communications.

Anyway, don't blame me for keeping things private -- additionally, the
result of the BOF at Palo Alto was that I was to write up some stuff
on pre-encryption and pre-MACing for inclusion in a draft document
that Paul would put together for public comment; others would
similarly contribute on different topics or write separate white
papers, also for public discussion.  The PA meeting notes were emailed
to this list and appears in the TLS archive at w3.org.  As it turned
out, I was slow about it (was away at a conference right after the PA
BOF) and Paul decided to write it up himself (rather than wait for me)
based on a phone conversation and an email message.  This was, as far
as I could tell, all more-or-less according to what was decided at the
Palo Alto meeting -- to have various people contribute and produce a
draft for public discussion at Montreal.  You might argue that the
procedure that was decided upon at the PA mtg was flawed, but....

Also, please make the distinction between pre-encrypted and pre-MACed
data.  They have very different security properties.  I discussed the
differences in my previous email message to the list, and will clarify
some other issues in a subsequent message.
