Bennet,

  I heartily apologize for accusing you of being an email conspirator.
I did look back at my TLS folder to find your messages and didn't see them,
but even if the mail list were working perfectly, I could have scanned
and forgotten the content and mis-filed the messages myself.  I hope the
delivery problems can be identified and resolved - especially since the
messages are showing up in the archives.

Sorry again,
   dpk
