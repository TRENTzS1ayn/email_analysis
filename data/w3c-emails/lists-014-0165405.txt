Not that I'm confident that we can properly design pre-encryption into TLS
right now, but if we are going to there is one thing I'd like to add to the
discussion.

If there is a protocol hook made, it should also be available in such a
form that it is compatible with the idea of compression. The option for
compression exists in the current draft (though no specific compression
specs have been proposed yet) and you don't want to try to compress a
pre-encrypted container.
