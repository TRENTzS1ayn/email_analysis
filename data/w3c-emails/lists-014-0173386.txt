Here is the summary I submitted to the Area Director (Jeff Schiller):

The TLS working group met once (and for the first time) at the
Montreal IETF meeting. The group heard presentations from
Paul Kocher on SSL version 3.0, Tatu Ylonen on SSH, and Mark
Scherlter about ISAKMP.  The main topic of discussion was
how the working group should undertake its work, and
the group decided to begin with the current SSL 3.0 specification
and consider some changes. Paul Kocher presented a few
possible changes, and discussion will continue on the mailing list.

Minutes will follow in a few days.
