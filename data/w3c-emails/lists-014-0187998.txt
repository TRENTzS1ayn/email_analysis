Thanks for the posting Win.

I wanted to clarify a point concerning the process. 

I assume that for the 7/30 deliverables, all that will needed is a
simple posting to the list.  However, for the 8/31 deliverables, what is
the preferred format for the detailed descriptions?  Should these be
submitted to the IETF as Internet-Drafts?  Should these just be
submitted as text files to the mailing list?  Etc.?
