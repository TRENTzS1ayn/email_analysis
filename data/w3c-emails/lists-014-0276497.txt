Personally, I'm opposed to password (or passphrase) authentication for
a number of reasons.  In my response, I've mostly restricted my comments
to technical issues.  Basically, I think passwords work fine if you
only have one, but after that they become a problem.

Unfortunately, they all rely on the fact that the challenger knows the
password.

That works fine if there's only one passphrase to remember.  If you have
to remember many, you'll either end up writing them down (bad), or using
the same passphrase for each service (really bad).  If you rely on your
computer to remember the random binary strings of bits, then you lose
the biggest advantage of passwords, the ability to carry them around in
your head.

This is semantics.  You claim that these systems don't require the
service to know your passphrase, but that's only true if you don't
consider the authentication authority to be part of the service.  In
Kerberos this is the ticket-granting server.  In RADIUS, this is
password daemon.  I'm not familiar with KryptoKnight and RPA, but I'm
sure they are the same.

I don't see how this is any different for certificates.  The user loses
his private key (for whatever reason).  He calls customer service, they
invalidate his current certificate.  He then logs in and generates a
new certificate, going through the Equifax (or whatever) authentication
process he went through initially to generate an account.  Customer
service can even generate a one-time PIN that he can use for this
purpose.

I don't think we should be burdening an international standard with
idiosyncrasies imposed by brain-damaged US regulations that will
hopefully be repealed in the near future.
