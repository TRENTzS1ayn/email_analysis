In the interest of making progress, I think we need to have a common
document to work from.  If everyone thinks this is a good idea, I'd be
happy to incorporate the SSL 3.0 errata into the spec and then make it
available.

Should I include change bars?  Should I post it to the list, or put it
up for ftp?  Both?
