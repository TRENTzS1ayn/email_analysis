  I have accounts on over a dozen sites that use basic auth on
the internet.  In every case I provided my own username and
password.  If these sites forced passwords on users they would
end up with a lot less subscribers.

  I think that including password authentication does weaken
TLS.  Every time someones password is stolen and used to
impersonate someone using TLS, it will weaken the public
perception of the standard.  I realize that this is not a
technical concern, but it is a real one.
