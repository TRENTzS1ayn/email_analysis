note that RFC 1602 has been replaced and is no longer the IETF standards
process - the new process has not yet been published as an RFC but can
be found in the internet-drafts directory as:
draft-ietf-poised95-std-proc-3-06.txt

This new version changes the IPR rules quite a bit and the cited language
is no longer in the document.
