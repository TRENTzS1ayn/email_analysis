Bennet, 

Thanks for your prompt response.  But I have one further question:

But how is the shared ``MAC key'' communicated?  Using asym crypto?
Or is it derived from the shared password, in which case the attacker
could use a dictionary attack?

Or would, for example, all Compuserve subscribers have the same
shared MAC key and we assume the eavesdropper does not know it?
