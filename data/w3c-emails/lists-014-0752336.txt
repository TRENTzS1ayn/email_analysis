This is absolutely correct.  Fortunately, the proposal *does* involve
asymmetric crypto--for key exchange.  Once a (strong) key has been
exchanged using asymmetric cryptography, the (as-yet-anonymous) client
and (already-authenticated) server share a fresh, random secret
(presumably) unavailable to the attacker, and can use that secret to
protect the shared-key-based client authentication transcript.
