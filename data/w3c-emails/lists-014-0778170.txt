No problem, your response helped me to better understand my own question <g>.
I do think, though, that in the final proposal, the shared MAC secret should not
be allowed to be derived from the passphrase.  Many users will choose low entropy
passphrases, and a successful dictionary attack of a transcript might cause the
entire TLS standard to be perceived as weak.

So it seems that the client code will come up with a (high entropy) random
number, and encrypt it with the Server's public key.  Is that correct?

Is there a provision in the proposal to deny service to an account which
is being dictionary attacked directly, or will this be left up to 
the implementation?
