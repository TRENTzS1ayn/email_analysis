This is the standard RSA server auth key exchange.

Protocols only specify the messages sent over the wire.  The
vulnerability to dictionary attacks, unfortunately, is independent of
this -- active on-line attacks, where the server is actually being
probed, -can- be detected by the server implementation, but such an
implementation requirement is outside the scope of a protocol
standard; off-line attacks where protocol messages are eavesdropped
and then used to determine the key in a separate computation, much as
brute-force key searches are done with known-plaintext attacks, are
completely separated from both protocol specifications as well as
implementation specifications.
