At the Montreal meeting (in reference to the flexibility of the SSH proposal)
someone commented that the protocol should not allow the implementor to 
"do bad things".  I agree with this, because many implementors don't have
the time or cryptographic expertise to consider all angles of attack.

Given that, it is misleading to state that (with the passauth proposal)
your passwords are protected with 128 bit crypto, when in reality a
server without attack detection, combined with a user whose password
is in a dictionary of 65000 commonly used passwords, effectively
has 16 bit crypto protection.

A security system is only as strong as its weakest link.  Again, I'm no
cryptographer, but it seems to me that this channel of attack does not
exist if passphrases are disallowed in TLS.
