Actually, I expect that in exportable TLS implementations applications
would *not* be free to decide what to use this for, since the TLS
implementation would presumably have to use some means to prevent sneaky
applications from using the extra channel for user data.

In any event, if this solution is more palatable to the working group
than the addition of a specific password authentication feature, then I,
for one, am happy with it.
