We do this on our B2 Unix implementation (DG/UX), and a partner is
implementing this for Windows.  The actual implementation will allow
arbitrary filters to be configured for specific types of connections for
specific users and/or specific hosts.  SSL will be one of the original
filters offered.

This is not currently available.  If you would like additional info, let me
know.
