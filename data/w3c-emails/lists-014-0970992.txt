To members of ietf-tls@w3.org:

I have recently received numerous requests from non-W3C Member organizations 
to join the W3C Digital Signature Initiative.

Please note the following:

a.  DSIG is _not_ open; it is closed to W3C Member organizations ONLY

b.  There is, indeed, a mailing list and proposal out for votes to W3C 
Members, closing on 15 September 1996.

c.  For W3C Members [or if you've recently become a W3C Member], more 
information can be found at:

Proposal:
 http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Security/DsigProj.html

Voting Details -- accessible to W3C Members ONLY:
http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Member 



If your organization is interested in becoming a Member of W3C, please review 
the information at http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Consortium/Prospectus/

If you need any additional information, feel free to contact me at 
khudairi@w3.org.

Regards,

Sally Khudairi
