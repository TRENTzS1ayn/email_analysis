W3C is a membership-based organization, and its members are interested in
carrying out this work directly and quickly.  These members include over 150
companies in the computer, network, telecommunications, service, publishing,
banking, and other industries.  Membership in W3C is open, at very
reasonable rates, to any company or organization that is interested in work
like the Digital Signature Initiative.

I would like to emphasize that the call for participation in the Initiative
makes it clear that the output of the project will be code and
specifications ALL OF WHICH will be made available at no charge to the
general public.  The change control and maintenance of both will be decided
by the participants at the end of the project, and turning either or both
over to a formal Standards body is certainly a likely outcome.
