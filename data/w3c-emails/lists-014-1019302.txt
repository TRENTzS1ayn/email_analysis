I think that this is rather ridiculous -- Consensus Development Corporation
is one of the most active companies in the web security and digital
signature field -- we wrote Sign-A-File for VeriSign, Inc., SSLRef 3.0 with
Netscape Communications Corp., and CD-ROM signing for Apple's Pippin
computer. We have the SSL Plus developer toolkit, write the SSL FAQ, and
have a forthcoming certificate toolkit.

Yet there is no way that we can justify $50K to join W3C! Even CI Labs (the
OpenDoc Alliance), the SPA, and other associations have room for small
companies like ours, and have often found companies like ours are the most
valued contributors, and thus have fees commiserate to our size.
