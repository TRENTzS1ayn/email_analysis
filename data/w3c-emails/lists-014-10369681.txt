Hi,
This was the only css related list I saw. Pardon me if I miss the proper 
list. I have a suggestion for an addition to the Height and Width 
properties as it applies to the box model. I was wondering where I should 
send this suggestion. For those burning with desire to know what it is, I 
would like to see the following.

Basically put: Height: 100% - Xpx;

This may seem strange, but it would be useful to be able to set the height 
of a box where you want it to be some X amount less than the viewport, no 
matter what size the viewport is, or on resize.

Thanks
