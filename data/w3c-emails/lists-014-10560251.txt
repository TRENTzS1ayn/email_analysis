Hi,

I have a problem with an applet that I have displayed on a layer, when I
click the link to display the layer holding the applet I can see the
writing from the previous layer appearing on the applet, if I click to
another window and come back this ghost writing is gone, Has anyone had
this problem before or know of a solution to it.

 

Regards

Brian Murphy
