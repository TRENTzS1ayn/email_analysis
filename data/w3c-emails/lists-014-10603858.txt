Hello,

I noticed a small error in the CSS1 test suite (section 7.1,
"Forward-compatible parsing",
http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS1/current/sec71.htm): the document
has no language specified on any element, yet relies on the document
language in a couple of CSS2 selectors.

I'm using a Gecko-based UA, and it appears that Gecko will match the
:lang pseudo-class using the languages configured for Accept-Languages
(pref intl.accept_languages) in the absence of a document-specified
language.  This seems like an acceptable behavior, but it causes
unexpected output when I view the CSS1 test suite (as mentioned above)
because I have French in my list of accepted languages.  Specifically,
the <ul> item "This unordered list item should be black, because,
according to CSS1, the selector is invalid, and according to CSS2, the
selector should not apply." appears in gray, because the CSS2 selector
*did* apply.

I should also note that the <span> that follows shortly after does NOT
appear to match (the CSS specifies SPAN[lang|="fr"]), although I'm
uncertain as to whether this is the correct behavior (i.e. specified
differences between :lang and [lang|=]) or an inconsistency in the UA.

Not subscribed to list, please CC replies, etc.
