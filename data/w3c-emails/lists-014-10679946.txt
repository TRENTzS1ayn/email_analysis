I just wrote a few tests [1] for 2.1 [2], and I'm interested in knowing
how I'm doing, especially with regard to the guidelines [3], and
especially from the authors of said guidelines.

A few issues where I'm particularly unsure of myself are:
 * are my title elements good?
 * are my filenames good, especially regarding my choice along the
   a-b-c-d-e-f spectrum (for which the tests I wrote are perhaps an
   unusual case)?
 * is my lack of consistent wording a problem?  I've written multiple
   variations of the sentences "This paragraph should have a green
   background." and "The next two paragraphs should look identical."
