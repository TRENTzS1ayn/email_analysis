I concur with Ian's comments have only two other quick short comments to
make:

1. serve the files as text/html for ease of trying them out in more browsers
 (alternatively, conditionally serve as application/xhtml+xml only if http
accept headers allow for it -- folks have documented this on the net.)
I know, this violates what is allowed for XHTML 1.1, but it helps usability
(a good tradeoff), and will only make a difference in browsers that don't
handle XHTML anyway.

Another possibility is to use content negotiation so that URLs without a
file extension, e.g.:

http://dbaron.org/css2.1/tests/t010403-shand-border-00-c

are sent as text/html to browsers that don't handle XHTML.


2. possibly add more <link rel="help"> tags for some of the tests.
e.g. your border shorthand test should also link to the sections on the
'border' and 'border-color' property in spec, because that's really what
it's testing, in fact, I might put the link to the border-color property
first since that's really what is being thoroughly tested.

I'm busy with prepping for my presentations at SXSW so I didn't do a
detailed review and will hopefully have more comments later.

Definitely a very nice start though.  Makes me want to write some tests.

Thanks,

Tantek
