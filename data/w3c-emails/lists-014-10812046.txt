The rest:

Most of the missing XML and XMLwNS tests likely don't belong in reality, 
though they /are/ listed in the XML tests list, so I added them back in 
for this version of the impl report.  If they truely do not belong, 
please remove them from the test-list.

*NOTES*  I did not check the validity of the placement of tests.  I 
suggest /this/ implimentation report be updated to reflect this list, 
though the next iteration of the test-suite should be updated based on 
what makes sense, (IE: if the tests are there they should be here 
regardless of if they are correctly placed or not)

Missing from XML:

See: 
http://drapostles.hypermart.net/Non_Apostle/Mozilla/implementreportTEMPLATE.html
for an updated Template, which I did, also added empty class attributes 
to every 'a' element to assist impl report creators, feel free to use 
mine instead of doing the work yourselves, stylesheet link changed to 
tantek's page rather than downloading the stylesheet locally.

As an added note what is class="f"  mean?
