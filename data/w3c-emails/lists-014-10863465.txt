I believe I've found another error in the 20040510 draft of the CSS3 Selectors 
test suite [1].

Test d3 [2,3] has a very unclear (or just wrong?) description of what should be 
happening...

The XML version [2] has a background set on the root element.  This propagates 
to the canvas, making it hard to tell whether the test passes or not.

The XHTML version [3] says "The following block should be green" and has three 
blocks following that text.  Based on the markup and CSS, it seems to me that 
only the last of these three should be green...  therefore, a compliant UA would 
fail this test (since it would should a block of red and then a block of green).

It may be worth it, in this test, to differentiate between the <test> that is 
the subject of the test and the other random <test> nodes in the test....
