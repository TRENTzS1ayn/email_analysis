Good point. The new text will read:

   <p>Select everything in this document. The following two constructs
   (in the thick black borders) should end up looking identical. You
   should also check that the cursor is the same on equivalent parts
   (in particular the cursor should either be a crosshair over "Tree"
   and the default everywhere else, or the default everywhere).</p>

Let me know if that is clear enough.
