Well as far as I am concerned, (completely my opinion) the other tests, 
say should, along with /one/ feature tested...the one in question says 
"check that they look the same, " for the selection AND it says that the 
cursor should be the same, which usually is ok, but with the text as is, 
is a bit misleading....perhaps splitting the two /features/ then?
