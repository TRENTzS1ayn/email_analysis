   Content generated with the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements does 
not actually modify the content of the element; only the way it is 
presented, and thus does not affect whether or not another selector 
matches.  The background colour should be red.

   &amp; is an HTML/XML entity, not a CSS entity, so it would not be 
converted to an ampersand while parsing the CSS.  Therefore the selector 
would not match your test element.  I expect that it would, however, 
match this:
<test>&amp;amp;</test>
