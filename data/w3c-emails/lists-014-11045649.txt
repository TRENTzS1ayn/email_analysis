I see. How about:


   <test/>

   test{                  background:red;
                          content:"PASS"  }
   test:contains('PASS'){ background:lime }


Personally, I don't see a difference here and I think that they all 
should have a green background (which stands for PASS, obviously). 
Especially since ':first-letter' _does_ apply to '::before'. That would 
lead to incosinstency between selectors, something you should avoid, imo.

That would be logical if the first has a 'red' background, which it 
should have according to the XML parsing rules. I see authors, and maybe 
implementors make mistakes with this though (Opera did) and therefore it 
might be good to add it to the official test suite.
