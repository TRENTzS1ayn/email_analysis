   That's right, there is no difference.  The generated content doesn't 
actually affect the contents of the element in the document, only the 
way it is presented.  Thus, they all should be red.

What about this:
<test>foo</test>

test:contains('foo') { content: 'bar' }

   According to your logic, first the selector would match, the contents 
would be changed, then it would no longer match, so it would be changed 
back, then it would match again...
