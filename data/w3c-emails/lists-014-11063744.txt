This contradicts the entire model of CSS processing -- selectors are
matched against the content, declarations from the matching rules are
cascaded to determine the specified values, and then values are
computed.

Furthermore, I don't see a use case for your proposal.  Generated
content is unlikely to contain text like this since generated content
should not be used for things that are essential to viewing the document
(such as adding text).  It should only be used for things that are
stylistic (e.g., changing the list-numbering style).

Pseudo-elements are very different from pseudo-classes.  Pseudo-classes
are just selectors:  they affect whether an element matches the
selector.  Pseudo-elements are styling specific parts of an element, but
the selector matching process for pseudo-elements essentially occurs
without the pseudo-element.


Also, cross-posting between www-style and public-css-testsuite is almost
never the right thing to do, especially since the membership of the
two lists is quite similar.  This discussion belongs on www-style.
