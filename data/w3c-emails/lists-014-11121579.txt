Cwm release 0.7.3 was made today, 2004-06-08

Mostly inspired by the idea that releases should happen more often, as 
well as in order to give me an idea of what it takes to make a release, 
this release has several bugfixes.

If you missed release 0.7.2, that was because it was never announced.

All changes listed below are  shamelessly copied from 
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/changes.html

changes sinces 0.7.2:


        HTTP errors

Cwm now correctly identifies HTTP 404 errors, throwing an exception, and 
does not try to parse the returned (HTML) file.


        Reflexive statements now work


        An n3 statement which references the same universal quantifier
        twice now does the right thing.

Changes since 0.7.1:

Ooops - nodeID was misspelled nodeid on RDF/XML output.


        Patch functionality

The |--patch=/patchfile/| command line argument allows a patch file to 
be applied to the knowledge base (current working formula). See the 
Diff, Patch, Update and Sync <http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Diff> note 
in the /Design Issues/ series on the motivation for exchanging 
difference files, and how they work. Diff files can in certain specific 
circumstances (a well-labeled graph) be produced by the diff.py program 
included with this distribution. The new tests are in 
$SWAP/test/delta/detailed.tests


        Internationization undefined, Numerics canonicalized

The i18n/detailed.tests have been removed from the test harness. They 
were not right, and URI/ IRI issues are not clear yet. It is not clear 
whether cwm should URI-canonicalize, or IRI-canonicalize. (My instinct 
is that it should - Tim).

Cwm does not canonicalize numerical (xsd:double and xsd:integer) values 
on N3 output. It uses python's str(float(s)) and str(int(s)). The effect 
is to reduce some over-precision in the output.
