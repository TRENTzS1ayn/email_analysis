We're pleased to announce cwm release 0.7.

What is cwm?

Cwm is a general-purpose data processor for the semantic web, somewhat
like sed, awk, etc. for text files or XSLT for XML. It is a forward
chaining reasoner which can be used for querying, checking, transforming
and filtering information. Its core language is RDF, extended to include
rules, and it uses RDF/XML or RDF/N3 serializations as required.

The cwm home page is
   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm.html

For upcoming releases, status reports, etc., stay tuned to
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-cwm-announce/


What features does cwm 0.7 have?
--------------------------------

* Loading files in RDF/XML and/or N3, generating RDF or N3 files from
the result.
       * Pretty printing data so that anonymous nodes are used creatively
         to minimize the number of explicit existentials (generated Ids).
       * Applying rules written in N3 to the data
       * Filtering the data to the result of a particular query
       * Generating arbitrary formats (using --strings)
       * Using an internal knowledge of functions to resolve them within
         a query, including:
               * Simple math and string operations
               * Getting and parsing documents from the web
               * Accessing command line arguments and environment
                 variables
               * Cryptography: hashing, generating keys, signing things
                 and checking signatures.

Those features are covered by the cwm/N3 tutorial.
   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/

Other features are in development, and haven't been documented as
thoroughly:

       * Accessing the web to directly or indirectly resolve a query,
         including:
               * Getting schemas for terms in the query
               * Using metadata to point to definitive documents
               * Looking up data in local or remote SQL servers


How do I get started?
---------------------

We plan to have .tgz and/or .deb packages for future
releases; for this release, grab the release from CVS:

$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public login
password? anonymous
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public get 2000/10/swap

You can restore/upgrade  your software specifically to this release by
in that directory

$ cvs update -r release-0-7

Test that it's working:

$ cd test
$ make

All the tests should pass. Some of the tests are good examples
to study. Some are just regression tests to make sure old bugs
don't come back.

For an organized presentation of (most of) cwm's functionality,
see the tutorial...
   http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/


How can I get involved? Where do I send bug reports?
----------------------------------------------------

We're interested in contributions to the code, the
documentation, and the tests.
