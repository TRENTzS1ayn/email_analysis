My CVS checkout of 2000/10/swap on Thursday, April 15 gave me only one
failure when trying

retest.py -n -f regression.n3

(in Cygwin on Windows 2000)

File "include/n3ExprFor.n3" has all lines ending with CR CR LF (not just CR
LF) which can happen as a file is saved/written
between Unix and Windows.
These CRs are stripped out when downloading individual CVS files with a
browser, but I did a commandline checkout
of the entire tree with
"checkout 2000/10/swap/"
( an "--lf checkout 2000/10/swap/"  prevents this problem, but it isn't in
the cvs example and who remembers to use it?)

Removing the CRs fixes the error.  I don't think this will be the last time
that someone ends up with CR CR LF in an
n3 file and perhaps a general purpose catch should be coded (or already in
use somewhere else).

The runtime error is not very enlightening:

Files differ, result= 256
