I'm writing a converter from RDF to XMLRPC data structures.
I need to distinguish list items from integers, strings,
and other sorts of things. I tried

i = graph.any(subj=item, pred=RDF.first)
if i: #list...

but that test never passed. I changed it to

if isinstance(item, term.List):

and the code is working now. But since this limitation
isn't documented

http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/formula.html#Formula-any

I conclude it's a bug.
