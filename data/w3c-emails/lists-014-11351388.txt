Thanks. Fixed. This now generates an error.

The use of "this" is now disallowed  except as the subject of 
log:forAll or log:forSome.

I hope people haven't used it much.   I think this makes the N3 
language much more conventional, less weird for most people coming 
across it, and more easily translatable into other things.

Of course, I want to move toward removing "this" altogether, to just 
using @forAll and @forAome.

Note in the next version
@prefix : <#>.
will be the default, too, to save typing.

Thanks for all the great one-liner test cases.

Tim
