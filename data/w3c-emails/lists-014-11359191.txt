Yes, this is an objectlist as in a sentence with several triples of the 
same subject and predicate, like

:Joe  :child  :Egbert, :Marmaduke.

objecttail is used in propertlist, which is used in [ propertylist ] as 
an anonymous node,
and in statement:

statement bnf:mustBeOneSequence(( subject propertylist )).

That is a list in the sense of a collection. In the grammar, ( pathlist 
).
Pathlist has no commas.

I think you just got the productions crossed.  If I have missed 
something, let me know.  Thanks for implementing it.    Maybe we should 
make various levels of common test suite.
