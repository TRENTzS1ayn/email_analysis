Agreed - Unfixed bug.

This is because lists are de-reified on input to cwm.

Possible options are
- Make rdf:first and rdf:rest special to do what you would expect in 
just this API;
- Make these builtins wwok in any()
- Make all builtins work in any()   ... this might be considered weird.
- Make cwm de-reify not only lists but also de-reify formulae. that 
would allow
- any n3 file to be transported as plain RDF.

This is API question, probably should wait till API work....
