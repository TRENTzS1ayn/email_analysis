Norm,

Yes -- this can happen.    The serialization is not sacrosanct - in 
particular the ordering of nodes is something which may change if it 
becomes logical to reorder them.

we'll try to mention this in changes.html
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/changes.html

and in fact did sometimes.

Of course, it is a pain for the tests when this happens, too.

Tim
