Hi Henry,

The problem you reported on 7 May
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-cwm-bugs/2004May/0004.html

was a case of the test data lagging a fix in the code.
The test data was fixed in
--- daml-ex.n3  6 Mar 2004 20:39:43 -0000       1.11

the code was fixed a little earlier
sax2rdf.py revision 1.41 date: 2004/04/16 20:43:13
