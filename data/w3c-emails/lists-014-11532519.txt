The orignal description of N3
  http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3

had a semi-formal BNF grammar. As
of v1.97 2004/04/16 15:13:48, the grammar
was split out to
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/grammar/n3-report.html
with subsets
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/grammar/n3rdf-report.html
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/grammar/n3rules-report.html

meanwhile, a number of other grammars and gramar-generated
parsers have been developed (noted in Notation3).

My favorite is...
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/rdfn3-gram.html

We have had various discussions about finishing this
grammar work; for example,
  http://www.w3.org/2004/01/20-swad-whiteboard

This bug is intended to track/capture that goal.

In particular, what we'd like is a formal grammar
that's somehow machine-checked against all the N3 tests.
