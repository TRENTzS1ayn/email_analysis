1. My test involves using an Ontology of mine
located on my hard drive that is referenced 
in the xmlns -- I want read in N3 data that references
my Ontology. But CWM is croaking because it also
wants to read in other schemas, such as XMLSchema.

   Here are the N3 headers in my test file that
   accesses my ontology:
   
        @prefix rdfs:
<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
        @prefix owl:  <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
