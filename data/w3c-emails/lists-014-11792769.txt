Hi, I was really interested to get diff.py to work.

Perhaps I am doing something wrong. But since I ran the unit tests and 
they failed (see previous mail) I think it could well be some problem 
with the code.

I am running OSX
Attached are the two rdf files that I ran the command with. I generated 
these files from two n3 files using cwm
