That was indeed correct.

  I needed the name space to point to the owl file I used as a model. It 
still does not work, but that is because my graph is insufficiently 
labeled. I will need to read TBL's paper more carefully and see if I 
can improve the constraints on the OWL semantics, or if I just need to 
find a way create resource names for the graph elements.

PS. Sorry to have pressed the bug filing button too soon. That must 
have been because I did not get the tests to work previously...
