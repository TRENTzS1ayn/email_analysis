After labeling every point of the  graph, I still get a problem.

Attached are the three files needed to duplicate this experiment. There 
is very little difference between blog-1.n3 and blog-2.n3. A normal 
unix diff reveals only one line non commented difference.

I tested diff on the from.n3 and to.n3 ical examples and those worked 
well. I am at a bit of a loss. I would have to look at the python code, 
but, not being a python person, this might take me a lot longer than 
the time I may have.

hjs@bblfish:0$ ../diff.py -f blog-1.n3 -t blog-2.n3
