Andy, Dave,

I think this is a good point. Mind you, I don't really like having such 
a wealth of punctuation inside names.

I don't think the user of a language is helped a lot by having the 
choice between
maple_syrup-count and maple-syrup.count and so on.  I think it is 
liable to lead to more uncaught errors and more user confusion. It is 
just that XML does it. So we have to be compatible - but we don't have 
to encourage it. After all,  one can always use the <uri> form.

  N3 uses punctuation for semantics.  XML doesn't have to worry about it 
because it uses angle brackets around tag names.   The "."  is very 
common parlance for a path step, and allowing   ?x.mother.age  makes a 
lot of sense to OO types.  I could imagine restricting it to   
?x!mother!age  but its looks weirder to the uninitiated.

The - issue I don't feel so strongly about.  It may be OK to force - as 
an operator, if we put operators into N3, to be separated by 
whitespace.

maple-current = maple-started - maple-finished.
