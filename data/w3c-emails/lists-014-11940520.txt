Tim and everybody,

I updated
 http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/admin/Makefile
v 1.9 2004/04/24 10:35:39
to grab bug status from public-cwm-bugs as well as www-archive.

and then updated
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/admin/N3-Bugs
  v1.12
w.r.t. recent email traffic.

I eyeballed the .ics file, and it looks OK. I'd like to be able
to show the ical:summary's of the new and fixed bugs, but that
isn't obvious from the cvs diffs. Hmm... maybe a report using
--strings? or use diff.py?

Anyway... I think we're overdue for a monthly bug status update
to public-cwm-announce. The last one was March 6
