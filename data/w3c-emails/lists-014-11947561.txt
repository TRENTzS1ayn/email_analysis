Yes, that's what I'd expect, but the text in the grammar says:
"character* with escapes as defined in the N-Triples section 3.3 URI
References. This is then used as a relative URI and resolved against
the current base URI to give an absolute URI reference."

It doesn't say that that the characters are restricted to those valid
in a URI, just the escapes. I half wondered if you were explicitly
being lenient for future IRI support. Perhaps you could add a sentence
referring to the URI Reference definition in RDF Concepts.
