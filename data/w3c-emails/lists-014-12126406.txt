I have just made an update to the Turtle language at
  http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/2004/01/turtle/
to cover some points raised since the last change.
The full detailed changes are given in the document changelog
at http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/2004/01/turtle/#sec-changelog

Discussion of Turtle can be done on this list but preferably for
detailed items, on public-cwm-talk which is archived at
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-cwm-talk/


1. Turtle names (QNames) are now allowed to use '_' at the start
of local names but not namespace prefixes since that's used for
blank node names.

This change was made because, for example, rdf:_1 was forbidden
as a QName which is slightly embarrassing :)

Changed the EBNF to support the change above, adding nameStartChar
and nameChar terms named after the XML equivalent.  This is also
meant some Editorial changes to the QNames section at
  http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/2004/01/turtle/#sec-qnames
to match the change to the grammar terms.


2. Allow a predicateObjectList to have a trailing ';' which
makes it easier for generating Turtle and for humans.

For example, this is now allowed (... standing for other property /
value pairs)

----------------------------------------
_:a a :List ;
    :item [ :prop1 "value1" ... ] ;
    :item [ :prop1 "value2" ... ] ;
    :item [ :prop1 "value3" ... ] ;
----------------------------------------


3. Updated the test cases for Turtle

New tests.zip at
  http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/2004/01/turtle/tests.zip
with tests for the items above.  This is also available in
Raptor's CVS, see the end of the Examples section
  http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/2004/01/turtle/#sec-examples
for pointers.


Sales Pitch: These changes are implemented in Raptor CVS version
right now at
  http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/raptor/
and will be in the 1.3.1 release out soon.

Cheers

Dave
