[forwarding an older mail]

In the mean time I've implemented the builtins
str:matches and str:notMatches for both java and .net i.e.
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/eulersharp/2004/01swap/src/euler/Euler.java?rev=1.9&view=auto
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/eulersharp/2004/01swap/src/Eulersharp/Euler.cs?rev=1.9&view=auto

I know that this is not strictly *about* cwm, but we want to interoperate
with cwm and in that respect I wanted to ask if the str:matches is intended
to determine if a string exactly matches a given pattern or to determine
if a string contains a pattern (we did the former i.e. the "exactly
matches").

Another link is that we have python code in the works
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/eulersharp/2004/02swap/RDFEngine/?sortby=date
and Guido is actually working on a next (major) release and that's
running backward chaining code...

semWaving :)

i have test cases here where string:notEndsWith and
string:notContainsIgnoringCase seems to be needed...

what I could do is put them in a
http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2004/01swap/string#
but then have no chance to run those in cwm...
(that's the trouble with builtins and completeness...)

any hint ?

thanks :)
