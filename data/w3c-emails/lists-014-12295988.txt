Oeps, something went wrong, the text again:
Hallo,
Here is how I plan to implement lists in RDFEngine
(http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/eulersharp/2004/02swap/RDFEngine):
For a triple like:
1) :a rdf:List (:c :d :e).
I create an object resource that contains a (Python)
list: [:c, :d, :e]. 
This I have implemented. What I did not implement is  
then statements like:
a rdf:type rdf:List.
what, as a query, must give a positive response given 
the triple 1.
Also :a rdf:first ?x. should give as response:
:a rdf:first :c.
Also :a rdf:rest ?r. should give as a response:
:a rdf:rest (:d :e). ??? I'm not sure about that. 
To be frankly I think the way lists are defined at the
moment is a bit problematic.  
Personally I would also like to see something like:
:x :indexOf :a; :value "2".
what should return the second element of the list :a.
Guido.
