        DanC:  discussion starting 23:37
        DanC: I took toIcal.py, a cwm API client, and ported it to the
        rdflib API
        DanC: the result was roughtly 2x faster in 2 cases. (1 second
        versus 2)
        danbri_dna: Nearby: the resulting code
        DanC: cwm should change 'pred' to 'predicate'. and the() should
        raise ValueError, not call assert()
        DanC: rdflib should learn about each/any/the. cwm should change
        statementsMatching() to triples()
        DanC: and rdflib should support RDF.type as well as (in stead
        of?) RDF.["type"]
        eikeon: RDF.type already added to rdflib-2.0.2 to be release
        this evening
