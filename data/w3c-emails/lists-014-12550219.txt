(Bcc: public-esw-thes)

There is a work package in the SWAD Europe project on the develpoment of an
RDF Thesaurus, which is closely related to the development of a glossary
system for W3C.

There is a page about it on the SWAD-E
Wiki at http://esw.w3.org/topic/RdfThesaurus which currently contains a
pointer to the workpackage page itself:
http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/SWAD/thesaurus.html

And there is a mailing list - public-esw-thes@w3.org archived at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-esw-thes/ which has so far been
quiet.

The work is actually a little ahead of what was expected, although I don't
know how much has been published to date.

cheers

Chaals
