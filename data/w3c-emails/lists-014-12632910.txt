Hi Alistair, folks,

I think Steve's got a good point - using the exact figure 50% in the
definitions could mislead people into thinking it had more significance than
an expression of the mappers belief. I'd suggest a minor change to the
wording, from:

> > Instructions to mapper:
> > Use <soks:majorMatch> to link concepts A and B if they overlap
> in meaning,
> > and if you believe that more than 50% of the documents that are about
> > concept A will also be about concept B.

to something like

"...if you believe that the majority of the documents..."

Generally developments are looking great to me - that was quite a flurry of
activity!

The combination constructs are interesting. I've not had a chance to play
yet, but I'd be a little concerned that they seem to be extending the
semantics beyond RDF, and that there might be a clash/incompatibility with
OWL constructs. Any particular reason for not using OWL, btw?

Cheers,
Danny
