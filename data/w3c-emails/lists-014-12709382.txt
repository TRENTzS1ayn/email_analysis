I've had a go at doing a mapping between some topics from the topicexchange
system to categories from the open directory.  The mappings are online at
...

<http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/SWAD/rdf/te_dmoz_map.rdf>

What could such a mapping be used for?  Well, for example, lets say I'm
viewing the 'Matrix' channel on topicexchange.  There could be a link from
this page saying 'view relevant pages from dmoz'.  The page at the end of
this link could use the mapping to retrieve the pages from the dmoz
categories that are most relevant to the 'Matrix' topic in topicexchange.  

Considering this kind of scenario, it occurs to me that there could be a
strong argument for defining matches simply as a list, ordered by relevance.
I'm going to call this an 'ordered' mapping.  So I could represent the
'Matrix' mapping simply as ...

Topic Exchange-->Open Directory

The Matrix1.  Arts/Movies/Titles/M/Matrix_Series/
2.
Games/Roleplaying/Genres/Science_Fiction/Matrix,_The/
3.  Games/Video_Games/Action/E/Enter_the_Matrix/
4.
Games/Video_Games/Action/Massive_Multiplayer_Online/Matrix_Online,_The/
5.  Arts/Movies/Genres/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy/
6.  Arts/Literature/Genres/Cyberpunk/

.. rather than as ...

broad-match

... which was the best 'traditional-style' mapping I could come up with.

I think it would be worth having a further discussion on the 'ordered'
versus 'traditional' mappings.
