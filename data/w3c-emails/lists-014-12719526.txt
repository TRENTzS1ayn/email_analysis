Interesting stuff, Al.

This probably doesn't make much sense, but...

I see where you are going with 'ordered' mappings, but I wonder if your
solution isn't a little brittle.
I mean, having defined 6 ordered mappings, what happens when you need
another, numbered say 3.5?

A way round this would be to allow relationships between mappings.
So a mapping to Arts/Movies/Titles/M/Matrix_Series/ is 'better' than (more
relevant than? more specific than?) a mapping to
Arts/Movies/Genres/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy/

Cheers

Steve
