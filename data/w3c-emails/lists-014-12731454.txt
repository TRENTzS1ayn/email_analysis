The ordering does look like it could make life easier for app
implementations, but-

I don't think that would be a problem, simply insert the new mapping into
the ordered list -the numbering isn't too important.
But I think there are a couple of related issues - firstly the loss of the
absolute relevance level (narrow-match, broad-match) might mean you end up
with really weak matches being given the same significance as strong ones.
This may not be an issue in practice - nearest is probably what you'd want
while searching.

The other potential issue is how to handle the matching up the taxo trees:

relevance
1. Arts/Movies/Titles/M/Matrix_Series/
2. Arts/Movies/Titles/M
3. Arts/Movies/Genres/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy/
4. Arts/Movies/Genres
5. Arts/Movies/

> Arts/Movies/Genres/Science_Fiction_and_Fantasy/

Yep, that sounds like it could do the same job as the ordering in a
(probably) more versatile fashion.

Cheers,
Danny.
