Hi Alistair,

> <rdfs:isDefinedBy
> rdf:resource="http://www.bigal.com/alsfoodthesaurus"/>
> </soks:Concept>

I'd be inclined to have a URI label:
     <soks:hasURI rdf:resource=http://www.bigal.com/alsfoodthesaurus/bandm" />

The point being that the same concept might be defined in several ontologies 
with different URIs. Then the hasURI can be an InverseFunctionalProperty whereas 
prefLabel is only unique relative to a specific thesaurus.

The value of this over simply letting each thesaurus define its own URI and 
adding separate owl:sameAs statements is possibly not that great.

Cheers,
Dave
