Hi,

I can't access the Wiki at the moment, and in any case don't know how you want 
comments, so I'll stick to email.

By KOS do you mean "Knowledge Organization Scheme"?
What does that cover? Are you including ontologies in there?

If the answer to the last question is "yes" then I suggest avoiding 3. A common 
core for all different thesaurus and ontology schemes is in danger of being so 
generic as to be little more than raw RDF(S).
