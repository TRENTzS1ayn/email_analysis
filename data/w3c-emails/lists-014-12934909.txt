Yup, sorry the Wiki is down again. We had some load problems 
(bad code in MoinMoin python; it loaded a huge log file on 
each pageview) which are now fixed. However the machine crashed 
for as yet undetermined reasons recently. Possibly because it 
has a miniscule amount of RAM (will have 1G soon). I had expected 
it to be back up by now, should be ok later today I'd guess.
Am investigating.

Sorry for the inconvenience...

Dan
