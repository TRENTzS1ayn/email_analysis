Hi guys, 

The previous title of 8.1 was

'RDF Schema for ISO Standard Thesauri'

The big problem I've had with trying to write this up is that the schema in
that document tries to deal with multilingual as well as monolingual
thesauri.  So it preempts the discussion of multilingual thesauri which is
supposed to come in 8.3.  It also preempts a discussion of interthesaurus
mapping, which is supposed to be in 8.4.

I propose to change the title of 8.1 to 

'Core RDF Vocabularies for Monolingual Thesauri'

and present a core solution to the monolingual thesaurus problem.  Save a
discussion and analysis of the multilingual problem for 8.3.

To give you an idea of where I'm going with this, take a look at 

http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/SWAD/deliverables/8.1_0_3.html

Also please note the section on 'Using Thesaurus Concepts for Subject
Indexing and Classification'.  What I've tried to do is design a schema for
thesauri that fits seamlessly with what dublin core and LOM are doing re
subject classification.

Brian I know you're keen to move this along, but I think it's really worth
making sure what we've got fits with things like RDFS, dublin core and LOM
before going public.  If you like this direction, I can have this ready for
submission by next week.

Yours,

Alistair.
