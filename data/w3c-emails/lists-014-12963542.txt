It makes sense to me to build on top of rdfs:label so that general RDFS 
processors can pick up the labels.

Thus:
     rdf:label  (domain = Resource, range = Literal)
       ^
       |
     soks:label (domain = soks:Concept)
       ^
       |
     soks:preferredLabel

Keeping the range as Literal is useful since that's the only bit of RDF that 
supports xml:lang.
