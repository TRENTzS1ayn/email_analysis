Hi Alistair

(just got back from holiday - wiki looks good btw)

Dave asked:

> By KOS do you mean "Knowledge Organization Scheme"?
> What does that cover? Are you including ontologies in there?

I'm still fuzzy on what we mean by ontologies. My understanding of 
ontologies for the semantic web is that one of their key utilities will be 
to provide a kind of umbrella 'knowledge representation' layer into which 
well developed, existent thesauri/other KOS's may be federated at key 
points. That is as well as ontologies being developed independently for 
classifying resources as per the requirements of specific user communities 
I guess. So that ontologies are very good for describing 'things' and 
relationships between things - which is great for describing resources on 
the network, & the relationship of those resources to each other and also 
real-world "things". So, ontologies are to provide us with rigorous and 
consistently applied resource description for the web, in contrast to the 
ways that thesauri/other KOS's often use inconstent/differing notions of 
subsumption, for example, in representing knowledge?

I'm waffling here & would like to invite someone to clarify things for me! 
Back to Alistair's issues:

As regards the options 1 2 & 3 you have stated for Design Issue 1:

- I think option 1 is out because it is pretty restricted in scope, given 
that there are many legacy & evolving KOS' that will be usefully employed 
in the semantic web.

- I understand your dilemma between option 2 & 3 to be whether to keep WP8 
thesauri-centric, or whether to start at a more generic place and work on 
from there, extending the core vocabulary specifically for thesauri & also 
the range of other existent KOS's (also permitting the ease of integration 
with ontologies).
I see Andy's argument about the dangers of straining to be as generic as 
possible.
I kind of feel I need an analysis of what problems Option 2 would create 
w.r.t. trying to map thesauri to other KOS's & ontologies using a WP8 core 
vocabulary. i.e. what do taxonomies, classification schemes, topic maps 
etc. use in their representation that we would be lacking if we stick to a 
core vocabulary centred on thesauri only?

I'll need to do some more reading around this issue ...

Regards
Nikki
(soks is cool with me btw)
