Hi Alistair

My philosophical angle on this is:

Human society distinguishes itself from (the rest of) animal society by its 
reification of abstract concepts, done primarily via language. So the 
concepts don't come from the language, they exist independently - languages 
evolve in the attempt to articulate human understanding of abstract 
concepts. Different languages have evolved over time of course, and have 
much in common, but also some languages have sought to reify concepts that 
other languages don't, and so on...

Coming back to the question of a pragmatic solution to modelling 
multilingual data: I tend towards Option 2, but then I've not experimented 
with much 'real' data, so you might want to give me some illustrative 
counter examples.
Is it not the case that the *concepts* being reified by one language can be 
mapped - partially or otherwise - to concepts being reified in another 
language? And if there are "missing" concepts for some languages then 
that's ok? i.e. is it possible to always map thesauri at the conceptual 
level as opposed to at the 'label' level? I know this means deriving 
concept hierarchies from thesauri from thesauri that don't have this 
explicit - but I thought that was what we were aiming for anyway?

I guess we should continue the discussion on the wiki ...
