Hi Dave,

Yes I was using 'KOS' for everything, including ontologies, thesauri,
classification schemes, taxonomies, glossaries, dictionaries, topic maps,
semantic nets, concepts maps etc...

You make a very good point I think.   

The design goal I had in mind when I suggested modular vocabs is this: I
wanted to avoid the worst case scenario, which is that we have one RDF vocab
for ontologies, one for thesauri, one for classification schemes and so on
for each type of KOS, and there is no overlap or reuse of components between
the vocabs.  This is in fact close to what we have right now (e.g. OWL for
ontologies, TIF for thesauri, LOM-CLS for classification schemes).  

If the core vocab for all KOS is nothing more than RDF(S) then great.  We
have OWL already.  So the gap that remains to be filled is for all KOS that
are not ontologies.  So I imagine soks-core to be aimed at the common
features of all KOS that are not ontologies, re-using RDF RDFS and OWL as
much as possible.  Then build an extension for all thesauri and things that
are like thesauri.  

To summarise my design goals: maximise re-use, maximise interoperability,
minimise complexity.  

To give an idea of how I imagine these modular vocabs fitting together, have
a look at

http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/SWAD/deliverables/8.1_0_3.html 

Yours,

Al.

Hi,

I can't access the Wiki at the moment, and in any case don't know how you
want 
comments, so I'll stick to email.

By KOS do you mean "Knowledge Organization Scheme"?
What does that cover? Are you including ontologies in there?

If the answer to the last question is "yes" then I suggest avoiding 3. A
common 
core for all different thesaurus and ontology schemes is in danger of being
so 
generic as to be little more than raw RDF(S).
