Hi Alistair,

A very generic base vocabularly such as the one you suggest sounds fine. I 
just wouldn't describe it as a common core for KOS languages.

Just look at how much intellecual effort was required just to unify RDFS 
and DAML enough to get the compromise that is OWL - for example, with 
OWL/DL and OWL/Lite not being supersets of RDFS. If the foundation starts 
to express anything richer than labels then the semantics constrains what 
you can cleanly build on top. I'm not sure you can have all of simplicity, 
generality and power. You are opting for the first two, which seems reasonable.

What you have is fine as a core for "things that are like thesauri", which, 
as I understand it, is the aim of the work package. But, for example, I'm 
not sure how well it corresponds to topic maps which, I think, have a 
different way of separating concept from indicator. For the very rich 
representations like conceptual maps then this core covers so little as to 
not really make much difference either way.

Cheers,
Dave
