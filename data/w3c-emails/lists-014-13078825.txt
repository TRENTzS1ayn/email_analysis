Only if you represent content-in-a-specific-language as a class, which 
would mean having a different class and different cardinality constraint 
for every language. Which probably wouldn't be workable.

But in any case you need to add the qualifier "in any given conceptual 
scheme". That definitely makes expressing the cardinality constraint in OWL 
unworkable.
