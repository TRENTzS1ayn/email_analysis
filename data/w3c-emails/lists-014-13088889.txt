Yup.

By the way the Gene Ontology is quite an interesting example in this 
respect. It has been migrating from a thesaurus like structure to a more 
ontology like structure. At the moment it has two link types, isa links 
which have strict subsumption semantics (as in RDFS et al) and part-of 
links which have less strict semantics. In the future they are 
contemplating spliting part-of into different flavours which could be given 
a stricter semantics.

In a meeting I was at recently it was suggested that the GO is easier to 
navigate than some of the deeper ontology-based domain models in similar 
domains because of this thesaurus-like heritage. The speculation was that a 
complex ontology is likely to benefit from a thesaurus-like navigation overlay.
