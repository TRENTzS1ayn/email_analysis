Hey Steve,

Yeah I got really excited when I read the spec about rdf:Alt containers,
because this seemed a way to keep the cardinality of the soks:descriptor
property to one and still have language alternatives.  The RDF specs and the
DC in RDF specs have examples doing things this way.  

So e.g.

<soks:Concept>
<soks:descriptor>
<rdf:Alt>
<rdf:li xml:lang="en">Bangers and mash
(cuisine)</rdf:li>
<rdf:li xml:lang="fr">Saucisson et pomme de terre
Anglais</rdf:li>
</rdf:Alt>
</soks:descriptor>
</soks:Concept>

However Danbri sent me a mail back saying that rdf:Alt is no good because
there is no consistent notion of 'alternative' behind it.  Danbri, is this
really no go?

Al.

cardinality for multilingual thesauri



First mail to list - hi all! so sorry if I've missed vital context.

1. sound like a workable fallback 
2. works but adds inference load 
3. Urgh! This is similar to the classic subclassing error of OO modelling
(imo) - except it's subproperty of course.

What about saying (apologies for any N3 errors)
<concept> 
   :hasDescriptor [:inLanguage <French>; :value "chaud"];   
   :hasDescriptor [:inLanguage <English>; :value "hot"] .

Or, if you want to keep cardinality constraints, add a level of indirection
<concept> 
   :hasDescriptor [:alternative [:inLanguage <French>; :value "chaud"];
:alternative [:inLanguage <English>; :value "hot"]] .

Steve
