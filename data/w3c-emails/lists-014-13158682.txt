Yup, generally rdf:Alt is pretty bad. There is also currently language
in the spec that says something like "the first value is the default". 
Which may be I18N-unwise, if we hold the English and French text in the 
example below to be equally good characterisations of the concept.

My understanding of 1st is that it means the rdf:_1 property, so a
workaround would be to use 

 <rdf:_2 xml:lang="en">Bangers and mash(cuisine)</rdf:li>
 <rdf:_3 xml:lang="fr">Saucisson et pomme de terre Anglais</rdf:li>

(since only rdf:_1 is considered the default)

...instead. In fact I just proposed this (tasteless hack!) as a
workaround in the RDFCore telecon today.

You could, if you like the basic data structure, do something 
with the same shaped graph as your proposal, just not use rdf:Alt.
eg. invent a class to replace Alt, and named properties (or rdf:value
perhaps) for the pointers from its instance to the bits of lang-tagged
text.

Backing up a bit, is there a lot of value in having a cardinality 
constraint on soks:descriptor? 

<soks:Concept>
 <soks:descriptor xml:lang="en">Bangers and mash (cuisine)</soks:descriptor>
 <soks:descriptor xml:lang="fr">Saucisson et pomme de terre Anglais</soks:descriptor>
</soks:Concept>

...looks good to me. Is it significantly more annoying for some classes
of user, implementation etc?
