I've added a new open design issue to the RDF Thesaurus Wiki page 

http://esw.w3.org/topic/RdfThesaurus

A summary of the issue:

Issue 5 - Using Concepts for subject-based indexing and classification

We want to be able to say, 'my article is about Concept x from Thesaurus y'.
These statements could then be used for subject-based indexing. 

The question is, what property to we recommend to use to do this sort of
thing? Do we invent a new one, or do we try to re-use something? 

2.5.1 Comments on Issue 5


AJM>> We could go with qualified dublin core, and recommend using
dc:subject. 

.....

So in summary, I have suggested an approach to subject-based indexing using
thesaurus concepts that is entirely consistent with all variations in the
qualified dublin core approach. The question is, do we like dcq?
