I think v good to try representing something like DMoz, which is grassroots and messy 
as an organisational system, yet substantive and useful w/ tons of data.

I would love to try writing rules to make explicit some of the structure 
implicit in DMoz's hierarchy, ie. express as RDF properties the 
things that underpin something's place in the tree.

Eg. a section homepages-of-popstars, hypothetically, might have 1000
pages listed. For each of those, it is implied (we might argue) that 
there exists a popstar, and the popstar has a foaf:homepage relation to 
that page. Same for restaurant reviews etc. Geographic facets would be a 
good thing to mine. This would show a path to get from the
document-centric world of DMoz into the more world-centric world of RDF 
and ontologies...
