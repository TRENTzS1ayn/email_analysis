Issue 7 - Thesaurus Linking vs. Thesaurus Mapping


There are two distinct situations. 

Thesaurus Linking: An indexer wants a thesaurus for subject-based indexing
of their collection. They find no one thesaurus offers adequate coverage,
but a combination of two or more thesauri does. So they want to create and
use a hybrid thesaurus. 

Thesaurus Mapping A collection has been indexed with concepts from thesaurus
A. A user wants to search this collection, but using concepts from thesaurus
B. Thus some mechanism is required for either transforming the query or
transforming the index. 

The purpose of this issue is to distinguish these two scenarios. If we use
the same mechanism for both linking and mapping, there is a lot of scope for
confusion.
