The Problem: A user wants to create a hybrid thesaurus by plugging bits of
existing thesauri together. By what mechanism should they do this? 

Solution 1: To express thesaurus linke by using the normal semantic
relations of a thesaurus, 'broader/narrower' and 'related'. So if a user
wants to prune a branch from a thesaurus, they remove the 'broader/narrower'
statements. If they want to add a branch, they add 'broader/narrower'
statements. This solution treats thesaurus linking as a special case of
altering the organisational structure of a set of thesaurus concepts. 

Solution 2: Create custom linking properties that are not 'semantic
relations'. In this way the integrity and internal structure of each
thesaurus is maintained.
