I'd like to close on the question of including shared-key
authentication in TLS. There has been little discussion
of the latest proposal from Barbara Fox, but I think we
went over the arguments pretty thoroughly a few weeks
ago.

At this point, I propose that we adopt the proposed
modifications for the TLS draft. As always, I am happy
to hear comments either on the list or in direct mail.

In addition, if there are other burning issues for substantive
changes, please let me know about them now.
