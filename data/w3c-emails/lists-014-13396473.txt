I think the list is a good permanent record of thoughts, issues,
changes. While the wiki does keep a version history, it isn't quite the
same. A brief mail message can capture a snapshot of someone's thinking
at a given point, which hopefully will also be reflected (eventually) in
the wiki view.

We should btw be very clear that we are making this up as we are going
along! One of the reasons I was originally excited to do this whole
SWAD-E project was as a way of finding out the pros and cons of various
ways of collaborating on SW vocab development. Whether IRC, wiki, email,
Web can be somehow hoooked together to support lightweight collaboration
on RDF vocabs, and to use this experience to figure out how/whether/etc
other W3C-related efforts might attempt similar things.

Long way of saying: I don't know what will work, let's find out ;)

I would support trying the experiment of subscribing this list to one or
more of the thesaurus wiki pages. If it gets annoying we can always back
off... Interesting idea, let's see how it works out. Alistair, others,
would that be OK by you?
