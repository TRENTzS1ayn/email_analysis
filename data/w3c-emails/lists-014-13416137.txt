terms, i.e. the concepts. 

However, there are some relationships which could be considered to exist
purely between the terms. For example, "stimuli" is the plural-form-of
"stimulus". "RDF" is an acronym-for "Resource Description Framework". 

By what mechanism to we allow these kinds of statements to be expressed as
part of an RDF thesaurus? 

Suggested solution 1: We use b-nodes to represent terms, with the property

connecting these two b-nodes, e.g. 

...

Suggested solution 2:: We don't bother with them. Instead we offer the
recommendation that all acronyms be included as possible labels for a
concept. Plural forms probably don't need be included as modern stemming
algorithms can identify the root of the term. So e.g. ...
