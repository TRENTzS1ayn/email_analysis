This seems amenable to subProperty relationships.

You could have a base property "thesaurusRelationship", subProperties for 
broader/narrower, subProperties of those for specific usages like strict 
isa, partof etc. In that way some could use a strict partOf relation and a 
thesaurus tool that only understood BT would be able to treat it as a 
broaderTerm.
