Hi Dave,

I agree, I think having a property set like ...

<soks:semanticRelation>
 ^
 |
<thes:broader>
 ^                        ^                           ^
 |                        |                           |
<thes:broaderGeneric>    <thes:broaderInstantive>    <thes:broaderPartOf>

... would be good for thesaurus-specific applications.  However, here is
where we start treading on the toes of RDF RDFS and OWL.  The property
<thes:broaderGeneric> would be semantically equivalent to <rdfs:subClassOf>,
and the property <thes:broaderInstantive> would be semantically equivalent
to <rdf:type>.  How do we handle this kind of overlap? 

Al.
