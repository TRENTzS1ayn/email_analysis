I'm not sure there is a problem here. If BG and BI are truly equivalent to 
rdfs:subClassOf and rdf:type then just define them as equivalent using 
either owl:equivalentProperty or a pair of rdfs:subPropertyOf relations. 
That's the beauty of RDF - open world, multiple inheritance, cycles allowed.

Then a thesaurus processor could take an RDFS file and realise, for 
example, that an rdfs:subClassOf relation implies thes:broader.
