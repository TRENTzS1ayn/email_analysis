OK, so shall we have


<soks:semanticRelation>
^
|
<soks:broader>
^                        ^                           ^
|                        |                           |
<soks:broaderGeneric>    <soks:broaderInstantive>    <soks:broaderPartOf>

and

<soks:broaderGeneric>   <owl:equivalentProperty>   <rdfs:subClassOf>.

<soks:broaderInstantive>   <owl:equivalentProperty>   <rdf:type>.

Any objections???
