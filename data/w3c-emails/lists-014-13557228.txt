The idea is that the skos-mapping constructs are a more convenient and
intuitive shorthand for more formal set based constructs that could be
expressed in OWL. 

So for example, you may consider that statements such as ...

<soks:Concept rdf:about="#A">
<soks-map:broaderMatch>
<soks-map:AND>
<rdf:li rdf:resource="#B"/>
<rdf:li rdf:resource="#C"/>
</soks-map:AND>
</soks-map:broaderMatch>
</soks:Concept>

... are in fact a convenient shorthand for the statements ...

<owl:Restriction> 
   <owl:onProperty rdf:resource="&dc;subject"/> 
   <owl:hasValue rdf:resource="#A"/> 
   <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:parseType="resource"> 
      <owl:intersectionOf rdf:parseType="collection"> 
         <owl:Restriction> 
            <owl:onProperty rdf:resource="&dc;subject"/> 
            <owl:hasValue rdf:resource="#B"/> 
         </owl:Restriction> 
         <owl:Restriction> 
            <owl:onProperty rdf:resource="&dc;subject"/> 
            <owl:hasValue rdf:resource="#C"/> 
         </owl:Restriction> 
      </owl:intersectionOf> 
   </rdfs:subClassOf> 
</owl:Restriction> 

For further discussion of this problem, see the extended writeup of open
design issues on the SWAD RDF Thesaurus wiki (Issue 9 - Inter-thesaurus
mapping) <http://esw.w3.org/topic/RdfThesaurus>.

What do you think of this?

Yours,

Alistair.
