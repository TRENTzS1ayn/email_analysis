One of the major design requirements of the SKOS vocabs is that they are
extensible.  So I would be quite happy for you to extend the
<soks:externalID> property and create two subproperties <class:notation> and
<class:permID> for example.  Would this fulfill your requirements?

The application of SKOS to classification schemes and faceted structures is
something I would very much like to explore.  Could you send me some links
to some classification schemes you think might be a good testbed for SKOS?
I'd be very grateful.

If you'd like to stay involved with the development of SKOS you're very
welcome.  There is the public list <public-esw-thes@w3.org> and the RDF
Thesaurus wiki <http://esw.w3.org/topic/RdfThesaurus> which you are most
welcome to contribute to.

Yours,

Alistair.
