I do not have a problem with splitting the document to a record layer
protocol and a key management / authentication handshake document
describing the negotiation and other key mgmt issues. There are things
we need to discuss before all multiple authentication methods are
standardized.


On the subject of password authentication I would like to make the
following two remarks. 

First, it is my understanding that the IETF usually puts things in
standards track based on rough consensous and running code (usually at
more than one location). I would like to see this implemented in TLS as
well before we put things on the standards track.

The other issue is that the community has not had a chance to evaluate
the security issues involved with having multiple authentication methods
in a single protocol. I believe that we all need to look at any security
hazard invloved with doing password-based auth using the same shared
secret that generates the encryption keys and MAC secrets. For example,
we should assume that some password is compromised and the effects that
may have on other portions in the sessions that use the same master
secret. I do not believe anyone feels comfortable with that now.


Splitting the TLS protocol document may be a good way to start putting
TLS in the standards track, assuming the record layer is easier to agree
on (from historical experiences).
