Hi Alistair,

Yes. Sorry, I hadn't read your example properly.

OK.

As it happens, in RDF a class is not itself a set instances either, it 
is something which has an extension which is in turn a set of instances. 
It's this level of indirection which allows you to have things which are 
both classes and instances without stepping outside the bounds of normal 
set theory. This is quite close to what you are trying to capture here.

There are certainly KOS applications in which this is a perfectly valid 
modelling approach - where the concepts can be reasonably treated as 
classes, where the resources being organized are instances of the 
concept and in those cases this is a good way of expressing the mapping 
which does allow you to transform queries.

However, I do agree with you that thesauri don't typically work that way 
and using rdf:type to represent the relationship between the concept and 
the resources associated with that concept is not always going to be 
appropriate. So I do agree with your approach.

It is a shame to end up with something which is so decoupled from 
RDFS/OWL though. There do seem to be applications where people start out 
with an informal thesaurus like model of the world and then over time 
move to a more ontology-like model (the GeneOntology is, perhaps, an 
example of this). It would be appealing to have a KOS representation 
that facilitated that by exploiting the quite forgiving nature of the 
RDFS semantics but I guess there is too much of a disconnect with 
thesauri to make that work.

[And I still recommend changing rdf:li but that's a minor point.]

Cheers,
Dave
