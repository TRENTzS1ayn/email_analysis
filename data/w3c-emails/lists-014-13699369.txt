Summary---------------------------------------------------------------------

Topics: 1. Modular RDF vocabularies for thesaurus-like data.
2. Use cases and requirements for thesaurus services.

1. Modular RDF vocabularies for thesaurus-like data.

The work on RDF vocabs for thesaurus and similar data is progressing well.
A proposal for modularising parts of the vocabs was discussed, in relation
to a discussion document previously posted to the list by Alistair
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-esw-thes/2003Sep/0002.html>.
Understanding how to fit the thesaurus RDF vocabs we are developing into
existing vocabs such as OWL was highlighted as a key issue and area for
further work.  This issue to be studied further as part of deliverables 8.3,
8.4, 8.5 and 8.6.  

2. Use cases and requirements for thesaurus services.

We agreed to begin work on development of a thesaurus web service with a
thorough study of scenarios and use cases.  The question of whether to begin
and maintain a public list of use cases was raised, to be agreed upon
shortly.
