I fail to see how you can conclude that there's a rough consensus on
this proposal.

First of all, I feel there are a number of weaknesses in any password
scheme.  In addition, this proposal has not received nearly as much
public review as SSL has.  For these reasons, I'm nervous about its
security.  It also has yet to be proven that this scheme provides any
more security than implementing passwords at a higher level.  Given this
combination of a lack of clear need and possible weakness, I feel that
this proposal doesn't belong in TLS.
