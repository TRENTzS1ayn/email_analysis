Cheers Dan.

Can we cope with the situation where a B-Node may be uniquely identified not
by a single property, but by a combination of two (or more) properties?

e.g. Concepts uniquely identified by a combination of soks:prefLabel and
rdfs:isDefinedBy properties.

Al.

By being careful to distinguish the blank nodes (a data structure) from 
the things they denote. This is one reason why stopped calling them
"anonymous resources" btw. The way to figure out if two b-nodes denote 
the same resource is to do some of the reasoning licensed by the OWL
spec. In the simplest case, if you have the same property/value pair 
ascribed and the property is an owl:InverseFunctionalProperty, then the 
two nodes should denote same thing. OWL is big and complicated and there 
are doubtless many other aspects to identity reasoning via OWL that
might be relevant, but this is probably the most common case.

See http://rdfweb.org/mt/foaflog/archives/000039.html for lengthier 
explanation with a bias to how we've done this stuff in FOAF.
