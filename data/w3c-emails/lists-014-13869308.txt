Just a couple of suggestions:

It's likely you would want to get a list of preferred terms in some 
thesaurus matching some submitted term, i.e. economics might match 
'economics' and 'financial economics', perhaps also allowing for 
truncation or stemming. More for a user interfaced I guess.

Another request might be for the top-term/concept of the hierarchies a 
concept is found in.
