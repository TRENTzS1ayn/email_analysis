Is the latest proposal still vulnerable to this type of an attack:

- Given a server with TLS/passauth and no attack detection
- Attacker uses dictionary attack against an account, 
  re-trying the Handshake with a dictionary of 65000 
  commonly used passphrases

If the user's passphrase exists in the dictionary, then the effective
security seems to be "16 bits" rather than "128 bits".
