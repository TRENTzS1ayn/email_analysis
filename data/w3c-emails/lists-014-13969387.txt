Hi Al,

I like the approach that is outlined by the OASIS Published Subjects TC
[1]. Although this document is a draft and omits some pieces that I
would like to see, I feel that the general approach is a good one. To
summarise, an HTTP identifier, when used to identify a concept *should*
resolve to a human-readable resource that describes the concept. Despite
coming from the topic maps community, I feel that this approach is
applicable to the creation of any identifier scheme that uses HTTP for
namespacing.

The things that I would like to see the TC consider is recommendations
for either embedding, linking to (e.g. using RDDL) or providing as
parallel resource (via content negotiation), other machine-readable
descriptions of the concept and related resource - so an RDF resource
would be one example, the same information translated into XTM might be
another and so on.

It would be good to get the Published Subjects work kick started again
(the committee went quiet a long time ago) - perhaps we could work on
putting together a technical report to pass either to the OASIS TC or
just to publish as part of the SWAD work ?

Cheers,

Kal
