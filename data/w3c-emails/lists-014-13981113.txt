Hi Kal,

Thanks alot for this.  

I just had a read of the OASIS PS report [1].  Some initial impressions...

I can see how the PSI/PSID approach would work well within a framework such
as XTM that allows you to say whether you are using the URI to refer to the
thing itself or the thing that describes the thing (sorry I just had to put
it like that, I thought it sounded so funny).  

But RDF goes wrong if you use the same URI to refer to two different things.
So I'm not sure adopting the PSI/PSID convention for SKOS concept schemes
would be a good idea.  

[As an aside, there's no reason why one couldn't define an
InverseFunctionalProperty called e.g. subjectIndicator.  Then the value of
this property could be used to uniquely reference the concept itself, i.e.
one could refer to 'the thing with subjectIndicator X', which achieves the
basic aims of the PSI/PSID approach I think.]  

Incidentally [RDF folks?], I always thought that was what the
rdfs:isDefinedBy property was for - to link some resource to a resolveable
resource that defines it.  

Anyways, Kal, I would like to develop this further with you.  Some clearly
defined best practices here would do the world of good I think.  Look
forward to more thoughts on this.

Yours,

Al.
