I think that this practice would certainly work much better with
PSI/PSID constructs than the fragmentary approach - one resource per
concept is probably a best practice that the Published Subjects TC
should recommend.

It is certainly true that content negotiation gives you the problem of
talking about the descriptive resource as opposed to the described
thing. That is a strong argument against content negotiation for RDF /
XTM resources. However, there are still two other options:

1) Embed the RDF / TM markup in its XML form. Then use an rdf:ID
attribute or XTM id attribute so that the reference to the RDF/XTM would
be <http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog#foo>

2) Use a profile of XLink to link to the RDF / TM resource that
describes the concept, and make it completely separate. e.g.
<http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog/dog.rdf>

I don't think that a position can ever be established which everyone 
will agree with :-)

I tend to agree. I tend to consider the use of URIs for subject
identification as being divided into three categories:
1) The URI resolves to the subject being described
2) The URI resolves to a description of the subject being described
3) The URI is used as a pure, unresolvable identifier

I think (2) gives the greatest possibility for interchange of semantics
if the resource addressed by the URI is human-readable - at some point
the processing of semantics has to be transferred from SW machinery to
wet-ware.
