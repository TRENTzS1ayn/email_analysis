This discussion is coming up from time to time. Its also called
"Identity crisis" or "Uri crisis"

Some interesting articles are:
-rfc2396 (uri)
- http://www.w3.org/2002/11/dbooth-names/dbooth-names_clean.htm 
- http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/09/11/deviant.html
- http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/HTTP-URI 

My opinion is to use Http URIs because:
- they are unique
- you can optionally put some content at the place the uri identifies
(be it RDF or HTML)

another guy behind this approach is Patrick Stickler and his URIQA.

A good concept to think about when using Uris to identify more than one
thing is to "Seperate by Ontology"

You can use a single resource uri and annotate it with different
triples, when you want to describe the "Web resource" aspect of the uri,
use a web ontology, when you want to describethe "dog-concept" aspect,
use the dog/concept ontology. They won't mix up, namespaces do the
seperation. And a single resource can have more than one type. voila.

Ad1: Don't use HASH identifiers if you can avoid them!

I don't think that a position can ever be established which everyone 
will agree with :-)

I tend to agree. I tend to consider the use of URIs for subject
identification as being divided into three categories:
1) The URI resolves to the subject being described
2) The URI resolves to a description of the subject being described
3) The URI is used as a pure, unresolvable identifier

I think (2) gives the greatest possibility for interchange of semantics
if the resource addressed by the URI is human-readable - at some point
the processing of semantics has to be transferred from SW machinery to
wet-ware.
