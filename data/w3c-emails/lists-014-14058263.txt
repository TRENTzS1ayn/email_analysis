That's the REST point of view and it's reiterated in the recent TAG
publication.

Yes; there's no generally applicable vocab currently (as far as I'm
aware) in RDF to describe the relationship between a URI (as a web
address rather than a resource identifier, so probably in the format of
a datatyped literal) and stuff you get when dereferencing that URI,
including specific content-negotiated HTTP conversations. But there's no
reason why there shouldn't be, and it'd let you explicitly avoid
confusions like "Ora Lassila's size in bytes".

Including, I'm led to believe, some members of TAG.
