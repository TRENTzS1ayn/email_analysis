Kal, Alistair

Just a quick note from a member and former chair of OASIS PubSubj TC

This is not a draft, it's a TC recommendation. Should be the first one of a series,
unfortunately there has not been consensus yet in the TC for what next recommendations
should contain.

That was the primary idea of Published Subjects. Now I'm not sure it was not flawed from
the beginning, because identification always need "identifying properties" +
"identification context". Topic maps provide clear identification context allowing to make
unambiguous interpretation of HTTP URIs for subject identification. I'm not sure to which
contexts such an interpretation can be extended without ambiguity. Using HTTP namespace is
not a sufficient pre-condition, as endless debates on interpretation of URIs in RDF
clearly shows. I agree with folks saying that the same URI can be interpreted in various
ways to identify different things in different identification contexts. So, to the
question to know if HTTP URIS can be used without ambiguity as identifiers in SKOS, I
would answer that a pre-condition is to define what the identification context in a SKOS
application is or should be.

Before going in such technical details, the quoted above pre-condition has to be
specified.

As you are maybe not aware of, there are at least two reasons for quietness of PubSubj TC.
One is the lack of task force, the other is the lack of consensus on further deliverables.
And the latter is linked to the issue discussed here, among others.
