Something I have done is use http://example.org/terms? as a namespace, so the
URI resolves to a query (which says to cache it by good practice, since it
doesn't change anything to run the query) and since that means you can do
something different for the "bare URI". Of course there is no reason not to
configure foo#bar to return just the relevant RDF if that's the content-type
requested, but people don't.

another option is to have a URI per term, and to add #term (or something
similar) in each case.

Yes, it seems like a good idea. The RDF specs even define that a URI with a
fragment identifier in it refers to the RDF version in case of a
content-negotiated resource, so presumably they expect that practice.

that's why I like using .../Dog#term

The solution to this problem is defined in the RDF specs, no? If you use
Dog#term then you are constrained to interpret it as whatever the RDF version
of the resource tells you.

me too!

(I love ending emails like that :-)
