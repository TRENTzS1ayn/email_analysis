Sure, from an RDF perspective, <http://example.org/term?204> is just as
good as <http://example.org/term/204>. I prefer the latter, because it
feels simpler and more flexible to me.

In practice, any decent web server would allow you to internally rewrite
"/term/204" to "/cgi/term?204".

The problem with using <http://example.org/foo#bar> is that an HTTP
query will have the form "GET /foo", not "GET /foo#bar". For a small
dataset being served from a flat file, this is probably the best way to
go, but if there's any server-side scripting involved, it seems better
to go with non-fragmented URIs.

I'd rather do <http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog> for the concept and
<http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog.rdf> for the RDF/XML document.

To be *really* unambiguous, you also have to consider the possibility of
changes over time. I've always felt that the best way to refer to an
representation retrieved via HTTP would be something like:

  [ a Representation
  ; source <http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog>
  ; date "2004-04-23T01:28:00Z"
  ]

You can also add properties like format, e-tag, last-modified, and the
content (in base64 if necessary).

Alternately, if I'm correct in thinking that HTTP lets you use
Content-ID, you could identify specific representations using cid: URIs.
