Tom:

I agree that this comes down to interpretation, but I did actually count
before I sent that  mail.  On the FOR list, I also included D P Kemp,
Phillip M. Hallam-Baker, Dave Wagner, Tom Stephens and Baber Amin.

Whatever:  the idea is "rough" consensus. You don't think we have it and
I do.  In any case, I like Taher's suggestion about modularizing the
document, submitting RFC's and getting running code.  What we want is a
standard that everybody wants to implement without lots of roll-your-own
extensions.
