Hmm ... trying to sort out terminology ... it's not that difficult, in fact :))

Let's say you have somewhere a formal representation of a Class "City" and an instance of
it "Bristol".

This can be expressed either in OWL-RDF ...

<owl:Class rdf:ID="City"/>
<City rdf:ID="Bristol"/>

.. or in Topic Maps XTM

<topic id="City>
<topic id="Bristol">
<instanceOf>
<topicRef xlink:href="#City">
</instanceOf>
</topic>

Now you want to say that the dmoz resource
http://dmoz.org/Regional/Europe/United_Kingdom/England/Bristol/
somehow "indicates" what the above abstract entity formally "represents"
In XTM, this would be expressed by:

<topic id="Bristol">
<instanceOf>
<topicRef xlink:href="#City">
</instanceOf>
<subjectIdentity>
            <subjectIndicatorRef
xlink:href="http://dmoz.org/Regional/Europe/United_Kingdom/England/Bristol/"/>
      </subjectIdentity>
</topic>

How you would do it in OWL is not standard ...

Yes, that's exactly what the above XTM example expresses.

Agreed. In fact there are too many different ways to express clearly any number of levels
of indirection in RDF, but unfortunately no standard one. Hence the endless debates about
URIs "meaning".

Yes. That does not mean everyone using Topic Maps understand them - let alone those who
won't even try to :))

Bottom line : what about "skos:subjectIndicator" to express what you suggest? For example:

<skos:Concept rdf:about="http:/example.com/geo/Bristol">
<skos:inScheme rdf:resource="http:/example.com/geo/"/>
<skos:prefLabel>Bristol</skos:prefLabel>
<skos:altLabel>City of Bristol</skos:altLabel>
<skos:subjectIndicator
rdf:resource="http://dmoz.org/Regional/Europe/United_Kingdom/England/Bristol/"/>
</skos:Concept>

Say what?
