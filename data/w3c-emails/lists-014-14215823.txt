SKOS web service APIs...

cheers,

attached mail follows:
With UMLS locally installed , I use :
- MetaMap (http://mmtx.nlm.nih.gov/)
- UMLSDB.java 
(http://www.cra.org/Activities/craw/dmp/awards/2001/groce/finalreport.html)
- concerning UMLS-Query (http://umls-query.sourceforge.net/), you can 
contact the author (Jason Michelizzi mich0212 (at) d (dot) umn (dot) edu) 
and ask him.
infact, his web page has been updated very recently.

There are however also several other attempts for Java UMLS query 
interface:

        Subject:        I seek for a tool to retrieve UMLS


Hello,
I am working in Information Retrieval applied to medical field and I seek
for some tool to question UMLS. I found UMLS-Query in source-forge, but 
this
project is broken and the tool is not finalised (pre-alpha version).

Thank you very much for helping me
M. Baziz
