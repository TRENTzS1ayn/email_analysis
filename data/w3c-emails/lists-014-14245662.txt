I prefer the / approach, but I should warn that TimBL and others have
made the claim that http://blah/ URIs without a # can only name
'documents' or 'networked information resources', and that concepts,
classes, properties etc don't count as those.

So, if you do advice thesaurus folks one way or the other, try to make
clear that this aspect of web architecture is still under discussion.
