To go along with Dan ...

I also prefer the / approach in principle because it defines more neatly the "subject
indicator", but consider that e.g. OWL uses fragment identifiers to define classes and
properties ...

Will not people be confused with OWL elements defined by
http://example.org/myontology#class001
and SKOS concepts defined by http://example.org/myskos/concept001

What about namespace management?

And having, e.g. for GEMET, over 8000 different resources/concepts, if you just want to
download the whole stuff, hmm...
Is not it more simple to have a / namespace for a whole SKOS scheme, and # for each
concept in it?

We've been through this in Published Subjects TC, without clear conclusion ...
