That's a whole other ball game.  As I understand it, the choice is between
the HTTP GET request for the concept URI returning either a machine readable
or a human readable description of that concept.  I may have boiled that
down too much - have I missed anything?

One thing a GET request for the thesaurus URI should definitely return is a
description of that thesaurus (i.e. name, version, creators, description of
scope and content etc.) although again whether that should be machine or
human readable is open.  

The other question is, should the request for the thesaurus URI also return
the entire content of the thesaurus?  Personally I think no, but again I'm
not sure about that.
