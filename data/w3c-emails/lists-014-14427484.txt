couple of options:

1) danbri/other sorts you out with permissions & connection details for w3c 
cvs server - (you need to generate public/private key pair and give dan 
your public key etc. Then you check the files in a suitable directory (e.g. 
see http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/)

2) I or Dave, who have access to the cvs server, can check the files in for 
you. Am happy to do this, but you might prefer 1) because you get control 
over what goes where on an ongoing basis,

let me know if you need any help,
Nikki
