This is an attempt at a list of features we could add by extending SKOS-Core
with OWL.

1.  <soks:related> is symmetric.

2.  <soks:broader> is transitive.

3.  <soks:narrower> is transitive.

4.  <soks:broader> and <soks:narrower> are each other's inverse.

5.  A resource typed as a <soks:Concept> may have at most one value for
<soks:prefLabel>

6.  <soks:broaderGeneric> and <soks:narrowerGeneric> are each other's
inverse.

7.  <soks:broaderInstantive> and <soks:narrowerInstantive> are each other's
inverse.

8.  <soks:broaderPartitive> and <soks:narrowerPartitive> are each other's
inverse.

9.  <soks:inFacet> and <soks:facetMember> are each other's inverse.

10.  A resource typed as a <soks:Concept> may have at most one value for
<soks:inFacet>

Can't think of any more for the moment.

  

Couple of general OWL questions:

1.  If a property is declared as an owl:TransitiveProperty, will all
sub-properties also be transitive?

2.  If a property is declared as an owl:SymmetricProperty, will all
sub-properties also be symmetric?
