I don't think either are true.

If s is a supProperty of p that means that each pair (sub,obj) in s is 
also in p but the subset of pairs in s can be arbitrary. For example, in 
a domain with two members a and b you could have:
    p = { (a, b), (b, a) }
    s = { (a, b) }
Here p is symmetric and s is a subProperty of p but s is not symmetric.
