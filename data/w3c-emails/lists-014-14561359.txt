Agreed. I had my doubts when I first saw a blank node used for foaf:Person,
seemed counter-intuitive, but with the use cases that have flowed through
rdfweb-dev it looks like this was almost certainly a very wise move. A
person is a tricky enough thing to pin down, I expect something like a
concept [waves hands in vivid demonstration] would be even more problematic.

One thing that may be needed in the docs - a warning about sticking a URI
in - one company (I forget which, better not guess) has been putting a URI
in their ever-so-slightly-modified FOAF files. Not pretty.

Cheers,
Danny.
