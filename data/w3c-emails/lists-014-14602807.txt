to expand on my example

 <Concept>
   <prefLabel>Bar</prefLabel>
   <altLabel>Baz</altLabel>
   <rdf:isDefinedBy rdf:resource="http://example.com/concepts?easyToFind"/>
 </Concept>
 <Concept>
   <prefLabel>Bar</prefLabel>
   <altLabel>Foo</altLabel>
   <rdf:isDefinedBy rdf:resource="http://example.com/concepts?worksForPWD"/>
 </Concept>

seems reasonable, or am I missing something?

Hmm. I am assuming you point to the term definition, not just the thesaurus
it is in. But  I think even if I pointed to the latter (i.e. the thesaurus
defines a concept with two prefLabels) there would be nothing to stop the
thesaurus from defining two concepts with the same prefLabel and different
alternative labels. And I don't see there is anything wrong with deciding to
name a concept definition:

 <Concept rdf:about="#foo">
   <prefLabel>Bar</prefLabel>
   <altLabel>Foo</altLabel>
   <rdf:isDefinedBy rdf:resource="http://example.com/concepts?worksForPWD"/>
 </Concept>

it just gives you a way to refer to this definition. ?
