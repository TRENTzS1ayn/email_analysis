I don't see why something as well as a URI is necessary.

The idea of the semantic web is that URIs are identifiers, good for
identifying "things". There are some things they are good at identifying. One
is actual pages on the web, since these already have a URI. But there are
also "concepts" - things that have a way of identifying them, and various
descriptions. We can give them a name (URI) or we can just describe them (as
blank nodes).

And I think it's a bad idea to insist on a single preferred label.

Words are what people use becausee we don't have blank nodes. They aren't
equivalent to URIs, because we already know that they are duplicated,
ambiguous, overloaded. But we're stuck with them as identifiers, since we
can't look up URIs in our head. (We also have descriptions, and we end up
using a mixture of the two to try and disambiguate concepts).

If two concepts have the same labels and descritptions, they might be the
same. It's certainly a useful working assumption. But a few long
philosophical discussions are enough to realise that often you can spend
hours talking about something before realising that each person is talking a
bout a different thing - and then you disambiguate it by adding some
qualifying information that is unique to one of the options.

So we can use identical graphs for two blank concept nodes to assert that
they are the same, for a given purpose. Or we can use a URI. In either case,
we have the important ability to go further, and subclass the concept perhaps
in two or more ways.
