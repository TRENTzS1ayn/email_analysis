Have I missed something here?  Is there any reason why the concept *must* be
blank?  This isn't the same as overriding the authority of the thesaurus - I
(as encoder of thesaurus in RDF) can add *a* name for a concept if I want to
help users of the RDF form - I just don't use the authorities naming space
for those URIs.

Why not give it a URI (urn:uuid being a possible choice) anyway even though
the primary identification in the theasurus is by other means.  Then, once
found, the usual way of referring to a resources is the same as other RDF.

Good point - and unfortunately not just for this situation  The additional
URIs can be assigned separately (another part of the file) from the
descriptions, because there is a uniquely identifying property set.   [I
always fancied a property "rdf:uri" and only having bNodes in RDF.]

Or write in N3 :-)

I guess I don't see it as black-and-white.  There can be several names
(URIs) for a thing.  If, later, that authority does assign URIs, we add
owl:sameAs rules.
