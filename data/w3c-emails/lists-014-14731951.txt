Hi Jasper,

Phil Cross suggested I contact you, after I had a query regarding the work
you did for SOSIG.  Phil told me you were in fact using more than one
thesaurus to index your content.  As part of the SWAD-Europe Thesaurus
Activity [1] I'm looking for a test case to demonstrate thesaurus linking -
combining two or more thesauri to create a hybrid.  Could you possibly tell
me which thesauri you were using, and where you would like them to be linked
(i.e. which bits of each you use and which bits you don't)?  That would be
very useful.

Many thanks,

Alistair.
