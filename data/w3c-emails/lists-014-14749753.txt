Hi,

Currently we have two vocabs, SKOS-Core and SKOS-Mapping, under different
namespaces.  I was wondering whether it would be better to put them both
under the same namespace, and just have a single SKOS vocab.

I think in the long run, a single vocab would be better.  However, in the
short term, and to facilitate a quick release of SKOS-Core 1.0 (adding in a
release version of SKOS-Mapping would hold it up a bit) I thought to keep
them separate for the moment.

Any thoughts?

Al.
