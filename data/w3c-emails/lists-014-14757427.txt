Hi,

This is an outstanding issue, which needs to be resolved before an SKOS-Core
1.0 release.

It is clear that it is necessary to have some way of stating that a concept
is a member of a particular thesaurus (conceptual scheme).  By what
mechanism do we do this?

Options:

1.  Use rdfs:isDefinedBy

2.  Create a new (more specific than rdfs:isDefinedBy) property e.g.
skos:inScheme

3.  For each scheme (thesaurus) define a subclass of the skos:Concept class

Argument:

(1) is not specific to this need, and overloading it could cause confusion
and ambiguity.
(2) is potentially easiest to understand.
(3) is more consistent with the qualified DC in RDF approach to representing
subject schemes [1].

I'm tempted to go with (2) for now and add a property to SKOS-Core
<skos:inScheme> for the 1.0 release.

Any thoughts on choosing this option, or the name of the property itself?
(I didn't suggest something like <skos:inThesaurus> because I'm trying to
keep SKOS slightly more generic than just thesauri.)

Al.
