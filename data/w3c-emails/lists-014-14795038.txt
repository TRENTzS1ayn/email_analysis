The thing is I'm not totally clear on exactly how rdfs:isDefinedBy should be
used.  

The following excerpt comes from [1] :

--------------------
rdfs:isDefinedBy is an instance of rdf:Property that is used to indicate a
resource 
defining the subject resource. This property may be used to indicate an RDF
vocabulary in
which a resource is described.
--------------------

What I want is a property that says 'concept X is a member of concept-scheme
Y'.

So I'm not sure if rdfs:isDefinedBy is appropriate?

P.s. I slept on it and now I'm tending towards option (3) - create a
subclass of skos:Concept for each concept scheme (mainly because of
consistency with DCQ).

Al.

I'm missing something. Can you explain why (1) is ambiguous and misleading?

Cheers
