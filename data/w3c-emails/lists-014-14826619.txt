Hi,

I'm thinking SKOS-Core 1.0 should have a class like <skos:ConceptScheme>.
So when someone defines a concept scheme (e.g. a thesaurus), they can give
it a URI and type it appropriately.

Quick discussion of some alternatives:

I would have called it <skos:Thesaurus> but I'm still aiming slightly more
generic than thesauri (am trying to shoot in between lots of different
communities with different legacy perspectives - 'ConceptScheme' is more
neutral and self-descriptive than 'Thesaurus' which means different things
to different people).

Also, I don't think <dct:SubjectScheme> is appropriate, because as Phil from
English Heritage pointed out, a lot of thesauri are used for things other
than subject based indexing.

Any comments?

Al.
