I propose we change the comment of the skos:related property to indicate
that this property should NOT be considered as symmetric.

We then add an extension skos:relatedSymmetric (as a sub-prop of
skos:related) to be used in the case where related IS considered to be
symmetric.

To accommodate the cases where the partitve relationship is treated as an
associative relationship (and NOT as hierarchical), I suggest we add two
extensions to SKOS-Core:

skos:relatedPartOf (sub-prop of skos:related)
skos:relatedHasPart (sub-prop of skos:related)

... So then users have the option to use either the hierarchical or
associative style properties to express the partitive relation, depending on
preference.
