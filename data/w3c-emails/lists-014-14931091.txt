Hi!
I thought an example from traditional KOS may help.

The situation with symbols in KOS is as follows and I assume
that this can be encoded in different ways (e.g. as an equivalent
term or as an preferred term)

1) classification uses symbols as concepts so if symbol
is used instead of concept there should be provision for the concept
description (as well as its scope note which is not the same)

examples

23 Religions originating in Indian sub-continent. Hindu religion
  in the broad sense
 SN:Hinduism is extremely difficult to define. Vedism and
 Brahmanism may be regarded as the religion of the archaic
 period, and, as a general rule 233 should be used for works on
 Hinduism
233Hinduism narrowly
233-442.47Upavasa. Fasting in Hinduism


(03)Reference works [description]
SN:All books containing information on a number of different
subjects or on the totality of knowledge [scope note]

[not to mention that symbols in classifications works as semantic
aggregates... i.e. one can connect 233 Hinduism with  (03) Reference works
to get composit 233(03) Reference works in Hinduism or 233-442.47(03)
Reference works on fasting in Hinduism. But this is out of
the scope of this discussion.

b) thesauri may also have symbols attached to descriptors for the
purpose of systematic display...
