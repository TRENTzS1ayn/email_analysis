Doing facets seems to me to be getting into the territory already 
covered by RDFS/OWL. Is there any way this could be couched as a bunch
of test cases, with facets defined as RDF properties annotated in OWL,
versus in a more traditional library-style thesaurus? And then mappings 
specified, in prose or RDF...?

I guess I'm wary that the ontology community might look at what we're
doing here and and say "Hey, why are you re-inventing OWL?", especially
as we move from representing networks of named concepts to representing
the properties and classes that characterise the things those concepts
stand for...

Any thoughts on where/how to draw the line? 

Dan
