Absolutely!  I am very conscious not to tread on the toes of RDFS or OWL, or
to re-invent or duplicate anything.  I want to use properties/classes from
other vocabs whenever possible.  

I think that a set of test cases is a very good idea - if anyone knows of
faceted schemes in the public domain, can they forward links to this list?

Thanks,

Al.
