I always assumes that the set of altLabels for a concept would constitute
the entry vocabulary (entry terms) for a concept.  So for example (from GCL
[1]):

<skos:Concept rdf:about="[someURI]">
<skos:prefLabel>Equal opportunities and diversity</skos:prefLabel>
<skos:altLabel>Positive discrimination (equal
opportunities)</skos:altLabel>
<skos:altLabel>Racial discrimination (education
opportunities)</skos:altLabel>
<skos:altLabel>Racial discrimination (employment
opportunities)</skos:altLabel>
<skos:altLabel>Racial equality</skos:altLabel>
<skos:altLabel>Religious discrimination (education and
employment)</skos:altLabel>
<skos:altLabel>Sexual discrimination (education
opportunities)</skos:altLabel>
<skos:altLabel>Sexual discrimination (employment
opportunities)</skos:altLabel>
<skos:altLabel>Discrimination by sex, race, religion
etc.</skos:altLabel>
<skos:altLabel>Diversity (equal opportunities)</skos:altLabel>
<skos:altLabel>Affirmative action (equal
opportunities)</skos:altLabel>
<skos:inScheme rdf:resource="[URI of GCL]"/>
</skos:Concept>
