I would describe this as the organisation of concepts within the
materials facet into arrays, each according to a specified criterion of
division. A concept may occur in two or more of these arrays and may
occur more than once within a single array.

For example you can have:

<materials by origin>
        animal materials
                animal fat
        inorganic materials
                mineral oil
        vegetable materials
                sunflower oil

<materials by function>
        foodstuffs
                animal fat
                sunflower oil
        fuels
                animal fat
                mineral oil
                sunflower oil
        lubricants
                animal fat
                mineral oil

I don't really follow this. You could argue that "materials" is one of
the mutually-exclusive groups you would create if you divided the
universe of concepts by the criterion of the "fundamental category" to
which they belong. Alternatively, you could argue that "materials" is a
top-level term which you would reach if you built a hierarchical tree
from the bottom upwards, and could then go no further, i.e. it is one of
the small number of ultimate "top terms" that you would reach if you
combined all concepts into trees on the "is-a" (generic) relationship.

Both of these approaches lead me to think that it is useful to use the
expression "facets" for these groups or ultimate top terms.

I agree that different people may derive slightly different sets of
facets by these methods. "People" and "organisations" might be
considered as separate facets or as concepts within a more general facet
of "people and organisations"[1]; "people" might be considered as a
concept within the more general facet of "organisms". But in most cases
I think it is possible to define a useful set of mutually exclusive
facets in this way.

But I'm not sure what you are saying that it "logically and technically"
is. Do you want to use the term "facet" for what I have called an
"array"?

These concept categories are what my reasoning above leads me to call
"fundamental facets", or preferably just "facets", to avoid the
complication and confusion of having different kinds of facets.

Yes, and I think we have to come to some clear consensus or we shall
continue to confuse the folk who are seeking definitive statements on
these structures in order to build them into the unforgiving syntax of
machine communication formats.

[1] It is unfortunate that we don't have a convenient word to encompass
"people and organisations". "Agents" is not good, because it implies an
active role and distinguishes them from "patients", i.e. the things
acted upon, which is not intended here. "Bodies" implies dead bodies or
corporate bodies.
