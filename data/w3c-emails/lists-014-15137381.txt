Agreed. I don't mind what they are called so long as we all call them
the same!

Yes, in principle, though any list of this kind is an example and cannot
be definitive.

I go along with the AAT definition
<http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/aat/about
.html> which reads:

"Facets constitute the major subdivisions of the AAT hierarchical
structure. A facet contains a homogeneous class of concepts, the members
of which share characteristics that distinguish them from members of
other classes. For example, the term marble refers to a substance used
in the creation of art and architecture, and it is found as a preferred
term (descriptor) in the Materials facet. The term Impressionist denotes
a visually distinctive style of art, and it is listed as a preferred
term in the Styles and Periods facet.

Facets and Hierarchies in the AAT:

ASSOCIATED CONCEPTS FACET
PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES FACET
STYLES AND PERIODS FACET
AGENTS FACET
ACTIVITIES FACET
MATERIALS FACET
OBJECTS FACET"

This doesn't say anything about roles.

I'm not so happy about calling these "facets", because some of them
depend on the role that something has rather than the fundamental
category to which it belongs. This is a rule for citation order, in
which I would say that the "thing" or "material" facets may occur more
than once, as "thing", "material", "patient", "product" and "by-product"
for example. Your other examples below are versions of this, or mixtures
of the "role" and "category" criteria, and thus unsatisfactory in
principle. That's not to say that they don't work in practice, because
humans can live with a certain amount of fuzziness; it's when you try to
tighten this up so that machines can understand it that the anomalies
become evident.

Yes.

We have problems because people from different backgrounds interpret
terms differently. My point is that even if these terms have been used
with different meanings by respected authorities in the past, that is
not a reason not to try to rationalise the situation now and restrict
the terms to a single, well-defined meaning.

Indeed. I think that there is a distinction between the definition of
"facet" and the broader concept of "facet analytical theory" or "faceted
approaches"; this broader concept includes the idea of organising arrays
of sibling concepts according to defined characteristics of division.

You have to draw a line somewhere in deciding how far to go in factoring
compound concepts into their constituents. The British Standard for
thesaurus construction gives some guidance on this.

I think that the point here is that when you set up an array with a
specified characteristic of division, you should try to make the
subdivisions mutually exclusive, so that you cannot combine two foci
from the same array. You cannot have a male female, for example, or an
adult teenager, if the arrays are specified as follows:

people
        <people by gender>
        males
        females

        <people by age>
        children (0-12 years)
        teenagers (13-19 years)
        adults (over 20 years)

I'm not sure that this rule need be enforced absolutely, though, or else
perhaps some refinement or interpretation is needed. In the example I
gave in my previous message, it is possible to have an array of
"materials by function" in which a single material can be both a
lubricant and a foodstuff (animal fat or castor oil, for example).

Also, in the array

        <people by relationship>
        daughters
        sons
        fathers
        mothers
        cousins

someone cannot be related to another single person as both a son and a
father, though a single person can be both a son and a father at the
same time. Care is needed on how you interpret these.

I think that inheritance should apply to all concepts related by the
generic hierarchical ("is-a") relationship, and I think that membership
of a facet is one aspect of this. In my last message I said that one way
of defining a facet is to work up a generic tree until you can go no
higher, and you end up with a facet definition, being the "fundamental
category" to which that tree of concepts belongs.
