I think this is a good approach.  Therefore, I suggest renaming the top
level property of SKOS-Mapping from 'mappingRelation' to 'semanticMapping'.


This would mean that the top level property of SKOS-Core (intra-thesaurus)
is 'semanticRelation' and the top level property of SKOS-Mapping
(inter-thesaurus) is 'semanticMapping', consistent with the BS convention.
