Having both <soks:descriptor> and <soks:prefLabel> is definitely confusing.
I suggest we drop the property <soks:descriptor> from SKOS-Core.  We retain
<soks:prefLabel>, which should be used to assert the preferred name by which
a concept should be labelled.  The name should be unique within the
particular conceptual scheme.

Just to state that I too would like to make sure that the SWAD work is
compatible with the new thesaurus standard.
