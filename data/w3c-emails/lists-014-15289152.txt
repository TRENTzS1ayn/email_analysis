Hi Alistair

First better warn you unfortunately I'm not working on SIMILE, but I'll
explain my position here, as I did do a bit of the work on lexical mapping
...

I think we do need to do this, in fact I think this is related to our
previous discussion on giving URIs to altLabels?

Automated discovery doesn't quite work in the way you describe, because the
computer will generate lexical mappings, but then anywhere between 10% and
50% of them are incorrect. So you need some way of capturing them, and
reviewing them by hand if necessary.

Does that seem sensible?
