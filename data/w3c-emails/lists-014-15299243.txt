Yes I was thinking of this when I made these comments.  (I have some ideas
about how to express lexical mappings that does not require the altLabels to
have their own URI.)

Yes absolutely.  Could you possibly provide me with a list of all the types
of useful lexical mapping you can think of?  

This is splitting hairs a little bit, but I think it would be more accurate
to say that a lexical mapping may or may not reflect a close semantic
mapping.  So a lexical mapping is never 'incorrect' if it captures some sort
of lexical similarity between labels, even if there is no semantic mapping
between the corresponding concepts. 

(This is just my attempt to make a very clear distinction between the world
of lexical comparison of character strings, and the world of semantic
comparison of intended meaning.)

Yours,

Alistair.
