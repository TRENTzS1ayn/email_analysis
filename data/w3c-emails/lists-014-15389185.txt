> that used an item dc:subject at least once.

> Sadly, it's little more than a mish-mash of string data.
> 
> Of those 52k feeds a subtotal of 24k unique strings were used.  It's at this
> point that the data gets messy.

> Those 24 thousand unique subject descriptions are all over the map.  Some are
> what would be considered usefully simple keywords.  Some are long string
> statements, sentences and partial sentences.  A bunch are just utter gibberish.
> 
> Several are using what appears to be a quasi-delimited strings.  Some in an
> apparent attempt to make hierarchical categorizations while others as multiple
> dichotomies.  About 1100 are trying to use the comma as a sort of multiple
> keyword delimiter.  The comma is also being (ab)used for formal names (eg
> "Smith, John Q.")
> 
> Another thousand are trying to use the forward slash as a hierarchy delimiter.
> Sometimes with or without leaders and/or space padded.  Some are even trying to

> just making it up.  <sigh/>

> Suffice to say, case sensitivity is equally random.

> One feed is trying to use several subjects per item but uses some sort of
