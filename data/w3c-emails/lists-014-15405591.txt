My attention has been drawn, by Mike Collett, Schemeta, via Stella 
Dextre Clarke, to a vocabulary definition exchange specification called 
"VDEX" produced by IMS Global:

<http://www.imsglobal.org/vdex/>

This is being tried out in some HE/FE organisations, for example:

<http://www.icbl.hw.ac.uk/vdex/>

Are the esw-thes people aware of this, and are any steps being taken to 
coordinate the two areas of work?
