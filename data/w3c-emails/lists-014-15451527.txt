Yes, I agree. We should probably practice what we preach, and define
these concepts in terms of their functionality. If in doing so we find
that we are talking about more than one distinct concept, then we need
to find distinct names for them.

I'm not sure whether any new distinction is being made here or whether
she is just making the distinction between mono- and poly-hierarchy.
I.e. whether or not a term can have more than one broader term.

It seems to me that the only case where mono-hierarchies are required is
something like a formal biological taxonomy, where membership of a
parent concept is an essential part of the definition of a concept.
"Whales" are "mammals" _by definition_ and they cannot therefore have
any other parent concept such as "fishes" or "insects".

In any other kind of hierarchy a term can in principle have more than
one broader term, so that "whales" can be a narrower term of "mammals"
as well as being a narrower term of "aquatic creatures", where it may
have "fish" and "plankton" as sibling terms. This polyhierarchical
structure allows broadening of searches for "all mammals" or "all
aquatic creatures", so I'm puzzled by the suggestion you quote above
that a monohierarchy is desirable for this purpose.

The only restriction is that the parent concepts must belong to the same
fundamental category (which I call a facet). "Whales" is in the facet of
"organisms" or "living things" and cannot have a parent concept in the
facet of "disciplines", or "actions", or "places", for example.

Some thesauri are restricted to being mono-hierarchical because of
limitations in the software used to construct them, but that is not
something  that we should accept as a general principle.

I don't think that the issue of polysemes is relevant here, because we
are talking about the relationship between _concepts_ rather than words.
If a word can represent more than one concept within a controlled
vocabulary then it is not a good descriptor and needs to be qualified to
show which concept it represents. If it represents only one concept
within the vocabulary, though it can represent other concepts elsewhere,
then its scope note needs to show clearly that its meaning is
restricted.

Yes, I think that this is the core of the problem. The rules for
combining descriptors to create a compound string to represent a
combination of concepts, are often called rules for the "citation order
of facets", but as I said in my last message this meaning of "facet" is
different from the "fundamental category" meaning. We are talking about
two different concepts, and I think we should give them different names.

When we build a string using a rule such as

>> >Thing/kind/part/property/material/process/operation/patient/product/by-
>> >product/agent/space/time

I would say that "we are combining concepts (or the terms which
represent concepts) according to their roles", with no mention of
facets.

In the strings

        boys kissing girls
and
        girls kissing boys

"boys" and "girls" both belong to the same facet of "people". The
citation order is determined by roles and not by facets.

Yes, this is another meaning again. When an interface allows you to
search for wine first by origin, then by colour, then by sweetness, it
is allowing you to apply successive characteristics of division in order
to reduce the number of entries in the arrays at the lowest level. This
is a fundamental feature of "faceted classification", but neither the
"characteristics of division" (origin, colour, sweetness) nor the
resulting arrays are "facets" in the sense of "fundamental categories",
and I think it misleading to call them that.

We don't need a structure other than well-defined concepts to attach
roles to. The fact that boys and girls are in the same facet in the
example about doesn't help in determining their roles.

>But the very fact that classification facets have their roles

I don't believe that they do, unless you are defining "classification
facets" to _mean_ roles. Doing that seems to introduce unnecessary
confusion..

Its role, not the facet to which it belongs, will determine its place in
a string.

Meaning of concepts should be defined by scope notes. A single concept
should not occur in more than one facet, though it may occur in more
than one hierarchy within a single facet (see above).

I don't see the problem here. The concept of "marble" refers to "a
granular crystalline limestone", and this is always true (_pace_ any
pedantic geologists). It may be put into an array under the node label
<rock by composition> and into another array under the broader term
"materials for sculpture" (if that is its only use within the scope of
the thesaurus). It may also be combined into an indexing string with the
discipline of "geology" and the form "deposits". None of these affects
the nature of the concept or its membership of a "materials" facet.

Yes, I am becoming more and more convinced that thesauri and
classification schemes are just alternative ways or arranging and
presenting lists and groups of concepts. I therefore am very keen to
help arrive at a single set of unambiguous terms which we can use to
discuss these things, rather than having to qualify statements by saying
that we are talking "in a thesaurus context" or "in a classification
context".

This is an interesting discussion - I wonder whether other people have
views on whether what we are saying makes sense.  Are we making any
progress towards a consensus of opinion?
