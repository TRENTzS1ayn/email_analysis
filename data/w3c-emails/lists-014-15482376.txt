There are some cases where apparent antonyms are alternative labels for 
the same concept. "Dryness" and "wetness" for example are both possible 
labels for the concept of "moisture content". (The "half-full" or 
"half-empty" situation.)

This worries me. A label is only of use if it identifies the thing it 
labels. I may have three jars labelled "coffee", of which one contains 
coffee, one contains tea and the other contains sugar, but this is not 
the sort of situation we should accept.

Did you mean to say that a concept may have more than one label? That is 
certainly true, and two labels that refer to the same concept could 
reasonably be said to be "equivalent".

Perhaps not "equivalence" but still a close association. The label is a 
convenient way of referring to the concept, avoiding the need to write 
out the scope note in full every time you want to refer to it. If I 
label a jar "coffee", "caf?" or "641.3373", those symbols are by no 
means empty of meaning; they indicate the same substance even though the 
character strings are not "equivalent" to the substance.

As you have indicated, equivalence between concepts is something that 
should arise only when mapping between different thesauri.

If two concepts within a single thesaurus are exactly equivalent, I see 
no need for them both to be present. They should be combined, as there 
is only one concept, not two.

If there is partial equivalence between concepts in a single thesaurus, 
then either one is a narrower term of the other or else there is an area 
of overlap (e.g. "ships" and "boats"). In the latter case the scope of 
each concept should if possible be redefined so as to eliminate this 
overlap, as it will lead to uncertainty in using the thesaurus. An 
associative link may then be made between the two related concepts.

It must be difficult to differentiate between MajorMapping and 
MinorMapping, but it is probably helpful to have these to indicate large 
or small extents of overlap.

Or 'concept + as many labels as necessary' (of which one may be 
designated as the "preferred" label or "descriptor").

My tuppence worth.
