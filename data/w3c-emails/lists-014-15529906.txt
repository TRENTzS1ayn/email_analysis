This looks a useful summary of where we are. Thanks. (A pity though that 
it is in pale grey type - I had to use the accessibility option to 
"ignore colors specified on Web pages" to make it easily legible.)

I haven't followed up all the links, but was a bit puzzled by the 
distinction between "preferred-label" and "descriptor" in SKOS-Core. 
They seem to me to be the same thing.

I take it that any labels that are not "preferred-labels" are by default 
"non-preferred labels" or "nondescriptors", so that is the reason why 
these are not explicitly provided for.

You have

preferred-label
Use this property to indicate a literal which is the preferred label for 
a resource. If a resource has this property, all other rdfs:label 
properties are considered to be the 'alternative' (i.e. non-preferred) 
labels.

and

descriptor
A 'descriptor' is a label that uniquely identifies a concept within a 
conceptual scheme. A descriptor must be unambiguous. Examples of good 
descriptors are 'Orange (fruit)' and 'Java programming language'. 
Examples of poor descriptors are 'Orange' and 'Java'.

Is there any significance in the fact that the first definition refers 
to "a resource" while the second refers to "a concept"?

In <http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/SWAD/deliverables/8.1.html#2.2> we read:

(a) The soks:prefLabel property is a sub-property of rdfs:label.

(b) The soks:descriptor proeprty [sic.] is a sub-property of 
soks:prefLabel. Therefore a concept cannot have both a descriptor and a 
prefLabel.

I can see no place for a preferred label that is not a descriptor.

If the "Therefore . . ." statement in (b) is a consequence of the first 
sentence of (b), would there not be a parallel conclusion in (a) : 
"Therefore a concept cannot have both a prefLabel and a label".  Such a 
conclusion seems incorrect.
