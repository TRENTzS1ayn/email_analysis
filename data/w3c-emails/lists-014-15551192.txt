Hi Leonard,

Thanks alot for these comments.

In SKOS-Core 1.0 there will only be a 'prefLabel' property (the 'descriptor'
property has been dropped).

This change originally proposed in response to Stella's comments, in mail
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-esw-thes/2004Jan/0001.html>.

Al.
