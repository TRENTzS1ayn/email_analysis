This looks like a really useful start. I wonder if it could be taken in
two parts: (i) an characterisation of the differences between formal
ontology/rdf approeach and thesaurus broader-term/narrower-term notions,
particularly referencing library world, then (ii) introduce SKOS as a
formalisation of the latter and an exploratory basis for mapping between 
the two...?

exciting to see this stuff coming together :)
