Hi all, 

Here is the schema I am proposing to offer as the SKOS-Core 1.0 release:

<http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/SWAD/rdf/skos_core_1_0.rdf>

I've added a few OWL statements about transitivity etc. - I thought, why
not.

Dave, Nikki and I set a target for the release of this schema by next
thursday, 5pm, along with a guide to using it (which I'm writing right now).
So all comments by next wednesday please.

Al.
