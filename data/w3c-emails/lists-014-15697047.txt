dc:subject relates a document to a code that stands for some thing the
doc is about.

foaf:topic relates a document to some thing that the doc is about.

...the difference is w.r.t. layers of indirection: where dc:subject uses 
an external taxonomy, set out in advance, foaf:topic relies on any chunk
of RDF that is handy for describing the thing. It's an interesting 
stylistic and representational difference that seems really quite 
unfortunately hard to explain clearly...

They differ importantly, just as you differ from your homepage, and XML 
differs from library subject codes for XML. With dc:subject there is a
whole other world squeezed into the representation: the world of
subject/topic codes. With foaf:topic, the RDF itself does that work,
removing subject/topic codes from the list of things the RDF needs to
describe. See above re this being hard to describe :(

that would imply that any pair of things related by foaf:topic are also 
related by dc:subject. This isn't so, since the values taken by
dc:subject are various forms of subject code, whereas the values taken
by foaf:topic are the things that those subject codes denote. So
declaring a subPropertyOf relation would confuse those two levels.

We defintely need to to allow for vocabulary evolution, it might be 
interesting to compare the two approaches...
