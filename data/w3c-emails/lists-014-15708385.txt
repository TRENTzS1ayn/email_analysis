This is off-topic but I think these days Literals are Resources (in terms 
of the semantics document the set of literal values LV is a subset of the 
set of resources IR) so a foaf:topic with a literal value is just fine as 
far as the range declaration is concerned.  Doesn't affect the more 
important philosphical distinction Dan is making.
