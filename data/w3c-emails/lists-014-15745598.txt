Doug wrote me a while ago to say that 'related' should not always be
symmetric.  So I made <skos:related> not symmetric, and created an extension
<skos:relatedSymmetric> to account for the situations where 'related' can be
taken as symmetric.

But Leonard's last mail suggests that 'related' is most often symmetric.  In
this case would it be better to have <skos:related> as a symmetric property,
and have an extension <skos:relatedAsymmetric> for those situations where
'related' is directional?

[N.B. need to resolve this by wednesday!]
