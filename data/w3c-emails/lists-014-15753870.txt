Just reread this more carefully from Leonard:

---
In most conventional thesauri, "related" relationships are treated as 
symmetric, even though more precise specification would recognise that 
many of them are directional, e.g. activity/agent, process/product, 
cause/effect and so on.

If such a conventional thesaurus is encoded in SKOS format, should such 
relationships be shown as "skos:relatedSymmetric", that being the way 
they are treated, or should they be given the more general coding 
"skos:related", leaving the way open to refine the nature of the 
relationship in future?
---

Does anyone have any thoughts on this?

Al.
