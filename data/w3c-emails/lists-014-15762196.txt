I know that traditional thesaurus practise demands that all preferred labels
be unique within a scheme.  But Chaals argued for relaxing this in SKOS
(e.g. see [1]), and I think he has an interesting point.  Hence the phrase
'strongly recommended' rather than 'essential'.  

Anybody else have any ideas on this?
