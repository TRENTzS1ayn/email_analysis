Most thesauri treat it as symmetric, although the actual underlying 
relationships are often not symmetric.

It would seem most logical to me to have the general <skos:related> 
apply to the case where symmetry is undefined.

<skos:relatedSymmetric> and <skos:relatedAsymmetric> would then both be 
parallel more specific cases of this. Whether you need this level, or 
whether you go straight to the more detailed specification of the 
relationship such as "cause/effect", "process/product" (both asymmetric) 
or "associated", "sibling", "neighbouring" etc. (symmetric) depends 
whether there is a difference in the way that symmetric and asymmetric 
relationships will be handled.
