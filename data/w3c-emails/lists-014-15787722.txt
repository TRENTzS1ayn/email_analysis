This is quite true of single controlled vocabularies. Having one label
possibly provide two different concepts means you need to be careful to
distinguish which one is being selected - generally implying an extra
verification step in the interface.

On the other hannd, in merging vocabularies, this is going to happen. It also
allows us to explore the case where people's actual usage means that one
label is used for two different concepts. Since  people commnicate through
labels (e.g. words) rather than concepts (e.g. telepathically transferring
mental models), I think this is important in our goal of being able to use
the thesaurus work for the real world.

One intersting application, then, is to look up any concepts that do share a
label, and work out if there is an optimisation that can be done to work
around it - is the most helpful thing to offer the preferredLabel? A
definition? Is it feasible to remove the label altogether, and force people
to search using a different term?
