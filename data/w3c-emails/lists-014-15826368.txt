 I think 'merging' and 'mapping' are completely different scenarios.  In
mapping, the schemes are kept separate, and linked via mapping statements.
In merging, a new scheme is created by combining concepts from different
sources.  

It's worth considering the situations where separate groups of people (part
of a larger community) are responsible for contributing concepts as part of
a larger scheme.  In this scenario we may expect to find overlap of labels.
