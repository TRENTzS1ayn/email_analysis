Clearly Leonard and I (and to some extent Alistair and I) are currently
looking from different perspectives. I don't see any point in a mapping
unless it is to allow use of two vocabularies as if they are merged (an
artifact of RDF is that as soon as we have a mapping we can treat these
things as merged).

As I understand it one of the important features of the work is the ability
to do this mapping (although it isn't kept in the same namespace, it is a
requirement, and it is certainly the basis of my interest in this).

I maintain that one of the use cases that makes the SKOS work interesting is
the parallel work on mapping, and that we should ensure that we don' break
this.

I therefore think that we should separate what we consider Best Practice (for
example having the same label as possibly referring to two concepts is
generally a bad idea) from making something absolutely incorrect when there
is reason to believe that it will arise in practice due to sensible work. So
I would continue to suppport the idea that things are "strong usage
recommendations" (but not encoded in the ontology definition frameworks),
rather than seeking to outlaw them by specifying appropriate RDF/OWL
constraints.
