Before you merge them, you may have to undertake a mapping operation in 
order to resolve conflicts and inconsistencies. A label may be 
associated with different concepts in the part-thesauri being mapped 
together.

Once you have merged the contributions into a whole, each label in the 
single resulting thesaurus should be unique. This should therefore be a 
requirement of a scheme of encoding any single thesaurus, it seems to 
me.
