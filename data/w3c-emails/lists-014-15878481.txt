Yes - it would be nice to move to a situation where we just defined a 
particular kind of KOS and its properties according to a standard KOS scheme
and set of terms.

Just picking up this thread having returned from a trip - 
I do think we are fairly close to a broad consensus on the basic notion of a
(simple) facet, 
without getting into any particular set of top level categories or
combination rules.
Eg as per Leonard's previous definitions of a homogeneous class of concepts
or the similar definitions in the BSI standards, Aitchison & Gilchrist, etc.
 
Some of the other issues, such as roles, synthesis rules for strings, and
fundamental categories belong I think to the (next) stage of higher level
schemes or OWL definitions for different kinds of KOS. 
 
However as regards the SKOS RDF scheme, I thought the original SKOS
definition of facet was fairly close* to this and I was sorry to see it
dropped it from the latest version. Did I miss some discussion on this or is
it considered something best left for the next version? 
 
* (My original question boiled down to a couple implementation details:
Is a 'facet' best modelled as a type of concept or as a separate entity,
when considering future OWL developments?
Is the Broader relationship best suited for concept-facet relationships, or
should it be a basic subclass/superclass relationship?)
