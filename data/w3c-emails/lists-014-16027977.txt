That's good news. But it figures ... you have to "read carefully" to understand it.

Does that fit in the topic vs subject distinction?

The 'lord of the page' strikes again :))

All that goes in the right member of the 'equation' I would call 'topic and its
characteristics'
and the left member is the 'subject'. Now, how well the subject is represented is indeed
all in human interpretation.

I'm happy to see a convergence here.
