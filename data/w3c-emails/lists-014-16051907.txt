Al,
Yes, I am generally encouraged that we are making progress towards
convergence. ( And all sorts of people who should know better use
thesaurus-speak badly, so you are right to be cautious.) Was my earlier
point also clear, that it works slightly differently in classification
schemes? In the latter form of KOS, the only thing you can use reliably
as a label is the notation. The captions (or class names, or subject
headings as somebody called them) do not have exactly the same function
as the terms in a thesaurus, because they are not necessarily unique. If
you move on to those KOS called taxonomies, it is even more confusing
because people use this word for all sorts of things, and there is no
standard to define best practice.

Subject: RE: What is a concept?



The following statement (basically a re-iteration of what you said
Stella) is how I see things, and my starting point for design in SKOS:

'The complete intension of a concept should be inferred from the
preferred label, the non-preferred labels, any scope notes or
definitions, and relationships to neighbouring concepts.'

[which is essentially the same as ... (from Stella)]
> "concept = preferred term + any non-preferred terms + any scope note +

> any clues given by relationships to broader terms and others"

The reason I replace 'term' with 'label' is because of the way I have
heard 'term' used in the thesaurus world.  In my experience, when
someone refers to a 'term' sometimes they are  pointing to a concept,
and sometimes they are point to a string of characters.

Actually if you look at Stella's equation, it illustrates my point.  In
the first part 'term' is used to refer to the character strings (concept
= preferred term + any non-preferred terms ...) but in the second part
it is used as a proxy for concepts (concept = ... relationships to
broader terms ...).  I would argue that 'broader' is a relationship of
meaning, and therefore a relationship between concepts, never between
strings of
characters.       

When I use the word 'label' I am pointing to a string of characters or a
symbol.  When I use the word 'concept' I am point to some idea in my
head. I find that not using the word 'term' helps to keep this
distinction clear.

Al.
