Hi. Just a brief note to let you know that there is a new Working Group at W3C,
the "Semantic Web Best Practices" group.

Homepage: http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/
charter: http://www.w3.org/2003/12/swa/swbpd-charter
mailing list: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swbp-wg/

It looks like we will be starting a task force of the group in the 
area of thesauri and RDF, and I've offered to coordinate. More news as 
we have it, this is just to let you know things are starting up...

cheers,

Dan
