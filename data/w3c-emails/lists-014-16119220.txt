Congratulations on recognising at first reading an ambiguity that I've
been banging on about for years!

The terminology of faceted classification is indeed not well controlled.
:-(

Some people use the expression "subfacets" for your sense 1 and
"fundamental facets" for your sense 2, but I think that this is
confusing because they are indeed different, and not specific types of
some more general things called "facets".

The main need, as you point out, is to distinguish these two senses and
to use different names for them. The choice as to which should be given
the word "facets" is difficult, as there is warrant for either, but the
interpretation I have advocated, and which is in the draft British
Standard currently under preparation, is to use "facets" for your sense
2, i.e. "fundamental facets", sometimes called "fundamental categories".

For sense 1, an accepted terminology is to say that concepts are grouped
into "arrays" according to specified "characteristics of division". The
"characteristic of division" is shown in a node label, after the word
"by". These node labels are not descriptors, but explain the grouping of
concepts in the array that they introduce. You then have a hierarchy
such as the following which shows three arrays:

detergents
     <detergents by form>
     liquid detergents
     gel detergents
     powder detergents

     <detergents by scent>
     citrus scented detergents
        lemon scented detergents
        orange scented detergents
     pine scented detergents

     <detergents by brand name>
     Persil detergents
     Daz detergents
     Surf detergents

Note that in this case the arrays all list kinds of detergents. If you
wanted to separate out the properties from the detergents, you would
have distinct hierarchies such as

scents
     citrus scents
        lemon scents
        orange scents

physical states
     solids
        powders
     gels
     liquids

and these would belong to different [fundamental] facets.

The AAT puts "scents" (i.e. "odors") into an  "environmental concepts"
facet and "powders" into a "materials" facet under the node label
<materials by physical form>.

In this case these terms would come together with detergents only when
both descriptors were assigned to an item when that item was being
indexed.

I hope other people agree with this description.
