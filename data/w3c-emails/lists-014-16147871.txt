Hi All

I find Leonard's reply helpful here.

Looking at

>      liquid detergents
>      gel detergents
>      powder detergents

>

>      Persil detergents
>      Daz detergents
>      Surf detergents

from an rdf-world point of view, I can imagine some rdf:resource, X, and I 
might want to say:

[X] type [detergent]
[X] physical state [powder]
[X] scent [citrus scents]
....

This is not N3 or anything, but you can see what I'm saying,
(X has an rdf:type of detergent, its physical state is powder etc). And 
here 'detergent', 'powder' etc would be encoded as skos concepts for this 
particular thesaurus.

But what to do about our 'facets': physical state, scent etc? We don't want 
them to be treated like skos:concepts because basically they are 
rdf:properties.  Therefore they form an extensional part of skos:core, I'm 
thinking. i.e. to migrate a thesaurus that includes facets in the sense of 
fundemental categories, one should give these facets as properties:

rdf:Property rdf:ID="physicalState"
<rdfs:label>Physical State<rdfs:label>
<rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="skos#facet"/>
<rdfs:range rdf:resource="#Solids>
<rdfs:range rdf:resource="#Gels>
....
<rdfs:comment>
</rdfs:comment>
</rdf:Property>


where any facet is declared as a subproperty of skosfacet, say, & which is 
not to be linked into OWL or rdfs.

Putting in the range resources (which should all be skos:Concept's) would 
enable an application to switch views on instance data in the way Leonard 
describes below. And the hierarchy of skos concepts would enable an 
application to determine that concepts under 'Solids' also are in the range 
of the physicalState property, and so on.

As for the 'backwards pointer' - the ability to express for any given skos 
Concept its facet - I haven't thought through whether or not that is 
necessary.
