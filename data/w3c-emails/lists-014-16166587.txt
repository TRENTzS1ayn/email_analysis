Hi Danny, thanks for the refs on this.  

It seems to me that data in XFML can go straight into RDF, using the
constructs of RDFS (and a bit of OWL) only.  E.g. I modelled the detergents
example from [1] using RDFS - see:
<http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/SWAD/rdf/facet_in_rdfs.txt>.  This approach is also
what the Siderean folks do [2] and what Nikki was suggesting this morning
[3].  I.e. a 'facet' in the XFML sense can be modelled as a rdf:Property
with a defined domain and range.

At the moment I'm trying to manage SKOS so it doesn't duplicate anything
that can already be modelled with RDFS or OWL - these three vocabularies
ought to be complementary.  Which is why I'm so keen to clear up the 'facet'
issue.  

Maybe someone should sit down and write a white paper on how to do 'faceted
classification' to support web catalogue browsing using RDF, RDFS and OWL
(including some XSLT to generate RDF from XFML)???
