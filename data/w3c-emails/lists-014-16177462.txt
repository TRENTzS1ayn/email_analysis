Hi all,

The new british standard for thesauri is including a recommendation for
'arrays' of concepts (see Leonard's mail [1]).  So I'm trying to work out if
it would be useful for SKOS to have a construct for modelling this directly.
For example, see <http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/SWAD/rdf/concept_array.txt> which
I just knocked up.

What do you think?

Al.
