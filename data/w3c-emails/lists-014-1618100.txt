Dan,

You bring an interesting point. In the design of SSL3.0, we did not
expect that the protocol would have to support weaker authentication
techniques, actually going backwards if you think about it. The idea of
SSL3.0 was not to support everything that may exist or everything anyone
can think of. So, you cannot really accuse SSL of not being forward
compatible because it assumes a good authentication method rather than
duplicate old ones that everyone has already implemented in any
interesting application protocol. The only reason for me to entertain
this password thing is that a customer thinks it is useful, not really
because it adds anything to the protocol, on the contrary, it makes it
less attractive since the level of authentication is not defined.
