Absolutely.  Assuming that the machine-readable description of the 
thesaurus concept contains similarly-formatted references to its 
"neighbouring" concepts (or that there is a form of query you can issue 
which returns "all concepts with a link to this one"), then you can 
browse up and down the thesaurus tree structure from the starting 
concept by issuing multiple requests - if that is what you wish to do.
