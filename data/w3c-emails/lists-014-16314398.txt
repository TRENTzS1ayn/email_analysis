I doubt we can specify the human-readable offerings of thesaurus 
providers in such detail, beyond noting best practice conventions and 
common useful UI conventions. What we can do, though, is take these 
as use cases for evaluating the _machine_ interface defined in the SKOS
API. We can ask ourselves whether such a UI could be built against
any/all SKOS servers that meet the API. This opens up the prospect of 
write-once, re-use elsewhere thesaurus browsing tools...

Regarding this specific proposal, it might be worth thinking about 
how "an alphabetical list of terms" works in an internationalised
context. Do all scripts (eg. Japanese kanji, kana?) define a sort order?
How about datasets that mix Japanese with English (multilingual
thesauri, etc.)?

cheers,

Dan
