Surely they must if they have dictionaries, catalogues and telephone 
directories. I'm sure there will be standards for this, but I haven't 
looked them up.

In a "multilingual thesaurus", i.e. one that provides terms in more than 
one language to label each concept, you would normally specify which 
language you wanted to work in and the system would then return the 
terms in that language. You could extend it, if you wished, so that you 
could submit a term in one language and ask the system to return the 
terms in another language or languages that were used for the same 
concept.

P.S. As I assume that we are all on the <public-esw-thes@w3.org> 
discussion list, I think it is best not to send duplicate copies to 
private email addresses, which just need to be checked to see whether 
they are really duplicates and then deleted.
