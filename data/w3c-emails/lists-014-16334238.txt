Being able to browse by terms, as well as by concept relationships, is
extremely important. The tools we as people have to determine whether we
really mean the same concepts are essentially words and pictures.

One thing that is intersting in implementations is being abel to see why a
certain term is not the preferred term for a concept - erhaps because it is a
preferred term for another concept, or becausee it overlaps too much with its
use as an alternative term for another concept...
