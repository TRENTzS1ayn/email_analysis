Sure, both are possible and will remain so. Our focus here, though, is
on the machine readable aspect (and on making machine interfaces that 
are adequate to support an interesting and usable range of human
interfaces).

That doesn't necessarily follow. HTTP supports content negotiation 
(see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/ ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2616.txt) 
which allows multiple representations of the same thing to be made 
accessible via a common URI.

We can also use XML namespace mixing to make multiple kinds of
information available within a common piece of markup (eg. RDF inside
XHTML, or RDF styled into XHTML using XSLT). There are a lot of options
to explore.

Yep, I agree, downloading the entire database will be relatively rare.

Search engine apps may well find value in downloading the entire thing.

As host to http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/ I have noticed that some people
have tried to crawl the entire dataset with repeated HTTP requests,
presumably so they can populate a local database for query etc. I'd like
to have conventions for giving them the entire dataset in a more
efficient manner.
