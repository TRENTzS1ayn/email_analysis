Al,

have you get cvs access to our server yet?
I've started checking in code I'm working on - it's hopefully got the 
pluggable-innable approach we're after. I'm going to develop the results

development of a web browser 'frontend' to the the service - I think you 
were interested in developing this bit yourself, right?

Nikki
