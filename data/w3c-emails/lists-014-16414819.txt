I've done a small edit of the SKOS-Core 1.0 guide 

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/thes/1.0/guide/

Section 4 is now called 'Using SKOS-Core with Dublin Core for subject-based
indexing'.

This section now recommends the use of the dc:subject property for stating
the 'subject' of some resource such as a web document, where the 'subject'
has been defined as a SKOS concept.

This section no longer recommends the use of foaf:topic or foaf:primaryTopic
with SKOS concepts.  

Motivation for this change:

Dan Brickley has argued the point (convincingly in my opinion) that the
qualified DC style of resource description (using the dc:subject property to
point to some concept from a subject scheme such as a thesaurus) is actually
fundamentally different from the FOAF[1] style of resource description
(using the foaf:topic and foaf@primaryTopic properties to point to some
concrete thing defined by its properties).  The SKOS scheme is designed to
be used to represent thesaurus style subject schemes.  It fits perfectly
with the qualified DC style of description [2].  SKOS concepts are therefore
appropriately used with dc:subject, and not with
foaf:topic/foaf:primaryTopic.
