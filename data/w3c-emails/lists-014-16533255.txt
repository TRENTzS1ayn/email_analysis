Let me apologize in advance for asking what might be a very naive question 
at this stage, but there is a tremendous amount of material to get through 
to try to get up to speed on current developments. Stella brings up an 
issue that I was just trying to get a grip on, namely, the sequence in the 
different concepts presented as of the same property. Is there any implied 
sequence among, say, Narrower Terms for a given concept? If so, what is it 
(or who determines it) and where is it indicated?

Thanks very much.

Ron
