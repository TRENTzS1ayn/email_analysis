Ron,
Not sure I understand this question. Is it about the sequence among
sibling narrower terms? If so, then very often the sequence does not
matter and alphabetical order is the most convenient. But sometimes
there is a natural order, such as the order of size, or of age, or of
location. Presentation in the natural order helps people to understand
the underlying concepts better, detect omissions, overlaps etc. The
person who determines this is the thesaurus editor. The presentation
becomes even more helpful if node labels are inserted as in Leonard's
example. (In this example, notice that he found a natural order in some
of the groups but not others.)
 
I hope I've been answering the right question?
Stella

Subject: RE: Supporting arrays of concepts : node labels


Let me apologize in advance for asking what might be a very naive
question at this stage, but there is a tremendous amount of material to
get through to try to get up to speed on current developments. Stella
brings up an issue that I was just trying to get a grip on, namely, the
sequence in the different concepts presented as of the same property. Is
there any implied sequence among, say, Narrower Terms for a given
concept? If so, what is it (or who determines it) and where is it
indicated?

Thanks very much.

Ron

Firstly, a note of support for Leonard's very thorough explanation of
node labels.

Secondly, re the alternative representations proposed by Alistair and
David Menendez, I'm not quite sure what will work best. I like the way
the array relationships are "semi-detached" from the relationships
between concepts, and I'm glad to see a proposal that allows systematic
rather than alphabetical sequence. To decide which representation is
best, perhaps we should consider how the node labels and arrays will be
used, and what functions need to be supported. I don't see much use for
them in the direct process of information retrieval, but they are useful
during thesaurus browse, when they should facilitate displays of
portions of a thesaurus. A meaningful grouping of terms helps people
choose the right term, either while indexing or while searching. They
are also useful during the process of building a thesaurus.

Hi Leonard,

Thanks for this, yes I was intended the skos:Array construct to cover
your scenario 1 only, i.e. an array of concepts ordered according to
some characteristic of division. 

I think scenario 2 should be handled differently, though I'm not sure
how yet.
