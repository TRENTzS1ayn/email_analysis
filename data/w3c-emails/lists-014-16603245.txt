In RDF, the values of a property (e.g., skos:narrower) for a given
subject form a set. So, there's no way (in RDF) to determine an
intrinsic order of two concepts, given only that they are narrower than
another concept.

The lists used in the proposed skos:Array structure avoid this problem
by introducing extra nodes.

This:

    thes:001 a skos:Concept
      ; skos:subArray
        [ a skos:Array
        ; skos:members ( thes:002 thes:003 )
        ]
      .

Is actually short-hand for:

    thes:001 rdf:type      skos:Concept.
    thes:001 skos:subArray _:a.
    _:a      rdf:type      skos:Array.
    _:a      skos:members  _:b.
    _:b      rdf:first     thes:002.
    _:b      rdf:rest      _:c.
    _:c      rdf:first     thes:003.
    _:c      rdf:rest      rdf:nil.
