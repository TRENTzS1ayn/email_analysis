Stella,

You've hit on exactly the issue that concerns me, which is how the network 
client knows what to do with what it gets back from the server. The 
ultimate aim, or user case if you prefer, is supporting a human-browsable 
display, both for alphabetical and for hierarchical types of display such 
as the AAT examples Doug talks about in his JoDI paper.

As you say, sometimes the order will be alphabetical and sometimes it will 
not. I think this mixture is even more frequent with taxonomies than with 
thesauri.

1. If it's not alphabetical, but some logical sequence, the client will 
want to respect the order in which the relations have been returned by the 
server.

2. If it's alphabetical, then of course we can ask "Alphabetical according 
to which language"? A series of relations sequenced by English labels will 
clearly not work if you want to display the French labels. That may not 
matter that much, if the client accepts the job of re-sorting all the 
relations by label for every language for every set of relations for every 
record that we want to display.

But the harder question is, How does the client know when the sequence is 
alphabetical (or is irrelevant) and when it's not (and is significant)?
