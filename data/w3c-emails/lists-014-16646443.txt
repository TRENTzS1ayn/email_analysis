The Getty does not call them "node labels" but "guide terms", which in 
my opinion confuses node labels with other things.

I maintain that <coverings and hangings> is not a node label, 
irrespective of the fact that it is printed in angle brackets. It does 
not contain "by" followed by a characteristic of division, and in fact 
is just a label for a broader concept than "coverings" and "hangings" 
separately. I would drop the angle brackets and treat it as a normal 
term.

There may be cases where one node label occurs immediately under another 
without any intermediate named concept, but I cannot think of one.
If you can give me an example I'll think whether such a structure is 
unavoidable!
