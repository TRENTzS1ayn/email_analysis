Leonard,

I won't argue with you, except to say that whether these are "node labels" 
or "guide terms", we can't ignore them. These are not, in the Getty way of 
thinking, concepts, and they function, in terms of the hierarchy, in ways 
very similar to node labels.

The question remains as to how this situation is to be described in RDF?

Incidentally, I didn't go looking for this example, it popped up in a quick 
five-minute browse, which suggests that there must be quite a few more in 
the AAT (which I don't know at all).
