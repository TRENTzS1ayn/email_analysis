I agree with Andy's response. We have to be able to support ways of
working with the commonly used vocabularies. However, DDC and LCSH are
not thesauri. There are some fundamental differences in the assumptions
humans make when applying these things. It seems to me that SKOS was
developed with standard thesauri in mind, and may need some add-ons to
work across different types of vocabulary.

We are trying to encode AAT, LCSH, MeSH and DDC in SKOS.
So my answer to these questions is that SKOS needs to
find a way to handle these things.  There are a wealth
of widely used vocabularies today and to create a new
Semantic Web data format that cannot take advantage of
these vocabularies seems, to me, to be problematic.
