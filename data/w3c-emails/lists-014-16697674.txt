OK, I agree that it would be useful to have a mechanism for encoding 
pre-coordinate classification schemes and subject indexing strings, and 
I do like the idea of treating them in an integrated way that works 
smoothly with the encoding of thesaurus structures.  It will mean a 
significant expansion of the project, though. Is it currently within its 
scope?

The difficulty of applying this to existing schemes is that computer 
encoding requires the development and application of strict and 
consistent rules and algorithms, and accommodating existing schemes may 
require many messy exceptions and special provisions. As Andy says, 
though, these schemes are so widely used that we have to accommodate 
them.

My suggestion for dealing with the AAT "guide terms" was an attempt to 
interpret that thesaurus in a way that the SKOS encoding could 
accommodate, without distorting either.
