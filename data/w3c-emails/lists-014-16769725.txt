I agree with Ron, though I would be interested to know the views of the 
folk closer to the mechanics of how this would work. Perhaps there is a 
difference depending on whether you are retrieving a display for a human 
to look at or specific terms for a machine to use.

It would certainly seem more efficient for a server to return a complete 
hierarchy in response to a single request; most standard thesaurus 
management software can display such hierarchies, constructing them when 
needed by following the chain of BT/NT links.

I don't think that it should be necessary to store "level" information 
to achieve this, and indeed I think that doing so would complicate 
matters, because if a concept is inserted to create a new level of 
grouping then the "levels" of all the subordinate concepts would change.
