I did not cast a vore against forward compatibility in general at all.
Actually the current shared secret proposal does not solve that either,
in the sense that to incorporate kerberos or some other auth mechanism
we need to add yet other messages.

I was not under the impression that we were after designing forward
compatibilty in the TLS protocol. If that is the case, we could do the
split document thing and work on an extensible handshake.
