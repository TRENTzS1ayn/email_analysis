- Password authentication weakens TLS.

- The first time someone cracks a password used in TLS authentication,
  it will erode public confidence in the security of TLS.

- We aren't just trying to solve a problem for next quarter, we're
  trying to generate a security standard for the Internet that will
  stand the test of time.  I don't think we should be guided by
  short-lived customer requirements.

- The only security reason for including password auth in TLS is that
  it gains stronger security by having access to strong crypto in the
  export case.  I don't think we should include features this major
  based solely on brain-damaged US export regulations that will
  hopefully soon change.
