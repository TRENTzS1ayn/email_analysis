  I totaly agree here.  Password authentication is too problemsome I believe.

  True.  Some of these customer requirnments however will be long
term and should be reviewed with that in mind.  I am an advocate
of looking long term myself.  I also believe that some of the precieved
short term customer requirnments do need attention however, otherwise
we will have a hard time achieving the long term goals.

  I hope you are right here, Tom.  I am not so sure that those regulations
will change all that soon.  In the interum however it seems necessary to
address password auth, for the short term.  I don't see how this should or would
inpune TLS in any really meaningfull way, long term.

Reguards,
