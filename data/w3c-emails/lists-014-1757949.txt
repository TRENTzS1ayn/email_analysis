You are quite correct.  However, short term customer requirements for
password authentication can be met by using existing authentication
mechanisms in existing protocols.  There is no need to add a mechanism
to TLS when all existing protocols already have a password mechanims.

Even if you think we'll be limited to 40-bit for export forever, do you
really believe that any password scheme is going to provide better than
40 bits worth of security for authentication?  If you can remember a
password with 40 bits of entropy then you have a better memory than I
do.

As to the lifting of export restrictions, the White House is already
talking about raising the limit to 56 bits, and there is legislation
pending that would lift export restrictions altogether.  I feel very
strongly that an international standard should not be burdened with
major features with such substantial security implications for reasons
of local governmental policy.
