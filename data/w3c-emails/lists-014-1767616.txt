  I realize that.  But my concern is not just that we may need to consider
adding it to TLS for those customers whom believe in that mechanism, all
be it not necessary, possibly.  Again I still believe that a "Common"
Protocol interface well featured would go a long ways in solving or
addressing some short term problems at teh very least.  Extensions to that
interface for enhancments to existiing or possably new protocols, would also
project a method of achieving long term desires here.  Don't you think this
makes some sense?

  No of course not.  I couldn't remember much more than 10! ;)  But is it
really necessary to remember.  I can be pluged into the login procedure.

  56 bits is a total waste of time in my opinion.  It wouldn't take much more
than 3 seconds to break that!  Without at least 128 bits being approved for
export international companies will not support commerce for long on the 
net.  In addition, even 128 bit in my humble opinion is a bit short of what
I would like to see.  

  With reguard to what you say reguarding local gov. policy, I am not quite
clear as to what you mean here?  Explain please, ok?
