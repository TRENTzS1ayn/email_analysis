Seems to me that's only if you assume the best way to secure password
auth is to just encrypt the password, as opposed to using other
more sophisticated methods.  It also is true only if you're willing
to accept authentication that is dependent upon the security of
the encryption; some people feel this is undesrable for reasons
having nothing to do with export regulations.
