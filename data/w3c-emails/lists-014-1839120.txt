Frankly, I'm baffled by this assertion.  Yes, SSL v3 is somewhat more
complex than some other security protocols, but I don't think it is
particularly resistant to analysis.  Bruce Schneier and David Wagner
have performed an analysis of the protocol, and their paper contains no
such complaints.

There is an obvious man in the middle attack when the server has no
certificate since client authentication is expressly forbidden in this
case.

Yes, Schneier and Wagner also suggested the use of "ad hoc MAC
algorithms" was to be discouraged.  This is certainly one area in which
SSL v3 could be improved.

SSL does use X.509v3 certificates.  What kind of different
authentication mechanisms are you talking about?
