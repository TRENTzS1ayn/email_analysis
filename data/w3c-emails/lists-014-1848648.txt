No, you should certainly do something more than just send the password
encrypted.  You should avoid sending the password at all, encrypted or
otherwise.  Some sort of challenge/response mechanism would be
appropriate, but you are protected from eavesdroppers if you encrypt
the data.

Do you suggest that the encryption (even 40-bit) is the weak link in
this scheme?  I don't think so.  While there may be some advantages to
be gained by moving the dependency up to the security of the key
exchange from that of the bulk cipher, I don't think they outweigh the
disadvantages.
