There is already an existing mechanism that allows compatibility between
versions.  Rather than providing an extension mechanism that will just
encourage fragmentation of the protocol, I'd rather see us achieve
consensus on useful features and include them in future revisions.

The main distinction I've heard between password authentication and
public key crypto authentication is that a password can be carried
in your head.  If you're using a floppy or other hardware token to
transport your password, why not just use it to transport your private
key?

I agree with you that 56 bits is a very small step, and provides only
slightly more security than 40.  However, it does indicate that times
may be changing and we should not view current US export policy as set
in stone.

The IETF is an international standards organization.  Should we design
our protocols to conform to US policy?  French policy?  Japanese policy?
I think not.  We should design TLS to be as secure as possible.
