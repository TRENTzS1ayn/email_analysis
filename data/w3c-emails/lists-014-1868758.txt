True.  I'm clearly misunderstanding you then.  You said previously:

I assumed the password mechanisms that you meant there were
cleartext ones, not more sophisticated ones based on challenge-response
or keyed hashes or anything else.  Was I wrong?

I believe there is a need to add a mechanism to TLS because, while all
existing protocols have password mechanisms, they're lousy ones.
