Sort of.  They're cleartext unless the entire exchange is protected
by TLS.  Then they're encrypted in whatever ciphersuite TLS
negotiated.  Obviously when you are negotiating use/non-use
of TLS in an existing protocol, you must start TLS before
sending the username/password.

The only advantage to embedding passwords is being able to
use "non-export" encryption on the password, _IF_ the protocol
is designed so that no one can use the password field to
exchange "random data".  If I can write an app to use
TLS/password auth to send words (say as "login attempts")
of my own choosing under strong encryption, the NSA will not
allow export of the scheme.  I have not reviewed the latest
TLS password proposal, so I do not know if it will meet
the NSA's requirements.  Has anyone asked them yet?

In any case, I agree with Tom that we should not be designing
the TLS protocol to meet the US crypto policy flavor-of-the-month.
Besides the fact that they can change it on any political
whim, rendering our work invalid, TLS is an international
standard.
