Surely you aren't proposing that the CA would have your private key?

Of course it's not acceptable.  It won't be acceptable until there are
no restrictions on crypto whatsoever.  Just because the current
political climate in the US imposes certain restrictions does not mean
that we should enshrine them in an IETF standard.

We should construct a protocol that is secure.  As an international
standard, we should not worry too much about anything any one country
does.  In France, cryptography is illegal.  What do you suggest we do?
