Thanks.

Yep.  But I think 128-bit RC4 is "good enough" for passwords
that change oftener than every 40 years. (see schneier 2nd ed. pp 167).
40-bit, of course, is not.

So, to sum up the arguments for password auth in TLS, the reasons are:

1. 40-bit export ciphers are too weak to protect passwords.
With password auth, TLS could use stronger authentication-only
crypto to protect password material.

2. it's "unhygenic" to send passwords themselves, so apps should
send hashes of them, possibly including a challenge.  Since someone would
have to re-write existing password-based protocols to do this, it
should be placed in TLS, to make it easier to do. 


Any more?
