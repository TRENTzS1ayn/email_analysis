  Oh no, of course not.

  Ok, I guess from previous comments there seemed to be some latitude expressed.
I believe that sometimes industry must lead government policies.  It is clear
that some political work is needed here.

  Right!  Not any ONE country.  BUt my suggestion is a colabrative effort
that would need to be orginized by all currently involved at the Corp.
level and a joint lab development facility be set up with other countries 
corp experts participatiing.  What do you think?
