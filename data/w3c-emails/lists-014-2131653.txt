No one is suggesting that complex extra features be added willy-nilly
without careful consideration of their security implications.  However,
to neglect to account for possible (and possibly necessary) improvements
in the protocol beyond those that can be addressed by versioning
(particularly possible changes to the first handshake message sent)
would be, in my opinion, sheer reckless hubris.  SSL 3.0 currently
lacks, and TLS desperately needs, a mechanism for incorporating such
improvements.   

Right now, most of the world still uses a completely inadequate SSL 2.0
client hello, and is forced to play weird nonstandard tricks with what
would otherwise be a perfectly standard PKCS public-key encryption, all
because of SSL 2.0's lack of extensibility.  Please, let us learn from
past mistakes.
