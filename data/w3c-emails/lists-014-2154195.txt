  There is a difference.  All these programs run on operating
systems.  They require the OS to run.  My point was that these
protocols MUST be able to do strong authentication in the
absence of TLS, therefore they are already solving this
problem.

  If we go down this road, we will have clients that want to
do https: with HTTP digest auth trying to communicate with
servers that want to do https: with TLS password auth and
no HTTP auth.  This will lead to interoperability hell, since
there will be two common methods for doing the same thing,
with no clear consensus.
