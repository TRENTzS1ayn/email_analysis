  I am assuming that SharedKeyAuthType is 128 bit here, correct?

  No, I agree with you here.  I think it would be much cleaner.

  Is this (Above) to be included or added to the current perposal?

  I guess you are infering that I have not read the spec.  Well I have, thank
you very much, David.  It is not clearly indicated weather challenge-response
mechanism is included, per say, hence my comment.
