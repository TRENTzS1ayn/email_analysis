Well, it has been pointed out to me that the latest SSL 3.0 errata sheet
includes the addition of just such a mechanism--to wit:

Section 7.6.1.2

For forward compatibility reasons, it's legal for a client hello message
to have extra data after the compression methods. This data should be
included in the handshake hashes, but otherwise ignored.

This looks to me like exactly what I was looking for.  Let's just hope
that the TLS editors are more up-to-date than I am.

When last I checked, it was still alive, but apparently someone killed
it while I wasn't looking.  Apologies to all.
