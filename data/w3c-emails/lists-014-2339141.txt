I too agree with this approach, which was proposed as far back
as Montreal.

In SSL3, we have "rough concensus and running code", if you
count the existance of the current implementation and the fact
that major interested parties have widespread deployment.

It might not be everyone's idea of perfection, but it seems
quite acceptable for a "TLS 1.0" iteration.  These other
discussions can happen for the next generation.

I assume that most people would agree that SOMETHING will
happen after the first TLS version, since this is not a static
technology, therefore presuming the existance of a post-TLS-1.0
standard seems reasonable.
