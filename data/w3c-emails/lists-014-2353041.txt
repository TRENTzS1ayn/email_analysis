Minutes from Conference Call on Cert Storage
10/10/96

Attending:
Christopher Allen <ChristopherA@consensus.com>
Robert Dickinson <bob@deming.com>
Tim Dierks <TimD@consensus.com>
Steve Dusse <spock@rsa.com>
Laurence Lundblade <lgl@qualcomm.com>

This group was brought together to discuss interoperability issues
regarding exchange of certificates and private keys between products. A
file format is desired which specifies the storage of a certificate, the
chain of certificates supporting its authenticity, and a password-protected
private key object. This should be suitable for exporting certificates from
one application and importing them into another or for native storage for
products which choose to adopt it.

The call opened with a review of some history and background:

There was a draft of PKCS#12 that was loosely based on what was learned
from the old Apple PowerTalk signer file, however, it was never distributed.

Microsoft has proposed PFX (info at
<http://www.microsoft.com/INTDEV/SECURITY/PFX/PFX019SYNTAX.HTM>). PFX
attempts to solve more problems than merely certificate transport, but it
does propose an ASN.1-encoded format for transporting certificates and
keys; this subset of PFX would be a candidate for solving this problem. PFX
drew on the unpublished PKCS#12 draft.

Steve Dusse at RSA Data Security said that they and Netscape have looked at
the PFX proposal and feel there is some value in basing a real PKCS#12 on
the bits-on-the-wire portions of PFX, but are not sure about the protocols
or trust model specifics of PFX. Microsoft is committed to PFX, and Steve
Dusse reported after the meeting that Netscape may actually have some
PFX-like interchange code underway.

Christopher Allen and Tim Dierks of Consensus Development define the short
term problem as "How do you encapsulate single private key, it's cert and
cert chain into a single package that we can interchange." They have seen
four different "signer" files: the original PowerTalk-compatible signer
file (which Mac specific); single file binary file formats; two binary file
formats (private key in one and certs in the other); and ASCII armored
files similar to what PGP offers.

Consensus is open to either some ASN.1 encoded object or some type of ASCII
mime-like file, and work with any appropriate standards process, but wants
to get things rolling.

Deming said that they are willing to support some type of
interchange/export file format, adding that this could be in the form of a
PKCS#7 mime type that contains the all the different parts. Tim pointed out
that VeriSign only provided a certificate (not a PKCS#7 object) for any
PCKS#10 requests, and thus Consensus' current ASCII armored format uses
those.

There was some discussion that whatever approach that was taken needed to
fit in with with Netscape and Microsoft's plans. Steve Dusse recommends
taking a look at the ASN.1 in the PFX proposal and base an interchange file
on that.

Ray Sidney says that a new draft PKCS#12 document might be possible in the
next 3 or 4 months.

Both Deming and Consensus were concerned with this pace as they are
preparing to release products now, and only require a
least-common-denominator solution right now, i.e. a single private key,
certificate, and a certificate chain.

Tim Dierks added that there is probably a sub-requirement to specify
a better standard for password protected encryption beyond PKCS#5 as it
stands because it currently only supports DES encryption.

The meeting ended with an agreement to go look at the ASN.1 of the PFX
documents, exchange some email, and talk again next week schedule
permitting.

P.S. Many thanks to Qualcomm for sponsoring the call.

FYI: Enclosed is a prototype ASCII armored file for Consensus' SSL Plus
beta. The descriptive lines are ignored comments; the format is just block
specifiers formatted as below wrapping base64 encoded ASN.1 data. It could
easily be adapted to MIME style wrappers, or support other base64 binary
encoded formats.
