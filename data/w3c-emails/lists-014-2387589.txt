I think that it is fine for us to start scheduling now for work beyond
December -- but I don't think it should stop us from doing what can be done
to get TLS 1.0 out that meets the state of the art.

I think the password authentication stuff should be on the schedule -- but
when you include the idea that there needs to be some implementation of it
(preferably multiple) before it can be truely a "standard", then deployment
TLS as a standard which does currently have multiple implementations
shouldn't wait for it.

I don't think it is a waste of time, nor "merely to rename it". Tim has
pages of notes and clarifications on what he has discovered in the spec,
and I'm sure that others do as well. The Fortezza descriptions in it are a
real mess. Getting change control out of the current authors hands will be
a huge step forward. It may even be possible to split it up in this
agressive time frame so that it will make it easier to manage change in the
future.

I think getting some incremental changes into TLS in those time frames are
a very good idea, and we should do it. However, it has been 10 months since
the SSL 3.0 spec was released, and 5 months since there have been multiple
implementations. The net is rolling fast and I'm on the side of moving
things along so we can do more work rather than slowing them down so we can
do more work.
