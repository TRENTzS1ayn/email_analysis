  Well we are in the process of implimentation in one case currently.  I would
agree that multipul implimentations suould really be done befor any decleration
for  a"Standard" should be made.  It seems though that getting that done
is really not doable without some extra help.  I would suggest that some
discussion, thought short, should be done along these lines as an "Aid", if
you will for achieving (Multipul implimentations).  If I read this right,
seems that this may be a solovable problem.

  This might be a workable approach.  But it does have some cordanition
problems.

  This is a tuff one here Christopher.  I would agree that moving along is 
usually best.  But I think some care might be taken in not puting out hurried
code.  If that can be accomplished with the WG you have now, GREAT!  If
not however, I think some momentum could be lost, not to mention 
credibility.   What do you think?  Anybody?

Reguards,
