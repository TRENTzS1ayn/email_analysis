Is it the expectation of the TLS work group, that any TCP-based protocol 
that listens on a well-known port, and now wants a TLS-secured version, 
obtain another well-known port for that purpose? 

Or are there other strategies that you could suggest.

For example, would it be frowned on to have a TLS implementation that 
dynamically distinguishes ClientHello from the (insecure) Application 
Protocol on a given port (assuming this can be done deterministically)?
