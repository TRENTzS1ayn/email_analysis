This has been suggested on several occassions, and I've been one of the
opponents to such schemes. The reason is in the last line Mr. Wilson's
proposal, the assumption. That assumption has non-zero risk in that it
might, under unforseen circumstances, result in ambiguious behavior.

To reiterate my position, I believe that a protocol (in the IP world) is
basically defined by the well-known port associated with that protocol.
To add an SSL layer to such an existing protocol is equivalent to
creating a new protocol and therefore demands a new (different) port
number.

However, I (and I don't think anybody contests this) believe that any
new protocol definition should make provision for switching between
secure and insecure associations.

I would also be the first to admit that my position is a bit of a purist
position. Still, somebody's got to represent the fringe :-)
