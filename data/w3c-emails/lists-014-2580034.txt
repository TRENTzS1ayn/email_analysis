Folks,
There have been several email messages describing what attribute
certificates are, but none which detail any protcols in which they're
used. Several scenarios have been mentioned, but nothing that I would
classify as a protocol. 
Has this been discussed? I haven't seen anything like this
in the archives.  Sorry if I'm retreading old topics. 

thanks,

ps- Is there a new Internet draft for SSL which includes the
errata?
