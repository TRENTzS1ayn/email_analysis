  Hi, this may be useful though it's not exactly what you asked for:

       We are currently developing a hierarchic distributed key
management and certification protocol that could be really useful for
Internet as it would not concentrate the load of key management on one
server. What is more, it does not cause thse famous "islands of
interoperation" because it can grow dinamically and can connect those
islands. We would like to know how can we propose it, or who can tell us
the way all the development of Internet Standards is carried out.

   Thank you.
   Antonio.
