Dear sirs,
  
   We are carrying out an opinion poll to know how the industry
evaluates Kerberos Centralized Scheme about efficiency and security and
how would you solve the problems (say traffic flow, KDC bottleneck, KDC
Security,...) that arise with such schemes. We also want to propose
another multilevel decentralized key distribution scheme which allow
efficient control, multilevel authentication security, complete
interoperability, true certifying authorities, not replicated key
storing and easy implementation. Would you please send eMail to the
address stated below giving us your opinion or asking anything else you
would like to know about us or uor proposal. Thank you very much.
         Trully Yours.
         Antonio Mana-Gomez.
