TLS working group members:

For personal reasons, I will be unable to attend the IETF
meeting in San Jose in December. After talking this over
with Jeff Schiller (Security Area Director) , I have decided
that the working group will not meet in San Jose. Instead,
I would like to review the outstanding issues on the mailing
list and reach some conclusions on moving a document
forward on the standards track.

I realize that this is unfortunate, and I apologize for
any inconvenience.

Win Treese
