 A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the Transport Layer Security 
 Working Group of the IETF.                                                


       Title     : The SSL Protocol Version 3.0                            
       Author(s) : A. Freier, P. Karlton, P. Kocher

This document specifies Version 3.0 of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL V3.0) 
protocol, a security protocol that provides communications privacy over the
Internet.  The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in
a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message 
forgery.                                                                   

Internet-Drafts are available by anonymous FTP.  Login with the username
"anonymous" and a password of your e-mail address.  After logging in,
type "cd internet-drafts" and then
     "get draft-ietf-tls-ssl-version3-00.txt".
A URL for the Internet-Draft is:
ftp://ds.internic.net/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-ssl-version3-00.txt

Internet-Drafts are also available by mail.
                                                
Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-ssl-version3-00.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.



Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
