 A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the Transport Layer Security 
 Working Group of the IETF.                                                

       Title     : Addition of Shared Key Authentication to Transport Layer
                   Security (TLS)

This document presents a shared-key authentication mechanism for the TLS 
protocol.  It is intended to allow TLS clients to authenticate using a 
secret key (such as a password) shared with either the server or a 
third-party authentication service.  The security of the secret 
authentication key is augmented by its integration into the normal SSL/TLS 
server authentication/key exchange mechanism.

Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-passauth-00.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.



Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
