I happened across the following quote from the Technology Preview of
Constellation  - Netscape's new netcasting and desktop-customization
technology. 

"Constellation will allow you to access your HomePort from any location
or any computer. You no longer need to be tied to your desktop to be
productive. For example, when traveling between home and work or between
multiple offices, you can enter your ***user name and password*** for
your HomePort and work with all of your information, just as you left
it, regardless of where you are or what type of computer you are
running. "

Given the reluctance of Netscape to support Passwords in the TLS
protocol, I am a bit curious as to the underlying technology Netscape
will be using for  password based authentication to your "HomePort."

Does anyone have any insight into this?
