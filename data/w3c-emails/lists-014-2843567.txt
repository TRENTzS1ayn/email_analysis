Based on our recent discussions about how the group would
like to proceed, my sense is that we want to make quick
progress on a standards track document. In order to help
this along, Chris Allen (<ChristopherA@consensus.com>)
drafted the following agenda for the San Jose meeting:

Monday, 9 December, 1530-1730

1530-1545 Introduction and background
1545-1615 Presentation of proposed SSL to TLS changes
1615-1645 Discussion of proposed TLS changes
1645-1725 Quick presentations on possible future work
(including shared secrets, Kerberos, IPSEC key
management, etc., may include others to be
determined)
1725-1730 Wrapup and next steps

Note: if you've sent a note about making a presentation,
you don't need to resend it. We're working on the details
of the quick presentation section.

Comments welcome.
