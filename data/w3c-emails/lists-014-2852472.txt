I'm just looking for some clarification.
- Is it the intention to move SSL 3.0 into TLS 1.0 "as is", with
clarifications to the spec?
- Is the hour of presentation and discussion meant for clarifying the
ambiguities in SSL 3.0 that Chris Allen mentioned in an earlier message,
also, does this include discussion about splitting the SSL spec into
separate specification documents?
- Does this mean that all decisions regarding draft proposals (Netscape's
authority attributes, Microsoft's passphrase authentication, CyberSafe's
Kerberos cipher suites, etc.) will be postponed until the next meeting of
the IETF?
