 A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the Transport Layer Security 
 Working Group of the IETF.                                                

       Title     : Modifications to the SSL protocol for TLS               
       Author(s) : T. Dierks
       Filename  : draft-ietf-tls-ssl-mods-00.txt
       Pages     : 4
       Date      : 11/27/1996

This document recommends for several modifications be made to the SSL 3.0 
protocol as it is standardized by the IETF under the name of TLS.  These 
changes primarily standardize various technical details of the protocol and
make some other minor modifications.

Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-ssl-mods-00.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.



Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
