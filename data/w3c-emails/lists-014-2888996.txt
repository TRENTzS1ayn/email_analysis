I strongly recommend that these be separated into 2 parts: those that
force a change the current protocol (bits on the wire), and those that
are clarifications of current practice.

In particular points 1., 2., and 6. above would make all current
implementations non-conforming. Do we have examples of interoperability
between the proposed protocol and existing implementations? Would the
version number be rolled forward?

I suspect that those at the meeting will want to treat these proposals
independently.
