I am revising a new version of the SSL-Talk-FAQ
<http://www.consensus.com/security/ssl-talk-faq.html> in time for the
IETF-TLS meeting next Monday in San Jose.

If you have any comments, additions, questions, etc. that you'd like to see
get in the next release, please send them to me ASAP so that I try to
incorporate them by Friday.
