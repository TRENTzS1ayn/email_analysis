I consider the break down of functions of ssl-talk and
IETF TLS exploder to be about right - TLS discusses IETF
WG processes (including implementation - whilst the stds track 
process is being worked - to maximise interworking) whilst ssl-talk talks
about  everything else around the periphary in a kind of all-comers mutual
support framework which is not normally overly competitive or otherwise
purpose-driven.

I fail to see why the TLS list cannot be used for discussing the
implementation of the I-D/ RFC etc and exchanging implementation and
interworking experience for the various TLS RFCs as they
evolve over time. This is quite normal. The first TLS RFC is unlikley to
be the last. Interworking trial feedback is vital to the IETF process,
so perhaps keep stds writing and interworking testing all together so
the two do not lose synchronization.

If one wishes to rename ssl-talk to be "tls-talk" for market confusion
abatement reasons, then,  just do it. Keep ssl-talk id around for a while
whilst list members changeover.
