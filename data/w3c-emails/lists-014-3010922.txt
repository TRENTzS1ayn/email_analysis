 A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts 
 directories. This draft is a work item of the Transport Layer Security 
 Working Group of the IETF.                                                

       Title     : The TLS Protocol                                        
       Author(s) : A. Freier, P. Karlton, P. Kocher, T. Dierks
       Filename  : draft-ietf-tls-protocol-00.txt
       Pages     : 66

This document specifies Version 1.0 of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
protocol, which is at this stage is strictly based on the Secure Sockets 
Layer (SSL) version 3.0 protocol, and is to serve as a basis for future 
discussions. The TLS protocol provides communications privacy over the 
Internet. The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in 
a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message 
forgery.

Send a message to:  mailserv@ds.internic.net. In the body type: 
     "FILE /internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-protocol-00.txt".

NOTE: The mail server at ds.internic.net can return the document in
      MIME-encoded form by using the "mpack" utility.  To use this
      feature, insert the command "ENCODING mime" before the "FILE"
      command.  To decode the response(s), you will need "munpack" or
      a MIME-compliant mail reader.  Different MIME-compliant mail readers
      exhibit different behavior, especially when dealing with
      "multipart" MIME messages (i.e., documents which have been split
      up into multiple messages), so check your local documentation on
      how to manipulate these messages.



Below is the data which will enable a MIME compliant mail reader 
implementation to automatically retrieve the ASCII version
of the Internet-Draft.
