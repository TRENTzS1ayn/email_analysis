I think this is a good suggestion, except that I would specify the contents
of the block data rather than using random data. I don't believe that
random data adds significantly to the security of the protocol, as any
significant communication will be well beyond the unicity distance; thus,
the verifiable plaintext of the padding won't aid attackers. The benefit of
using predictable data is that the peer can verify that padding is being
done as expected, which allows a greater rigidity around implementations,
which I believe aids security analysis.

If you'd like to avoid the padding data being known plaintext, you could
specify it in some what that it is unknown, yet verifiable. However, the
protocol should be strong against known-plaintext attacks anyway, as such
attacks are commonly available to attackers.
