One more protocol issue ... I've never seen an explanation about why
the "change cipher spec" record is necessary.  It seems like all that's
needed is the ability to flush the handshake messages which have been
queued, since I don't see any cases where the next legal handshake
message isn't predictable from the current protocol state.

Is "change cipher spec" as a record type an artifact of some early SSL
implementation, which might be removed in a "new protocol based on the
SSL 3.0 specification"?
