The intent is to consider some small changes to SSL 3.0 that
the working group believes will improve the TLS protocol.

The first hour is intended to cover the proposed clarifications and
the "small" changes.  My sense is that the first TLS spec would not
be separate documents, because disentangling things will take a fair
bit of time.

Based on the discussion so far, I think that the working group is far from
consensus on those changes, so I don't expect final decisions to be made
in San Jose. We can make decisions on the mailing list before the next
meeting, however, and I hope we can make some good progress between
the meetings.
