On the client side when setting up a new session (rather than
continuing an existing one) the handshake message before the Finished
could be a ClientKeyExchange, or a CertificateVerify if the
client was asked to authenticate itself.


However the changeCipherSpec message is there, and is an alert
rather than a handshake message, in order to make better seperation
between the record layer (which has to know about the change)
and the handshake layer above it.

Theoretically you could invent a new handshake protocol, and the
underlying record layer wouldn't care (and the code wouldn't have to
be changed) as long as your new handshake included changeCipherSpecs
at the appropriate time.
