If those handshake protocols are well specified in the way I suggested,
then having multiple such protocols would never be a problem.

They're already closely related; I can't see new ugliness coming in.

Code related to change_cipher_spec gets removed, and the existing
hook in the record layer (triggered by receipt of change_cipher_spec,
when conditions are right) gets triggered by receipt of a different
message (again, if conditions are right).
