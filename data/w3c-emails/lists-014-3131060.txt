It's there as an explicit indicator of the change.  Yes, it would be
possible to make it implicit, but for protocol purity reasons, we don't
like implicit things, especially state changes.  The fact that it's a
different record type instead of a handshake message is just a way of
making sure that someone can't send it in the middle of a handshake
record.
