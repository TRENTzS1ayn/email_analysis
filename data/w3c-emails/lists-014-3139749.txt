I'd like to hear more about this, perhaps offline.  I really do
fail to see how this improves layering.  A particular behaviour
is triggered when several conditions (knowable only to the
handshake layer, until it tells another layer) are satisfied,
and a particular meessage comes in.  I'm commenting that the
particular message seems strange.
