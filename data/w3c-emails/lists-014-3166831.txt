It's there for 2 reasons.

1) Hardware implementations.

Imagine a pipelined implementation of a TLS protocol engine (record
gathering, decompression, decryption). At the point that a cipher spec
changes, the pipeline must be stalled/flushed so that the new ciphers
and keys can be loaded (potentially in parallel) into that engine.

It is very convenient for there to be a simple test for the hardware to
make to know to do that stall (as opposed to having to understand the
semantics of the protocol).

2) Future extensibility.

Handshake protocols have been proposed (and I strongly suspect will be
proposed in the future) where some of the handshake messages will have
to be encrypted for security reasons. Having an explicit marker makes
implementations and analysis easier.
