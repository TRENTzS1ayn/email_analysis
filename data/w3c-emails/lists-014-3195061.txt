Phil,

  I assume from what you are saying than is that the verification is
a intragal part of the method of implementation corresponding to the
"Underlying engine" to provide the necessary transition at the proper
point?  Is that correct?  If so, than it would seem to me you are
right here, but I also think this could be made easier or, shall we 
say, more elegant if that could be done as part of the handshake
layer itself.  Don't you think?

Regards,
