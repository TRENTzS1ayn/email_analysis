We have a tight schedule for "quick topics" at Monday's TLS meeting and I'm
trying to pin details down so that I can squeeze a little more time in.
Currently the plan is to limit the time of each quick topic to about 5-7
minutes.

I've only received two copies of draft presentations/slides:

TLS Kerberos Presentation Slides/Ari Medvinsky and Matt Hur
Compression Support in TLS/Bob Monsour & Mike Sabin

Win and I have had people suggest presentations on IPSEC Key Management,
Shared Keys, Attribute Certificates, SSL/FTP, and some other topics.
However, I really need to see the presentations in advance to make sure
that we can fit them into the tight schedule.

Please forward any draft presentations to Win Treese
<treese@OpenMarket.com> and I <ChristopherA@consensus.com> ASAP if you want
to be scheduled in.
