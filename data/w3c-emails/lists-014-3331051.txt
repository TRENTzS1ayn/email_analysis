I think we need to decide what we number this thing.  I think this was and
will continue to be a point of confusion so I think it needs to be
resolved.  Here's how I think it should be resolved.  

Right now, the document calls itself 1.0, and the protocol it specifies is
3.0.

SSL also is called 3.0, if you look at the bits on the wire.

We have rough consensus that the modifications we are making will be
'minor', but I believe at least one of them (the MAC change) will cause
this protocol to no longer exactly match "SSL 3.0".

QUESTIONS:

1. Am I correct the MAC changes will cause this to cease to match SSL 3.0
exactly?

2. What do we call it?  I have a suggestion.  I suggest we make the label
of the document and the internal version match.  Furthermore, since we are
making a significant change to a field in the TLS Record Format
(TLSCiphertext MAC values will be calculated differently so an SSL 3.0 MAC
will not match, right?) I suggest it's not a 'minor' revision but rather a
'major' revision.  THEREFORE...

I suggest we call both the SPEC and the PROTOCOL "TLS 4.0".

Comments?  Corrections?
