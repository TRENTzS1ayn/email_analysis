The move to HMAC does change the bits on the wire (at least that was my
interpretation of <draft-ietf-tls-ssl-mods-00.txt>).

Whether the version number is 4.0 or 3.X is a minor issue in my mind. I'm
more concerned about how version negotiation will be done. Will it work like
3.0 where the most recent version is considered more secure? Such that if
both sides support TLS vX.X then TLS is used. 

Will TLS vX.X continue to support SSLv2 messages? The move to TLS vX.X could
be a vehicle to force migration away from v2.0. No?

Will TLS make no assumptions about previous "non-IETF" protocols and not try
to be backwards compatible with SSL2 or SSL3? (certainly there will be
pushback if TLS is not backward compatible with SSL3.0)
