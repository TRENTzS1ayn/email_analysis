Yes.

Hmm, I don't think this is a major revision of the protocol. 2.0 to 3.0 was
a major revision, 3.0 to TLS is minor in comparison. At most, it is a 3.1.

>Comments?  Corrections?

Basically I think that TLS is a 1.0 protocol -- it is the first version of
what we hope will become an IETF protocol (which requires we go through
proposed standard, draft standard, internet standard). The fact that there
is some bits on the wire in hello messages that will probably say "3.1" for
backward compatibility reasons has little to do with the fact that we are
only now officially going the first time through the standards process.

I'll not object if the overwhelming consensus is that it should be 3.1, but
I would prefer that the version number of the documents be 1.0.
