-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The TLS group covered two main topics at it's WG meeting.  A proposal to
take the latest TLS draft (Edited by Dierks/Allen) as the starting point
was offered.  It was proposed that this document plus a limited set of
presented changes be submitted for publication.  After some debate and
some advice from the AD, this proposal was agreed to, unanimously, by the
group.  The
next step for the group is to proceed with a working group last call on
the draft (with the short modifications list integrated.)  After this the
group plans to discuss changes to the base TLS protocol, as there are
several proposals now on the table.
