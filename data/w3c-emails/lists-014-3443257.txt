Chris/Tim,

  IETF guidelines are that unpublished algorithms are not to be
included in Standards-Track documents, but they may be specified
in accompanying Informational RFCs.  As a first step towards moving
towards Standard status, the SSL 3.0 Fortezza algorithm suites were removed
from the TLS 1.0 draft, however several other CipherSuites using
unpublished algorithms (RC2 and RC4) have not yet been moved out of
the main draft.

Separating the optional CipherSuites out from the Standard is a good
idea, and makes it easier to define support for additional algorithms.
Will the next document (incorporating the 9 unanimously-approved changes :-)
be in the form of separate drafts for the baseline standard (only DES and
3DES) and the optional algorithms?  Or will there be an additional revision
cycle before proceeding to WG last call?

I assume you will be writing the RC2/RC4 draft(s). Will you also be writing
the Fortezza draft or should someone else take responsibility for that
document?
