Ooh. He's right, isn't he?

I believe it, but is there an RFC one can quote to reference these
guidelines?

So the common denominator among (the tls doc) and (the common exportable
Netscape) and (the common exportable MS Internet Explorer) would
end up being MD5 or SHA-1 digesting, and 40-bit DES.

This is valid, and this is supported by N. and MS., correct?  

It seems to me that it would be worth making sure we don't write a draft
that isn't irrelevant to the (ahem) 'best current practice'...
