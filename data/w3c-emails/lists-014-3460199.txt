I don't know. I was previously advised that RC2 and RC4 were OK, as long as
there were alternatives, but that Fortezza was right out. I'm going to go
and check with Jeff Schiller.

Actually, as far as I know, neither Netscape nor Microsoft support 40 bit
DES. My belief is that the intersection of the set of publically described
algorithms, the set of exportable algorithms, and the algorithms used my
Netscape or Microsoft is the empty set. I believe this is a problem,
although not an insurmountable one.

If one doesn't restrict to exportability, I know that Netscape supports
RSA-DES-SHA and RSA-3DES-SHA. I don't have a Microsoft Explorer 3.0 that
runs in my office, and 2.0 doesn't tell me what ciphers it supports.
