Be careful here. The reason SSL used only MD5 for the final phase of the
export case is that we were advised that it might be difficult to get a
CJ for products that used SHA in that step.

I have a pretty good imagination. :-)

Another issue concerns the MAC for the Finished messages. There was MUCH
discussion about whether they should be constructed like HMAC rather
than the ad hoc algorithm that was chosen. The tradeoffs are fairly
simple.

   pro) Using HMAC is more secure (probably).

   con) The server has to retain the entire handshake until it
can compute the master_secret. The storage requirements
for heavily used secure servers could be prohibitive.
(Some information, e.g. the server's certificate chain
is probably constant across all handshakes; and that
helps a little.)
