There is at least one published description of an algorithm which
interoperates with RC4; see the 2nd edition of Schneier's Applied
Cryptography.  I suspect that this may be "good enough" for RFC2026's
purposes.

The first edition is already cited as [SCH] in the bibliography
(though there's a formatting glitch which makes both it and [TCP] hard
to spot).

RC2 is more problematic, but does anyone actually use it?  Deleting it
might make sense if nobody actually uses it..
