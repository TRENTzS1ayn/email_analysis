                 THE INTERNET SOCIETY 1997 SYMPOSIUM ON
                 NETWORK AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM SECURITY
                              (NDSS '97)

                          10-11 FEBRUARY 1997

            SAN DIEGO PRINCESS RESORT, SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA


  This fourth annual symposium will bring together researchers,
  implementors, and users of network and distributed system security
  technologies to discuss today's important security issues and
  challenges.  It will provide a mix of technical papers and panel
  presentations that describe promising new approaches to security
  problems that are practical, and to the extent possible, have
  been implemented.  We hope to foster the exchange of technical
  information and encourage the Internet community to deploy
  available security technologies and develop new solutions to
  unsolved problems.

WHY YOU SHOULD ATTEND

  The use of the Internet is rapidly growing and expanding into
  all aspects of our society.  Commercial organizations are coming
  under increasing pressure to make their services available on-line.
  This in turn is increasing the need for rapid and widespread
  deployment of usable and effective network and distributed system
  security technologies.  High visibility attacks on the Internet
  underscore the vulnerabilities of the Internet and the need to
  solve its security problems.  There is growing concern for securing
  the network infrastructure itself.  Recent trends in software
  distribution (such as Java and ActiveX technologies) have made
  certain attacks easier to carry out.  Privacy has become an
  important issue for the Internet.

  NDSS '97 will bring together researchers, implementors, and users
  of network and distributed system technologies to discuss today's
  important security issues and challenges.  We have selected the
  technical papers and panel presentations that describe promising
  new approaches to security problems that are practical, and to
  the extent possible, have been implemented.  Topics to be addressed
  include Internet infrastructure and routing security, security
  for the World Wide Web, Java and ActiveX security, cryptographic
  protocols, public key management, and protection of privacy.

  The symposium will have a positive impact on the state of Internet
  security.  You will have the opportunity to actively participate
  in the dialog.  Ask questions of the speakers, raise your important
  issues during the panel sessions, and let other participants know
  of your requirements, observations, and experience in this
  important area.  We hope to encourage the wide-scale deployment
  of security technologies and to promote new research that can
  address the currently unmet security needs of the Internet
  community.

LOCATION

  The Symposium venue is the San Diego Princess Resort, a tropical
  paradise on a forty-four acre island in Mission Bay, ten minutes
  from the international airport.  Lush gardens landscaped with
  hundreds of species of tropical and subtropical plants are
  always ablaze with color and perfect for themed group events.
  Charming pathways wander among sparkling waterfalls, across
  quaint footbridges and sleepy lagoons filled with water lilies
  and waterfowl.  A white sand beach curves around the island
  for over a mile, and the award-winning grounds encompass five
  swimming pools and six lighted tennis courts.

  Spouses and family members can catch a convenient Harbor Hopper
  for a quick trip to Sea World.  Plan to visit La Jolla, the world
  famous San Diego Zoo or Mexico, only 30 minutes by car or Trolley.
