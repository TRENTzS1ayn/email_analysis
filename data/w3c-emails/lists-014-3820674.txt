      Call For Papers 

   Second International Workshop on Enterprise Security

      June 18-20, 1997
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),
Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA

Co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and the
Concurrent Engineering Research Center (CERC) at 
   West Virginia University
           
                          
==============================================================================
Enterprises are increasingly dependent on their information systems to
support their business and workflow activities.  
There is a need for universal electronic connectivity to support 
interaction and cooperation between multiple  organizations.  
This makes enterprise security and confidentiality more important, 
but more difficult to achieve, as the multiple organizations may 
have differences in their security policies and may have to interact 
via an insecure Internet.  These inter-organizational enterprise systems 
may be very large and so tools and techniques are needed
to support the specification, analysis and implementation of security.

This workshop will focus on the problems and challenges relating to
enterprise security in inter-organizational systems. We aim to bring
together principal players from both the internetwork and enterprise
security community and will provide plenty of time for discussion.   Topics
to be addressed include:

- Internet/Intranet security
        - Security infrastructure and protocols
- Java Security
- Specifying and Analyzing Enterprise Security Policy
        - Role-Based Access Control
        - Supporting enterprise security over the Internet
        - Conflicts and harmonization of inter- and intra-organizational
             Security
        - Distributed Database Security
        - Secure Transactions
        - Security in Workflow Process
        - Object-Oriented and CORBA Security
        - Secure Applications and Environments
        - Integrating Heterogeneous Security Environments
        - Managing inter-organizational Enterprise Security
- Internet Security protocols
- Security Algorithms

This workshop will be part of the IEEE Sixth Workshops on Enabling
Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprises (WET-ICE
96) organized by the Concurrent Engineering Research Center (CERC)/
West Virginia University.
