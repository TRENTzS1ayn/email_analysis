Hello TLS friends.

Many of you are no doubt wondering where the heck the TLS draft I promised
you is. Unfortunately, due to Christmas laziness and a double bucket-full
of other work, work on the revised TLS draft as discussed here and at IETF
in December hasn't proceeded as planned.

However, I believe that the amount of work remaining is not large and thus
feel that rapid progress can be made. I will be able to resume work on the
draft early next week. Hopefully, I will have a further status update (or a
draft) for you by the end of that week, February 7.

Thanks for your understanding,
 - Tim
