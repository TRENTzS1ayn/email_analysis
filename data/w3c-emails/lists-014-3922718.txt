Yea.  However in my experience writing two different SSL3 implementations
it's the handshake that's the hardest part to get right.  Getting the
record-layer stuff correct is easy in comparison.  In fact the
way I've designed my SSLv3 code has required getting the record
layer right before I can even get to the handshake stuff... I
think that the TLS spec strongly encourages this type of design.

So, I agree it'd be useful, but I don't think its useful enough
to offset the possible security hole it opens.
