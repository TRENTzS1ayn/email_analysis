Agreed.

The issue of the names is a legitimate problem that I wasn't sure that I
wanted to address in this email -- I've not even been able to track down
how new URL identifiers are even registered.

What do other people think we should do -- should we go ahead and
regularize the names? Netscape & Microsoft -- we particularly need to know
about your priorities in the above list.

I was avoiding adding too many new ports without developer commitment to
support them. If we give the IANA a huge number of port requests they are
going to punt and say "solve the problem by using one port" which is not a
completely unreasonable request, but we are looking for a short term
solution.

If you are a developer that is committed to supplying SSL secured versions
of any of these protocols, send me a private email. I will keep this
information confidential unless you give me permission to give out your
name. If I get confirmations, I'll add the requests to the list.
