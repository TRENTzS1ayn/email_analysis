I have strong interest in adding TLS/SSL support for telnet, login, and
ftp.

The reality is that you need to have separate ports unless we want to
force a major re-write of applications.

Of course, the preference would be to have TLS/SSL be implemented in
the protocol stack and be transparent to the application whenever
possible.
