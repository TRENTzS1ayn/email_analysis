forwarding some mis-mail


attached mail follows:
According to Christopher Allen:

    Why not have them all named <PROTOCOL>s with the non-regular name as
an alias ... also your list should have # comment otherwise it isn't in
the right format for inclusion in the standard services "database" :-)
The current naming scheme is inconsistant and really should be sorted out.

 https       443/tcp            # http protocol over TLS/SSL
 smtps       465/tcp    ssmtp   # smtp protocol over TLS/SSL
 nntps       563/tcp    snntp   # nntp protocol over TLS/SSL
 ldaps       636/tcp    sldap   # ldap protocol over TLS/SSL
 pop3s       995/tcp    spop3   # pop3 protocol over TLS/SSL
 ftps    990/tcp            # ftp protocol over TLS/SSL
 imaps       991/tcp    simap   # imap4 protocol over TLS/SSL

    You might also want to have snews as an alias to minimise impact
and also strongly recommend that people using the old name format change
their code to use the official name.

    I'd also think that you should ask for ports for the following at
the same time:

logins      992/tcp            # login protocol over TLS/SSL
shells      993/tcp            # shell protocol over TLS/SSL
telnets     994/tcp            # telnet protocol over TLS/SSL
gophers     995/tcp            # gopher protocol over TLS/SSL
ircs        996/tcp            # irc protocol over TLS/SSL
sockss     1081/tcp            # socks protocol over TLS/SSL

    If you want to forward this to the list for discussion then feel
free to do so ... however I don't think discussion is required as most
of these are already in use out there (not on those ports [i.e. non-official])

Tim.
