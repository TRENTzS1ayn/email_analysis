I disagree that it's easy to SSL-ize applications. I added SSL to <a
commercial browser> and it was massively painful because of the message
negotiation that has to happen up front; this interfered unfortunately with
the non-blocking I/O model the browser was using.

Of course, now that I have the scars from this experience I feel I
understand exactly what I need to do next time I design an application...
