Of course the answer is yes.  That's not the issue.  I can also run an
X server on port 25.  The question is: "should I?"  If I run an HTTP
server on port 80, it had better start out talking HTTP.  If I run an
FTP server on port 21, it should talk normal FTP at first.  I don't
think anyone disagrees with this.

The question, then, is do we reserve special ports for protocols that
sit over SSL, or do we try to negotiate up to SSL after connecting to
the normal port?  If we do the later, I get worried about security.
