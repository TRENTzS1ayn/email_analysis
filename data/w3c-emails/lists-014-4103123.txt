Yea, there's more ways to shoot yourself in the foot when
you're negotiating SSL/TLS inside another protocol.
I think the problems are surmountable as long as the application
can notify the user (or some decision-making code in the server)
when attempted SSL/TLS negotiation fails.

The biggest drawback to seperate assigned ports for the TLS versions
of N services is the limited port number space below 1024.
Is there any reason (other than convention) for using port
numbers under 1024?  I know some filtering router "firewalls"
will need to be re-programmed, but other than that small problem
why not use ports over 1024?
