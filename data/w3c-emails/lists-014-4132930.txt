Even if we have developer committment, heck, ports below 1024 are sacred and  
a scarce resource.  We need to find a way to solve the problem by using one  
port NOW.  Has anyone done any work on reducing this tremendous waste of  
ports?

Why can't both service live on one port?  That's what we should be working on  
rather than a quick and ugly fix by simply registering all those port ranges.  


This current schema of allocating SSL alter-egos for existing services does  
not scale.

Best regards,
Chris
