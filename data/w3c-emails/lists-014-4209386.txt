A generic adapter piece like portmapper?  The problem with
portmapper (and family) is that it makes packet filtering to exclude
protocols very difficult.  That requires installing security
configuration tools on every machine on your network that offers any
service over TLS.  I don't believe that there are, or will in the near
future be, tool to effectively manage such groupings of connections.

On another part of the thread, standardizing on 'non-reserved'
ports allows daemon mode implementations to be run as a user without
being called from inetd.  If http worked on 8000, then there would be
fewer web servers attempting to run as root, and that would be a
security win.
