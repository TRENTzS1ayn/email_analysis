Time for this lurker to speak up.

There is a fourth alternative, and one which may be painful in the short
term but beneificial in the long term.  That is to define a mechanism to
define session-layer and presentation-layer protocols for applications that
allows for (almost) seamless integration of things like SSL/TSL,
host-to-host compression, and other enhancements to existing applications.

At least this should be explored.  If I knew more about existing practice
(and if my day job didn't steal so much of the night) I'd come up with some
proposals.  Maybe this is a good research project for a grad student to
look at.
