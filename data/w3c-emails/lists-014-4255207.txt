There is another drawback. If many services are secured by TLS
and new ports assigned for each service, then what happens when
the next security-technology-of-the-day comes along?

Imagine if the services listed in this forum were secured by SSL
2.0, SSL 3.0, TLS, Kerberos 4, Kerberos 5, and each service
given its own port. What sense does that make?

Perhaps the community would be better served not by
registering a new port for every service but by developing a
framework for each service where multiple security
technologies can be supported. There is precedent: several
services support security negotiation (e.g., telnet, ftp,
and IMAP) and extensions are being proposed for others (e.g.,
NNTP).
