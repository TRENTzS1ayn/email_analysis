Yea, I know that.

With server certificates, does it make any difference?
(remember in SSL/TLS the server always sends its certificate)

You still have to be able to prove, by using the private key which
is presumably kept secret & encrypted, that a server is
who it's certificate says it is.  The certificate is really
the authenticator, not the port.  Given the number of root
hacks around, having a service on a port below 1024 doens't
prove as much as it should.
