That model works very well if you can be certain that every machine
connected to your networks adheres to it.  However, that is not the
case.  The IETF and IANA deal with standards for the whole internet.
The reality of the situation is that relying for security on the the
assumption that all machines are good citizens won't work.

Besides, we aren't talking about cloning every registered port.  We're
talking about a few ports that are either already in use or will be
very soon.
