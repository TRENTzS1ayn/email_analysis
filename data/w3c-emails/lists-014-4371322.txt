Whoa!  Hold on there.  I should have said "None whatsoever, in
principle."  Those protocols already have ports reserved.  All Chris
is talking about is changing the names.

These, on the other hand, I would certainly not object to changing their
ports to be over 1024:

ftps        990/tcp            # ftp protocol over TLS/SSL
simap       991/tcp            # imap4 protocol over TLS/SSL
logins      992/tcp            # login protocol over TLS/SSL
shells      993/tcp            # shell protocol over TLS/SSL
telnets     994/tcp            # telnet protocol over TLS/SSL
gophers     995/tcp            # gopher protocol over TLS/SSL
ircs        996/tcp            # irc protocol over TLS/SSL
sockss     1081/tcp            # socks protocol over TLS/SSL
