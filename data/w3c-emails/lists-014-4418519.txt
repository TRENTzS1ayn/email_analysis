Hell, no, not another portmapper ;-).

What I had in mind is a generic interface which attempts to negotiate SSL at  
a given, existing port, in such a way that if it fails it will use non-SSL  
traditional style, if it succeeds (meaning: the other end is SSL aware), it  
will initiate an SSL style session.

You don't need/want a portmapper to do that.  You don't concentrate all SSL  
services through one multiplexer, but rather multiplex SSL and non-SSL on a  
per service level.

SSL isn't really a new service, it is just a variety of an already existing service.
