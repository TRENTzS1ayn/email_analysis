   Such as?

- broken clients that predate the negotiation protocol that manage to 
  accidentally trip the negotiation sequence, but obviously can't
  complete it.
- servers that predate the negotiation protocol that react badly
  to clients trying to get a secure connection.

   Would you mind sharing what you have in mind as an insurmountable 
   show stopper?

- Some protocols may because of their very nature may leave no 
  room for escape mechanisms to substitute a different sub-application
  layer protocol.
- If it was really easy, some really smart person out there might
  have been able to at least describe it by now. It's usually safer to
  think of software problems as hard until demonstrated to be easy, not the
  other way around.
