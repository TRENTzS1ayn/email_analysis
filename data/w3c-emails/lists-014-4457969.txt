Earlier threads on this list seem to have focused debate on
weak methods for password/passphrase/shared-secret authentication.

Methods that are immune to unconstrained dictionary attack
have been around since 1992, from Bellovin & Merritt's EKE family
of protocols, to the SPEKE method developed by myself.
I find it curious that the debate has settled down upon
demonstrably weaker alternatives, as in the current drafts.

I would suggest that the passauth-00.txt "Addition of
Shared Key Authentication" document be modified to use
strong password authentication.  Presenting weak password
authentication as an alternative to strong public-key
methods seems sloppy.

I really prefer the combination of strong public-key AND
strong memorizable passwords, as two independent factors for
authentication, but that's probably asking for a bit much at
this point.
