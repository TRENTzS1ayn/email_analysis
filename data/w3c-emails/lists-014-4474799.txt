Begging your pardon,  but Thawte's strategy is entirely global.  Also,
because we are based outside the US,  the only way we would consider
escrow is if the US government explicitly banned the use of non-escrow
keys within the US - an unlikely proposition.

As soon as it's possible to conduct quality checks free,  there will be
quality free certs.  Certification should not be an expensive thing at
all.  We don't think so.

Also,  I think we'll see "micro-certification" become important.  By this
I mean the certification of small, easy to prove but also valuable
relationships,  like "this key is managed by the person at the end of this
email address".  Xcert, Thawte, Verisign, etc. all have projects that
explicitly or implicitly suggest this trend.
