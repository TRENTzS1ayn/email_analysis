I believe that the earlier thread contained implications that the
Bellovin & Merritt technique might be encumbered by intellectual
property restrictions.

Is the SPEKE method covered by any patents, B-M, your own, or others?

The One-Time-Password working group made it's distaste for encumbered
technology "patently" clear (sorry :-) at the December IETF - choosing
to reject both a method patented by Bull and an alternative patented by
Bellcore.

The TLS working group also expressed concern about using patented
compression technology from Hi-Fn (Stac), although it may be possible
to implement the proposed compression method in a non-infringing way.

If SPEKE is both demonstrably stronger than Dan Simon's proposal
*and* unencumbered, then by all means submit a draft for our consideration.
If it is not, it will probably fall pretty low on the priority list of
work items.
