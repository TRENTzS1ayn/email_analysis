Sorry, I missed where we got the assertion that TLS requires a CA.

As I understand it TLS requires a ROOT CERTIFICATE and CERTIFICATES.
[Assuming the identity-based case, not the anonymous case.]
Implementations can do whatever they wish to come up with the root
certificate.  I might deal with that by configuring my implementation to
use Thawte's root certificate and use them as a CA.  Someone else might set
up a CA for use inside a corporation or other organization.  Someome might
even set things up to self-sign or deliver a signature engine fairly
widely.  One can look at PGP as an example of this.

I don't see that there is any technical REQUIREMENT in TLS that I pay
anyone to act as my certificate authority.  I myself use it that way
sometimes but that's an implementation and deployment detail, not a
requirement of the protocol.
