Open debate must first focus on technical merit.
The IETF and working group members clearly feel that strength
comes first, and patent issues are secondary, as is demonstrated
by the repeated endorsement of patented PK methods (RSA, DH, etc.).
Otherwise all standards would degrade to second-rate technology.

SPEKE is not covered by the B&M patents, and B&M is not encumbered
by the pending SPEKE patent.  So at least you have a "second source"
which forces reasonable terms even without IETF's required
patent policy statement.  Both SPEKE and DH-EKE, like many good PK
methods are covered by the Diffie-Hellman patent, till Sept. '97.
And you're free to look for other strong methods that might
not be covered by either B&M or SPEKE.  So far I've seen little
evidence of a search for strong password methods in the earlier
discussion, perhaps because so few knew that these exist.

These are bad comparisons.  When EQUALLY STRONG unpatented
alternatives exist, of course you want to use them.  But
debate over whether or not to use public-key encryption
should never be BLOCKED by the fact that most good PK methods
(RSA, Diffie-Hellman, etc.) are patented.
