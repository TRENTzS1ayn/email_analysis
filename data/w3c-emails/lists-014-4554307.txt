Deployment is what it is all about, isn't it? What good is a
protocol if it can not be deployed?

Certainly a company can set up its own root certificate, but
what happens when their services access outside services?
Does each an every service accessed by the company going to
require their certificate or root certificate to be signed by
the company? Perhaps the company may think so but that is
unrealistic and unmanageable. What is realistic and
manageable is a trusted CA. However, considering todays
patchwork of CAs the problem is the same.

It will be interesting to see the effect when a CA recertifies
itself. Perhaps the bank vault where Thwate stores its private
key is robbed or obtained by legal means and the key compromised
(in the US the result of a discovery is often public). Probable.
What then?  At least with a CA infrastructure roots can be cross
certified (as in the case of PGP) and CRLs published.
