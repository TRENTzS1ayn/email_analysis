I know of no sense in which our shared-secret authentication proposal is
less secure than Bellovin-Merritt-style authentication.  The major
difference between the two is that our proposal only authenticates *one*
party (the TLS client) using the shared key; the other party (the TLS
server) must still have a certified public key to authenticate.  In
Bellovin-Merritt-style authentication, *both* sides authenticate using
the same shared key.  This second authentication actually *reduces* the
security of the protocol; for example, *both* sides (not just the
server) must guard against online brute-force attacks on the shared key.
 (On the "plus" side, it eliminates the need for one party to have a
certified public key.)

We decided that for the applications we had in mind, requiring that the
server obtain a certificate was not as problematic as worrying about
attacks on the client.  Of course, if people are very enthusiastic about
having Bellovin-Merritt-style two-way shared-key authentication as an
option in TLS, then I would invite them to write up a proposal in
Internet Draft form and submit it to the ietf-tls list.  I, for one,
would certainly not oppose its inclusion, provided it is incorporated in
as secure a manner as possible.
