That's kind of funny. spop3 and ssl-ldap both mention ssl :-)

Sorry for being pessimistic, please don't take this negatively, I
just have some questions, being an implementor and one who has
actually registered one of the above ports.

I guess the real question is, does this will this "obsolete" any current
products that do not do TLS on the above ports?

Is "TLS" available from any vendor, aside from the author of this draft?

What is the status of the TLS track? Are we commiting to a moving to
TLS for the sole reason of supporting a vendor's efforts to single-handedly
control TLS? What about if/when SSH moves into TLS? Does that
mean that the above must also support that?
