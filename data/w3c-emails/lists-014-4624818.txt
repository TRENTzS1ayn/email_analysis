Is Pat Richard enquiring re: what I interpret to be a grab for exclusive
power?  Is that "monopoly?"  Does that retain the inner-sanctum idea of
"open platform?"

Is winning a monopoly relevant?  Is this group not seeking the most
competent long-term resolution, irrespective of toolkit or patent control?

Should there be an additional period of time...2 weeks or a month, during
which to reflect on what is being driven home at this moment?

If this group were to express a desire for an extension of time and/or a
reconsideration of the proposal, who has the ultimate decision power?  The
individual at the outfit that will win the monopoly or someone else?

Is this the appropriate place to suggest a call for such a vote?  Do I have
the right to ask?
