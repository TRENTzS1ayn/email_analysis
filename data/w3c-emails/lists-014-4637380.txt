I think Chris is working off an out-of-date list.

It would if they don't do SSL.  There shouldn't be anything on
those ports that isn't doing SSL.  If something on those ports does
talk SSL3 then it'll be able to talk to implementations talking
TLS on those ports.  If it's doing SSL2 it might be out of luck...

Most people with an SSL3 in production have said that they'll
move to TLS when it's final.

Huh?  Who's single-handedly controlling TLS?  I count as major players
Netscape and Microsoft, with Consensus coming up.  But they're certainly
not the only people involved, nor the only people whos ideas have been
listen to.

That's SSHs problem isn't it?
I'd hope that since SSH _is_ controlled single-handedly then it'd
do the clean solution and negotiate the use of TLS internal to the
protocol rather than external via a seperate port number.
