Due to an undue number of meetings this week, all of which went
dramatically longer than expected, the draft isn't yet complete. However,
progress is being made, and I have reason to expect completion over the
weekend. I commit to providing status at the least by Monday at the latest.

For any nine-to-fivers out there, you probably won't even notice the
difference. Everyone else, go home.
