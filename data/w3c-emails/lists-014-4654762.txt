Whoa There--

The posting below deserves to be publicly answered by MS, NS and Consensus
*before* any action is taken by ietf-tls or anyone holding themself out as
empowered to act unilaterally.  

Is there not a potentially obvious opportunity to self-serve and an
actionable conflict of interest to the community at large.

What's the cost of one week, so that each of the three above can step
forward and commit in writing what their TLS inclusion policy will be?  

I'm just a potential applications user; but I can't believe that the
ietf-tls would run rough-shod over the fourth major member of the
"triumverate"... SSH. 

I'd sure like to hear what all four plan to do to keep the platform "open".
I am not ready to hand over my slice of the world to MS, NS, Consensus or
SSH until I know that baseline development opportunities remain open to
everyone.

The whole point is that this is for everyone, not for the quick or
aggressive.  Drop the bully-boy behavior and toss the week or two away until
the positions are stated clearly.

I may have missed those *expected* posts before; but meanwhile, I can read
"concern" on the part of one of the new players on the block, XCert.  

...And we all know that they represent the least expensive solution on the
block at the moment. :-)  And as to SSH, well they're even less expensive.

I encourage, support, and demand a clear answer to Pat's questions from the
folks alluded to in Eric Murray's most recent post (who I've listed above).

I expect the same from any and all others who by the Proposed Draft will
find themselves in a position of public trust to keep the internet "open"
*before* any further action is taken by ietf-tls.

Director, aZAP

BTW, any lawyers in this group?  Is this an anti-trust or restraint-of-trade
issue?  Is it class actionable?
