With that said...

It isn't clear (to me) the value to the community of registering
all those ports and developing all that code except, perhaps,
to the profit margins of the few. One of the most disturbing
comments of one of the proponents is the one "I'm a short term
pragmatist and a long term idealist". The implication is the
few want to get their product to market, without considering
alternatives or engineering good solutions, and those of us
with long term Internet interest are stuck holding their bag.
