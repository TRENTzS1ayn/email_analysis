I think that we have a practical problem to solve in
the short term. Even if we agreed that the "right thing"
was to multiplex applications over a TLS channel, or
that the "right thing" was to let applications negotiate
their own use of TLS, it would take a while to get the
necessary specs on the standards track.

Chris's proposal lets a number of projects proceed,
so I think we should go ahead with it. I encourage
continued thinking and proposals to solve the broader
problem, but I think they go beyond the charter of
this working group now.
