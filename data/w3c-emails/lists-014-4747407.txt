You can never undo this, Win.  Never ever.  Once IANA approves that
request those ports are gone in the short and long term,  because somebody
somewhere will still be running a secure server on one of them.

If there were even one shred of evidence that NS and MS had met to resolve
this "The Right Way",  and failed,  then that would be one thing.  But
there is no such evidence.  This is an exercise in stubborness.  I hope
the IANA returns this request to sender with a clear message that no such
requests will be considered until they are the last resort,  not the
first.
