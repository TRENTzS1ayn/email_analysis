Mark, why do NS and MS need to meet on this?  We, the IETF working
group, are the ones making the decision, not NS and MS.  Admittedly
much of the WG's discussions have been MS vs NS but I think we've been
getting away from that, and I think that's a good thing.

Why would you want to re-politicize the WG?

I fail to see the great conspiracy that you (and others) are alluding to.
Usually I'm first to see stuff like that, not the last. :-)
Could someone explain to me why calls to actually go ahead with something
(like we agreed to at the San Jose meeting in December) appear to
them to be evidence that someone's putting something over on them?

The alternatives are taking 6 months or a year (more likely a year) of dicking
around trying to A) get people to write drafts on TLS-MUX, and running
code ("concensus and running code" remember), then adopting that.
B) getting people to write drafts for negotiating TLS in the various
application protocols, then working with the IETF groups that oversee
those protocols to incorporate TLS into them. 
or C) we could forget about specifying ports at all.  However the likely
result of that would be a whole lot of people in the field putting an
TLS library together with their favorite TCP apps and just running it
on whatever port they have free at the moment.
