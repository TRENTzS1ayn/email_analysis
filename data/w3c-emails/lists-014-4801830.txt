That is correct -- the requests for additional ports that are included in
my proposal were *NOT* made by NS or MS. They were made by small developers
like you and I that feel that they have a niche to fill by offering a
secure ftp, irc, etc. *now* before the big guys close in over them.

I will also say that Consensus Development is *not* planning to come out
with secure ftp, irc, etc., so there is no conspiracy here either.

I have said that I would keep those who sent me product plans confidential,
but if you have products that your company wants to ship that you need some
ports for now, speak now, or risk that we'll wait another year before your
product can interoperate with others.

I've received quite a few private emails supporting the ports proposal --
it is time that you make your opinions public.
