I disagree -- we are setting a good precedent. Before now anyone could just
ask for an SSL port, a number of people have done so (including X.Cert, who
requested SSL-LDAP and yet is one of the people complaining here!), and the
ports have been issued by the IANA.

Now we are saying "let's make sure that at least two different companies
are committed to doing this" and "we know there is a long term problem here
and we have to address it soon". Both I feel are good precedent.

I have no problem raising the bar a little -- maybe requiring that there
are three rather than two companies committed to using the ports, or
requiring that their names must be public. But forcing the companies to go
proprietary or ad hoc use of ports is not a good short term decision.
