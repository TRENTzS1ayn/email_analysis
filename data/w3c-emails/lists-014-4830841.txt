or D) document the port assignments using some mechanism other than
the IANA.

I don't have any problem with people solving problems today by agreeing
on separate port assignments.  But I firmly believe that these ad-hoc
quick fixes should be "etched in sand" via an Internet Draft or a BCP,
and not "etched in stone" via the IANA.

I agree completely with Mark - the IANA should use it's good? (DOOM indeed!)
judgement and reject this request.  If approved, it can never be undone.
