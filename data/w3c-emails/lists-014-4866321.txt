On the other hand ... given the lack of comparably complete alternative
proposals, I believe it's more accurate to say that there's been a LOT of
inconclusive grousing.  (Much more than I like to find in my mailbox.)

We _know_ that using assigned ports works.  Alternatively, we've seen the
FTP proposal, and one's upcoming for Telnet.  That's the extent of the new
proposals.  The alternatives to assigning ports are incomplete, and don't
address the needs of folk trying to roll out secured applications "soon".

Seriously:  those of you who don't like the idea of assigning ports should
really be making complete proposals (deployable "soon") rather than just
asking other folk to design to suit your taste.
