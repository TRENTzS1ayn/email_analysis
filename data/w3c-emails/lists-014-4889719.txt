ftpsec-09 current has four organizations (that I know of, there are
probably mode) implementing using kerberos or gssapi.  Three of these
implementations are independent.  With a few exceptions which recent
version of the draft address, they interoperate.  I will admit that I
have not read the murray draft, but it seems poor to ignore an
existing, implemented propsal.
