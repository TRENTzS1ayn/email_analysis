However, that proposal doesn't address TLS, and the TLS-enabled
proposal is far simpler.  I see your point re Kerberized FTP;
I expect you see mine re SSL-ized FTP, which can also address
Kerberization through the proposed Kerberos flavors of TLS.

It does make sense to me to have a single FTPS protocol, but I do
feel that it's strikingly easier to do that by layering over SSL/TLS
than by requiring the complexities of the cat-ftpsec approach.
