I agree that ftp security protocol is better.  Are you going to tell
the existing shipping vendors to stop?  The TLS approach isn't all
that much simpler than the cat-ftpsec approach.  The devil, as usual,
is in the details, and both protocols have plenty of those.  If it was
that hard, it wouldn't have been done three times already.
