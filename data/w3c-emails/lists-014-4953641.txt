Considering SSL/TLS is being proposed for protocols other
than HTTP, no. Several existing protocols perform security
negotiation over the same port and predate SSL/TLS. There are
proposals that predate the SSL/TLS proposal and have their own
momentum, such as draft-myers-auth-sasl-07.txt, last
revised December 1996.

Finally. A reasonable technical argument to support port
mirrors, but only for protocols such as http. :)
