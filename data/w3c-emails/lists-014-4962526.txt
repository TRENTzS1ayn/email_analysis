Sure there is, you just send a modified request rather than 
sending the same request to a modified port. However this means the http
spec people who write the http standards, and all the browser writers who
make their own up have to be brought into the equation to change the 
world "just because".  It'll be a bit cold underfoot when that happens

Well, that and unlike telnet, it usually isn't supposed to be
used to allow high level access to your system :-) Notwithstanding
that It's already here and therefore would be damn near impossible to
change. That fact doesn't mean you need to do this for other protocols
(like telnet, ftp, etc) where you can easily do it with negotiation,
Particularly considering there are already implementations that will
do this for you.
