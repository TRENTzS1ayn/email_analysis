Ok.  All lemmings please stop this RIGHT NOW.  It doesn't work.  I've
gotten about 15 "UNLIST" messages.  I don't want any more.  This is
the wrong command, issued to the wrong address.  When you subscribed
to this list, you received a welcome message which explains how to get
off this list.  I've appended a copy.  If you want off, follow the
instructions.

******* Note from the listmaster: (listmaster@w3.org) *******

You have been added to the subscriber list of:

    ietf-tls@w3.org

with the following mail address:

    marc@cygnus.com

This mailing list is now being governed by SmartLists.
All administrative requests should be sent to the request address:

    ietf-tls-request@w3.org

Commands to the request address are processed automatically.
The desired command should be sent in the Subject of a mail message
to 'ietf-tls-request@w3.org'.

******* Administrative Requests *******

The -request mail address should be used for all list administrative
requests.  It accepts the following commands (in the Subject of an
e-mail message):

    subscribe         -- Subscribe to the list.  If you want to subscribe
                         under a different address, use a Reply-To: address
                         header in the message.

    unsubscribe       -- Unsubscribe from the list.

    help              -- Get information about the mailing list.

    archive help      -- Get information about the list archive(s).

In the event of an address change, it would probably be wisest to first
send an unsubscribe for the old address (this can be done from the new
address), and then a new subscribe from the new address (the order is
important).

Most (un)subscription requests are processed automatically without human
intervention.  Do not send multiple (un)subscription or info requests in
one mail.  Only one will be processed per mail.

NOTE: The -request server usually does quite a good job in discriminating
      between (un)subscribe requests and messages intended for the
      maintainer.  If you'd like to make sure a human reads your message,
      make it look like a reply (i.e. the first word in the Subject: field
      should be "Re:", without the quotes of course); the -request server
      does not react to replies.
