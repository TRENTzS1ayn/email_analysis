Agreed.

Nonetheless, if we do find a clean universal solution, we can at least make suggestions to roll it all up into one mechanism, and urge vendors by means of a standards publication to roll their products into this mechanism as well.

Granted, many products will end up supplying both.  However, I believe that all brains in said organizations aren't completely disabled because of their business interests (in fact, they shouldn't be for their success) and someone will adopt a sane spec, if we have one.
