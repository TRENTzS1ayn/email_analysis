(PLEASE don't send mail to any list to unsubscribe, or send mail to me, I
am not the list administrator. I am only sending this to help.)

>The discussion list for IETF-TLS is at IETF-TLS@W3.ORG. You subscribe and

------
>This mailing list is now being governed by SmartLists.
>All administrative requests should be sent to the request address:
>
>    ietf-tls-request@w3.org
>
>Commands to the request address are processed automatically.
>The desired command should be sent in the Subject of a mail message

>******* Administrative Requests *******
>
>The -request mail address should be used for all list administrative
>requests.  It accepts the following commands (in the Subject of an
>e-mail message):
>
>    subscribe         -- Subscribe to the list.  If you want to subscribe
>                         under a different address, use a Reply-To: address
>                         header in the message.
>
>    unsubscribe       -- Unsubscribe from the list.
>
>    help              -- Get information about the mailing list.
>
>    archive help      -- Get information about the list archive(s).
>
>In the event of an address change, it would probably be wisest to first
>send an unsubscribe for the old address (this can be done from the new
>address), and then a new subscribe from the new address (the order is
>important).
>
>Most (un)subscription requests are processed automatically without human
>intervention.  Do not send multiple (un)subscription or info requests in
>one mail.  Only one will be processed per mail.
>
>NOTE: The -request server usually does quite a good job in discriminating
>      between (un)subscribe requests and messages intended for the
>      maintainer.  If you'd like to make sure a human reads your message,
>      make it look like a reply (i.e. the first word in the Subject: field
>      should be "Re:", without the quotes of course); the -request server
>      does not react to replies.

-----
>    The most common problem is that you are attempting to unsubscribe
>    using an email address different than that with which you subscribed
>    Check with your mail administrator and make sure that you don't have
>    an alias or ".forward" file sending mail to you from another
>    address.
>
>    Another common problem is that the subdomain of your mailer has
>    changed, for example, "mail.consensus.com" has been renamed
>    "server.consensus.com".
>
>    In either case, sending mail with the "From:" line matching the
>    account you subscribed with should unsubscribe you from the list.
>
>    Please don't send mail to the general list to unsubscribe;
>    it will only frustrate you and the rest of the recipients.
