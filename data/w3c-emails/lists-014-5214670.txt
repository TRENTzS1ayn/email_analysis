I haven't received the time for the working group meeting
in Memphis yet, but I would like to call for any agenda
items, proposals, or requests for presentation for the meeting
now. You can send them to the list or just to me, and I'll
circulate a draft agenda once or twice in advance of the
meeting.

The Memphis IETF meeting will be held from April 7-11,
1997.  Details of the meeting may be found at
http://www.ietf.org/meetings/Memphis.html

Thanks very much.
