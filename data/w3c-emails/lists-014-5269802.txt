Chris,
  I noticed that the draft still contains references to ciphersuites
including the unpublished algorithms RC2 and RC4.  Of course an
Internet-Draft is just that, a draft, and can contain anything.
But if we are to have a document that will allow us to move forward
towards a Proposed Standard RFC, this will have to be fixed in
another iteration of the draft, before we can go to Last Call.
