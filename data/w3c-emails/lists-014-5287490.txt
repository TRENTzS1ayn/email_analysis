Yes, of course it is.  And "alleged RC4" is also posted on Ron Rivest's
web page.   But I'm sure Phil Karlton had a copy of Schneier when he wrote
the statement "There is no good reference to these [RC2, RC4] as they
are unpublished works" in the SSL specification.  This statement is still
included in the current TLS draft -01.

Perhaps you should check with RSADSI to see if they still regard RC4 as
an "unpublished work", despite the fact that it leaked out some time ago.
