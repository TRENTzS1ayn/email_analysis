I spoke to Jeff Schiller (area director for security), and
we think that the reference to Schneier is sufficient
for the TLS spec. Having the RC4 ciphersuite is important,
I think, because of its widespread use in SSL today.

Without a similar description of RC2, it isn't appropriate
to include the ciphersuite.
