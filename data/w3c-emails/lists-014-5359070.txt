From Schneier, p. 398: "The name is trademarked, so anyone who writes his
own code has to call it something else....RSA Data Security, Inc. will almost
certainly sue anyone who uses unlicensed RC4 in a commercial product.
They probably won't win, but they will certainly make it cheaper for a company
to license than fight."

RC4 appears to be a strong cipher.  The TLS protocol should clearly
not mandate the use of proprietary ciphers, but neither should it
prohibit their use.
