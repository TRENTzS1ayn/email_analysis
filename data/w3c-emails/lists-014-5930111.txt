This list (pics-info) was originally created to serve as a medium
for one-way announcements of PICS-related material to interested
subscribers.  The list has been inactive for well over a year;
instead, the relevant information has been posted periodically
on the W3C web site http://www.w3.org/

This list will be decommissioned effective immediately.  If you
want to continue to participate in e-mail discussion about PICS,
you may wish to subscribe to the pics-interest mailing list.
Send a request with 'subscribe' in the subject line to
pics-interest-request@w3.org.  That list is available to all
subscribers to post.  To date, the volume of mail has been on
the order of less than one per week though there will be periods
of higher activity.

Thank you for your interest in PICS.
