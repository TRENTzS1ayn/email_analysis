Guys,

you might be interested in a set of articles discussing the use of PICS
(or medPICS, respectively, see http://medpics.org) or other/similar
metadata technologies in the medical field, published in the British
Medical Journal. 

The main article is 

Eysenbach G, Diepgen TL. Towards quality management of medical
information on the internet:
evaluation, labelling, and filtering of information. BMJ
1998;317:1496-1502  
(http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7171/1496)

surrounded by three commentaries and one editorial.

Next year, I and a number of other medical institutions from around the
globe will try to get some funding from the EU (within their "illegal
and harmful content on the Internet" framwork) for launching a project
on assigning metadata to medical information on the World-Wide-Web.
Details will be posted on the medPICS-Website (http://medpics.org).



Kind regards

G. Eysenbach MD
Head, Unit for Cybermedicine, University Heidelberg
(at the moment still University Erlangen)


PS: note to the person in charge for the PICS-pages on the w3.org
server: Could you perhaps put links to the BMJ-articles and to the
medpics.org website.
