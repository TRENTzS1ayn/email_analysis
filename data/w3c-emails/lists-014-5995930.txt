Hi all -- I work for Maxum Development Corp., a company that builds MacOS 
Internet server software. We're about ready to enter beta test phase for 
our new proxy server product, which includes a module for performing PICS 
filtering. This product will be primarily targeted toward schools and 
small workgroups where Macs are still in abundance.

I've tested its ability to query label bureaus against the few 
publicly-available label bureaus I can find, including:

<http://pics.microsys.com/ratings> -- the "CyberNOT" list

and:

<http://www.sserv.com/cgi-bin/pics-serv> - evaluWEB's experimental server

but that's about it. The CyberNOT server has stopped serving labels 
lately, and the evaluWEB server is verrrry slow, and somewhat buggy.

Are there any other publicly-available label bureaus out there that can 
be used for testing?
