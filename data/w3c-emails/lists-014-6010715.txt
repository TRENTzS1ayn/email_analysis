Net Shepherd might let you connect to their label bureau for testing
purposes. Try contacting Ron Warris (ron.warris@netshepherd.com).

We have a label bureau at the University of Michigan PICS Incubator that
serves SurfWatch labels in PICS format, but it is for demonstration uses
only. Contact Ali Salomon (ali@surfwatch.com) at SurfWatch to ask
permission. If she says OK I'll send details on how to connect.

W3C has the Jigsaw label bureau which you can run (source code provided)
but you'll have to provide your labels to populate it. See
http://www.w3.org/PICS/refcode/

(When you say that you have a module for performing PICS filtering rules, I
hope that you have implemented this as an evaluator for the PICSRules
language. There is a reference implementation of such an evaluator, in
Java, available at the same URL: http://www.w3.org/PICS/refcode/ in the
"PICS Standard Library")
