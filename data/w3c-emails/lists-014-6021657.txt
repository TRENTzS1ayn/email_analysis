with long headers...)

Barb and I are finally settling into the Seattle area.  It took almost 9
hours to close the deal, but we finally own a house in Bellevue, WA.  We
should close on the house in Arlington at the end of the month and will be
all moved out of the Boston area by the first week of August.
