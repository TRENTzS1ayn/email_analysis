>Dear Jim

>I am a researcher at UNN at Newcastle in England and I am currently
>conducting a feasibility study into PICS ratings systems. The
>implementation of this system seems imminent and my personal feelings
>from the research thus far sugget that it is the front-runner in the
>scramble for regulation of the Net.

>I have conducted a study into the opinions of Internet users and
>non-users' regarding the shortfalls of the Net, and a summary of the
>findings so far suggests that people are largely in favour of a
>non-centralised system of access controls - though this must be
>malleable. Though almost all feel that the majority of 'objectionable
>matter' should remain on the Net in some form, there is however
>concensus on the issue of total censorship of 'extreme' material or that
>with no 'discernable positive merit' - though the specifics of what this
>may involve are unclear. This would seem to be one thing which PICS
>cannot cater for, and has been accused of being a 'half measure'. I
>would welcome your comments regarding this or any other aspect of PICS.
