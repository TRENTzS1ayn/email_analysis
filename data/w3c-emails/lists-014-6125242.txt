Netscape and SafeSurf Team Up to Protect Children Online

WESTLAKE VILLAGE, CALIF. (June 17, 1998) - SafeSurf and Netscape Communications 
Corporation (NASDAQ: NSCP) today announced NetWatch, an important new tool now 
available within Netscape Communicator software.  The tool allows parents to 
utilize the popular SafeSurf Rating Standard within their Netscape browser to 
set content levels according to their own individual standards.

"Netscape and SafeSurf have taken a significant step toward protecting children 
and free speech on the Internet," said Wendy Simpson-Cherry, SafeSurf's President.
"NetWatch is efficient and easy to use, making Netscape the "family-friendly" 
browser of choice for millions of parents."

Parents may configure NetWatch to accept content levels in different SafeSurf 
categories including Profanity, Nudity, Violence, Intolerance and Gambling.  
Parents also have the ability to block unrated sites.  The easy-to-use NetWatch 
interface gives parents a "point and click" ability to choose Internet content 
for their families.

"On behalf of parents everywhere, who have envisioned the day when the SafeSurf 
Rating System would be available as a standard browser feature, we applaud 
Netscape for making this a reality.  Communicator now becomes the browser to 
choose for safesurfing," said Ray Soular, SafeSurf's Co-founder and Developer 
of the SafeSurf Rating System.  The best part is Communicator doesn't just 
implement this feature as an afterthought, it does it like it really cares," 
he conculded.

"We hope this important step will encourage all webmasters to rate their sites 
and identify their content," explained Simpson-Cherry.  "Responsible Internet 
publishing is one of the most effective ways to avoid government censorship of 
the Internet," she added.

SafeSurf is an international no-fee parents' organization formed to protect 
children on the Internet and the rights of parents through technology and 
education.  After pioneering the Internet's first rating system, SafeSurf 
became a founding member and served at the heart of the technical development 
of the PICS specification, and has been instrumental in fighting government 
censorship on the Internet. SafeSurf's web site (http://www.safesurf.com) 
provides an easy-to-rate form which content providers may fill out to
create their own custom rating for their site. SafeSurf's site also features 
family resources such as safety basics for children online, links to filtering 
software, and the famous "Kid's Wave" safe list of entertaining and educational 
sites for all ages.

Netscape Communications Corporation is a leading provider of open software and 
services for linking people and information over enterprise networks and the
