http://www.w3.org/ -- 24 June 1998 -- The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
today announced that Daniel J. Weitzner will join the Consortium as
Technology & Society Domain Leader. He will be responsible for leading the
Consortium's global public policy initiatives and for managing the
development of technologies that address social and policy issues on the
Web. 

"We are pleased to have Danny join as Domain Leader," said W3C Chairman
Jean-Fran?ois Abramatic. "His background and leadership in the policy arena
will strengthen the Technology & Society Domain's role of addressing various
policy issues raised by the Web and developing technology tools in
collaboration with our Membership and the broader user communities world
wide." 

Weitzner has been at the center of Internet policy development since 1991,
both in the United States and around the world. As a lawyer, coalition
organizer, and public policy analyst with technical skills, he has regularly
faced the challenge of forging sound, sensible public policy solutions to
problems raised by the Internet. From the early-Web days (1992), he helped
develop the case for the initial commercialization of the Internet in the
United States. Since then, he pioneered the 'user empowerment' policy
approach for free expression and privacy issues. In 1995, he was public
policy co-chair of the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS)
Steering Committee. Prior to joining W3C, Weitzner was Deputy Director and
Co-Founder of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a leading Internet
policy & civil liberties organization in Washington, DC. 

"The Consortium is, indeed, happy to add Danny to our team," added
Abramatic. "We have worked closely with Danny and his colleagues at the
Center for Democracy and Technology and expect to continue to leverage CDT's
expertise in critical Internet free speech and privacy issues."
