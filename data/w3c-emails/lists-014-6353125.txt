I have less and less time to devote to PICS related activities. I am now
engaged in other research projects, on feedback and reputation systems, and
on uses of information systems in local communities to create "social
capital".

If there is anyone else who would like to step in as interest group chair,
I suggest that you contact Danny Weitzner (djweitzner@w3.org) or Ralph
Swick (swick@w3.org) at the World Wide Web Consortium. The main things that
need to be done right now are to update the PICS web site and answer
questions that arrive at the pics-ask mailing list. Of course, you could do
much more: your imagination is the limit. 

Even if no one steps forward, this mailing list can continue to function
for occasional distribution of information related to PICS.

Thanks to everyone for participating in the development and evangelism of
PICS. I certainly learned a lot from the whole process. I am proud to have
been part of promoting the idea of receiver controls rather than sender
controls (even if the U.S. Congress wasn't convinced), and to have
contributed ideas that live on not only in the PICS specifications but in
P3P and RDF as well. Thanks for all the memories!
