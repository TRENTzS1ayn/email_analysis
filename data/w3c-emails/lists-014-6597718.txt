  Okay! You say make an offer!  How about We take it all for$1.00

  Is that a good price for you!  You can deposit this money in your account and retire for the rest of your life!  

  How can I make you an offer if I have no idea what the masters or photos are?  Some businessman you are!!!  

  What you have is probably junk not worth anything!
