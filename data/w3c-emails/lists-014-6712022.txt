Dear Sirs,
         Many links are broken at <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/PICS">http://www.w3.org/PICS</A>,  here are the ones 
I am interested in, and could not reach.  
Lists of PICS-Compatible products and services links to link list, but HTTP 
Servers is a dead link.
Rating Services links to PICS Third-party Rating Services but links in this 
list are dead.
Label Bureaus links to a link list but Label bureau software: IBM's Server is 
a dead link.
Under the heading, General Purpose Label Bureau Services: EvaluWeb and Surf 
Watch are dead links.
Under the heading, Special Purpose Label Bureau Services: Microsystem's 
Software is a dead link.

         The Proxy Servers and NetShepherd links, among others, do work.

Sincerely, 
David Mowrey
