I'm representing Night Shift Auto.  We are a small business which manufactures  
a braking system for the vehicle being towed behind the RV, a tow bar that goes  
from the standard car mounted bracket to the RV, and a receiver height adjustment  
adapter (drop can be used as a lift).  Our products are mainly receiver style  
products.  Therefore, if you have a truck you will find our products useful.  
If you find that your receiver hitch is consistently lower or higher than the  
optimum necessary to accomplish the task then our drops are for you.  We have  
never tested a stronger drop than our own.   
 
If you are asking, "Why am I reading this?" 
 Your email address has been generated through an email search for RV related  
 people.  With us:  An individual can earn $20 for every productive referral  
 ending in the sale of a ReadyBrake or a Ready Brute.  The RVer looking for a  
 braking system, tow bar, or a drop hitch can purchase directly from us.  The  
 individual who has a vehicle with a receiver hitch could find our receiver  
 drops interesting.  The dealer looking for a solid American Made product can  
 feel secure in our, "Compete, but don't defeat."  retail policy.  And, the  
 Distributor willing to expand the knowledge of his dealers will benefit where  
 it counts most....the bottom line.
