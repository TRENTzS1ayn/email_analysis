9-11 Widow Files rico Lawsuit 

public signatures sought to support Investigation

PHILADELPHIA, Jan 6 -- Ellen Mariani, whose husband died in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks when UAL 175 was flown into the World Trade Center, has filed suit in a US District Court alleging Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld and other co-defendents had sufficient warning to stop the terrorist attacks but failed to either warn or protect the public. 


 

According to a recent CBS News, the Republican 9-11 Commission Chairman agrees:

 

9/11 Chair: Attack Was Preventable

(CBS News -- December 18, 2003) For the first time, the chairman of the independent commission investigating the Sept. 11 

attacks is saying publicly that 9/11 could have and should have been prevented, reports CBS News Correspondent Randall 

Pinkston....

 

Appointed by the Bush administration, Kean, a former Republican governor of New Jersey, is now pointing fingers inside the 

administration and laying blame.

Mariani's suit also charges the Bush Administration with burying evidence of its failure and refusing to release vital information.



Philadelphia Attorney Philip J. Berg, who filed the suit on Mariani's behalf, says the Administration must be held accountable. Berg launched the suit on November 26, and has since put up a website explaining the details of Mariani vs Bush, et al. The Bush Administration is currently trying to have the charges dismissed in court.

 

Public support is critical, says Berg, who has posted an online petition.  "We need at least a million signatures for them to take it seriously." He added that mounting a class action is also being considered. Concerned citizens are urged to read and sign the petition here:
