I'm posting you to ask that you take the time to join two of the GREATEST FORUMS IN THE HISTORY OF CYBERSPACE!!

The first list is an information and discussion list called "

http://groups.com/TheBigPicture2003/?yguid=132698554 " 

We are a  little over 2,800 strong now and growing rapidly.

Our focus there is discussing the GREAT issues in life that confuse and perplex most human beings. We give them answers on how to see the BIG PICTURE in life and live a much more richer and fulfilling life style; both FINANCIALLY AND SPIRITUALLY.

We are looking for things that we can do to make sure that your mental
health and self esteem remain high while you struggle to clear the cobwebs and misprogramming from your minds. 
We  promote networking between honest, ethical, law abiding business people.

The second list you should peruse is named :
"http://groups.com/NBCOCEPPLSI/ "


Be careful! Strive to be happy. Despite all of the sham, trickery, lies, drudgery, and broken dreams, America is still a beautiful place to live!




Support Our Troops
GOD BLESS AMERICA!! 


Honor our troops both here and abroad. Thank YOU! for keeping us all safe?
