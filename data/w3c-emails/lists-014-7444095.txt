Hello,

Are you still accepting comments? If you are, I will try to read the
PNG Proposed Recommendation [1] on Tuesday-Wednesday. Here are results
of spell checking.

Does this project require UK English? I have only the old Directives
Part 3 3rd edition which says: "The following reference works for
language are suggested: - for English, The Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary and The Concise Oxford Dictionary...." W3C on the other hand
uses US English [2]. I imagine it's bad form to point these out but
here goes (they weren't in the 1996 edition).

There is one "grayscale" (the rest are greyscale; either is fine).

Editorial changes says, "The document has been reformatted according to
the requirements of ISO." Is justified text required? I think unless
one has a fancy high resolution set up this is quite hard to read
justified. What is the source of the style sheet [3]? Unless it is
ISO, 'text-align: justify;' could be one huge rule for all your
selectors, and then be commented out for W3C.

Also I wondered if you had looked at the Manual of Style suggestion 
for references [4]. The titles ought to be the link.

I just happened to see the reference for RFC 2070 should read:
   Yergeau, F., Nicol, G., Adams, G., Du&uuml;rst, M.,
(note the commas)

More comments later this week if you would still accept them.
