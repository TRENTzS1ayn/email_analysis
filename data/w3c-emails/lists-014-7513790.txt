Susan Foord and I have had some offline discussion of her suggestion,
and as a result the recommendation is now, in the interest of clarity,
to change parts of PNG second edition, Clause 4.4, PNG Image, indicated
by the square brackets:

   c. Truecolor: ... The alpha channel may be represented by
      a single [pixel] value.  Matching pixels ...
   d. Greyscale: ... The alpha channel may be represented by
      a single [pixel value as in] the previous case. ...

   ... size of each sample, not the total [pixel size].

 to read:

   c. Truecolor: ... The alpha channel may be represented by
      a single RGB value.  Matching pixels ...
   d. Greyscale: ... The alpha channel may be represented by
      a single greyscale value, similar to the previous case. ...

   ... size of each sample, not the total number of bits per pixel.
