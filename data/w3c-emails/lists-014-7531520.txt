The "pixel value" phrase appears again in section 6.2, but the same
fix cannot be applied there, because the truecolor/grayscale cases are
combined, like so:

    b. Truecolour, greyscale: A tRNS chunk contains a single pixel
       value...

How about if we leave 6.2 as-is, but prepare the reader for it by
keeping the word "pixel" in section 4.4, like so:

     c. ...by a single RGB pixel value. ...
     d. ...by a single greyscale pixel value. ...

Also, I like the replacement of "size" by "bits per", so much that I'd
like to do it not only for "pixel", but also for "sample":

    ...the bit depth specifies the number of bits per sample, not the
    total number of bits per pixel.

I've added these suggestions to my own growing collection.
