===8<==============Original message text===============

I have posted a proposal for the "License" PNG keyword at
http://pmt.sf.net/proposals/proposed-license-keyword-20040417.txt

This message begins the PNG group's formal 2-week discussion period.
I will send a hard copy to the registration authority at INRIA.

Here's a copy:
proposed-license-keyword-20040417.txt

Proposed new PNG text keyword

License
   Either the full text license granted by the copyright holder
   or the title or abbreviated title of a published license, along
   with a URL pointing to it.  The URL should begin after a newline.
   Long URLs should not be wrapped even if they exceed 79 characters.
