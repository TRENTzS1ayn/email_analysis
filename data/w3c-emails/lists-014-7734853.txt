Dear Sir,

We would like to propose either a new tEXt keyword for the PNG
"extended" standard.

"ID" / "Id"

The basic idea is that each image can be "tagged" for easy reference in
a database. This frees people from the reliance on checksums and
filenames to identify images.

This will be used (and a couple of other international groups partnering
with us) to track our images by content and not filenames, which may
change. What we are doing is digitally preserving computer software
packaging (boxes, disk labels, manuals, etc.) for cataloguing and
archival.

However, we can see that this can have very wide application outside our
own use.

For us, the information will only be used by automated tools, and will
be used as a number format, but we can also see the use in it being
used as a human viewable alphanumeric keyword.

Please could you advise us if this would be a likely addition, and if
so, roughly how long it would take to implement it?

Thank you for your time,
 
Yours faithfully,
