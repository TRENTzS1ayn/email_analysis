OSF DCE RPC uses UUIDs (but do people use DCE?)

It is used in various LDAP implementations to tag attribute values in a 
unique way (typically to support server-to-server replication or 
client-to-server synchronization).  Some of these uses are now being 
proposed as standards in the IETF, e.g.,

   http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ldup-lcup-06.txt
   http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-zeilenga-ldap-uuid-03.txt

UUIDs are also used in COM (by Microsoft and others) as unique identifiers
for C++ interface definitions, etc.  And also in many XML based efforts (but
I don't know the details).

Understood.
