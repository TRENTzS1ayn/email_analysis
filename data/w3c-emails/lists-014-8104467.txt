I agree with Eric, it is an interesting approach but it does not solve the 
local file: URI problem.
If I first use local "file:" URIs and then publish a file globally with 
global "http:" URIs and an owl:sameAs reference to the previous 
local  "file:" URI it does not make the local file: URIs any different. 
They are still ambiguous in the global context.

For instance. the scenario where the user makes a bookmark locally into one 
bookmark file and uses a topic from another local bookmark file and 
publishes these files some time later to the Web would still have problems 
with the bookmark base solution. Furthermore, it would be impossible to 
know if we are talking about a same topic or a different one based on the 
local file: URIs if we would like to find it out.
