Anyone have any criteria for evaluating which of uuid-urn [1]
 eg urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6
or urn-5 [2]
  eg urn:urn-n:JtTCacwJ1e1N0yqTULRG7C1GLq8 or
     urn:urn-n:JtTCacwJ1e1N0yqTULRG7C1GLq8:4
will be better? We were planning on using the urn with a fragment
identifier to differentiate the different parts of an bookmark or
maybe even mulitple bookmarks in the same file. I'm tempted to use
which ever has more protocols using it that we would like to share
code with.
