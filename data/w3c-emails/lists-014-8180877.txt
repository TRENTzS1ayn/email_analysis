Thanks Eric!

I tested it today and something is still wrong. Not sure if it is the 
server or the Amaya version.

I do an annotation and post it to iggy.

Everything looks fine except that when I look the document info at 
annotation window it gives me a local address instead of an iggy address. 
However, when I close the annotation window the pencil icon disappears.

Did you change the way Amaya is supposed to ask for the annotations now? 
Maybe you could check with Jose that part.

Here is an annotation on iggy that I made with the 
/usr/local/Amaya/GTK/bin/amaya

http://iggy.w3.org/annotations/annotation/1083156542.499364

It looks OK to me in the query interface except that IE cannot open the 
body when I click the link (I think we had fixed this IE MIME type problem).
