Eric,

I think the problem is in my test Amaya version as I can see the annotation 
with an older stable Amaya version. (We did not have any problems with the 
DC 1.1 annotations even with the older servers just with the DC 1.1 replies 
that used dc properties in the query.)

I will probably need a corrected Amaya test version before I can continue 
testing iggy.

I did notice that in 
http://iggy.w3.org/annotations/annotation/1083156542.499364 the annotation 
is using DC 1.0 for the creator when it uses DC 1.1 for everything else but 
while we do want to correct that to make the conversion final, the queries 
should still work.
