Thanks Jose!

Amaya in swada works now. Tried both an annotation and a reply. I really 
appreciate you correcting this Jose. Too bad I did not notice it earlier.

We have been concentrating on bookmarks so maybe the bug creeped there in 
some Amaya version that we did not test because there were supposed to be 
no changes. And with all the test versions we have been using it was not 
surprising to occasionally have problems.

I wonder if  Amaya team would be willing to add a simple annotation test 
for their preversion tests to prevent this in the future.
