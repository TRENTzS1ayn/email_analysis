Jose,

I updated

http://www.w3.org/2003/12/20-local-global.html

to hopefully reflect what you want to do e.g. first just have a URN and 
then change the file to have HTTP URI and refer to URN with owl:sameAs. 
This means that if I have a local bookmark file I need to use Annotea 
knowledgeable tools for conversion before I publish it or to do the 
combined conversion and publishing.

I did not yet change the fragment URIs in the examples to full URIs as I 
think both can be used and they have their benefits. But that is an easy 
change to make.

Marja
