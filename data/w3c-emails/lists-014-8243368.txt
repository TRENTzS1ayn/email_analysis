This convertion is to be done intentionally by the server, if it
decides to assign a new URL. The client is not expected to do it at
this moment. This gives the freedom for exchanging the bookmark 
files thru any means, such as e-mail, ftp, scp, HTTP PUT, ... 
without having to go thru a specialized RDF store. Of course, if the
client does the convertion there's no problem, but it's not necessary
to do it to exploit a bookmark file.

I'd like to have the document reflect the state of what we're going
to implement rather than diverge. If you want to have those fragment
ID's, please make a case for them. Otherwise, it's better to remove
them if this document is intended to report on our modeling and
implementation choice.
