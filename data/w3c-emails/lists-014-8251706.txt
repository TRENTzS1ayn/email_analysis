We're using somthing around DC 1.08 . Less flippantly, we're part way
through migrating from 1.0 to 1.1 . The test server queries for either
1.0 or 1.1 (which inspired implementing OR which was great fun) and
generates 1.0. The amaya client is publishing annotations with 1.1 and
parses either 1.0 or 1.1 . After a reasonable deployment interval,
we'll switch the server to generating 1.1 for the DC data that it adds.
