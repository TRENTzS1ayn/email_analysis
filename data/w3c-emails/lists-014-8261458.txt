i think this has been addressed in the last three weeks (sorry for the
delayed response).

The server never presumed any association between / and /Overview.html
(ro any other index file, for that matter). This is document server
configuration that the annotation server can't know anything about. I
think Amaya may have had some special knowldege of the www.w3.org, but
I'm not sure.

That's not really up to the protocol doc to define -- that's the
domain of the domain of the HTTP spec:

[[ http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html#sec6.1.1
The reason phrases listed here are only recommendations -- they MAY be
replaced by local equivalents without affecting the protocol.
      Status-Code    =
            "100"  ; Section 10.1.1: Continue
          | "101"  ; Section 10.1.2: Switching Protocols
          | "200"  ; Section 10.2.1: OK
          | "201"  ; Section 10.2.2: Created
...
Reason-Phrase  = *<TEXT, excluding CR, LF>
]]

I had replaced 'Created' with '', which is technically legal.
That said, I had mercy and put in a reason phrase.
