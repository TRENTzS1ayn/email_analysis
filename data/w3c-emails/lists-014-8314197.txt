Eric,

It was NOT an iggy problem after all.

I think what happened was that Amaya refresh bug affected this too and 
while I thought you checked that my HTTP calls did PUT and POST with the 
replace flag you actually looked your own test results produced with 
corrected Amaya.
And that's why I could not see the replace flag myself when I looked the 
HTTP info.

I'll do a couple of more tests but I think we are getting ready to change 
annotest to use this code. New Amaya will eventually correct this problem.

Marja
