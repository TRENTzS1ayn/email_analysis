2004-06-12T04:11:12Z <ericP> iggy shoudl be a bit more opperational now
2004-06-12T04:11:50Z <ericP> have fixed bugs that keep it from working when retrieving annotations with no authentication
2004-06-12T04:12:01Z <ericP> now to fix the fact that they have no authentication
2004-06-12T04:12:09Z <ericP> (really, that it threw it away)
2004-06-12T06:37:37Z <ericP> done, seems to work for simple tests
