Marja and I have been working through a scenario allowing you to
create objects (like annotations or bookmarks) when not online, but
give then URLs as soon as you are connected. This approach might be
useful in any situation when you need to label RDF nodes but have no
safe way to create URLs at that time.

Take a poke at it. Let us know what you think.
