I do not have an opinion about which approach is better for the bookmark 
local/global ID problem.  But generating globally unique UUIDs is 
something that quite a few applications and protocols do, and the most 
widely used algorithm is described here:

   http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mealling-uuid-urn-03.txt

Sample C code is included in that Internet Draft.  The UUID-based URIs 
won't be pretty (e.g., urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6) 
but they should be globally unique.
