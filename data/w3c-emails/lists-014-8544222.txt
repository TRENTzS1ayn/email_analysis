Do you know what other protocols use this uuid scheme? That it is
specified (and even have algorithms and code) makes it appealing for
this application. But if there some other protocols that use it, we
may discover opportunities to re-use parts of those protocols as well.

We were looking for something more shapely, and with nicer colors, but
maybe if there's already code we'll forgo aesthetics this time.
