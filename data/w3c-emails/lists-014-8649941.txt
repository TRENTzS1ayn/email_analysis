Editorial comments on http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-WCAG20-20030624/
1. Under Priorities and Techniques  the following words makes the paragraph longer and  confusing. 
 "The main WCAG 2.0 Working Draft document does not include technology-specific 
implementation requirements or techniques, but... "
Stating that "WCAG 2.0 contains only links to..." will make the construction simpler and serve 
the purpose.
2.  Under Overview of Design Principles
Qualifying the word "ramp"  will drive the point in more forcefully. So replace
"In the physical world, ramps are used by bicycles, people pushing
strollers, and people in wheelchairs." 
with:
"In the physical world,  the creation of ramps for sidewalks was mandated to aid wheelchair 
users. But these help others too like bicycle users, parents with strollers and skate board users."

3.   Begin section "Overview of Design Principles"  with "User Needs". Move the paragraph :
"Accessible Web content benefits a variety of people, not just people with disabilities...."
to the start of User Needs.
After that say:
"Therefore, the overall goal is to create Web content ..."
This construction may improve the flow of the section.
4. Consider getting rid of the explicit Note in "Overview of Design Principles" and  restate 
it at end of list of four guidelines by:
"It may be noted that these principles apply only to Web content presented to a human reader 
and not to situations   where the data is intended for use by another machine not requiring 
any human interface like a structured database or metadata collection."

5.
Under heading "Designing Accessible Web Content", 
i. delete statement:
"This document is not designed to provide the background needed to
learn about accessible Web design in a thorough or effective manner for those interested in 
learning. Readers are therefore..." 
and replace with:
"Refer to the articles on Web accessibility produced by the Education and Outreach Working 
Group of the Web Access Initiative for a fuller discussion  of the subject."
ii. there is a link to E-O WG. This should be replaced with  a link to an index of completed 
docs put out by the E-O WG. 
6. Under the section for checkpoint mapping for WCAG 1.0, there is a  image: 
src=http://www.w3.org/Icons/detab
alt=change column layout
title=change column layout  
I am a JAWS4.51  user and  am unsure  what is meant to be conveyed by  "graphic change column layout" that JAWS reads out.
