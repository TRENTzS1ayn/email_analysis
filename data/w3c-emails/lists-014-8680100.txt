7. For checkpoint 3.3,  H5 heading is missing:
"Required Success Criteria for Checkpoint 3.3"
8. Under Benefits for 2.3: "Individuals with distractibility problems may not be able to..."
Replace "distractibility problems" with "tend to get distracted". That does not appear like proper English and may also be  difficult to translate into other languages.
9. Consider replacing all headings "Benefits" with "Who is benefitted?". The style in which the items are listed are more  appropriate for this interrogatory. Also all items under benefits appear to be user groups.
