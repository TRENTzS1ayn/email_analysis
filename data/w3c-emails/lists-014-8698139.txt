Hi,

I tell people about the WCAG about once a week.  I tell them to pay special attention to sections 6.1, 6.3, 6.5 and 11.4 since these point out the kind of accessibility problems I run in to most often and find to be the final "stopper" against accessing a site and retreiving information/files and whatever.
If WCAG 2.0 shall be published, it should definitely have a section about this kind of problems, and that section should be a part of the "CORE".  WCAG 1.0 correctly states sections 6.1-3 as priority 1.  WCAG 2.0 should do the same.  Section 4.2 should not be removed but rather reflect the content of WCAG 1.0 sections 6 and 11.4.  Being as explicit as in WCAG 1.0 is quite important if you want developers to pay any attention to these issues.

It seems that (http://www.learningdifficulty.org/develop/w3c-scripts.html) is an attempt to deal further with client-side technology.  I hope you keep working with it.  For games and other toys, this is not that important, but when lots of sites start refusing you access because you can't let them open a popup-window with Javascript but relies on them providing a <a href...> or a submit-button instead of a script-triggered image, it is troublesome.  Sites without alternative navigation should not be allowed to state conformance to WAI.

Best wishes
