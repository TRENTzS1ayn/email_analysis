          Q1.  In general, is this WCAG 2.0 Working Draft easy to understand?

It is not trivial reading, but I found it far easier to understand than the 
1.0 guidelines.  I cannot even guess how many times I read the 1.0 
guidelines and frankly never did understand them fully.  I skimmed this 2.0 
document once, then read it carefully and understand it already better than 
I ever did the 1.0 guidelines.

          Q2.                 Is the concept of Core and 
Extended  checkpoints easy to understand?

Yes, but I found the priority level concepts of 1.0 understandable as 
well.  The advantage of the new system is that it does not need to set 
priorities on which of the extended guidelines is the most important.  I 
can also see that the new structure is at least partly responsible for the 
increased readability of the guidelines.  For what it's worth I like the 
concept of Core+ but recommend that a core+ claim list the extended 
checkpoints that are met.  Number of extended checkpoints isn't very 
informative unless it is nearly all of them.

          Q2a.               Is this an effective structure?

Yes, but I do sympathize with those who've mastered 1.0 structure and are 
now being asked to adopt something that really is radically different.

          Q3.  If your site or organization already uses WCAG 1.0, do you
               think it will be difficult to migrate from WCAG 1.0 to WCAG 2.0?

I'm certainly no expert, but it's obviously not trivial.  A lot of effort 
is required to provide transition documents.  Good luck.
