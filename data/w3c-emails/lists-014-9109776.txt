[Tom Martin is going through WCAG 2.0 with an editorial eye. This is the 
first in a series of messages that he sends]

>Separation into three layers is a good idea, I believe. It mirrors the 
>"separation of content from presentation" mantra. Keeping to 18 the 
>checkpoints for the guidelines is good, too.
>
>I was surprised to see that identifying data table headers is part of an 
>extended checkpoint. My experience with screen-reader technology (I use 
>WindowEyes 4.2) tells me that the ability to navigate within a data table 
>should be core.
>
>Anyway, that is the one matter of substance I noted. I will work over the 
>next few days to finish an edit of the draft and will send you a file when 
>I am done.
