Hello Harvey,

You made comments on WCAG 2.0 [1].  This email shows how the WCAG WG has 
attempted to address one of your concerns.  We will send a separate email 
for each of the issues you raised. Please let us know if we have adequately 
addressed your issues.

Issue 383 [2]

You said:
"Required for success of 3.4
Omit the ambiguous opening use of "Key" followed by "orientation and
navigation."

Use "Important" instead.

Best Practices for Checkpoint 3.4
Use consistent "verb first" style for each list item.  About half now are

passive:
... should be ..."

We believe this is addressed in the March 11, 2004 Working Draft [3]

Guideline was significantly rewritten for this draft - replaced "key" and
"important" with "components that are repeated"

Thank you,
--wendy
