Hello Greg,

Thank you for your comments on WCAG 2.0 [1].  This email shows how the WCAG 
WG has attempted to address one of your concerns.  We will send a separate 
email for each of the issues you raised. Please let us know if we have 
adequately addressed your issues.

Issue 703 [2]

Greg Lowney writes:

59.     Guidelines 3.4 "Key orientation and navigational elements (such
as navigation bars) are generally found in one or two consistent
locations."

59.a.    [LOW PRIORITY] I recommend saying something like "(such as
navigation bars, page numbers, and section titles)" to avoid giving the
impression that we're only referring to things outside the primary
content.

This guideline was significantly rewritten in the March 11, 2004 Working 
Draft [3] and we believe we have addressed your concern.  Do you agree that 
the latest wording makes it clear that we are referring to objects outside 
of the primary content?

Thank you,
--wendy
