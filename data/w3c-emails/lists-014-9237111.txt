Hello Greg,

Thank you for your comments on WCAG 2.0 [1].  This email shows how the WCAG 
WG has attempted to address one of your concerns.  We will send a separate 
email for each of the issues you raised. Please let us know if we have 
adequately addressed your issues.

Issue 705 [2]

Greg Lowney writes:

62.     Guideline 3.4, "pages with similar function should have similar
appearance and layout"

62.a.    [LOW PRIORITY] But we might note that it's also good for
separate sections to be easily distinguishable, which implies not using
identical appearance; distinct visual elements such as colors or
graphics will help readers orient themselves, keep in mind which section
they are in, and avoid mistaking similar pages.

This guideline was significantly rewritten in the March 11, 2004 Working 
Draft [3] and focuses on organization of content rather than 
presentation.  Also,  Guideline 2.4 [4] has a criterion that we think 
addresses your concern about making separate sections easily 
distinguishable, "Different structural elements look or sound different 
from each other and from body text."  Do you feel these changes address 
your concerns?

Thank you,
--wendy
