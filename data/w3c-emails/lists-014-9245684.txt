Issue 706 [2]

Greg Lowney writes:

63.     Guideline 3.4 "the content has been reviewed, taking into
account."

63.a.    [MEDIUM PRIORITY] Isn't there some way that this criterion
could be made to have some impact or benefit? I'm afraid that, as it is,
criteria phrased this way will just be a checkbox that can be checked
without anyone doing anything! Perhaps, to have some benefit, the web
site could post a review of its usability and rationale for their
decisions to avoid making improvements. Something? Anything?

This guideline was significantly rewritten in the March 11, 2004 Working 
Draft [3].  Instead of a list of "ideas to consider" we rewrote the list as 
testable statements.  Do you agree that the latest wording improves the 
impact of the Guideline?

Thank you,
