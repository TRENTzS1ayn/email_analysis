Hello Juan Luis Lara,

Thank you for your comments on WCAG 2.0 [1].  This email shows how the WCAG 
WG has attempted to address one of your concerns.  We will send a separate 
email for each of the issues you raised. Please let us know if we have 
adequately addressed your issues.

Issue 595 [2]

SIDAR's WCAG2-espa group writes:

4)Guideline 1: Core Checkpoints: 1.3: Example 4

URL:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-WCAG20-20030624/#content-structure-separation

Example 4 in this checkpoint should also include a reference to
checkpoint 4.3
==

This guideline was significantly rewritten in the March 11, 2004 Working 
Draft [3].  The example that you referenced is no longer included so we 
have not made the cross-reference that you suggested.

Thank you,
--wendy
