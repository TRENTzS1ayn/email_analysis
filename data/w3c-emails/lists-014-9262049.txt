Hello Greg,

Thank you for your comments on WCAG 2.0 [1].  This email shows how the WCAG 
WG has attempted to address one of your concerns.  We will send a separate 
email for each of the issues you raised. Please let us know if we have 
adequately addressed your issues.

Issue 670 [2]

Greg Lowney writes:

13.     Guideline 1.3 Checkpoint 3 "Text content is not presented over a
background image or pattern OR the text is easily readable when the page
is viewed in black and white (no grayscale)."

13.a.    I think this belongs under 1.6 "Foreground content is easily
differentiable from background for visual default presentations" rather
than under 1.3.
==

In the March 11, 2004 Working Draft we moved the statement to the Guideline 
that addresses contrast in visual presentations [3].  This was a great 
suggestion.

Thank you,
--wendy
