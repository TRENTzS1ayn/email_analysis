Hello Greg,

Thank you for your comments on WCAG 2.0 [1].  This email shows how the WCAG 
WG has attempted to address one of your concerns.  We will send a separate 
email for each of the issues you raised. Please let us know if we have 
adequately addressed your issues.

Issue 671 [2]

Greg Lowney writes:

14.     Guideline 1.3 "The markup that creates the columns is separate
from the markup that specifies the logical structure of the document."

14.a.    [MEDIUM PRIORITY] I recommend clarifying the meaning of
"separate from." By this phrase, do you mean to require that the two
categories of markup be distinguishable, or that they actually have to
be physically separate? If separate, must they be in separate files or
can they be in separate sections of the same file? Personally I believe
they should only be distinguishable from each other.

Issue 672 [3]
15.     Guideline 1.3 "Example 2: a scrolling list of stock prices.
Current stock quotes are scrolled horizontally across the screen. The
data are separate from the methods used to scroll the text across the
page."

15.a.    [MEDIUM PRIORITY] So what is the recommended solution in this
case? It is not obvious, given that the server probably does not have
all the quotes at any one time, nor does it necessarily retain values
after they are displayed.

These examples are no longer included in the March 11, 2004 Working Draft 
[4] and thus these issues are closed.

Thank you,
