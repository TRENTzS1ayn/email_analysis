Okay, there's no tool to check for this. Question: Are there documented 
examples of anyone with photosensitive epilepsy ever getting clobbered by a 
Web page?If so, can you please point me to them, preferably from a 
reputable source (such as a medical journal) rather than just hearsay?

This guideline was significantly rewritten in March 11, 2004 Working Draft 
[3] to incorporate data from the ITC Guidance Note for Licensees on 
Flashing Images and Regular Patterns in Television [4].  While we do not 
have reports of Web content causing seizures in people with PSE, we 
coordinated with Professor Harding and his group in the expectation that 
Web content will become more dynamic and that we will see similar issues in 
Web content that we've seen with television.  Does this address your concerns?

Thank you,
