1. Under paragraph #2 of Priorities and Techniques, there is a  statement that reads:
"... but it will link to technology-specific requirements as well as technology-specific
examples and techniques (as soon as those documents are more stable)."
Is this repetition or am I missing  something here? Perhaps can be reworded to:
"but it will link to technology-specific examples and techniques (as soon as those documents are more stable)."
2. The term "Web resource"  appears in two places in this doc and needs to be defined.  Elsewhere the term Web content is used.
3. Under Conformance Claims, I am not able to understand  the difference between first and second points. The first  reads:
"1. In order to make a valid conformance claim for a Web resource, the resource must satisfy all level 1 success criteria for all guidelines."
In fact the next point states this in differnt words for level A without using terms like resource or content or Web page.
4. Refer to:  "In the physical world, ramps are used by bicycles, people pushing
strollers, and people in wheelchairs."
I think the statement can make its point more forcefully if reworded as:
"In the physical world, ramps are built (to provide essential access to /) for the benefit of people in wheelchairs   but they also benefit people using bicycles and people pushing strollers".
