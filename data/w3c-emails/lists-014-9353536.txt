It appears that  there is a shift away from accessibility for PWD to universal
access in WCAG 2.0.
Consider that:
i. Five WCAG 1.0 checkpoints including 3 P1  map to an extended   WCAG 2 
checkpoint 4.2 about declaring  technology/providing alternative content.
ii. WCAG2's  checkpoint 2.4 about navigation mechanisms maps to 13 
checkpoints of WCAG 1.0 some of which are P1 and some are P2. Checkpoint 
2.4 of WCAG 2 is categorized as extended and not  core.
iii. On the other hand, checkpoints 4.1 and 4.3 relating to language in WCAG
1.0 now have become  core under  3.1 of WCAG 2.
===

11 March 2004 WD we are no longer using the terms "Core" and 
"Extended."  With the new organization in the 11 March 2004 Working Draft 
[3], do you still feel that there is a move away from accessibility towards 
universal access?

Thank you,
