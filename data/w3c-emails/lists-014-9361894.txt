Hello Harvey,

Thank you for your comments on WCAG 2.0 [1].  This email shows how the WCAG 
WG has attempted to address one of your concerns.  We will send a separate 
email for each of the issues you raised. Please let us know if we have 
adequately addressed your issues.

Issue 374 [2]

Harvey Bingham writes:
1 .3  1. c. any emphasis -- should user preference determine how to 
distinguish among kinds of emphasis: e.g. by speech pace, voice, volume, or 
pitch shift.

Should the user be able to specify these distinctions? One option would be 
to let the user have the choice to enunciate some or all element names in 
tags. That general issue of user learning the distinctions among markup 
warrants careful consideration. How are header levels differentiated? 
Should the user have the ability to inject personal preferences? [These are 
suggested later in  Checkpoint 1.5 in the best practices.]

At a minimum, how does the user learn these distinctions? Should such
explanation be included by query for each document (or at least in some 
general guidance for a collection of similar documents -- with a common 
style sheet.)  A simple document naming and giving the presentation for 
each distinct  structural form of markup would be a useful aid, that 
probably should be included with each distinct style-sheet.

It would need to cover distinctions in list nesting of different kinds.
Also of table cell coordinate query and identification vs cell content.

At our 22 April 2004 telecon [3], the WCAG WG determined this was a User 
Agent issue and have closed issue 374.  Do you agree this was an 
appropriate action or would you prefer WCAG 2.0 to address this in some 
way? If you would like to see a change in WCAG 2.0, please propose specific 
language based on the latest draft [4].

Thank you,
