Wendy,
These comments and several others were in connection with  the June 2003 draft of WCAG 2. We have moved further from that point now to the March 2004 draft. I had inter alia, questioned the  appropriateness and use of  terms like core and extended too. I am happy to note that these have been addressed and my comments below are  not valid any more.
Thanks for the feedback.
