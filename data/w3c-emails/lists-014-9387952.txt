Hello Greg,

Thank you for your comments on WCAG 2.0 [1].  This email shows how the WCAG 
WG has attempted to address one of your concerns.  We will send a separate 
email for each of the issues you raised. Please let us know if we have 
adequately addressed your issues.

Issue 700 [2]

Greg Lowney writes:
54.     Guideline 3.2 "if contracted forms of words are used such that
they are ambiguous, provide semantic markup to make words unique and
interpretable"
54.a.    [LOW PRIORITY] This guideline is not clear to me. What are
examples of ambiguous contracted words?
54.b.    [COMMENT] If we're going to require markup to disambiguate
contractions, why not non-contracted words that have ambiguous meanings?
Other than the fact that it'd be a lot of work to comply, that is.
===

In the March 11, 2004 Working Draft [3], this was reworded to "The meaning 
of contracted words can be programmatically determined. [I] "  Does this 
address the issue?

Thank you,
--wendy
