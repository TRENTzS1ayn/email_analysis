Hello Kynn,

Thank you for your comments on WCAG 2.0 [1].  (you're familiar with the 
opening blurb now... :)

Issue 401 [2]

I tried mentally diagramming the sentence that comprises checkpoint 1.1 and 
it wasn't easy. I think this checkpoint has been overworked and needs to be 
stated simply and clearly. Note that this particular way of phrasing the 
checkpoint text makes it really impersonal. Compare to:

If you use content which is not simply textual, include a text equivalent 
for the parts of that non-text content which can be expressed in words. The 
text equivalent should convey the same function or meaning as the non-text 
content.

This is an extreme example -- from one style ("W3C clinical" to "Kynn 
chatty") -- but it is meant to illustrate how a checkpoint can be rewritten 
to be understandable.

Guideline 1.1 has been significantly rewritten. It's not "Kynn chatty" and 
still fairly "W3C clinical" but is it easier to mentally diagram? Does this 
close the issue?

Thank you,
