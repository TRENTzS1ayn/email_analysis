Subject: 2004 and they finaly have accessable content - nope - just another dream...


The entry points to sites displaying the wc3 logo are many and varied but main access to the public is gained through the url portals of http://act.gov.au or http://www.canberraconnect.act.gov.au.  They (ACT Government) also market them selves to be a portal which provides access to these documents displaying the new content ratings like http://www.legislation.act.gov.au for example.

The tag for the site of http://www.act.gov.au/index.jsp is :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

The tag for the site of http://www.canberraconnect.act.gov.au is :
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xml:lang="en-AU" lang="en-AU">

The tag for the site of http://www.legislation.act.gov.au is (the only site to conform to wc3 A content rating with a html page and little use of C++ programming like java) :
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">

Can you please make all sites/subdomains (two above) that provide access these pages with the A rating of wc3 do conform to the content standards as access is gained via them.  The use of wc3 logo's is not tollerated in this way and infact causes users to think sites connected together under the one portal would conform when infact they do not - the two offending portals make use of graphics so one is to belive a wc3 logo that does not apprear would be because of other factors.  I do not mind links showing a page is written to a standard but detest the way of which the Australian Governments' are using the logo's with sites that contain broken links, no automated email replys, and the list goes on and on.

The ACT government use subdomains to host content like http://www.legislation.act.gov.au displaying the A rating.  The fact is that the domain holder does not endorce the same standard, and thus how is one meant to access such clean pristene content via the garbage dump?  I do however hold in high regards the adimistrators that do ensure a standard is adopted accross web pages that they control - its a shame that the actual government its self is so waistfull with the money it gets.

My many thanks.
Regards,
Jason Robinson

Considering you (HRO) made statements in regards to web service provisions - Could you now also provide information as to why no standard was kept too for the web site LA Legal Aid ACT created in 2001.  I have noted some sites now have these logo's and I would like to thank them for ensuring the provison of accessible content.  However the portal that provides access to such content does not adhear to the same standards.  Any government site without this compliance is to be removed ASAP because your own guidelines state you must provide such access by the start 2001/2003.

This also continues into your use of email systems - Please provide an automated responce to all requests with alternate actions, and comply with the standards of web pages if sent as such.  This includes the AFP as a not delivered message is not acceptable.

Many wonderfull thanks again for spending all that money.
Regards,
Jason Robinson
