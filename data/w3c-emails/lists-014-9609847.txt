I am starting to design a site that I want to make very accessible. I 
have several questions that also reflect my difficulty in comprehending 
your presentation in these matters.

1. I understand that pop-up browser windows can be disorienting, 
particularly for the sight impaired. I am wondering if PDF documents 
which open in a separate "window" cause the same disorientation? Is 
there any recommended work around for making PDF documents user 
friendly for screen reading technology and the sight impaired? In 
particular, I am concerned about the ease of changing from the HTML 
document to the PDF file and back.

2. Could you provide several examples of tables are set up clearly for 
the sight impaired? I would like to see several examples of how one 
groups columns and rows logically. How do you associate table cells and 
their headers?

3. If a site has a top horizontal menu and a left-side vertical list of 
links and a right-side vertical list of links, do I need to create a 
tab index and what is the best approach? Is there some way that I 
should or could be assisting the sight-impaired visitor to scan all the 
menu choices before choosing? In the code only, can it be noted that 
there are three menus on each page...? Can you show me an example of 
this?

4. If I want to ask further questions on this order, where is a good 
place to turn for no-cost and expert advise or feedback?

Thank you for your consideration.
Pamela
