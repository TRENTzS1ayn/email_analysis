Please kindly accept my appology for intruding your privacy.I am 
Mr.Godfrey Ohiri ,an internal Auditor with Hallmark Bank PLC,Nigeria.I 
am soliciting your assistance to help accept ownership of $1million 
dollars in my bank which I discovered in discharge of my duty.This 
money arose as a result of unrecorded foreign exchange trading in our 
bank last year.

I have concluded arrangement for you to simply open an account with our 
bank and this money will be credited to your account,You may latter 
travel down to Nigeria or appoint an Attorney for us to sign Legal 
Agreement for managment of account or investment of this money 
preferably in your country.Looking forward to receiving your prompt 
reply.

Best regards.
Godfrey Ohiri.
