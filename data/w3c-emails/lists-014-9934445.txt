Web Intelligence (WI) has been recognized as a new direction for
scientific research and development to explore the fundamental roles
as well as practical impacts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) (e.g.,
knowledge representation, planning, knowledge discovery and data
mining, intelligent agents, and social network intelligence) and
advanced Information Technology (IT) (e.g., wireless networks,
ubiquitous devices, social networks, and data/knowledge grids) on the
next generation of Web-empowered products, systems, services, and
activities. It is one of the most important as well as promising IT
research fields in the era of Web and agent intelligence.

The 2004 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence
(WI'04) will be jointly held with the 2004 IEEE/WIC/ACM International
Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology (IAT'04
http://www.maebashi-it.org/IAT04).  The IEEE/WIC/ACM 2004 joint
conferences are sponsored and organized by IEEE Computer Society
Technical Committee on Computational Intelligence (TCCI)
(http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~xwu/tcci/index.shtml), Web Intelligence
Consortium (WIC) (http://wi-consortium.org), and ACM-SIGART
(http://www.acm.org/sigart/).
