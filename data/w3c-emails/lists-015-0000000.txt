Yes, skos takes the approach of expressing broader/narrower/related 
relationships between concepts. If we are to add what is effectively 
harvesting functionality to the thesaurus, then we would likely return skos 
encoded data as is, from which some client app would be able to build a 
thesaurus browser if required.

If time permits we may demonstrate how this would work against our own demo 
thesaurus service implementation. For example either by layering Protege on 
top of our service for browser-based views on the data, or developing 
prototype viewer implementations that we already have.
