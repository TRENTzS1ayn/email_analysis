Ah, right, that makes sense.

You might want to specify separately "number of levels up" and "number 
of levels down", or "up to the top of the tree and down three levels" 
from the given concept.

I wanted to make sure that people were not trying to impose some scheme 
of absolute levels (though this what the biologists do, labelling levels 
as kingdom - phylum - class - order - family . .  etc., which 
necessitates awkward interpolations like sub-order and so on).
