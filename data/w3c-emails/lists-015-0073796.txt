I just pulled this quote from the home page of the person who did the
portuguese translation of the SKOS-Core guide:

"People become librarians because they know too much. Their knowledge
extends beyond mere categories. They cannot be confined to disciplines.
Librarians are all-knowing and all-seeing. They bring order to chaos. They
bring wisdow and culture to the masses. They preserve every aspect of human
knowledge. Librarians rule. And they will kick the crap out of anyone who
says otherwise."
