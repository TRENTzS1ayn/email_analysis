I think I agree with your idea of separating the two.  Maybe what is
needed is another element at the same level as skos:Concept, perhaps
skos:Summary, that handles (b) and the current proposal for handling
(a).  Although the current proposal seems odd to me.  It seems to me
that you might want to have additional metadata associated with node
label array in addition to the list of concepts associated with it.
For example scope notes or other types of notes.

I guess I didn't quite follow that.  Yes, LCC, DDC, LCSH, MeSH and
others allow synthesising concepts, but those concepts are still
valid from the vocabularies perspective, its just that they have
not been *enumerated* as a standard thesaurus does.  So lets say
I convert DDC into SKOS.  What you would get is all the predefined
concepts defined by the Dewey editors.  If someone builds a class
number, based upon the instructions in the classification, then
they can merely create an skos:Concept element and within that
element use the skos:inScheme to point to the "official" base
scheme which defines the list of predefined concepts.  Any built
concept in LCC, DDC, LCSH, or MeSH participate in same BT/NT 
relationship established for the vocabulary.  So I seem to be 
missing something with your analogy.

You don't need to incorporate the rules for creating the compound
strings.  The "whole" compound string *is* the concept and there
isn't necessarily a BT/NT relationship between the predefined
part and what was composed.  The whole term should be taken as
the concept and its BT/NT relationship is to be taken in the
context of all the other predefined or compound strings in the
vocabulary.

I disagree with this statement on several fronts.  FAST is no
more amenable to SKOS than any of the other vocabularies I
mentioned.  As a matter of fact I forgot to include FAST in
the list of vocabularies that we will probably put into SKOS.
FAST actually doesn't treat LCSH headings much differently than
LCSH already does.  LCSH is already faceted!  LC may disagree
with my statement, but the simple fact, or facet, of the matter
is when we look at LCSH, which is defined by MARC21, the preferred
term of the vocabulary is specified as the 1XX field.  That XX
should be a clue.  Looking at the MARC21-A authorities format,
you can see the following 1XX definitions:

    * 100 - HEADING--PERSONAL NAME (NR)
    * 110 - HEADING--CORPORATE NAME (NR)
    * 111 - HEADING--MEETING NAME (NR)
    * 130 - HEADING--UNIFORM TITLE (NR)
    * 148 - HEADING--CHRONOLOGICAL TERM (NR)
    * 150 - HEADING--TOPICAL TERM (NR)
    * 151 - HEADING--GEOGRAPHIC NAME (NR)
    * 155 - HEADING--GENRE/FORM TERM (NR)
    * 180 - HEADING--GENERAL SUBDIVISION (NR)
    * 181 - HEADING--GEOGRAPHIC SUBDIVISION (NR)
    * 182 - HEADING--CHRONOLOGICAL SUBDIVISION (NR)
    * 185 - HEADING--FORM SUBDIVISION (NR)

To the naive, those pretty much look like facets.  The 18X are
used in building composed subject headings.  So the "real" facets
are everything else.

FAST doesn't do anything radically different.  They basically use
the similar "facets" as LCSH has, but pull out some sub-facets under
the existing LCSH pseudo-facets.
