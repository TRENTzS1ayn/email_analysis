Hi,

This seems like a good moment to put out a call for suggestions for exactly
what types of note (e.g. editor-note, hierarchy note) should be supported by
SKOS-Core, and what each note should contain.

Can I ask you to be as precise as possible in outlining what each type of
note should be used for.

Many thanks,

Alistair.
