I think that calling it "summary" would confuse the issue, because these 
terms _do_ in fact represent concepts, and in the AAT for example they 
can occur at any level. I'd prefer to see them treated as a sub-class of 
concept, having the restriction that they are not to be used for 
indexing.

Sorry, but I'm not clear exactly what you mean by "the current proposal" 
- are you referring to the definition of node label as in (a) above, or 
the SKOS proposals for encoding these?

Again, I'm not clear what you mean by "node label array". If you mean 
the node label, as in (a), under which an array of concepts is listed, 
then I suppose you might have a note clarifying the characteristic of 
division*, but that would be unusual. There would be no harm in 
providing for such a note, but the main point is to avoid confusing node 
labels with descriptors, i.e. terms that are labels for concepts.

*(As an example, I suppose that the node label <people by occupation> 
could have a note saying "Occupation refers to a trade or profession in 
which a person is currently engaged for more than the equivalent of one 
day per week". This is effectively extracting a common factor to avoid 
repeating it in the scope notes of each of the concepts in the array.)
