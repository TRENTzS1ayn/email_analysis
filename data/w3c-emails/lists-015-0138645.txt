I agree, I thru out "summary" because I couldn't come up with
a better name and hoped someone else could.  I guess I should
have noted that in my message.  I have been debating whether 
these should be a subclass of concept or not.  Regardless of
whether it is or is not, it still would be defined at the
same level as skos:concept.  So if I had:

skos:NodeLabelB

or 

skos:Concept
+-- skos:NodeLabelB

the RDF serialization would still look like:

<skos:NodeLabelB/>
<skos:Concept/>

So it's just a matter of semantics whether you consider it a
subclass or not.  From a serialization point of view they are
exactly at the same level.  One needs to decide whether this 
truly is a subclass of concept.  I think it might be, but I keep
going back an forth on that point.  I'll leave the semantics,
to others, but I do think that SKOS does need to make the
distinction between (a) and (b) as you pointed out.

I was referring to the original proposal that Miles posted for
comments.  I guess I switched topics without being clear on the
matter.  Sorry for the confusion.
