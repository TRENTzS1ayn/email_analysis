Well you could, but I think that you would run into difficulties if you 
tried to combine pre-coordinated strings like this into a thesaurus 
structure. The following block of LCSH strings is taken from the LC 
catalogue; certainly you could say that each of these represents a 
single compound concept, but I would have difficulty in giving these 
terms a useful set of  BT/NT relationships, and I don't think it 
realistic for someone to do that for every such string that they create. 
Thesaural relationships are normally between the simple concepts of 
which such strings are composed..
