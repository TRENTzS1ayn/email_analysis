But that's exactly what happens when librarians create a composed
LCSH in their local catalog.  They evaluate the new concept against
the existing LCSH and add the appropriate BT/NT/RT relationships
to the record they created.  No one said it was easy... that's why
copy cataloging is used so frequently.  Nobody really wants to do
the intellectual effort and many would prefer to wait until LC does
it.  It's expensive to create metadata...
