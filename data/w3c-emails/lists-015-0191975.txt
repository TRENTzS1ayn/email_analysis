Maybe I am missing the point here, but we seem to have jumped from
talking about exchanging vocabulary data to the exchange of catalogue
data. I thought SKOS was addressing the former, but not the latter. The
relationships in a thesaurus are supposed to be paradigmatic, not
syntagmatic. But a catalogue or index typically sets up syntagmatic
relationships ( i.e. the sort to be found in the context of one
particular document), which leads us into the difficulty outlined by
Leonard. 

Sorry if this comment is incomplete. I should perhaps say much more, but
am having great difficulty keeping up with the quantity of interesting
correspondence on this list.

But that's exactly what happens when librarians create a composed LCSH
in their local catalog.  They evaluate the new concept against the
existing LCSH and add the appropriate BT/NT/RT relationships to the
record they created.  No one said it was easy... that's why copy
cataloging is used so frequently.  Nobody really wants to do the
intellectual effort and many would prefer to wait until LC does it.
It's expensive to create metadata...
