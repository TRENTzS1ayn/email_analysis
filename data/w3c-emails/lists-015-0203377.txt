I think that Andy is thinking of SKOS as maintaining a subject authority 
file, including all the simple and compound concepts that are either 
enumerated in schedules or that have been used in creating catalogue 
entries. This is very different from a thesaurus, as you say, and adds a 
whole new dimension of complexity. If this is to be done I think it 
would be better to keep the thesaurus and the subject authority file in 
separate databases.
