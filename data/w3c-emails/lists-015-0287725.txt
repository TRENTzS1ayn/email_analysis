Actually, this thread started with Leonard saying:

I disagreed with the assessment that it would *significantly* expand the
SKOS project.  To which Leonard replied:

I then pointed out that to encode LCSH in SKOS doesn't mean you have to
incorporate the rules for how LCSH, or any other vocabulary, builds compound
concepts.  The "whole" compound string *is* the concept and there isn't
necessarily a BT/NT/RT relationship between the predefined part and what was
composed.  The whole term should be taken as the concept and its BT/NT/RT
relationship is to be taken in the context of all the other predefined, e.g.
enumerated, or compound strings in the vocabulary.

The point here is that whether the vocabulary *enumerates* or allows
synthesis of new concepts the "whole" string *is* the concept and should be
used as the skos:prefLabel within skos:Concept.  A thesaurus could have
constructed concepts just like DDC, LCSH, UDC, etc., if it has the notion of
tables.  For example, the thesaurus allows you to add a geographic component
from a table to the enumerated list of concepts.  While the thesaurus
*could* enumerate all the possibilities its probably more efficient to
specify a table and have appropriate notes say when the table should be
used.  This use of tables is no different from how DDC, LCSH, UDC, etc.
build new concepts.  Regardless, the constructed string is a new concept,
e.g. Cats [enumerated] vs. Cats--United States [constructed] vs.
Cats--France [constructed].

This means there is *no* impact on SKOS.  Hence, my disagreement with
Leonard's original assessment that it would *expand* the scope of the SKOS
project.  Hope this clears things up...
