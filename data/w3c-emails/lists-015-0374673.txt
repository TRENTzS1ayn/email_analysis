I'm not clear as to why RDF collections were not used vs. the
skos:ordered property.  It seems to me that whether there is
ordering or not maps onto rdf:Bag and rdf:Seq which are both
collections.  If you didn't want to use rdf:Bag and rdf:Seq
you could develop the appropriate SKOS representation and
mark them in the RDFS as collections.  Can you clarify why
RDF collections are not being used?


Thanks, Andy.
