Hi Bernard,

Er ... oops!  I always intended skos:TopConcept to be a sub-class of
skos:Concept.  I'm going to change that asap.

Leonard - yes you are right, a top concept is just a concept without any
broader concepts.  I originally removed the TopConcept class from early
versions of the SKOS-Core schema (we inherited it from the TIF schema that
was the early basis for SKOS), for exactly this reason - I thought it was
redundant.  

However it is convenient from a programming point of view to have a
TopConcept class, so applications can locate the top concepts directly, and
not have to discover the top concepts dynamically by examining all of the
concepts.  

Al.
