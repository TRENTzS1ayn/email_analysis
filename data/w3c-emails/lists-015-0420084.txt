Hi Andy,

We are using RDF Collections here - the skos:members property should be used
exactly as in the #students property in the example at [1].

So a SKOS e.g. in RDF/XML ...

<skos:Concept rdf:about="URI_X">
<skos:prefLabel>Aircraft</skos:prefLabel>
<skos:array>
<skos:Array>
<rdfs:label>Aircraft by form</rdfs:label>
<skos:members rdf:parseType="Collection">
<skos:Concept rdf:about="URI_A"/>
<skos:Concept rdf:about="URI_B"/>
<skos:Concept rdf:about="URI_C"/>
</skos:members>
</skos:Array>
</skos:array>
<skos:narrower rdf:resource="URI_A"/>
<skos:narrower rdf:resource="URI_B"/>
<skos:narrower rdf:resource="URI_C"/>
</skos:Concept>

<skos:Concept rdf:about="URI_A"/>
<skos:prefLabel>Flying bomb</skos:prefLabel>
<skos:broader rdf:resource="URI_X"/>
</skos:Concept>

<skos:Concept rdf:about="URI_B"/>
<skos:prefLabel>Seaplane</skos:prefLabel>
<skos:broader rdf:resource="URI_X"/>
</skos:Concept>

<skos:Concept rdf:about="URI_C"/>
<skos:prefLabel>Monoplane</skos:prefLabel>
<skos:broader rdf:resource="URI_X"/>
</skos:Concept>

Al.
