Just to respond to Andy's mail about facets: I'm going to resist the
introduction of anything with the name 'facet' into the SKOS-Core schema,
because the word 'facet' has become too overloaded (see earlier mail [1] and
subsequent discussion [2]).  

The basic problem faced by the community of people involved in thesaurus
development and classification as I have experienced it is an overloading of
functional terminology, leading to people talking at cross-purposes.  Hence
I have always put a lot of thought into the naming and the description of
the SKOS-Core schema classes and properties, in an effort to reduce the
possibility for ambiguity and confusion to an absolute minimum.
