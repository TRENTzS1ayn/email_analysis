Hi all,

I'm going to start organising this, as there have been no objections so
far.

I'm going to send a note to www-rdf-calendar, ccing a few people who I
know aren't on it. If you know of anyone who might like to come, give me
shout.

The webont f2f is on the 7th and 8th October, monday and tuesday, so the
best day would probably be wednesday 9th. I've talked to the chairs of
the wg about this, and they're ok with it, although there's an event in
London the same way which some people are attending (xml-uk).

At this stage, I'm thinking that ILRT will try and host it. The
University has some reasonable rooms if we book ahead, though of course
the food won't be as good as HP :)

cheers

Libby
