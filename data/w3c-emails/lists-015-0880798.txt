hey Danny,

Thanks for your comments :)
This is as you say a public list and we welcome comments from non
project partners.

Interesting that you think there's a gap for this beginners' mailing
list. Where, out of interest, do you think these sorts of questions go
at the moment?

We are going to try to use existing community lists where possible, but
this focus would fit with our FAQ based approach. We will discuss it on
this list and at our next face to face meeting and see how we go.

Thanks again,

Libby
