Hi Libby,

Thanks for your response ;-)

Hmm - I was thinking not necessarily a beginner's list period, but more of a
catch-all for things that fell outside of rdf-interest/logic etc, including
things that are more localised (a la RDF South West) and nuts & bolts, e.g.
"Does anyone know of an NTriples parser for Jena?" - ok, I just snatched
this from the Jena list, but if that list didn't exist...
Though now you mention it, perhaps 'rdf-intro' would be a good idea.

Haven't the foggiest ;-) Good question though. How do people usually hear of
the SW & RDF? I wonder where all those Scientific American readers went.
It'd be interesting to see the posters/lurkers ratio for rdf-interest.

Yes, of course - I'm only guessing there's a need not covered already.

Great! Thanks again,
Danny.
