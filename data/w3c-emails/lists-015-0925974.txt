A very preliminary skeleton for the Initial Workshop Report (the one being
held in conjunction with the Dublin Core 2002 Conference) is now available -
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/initial_workshop_report/ - and
linked from the reports page - http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/ - as
a work in progress.

As I was doing this it occurred to me that it might be useful to have an RSS
feed available from the reports page, enabling us to track our deliverables
(and potentially compare them against the calendar of due dates).

It also seemed like it would be useful to link the deliverables listed in the
Work package descriptions to the actual reports of deliverables being
completed. Perhaps this is simple enough to automate if we have RDF
information about reports being published.

cheers

Charles
