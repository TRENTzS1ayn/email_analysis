As part of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory work on using semantic web 
technology to represent and model trust in open systems, a new document [1] 
is available for review.

This document surveys a number of security-related Internet protocols and 
suggests the beginnings of a framework for relating them to trust in open 
systems.  In internal discussions, we think that a development of this may 
be the introduction of contracts (and contract descriptions), with quality 
of service requirements, as a way of mapping the unspecified trust inputs 
into some kind of quantifiable (or describable) values related to risk 
management;  these in turn would be reflected in the policy descriptions 
that are part of the framework presented here.
