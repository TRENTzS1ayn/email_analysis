There is one HTML problem the validator found.

173:
  <h2><a id="#outcomes" name="#outcomes">Outcomes</a></h2>

should be:
  <h2><a id="outcomes" name="outcomes">Outcomes</a></h2>

There are a bunch of broken links and fragments too according to the
W3C link validator
  http://validator.w3.org/checklink?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2001%2Fsw%2FEurope%2Freports%2Fdev_workshop_report_2%2F&hide_type=all&depth=&check=Check


Summary

P2
suggest add link
  W3C 2001 Technical plenary.
  http://www.w3.org/2001/07/allgroupoverview.html

P4 - add authors names after the various models maybe, to help
distinguish them.

Maybe put aims as <ol> so the 1, 2, 3 are clearer.  Or summarize with
one line, giving more detail
  1. Consider usecases for RDF ..
    More ...
  2. Discuss a single RDF calendaring vocab
    More ...
  3. Community building; bringing calendar developers together ...
    More ...

Outcomes

The http://www.w3.org/2002/10/calendar thing (a 404); was that a
todo?  Who suggested it, even if nobody was actioned to do it? DanC
possibly.

I guess the DanC @@s need passing by his eyes?

Looks like these things need to be owned by people somehow, even if
it wasn't agreed at the meeting.


FAQs

I don't know if it is relevant but I didn't see any mention of the
ABC/harmony model.

Oh http://ilrt.org/discovery/2002/04/query/#one is nice; I'd not noticed
that before since it was in a doc titled querying.  I'll be citing
these as the Miller Principles ;)

Usecases

Maybe after the workshop, but link to the Mitch Kapor / OSA
Foundation work with PIM tools using RDF?  "Chandler" I think
somewhere off http://www.osafoundation.org/.  yes:

  [[RDF

  The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a model for describing
  metadata, or ?data about data,? facilitating the exchange of
  structured information between applications. We plan to import and
  export RDF-formatted information, and support RDF schema semantics in
  our data model. Users of our application will be able to model their
  information in terms of classes, objects and the relationships
  between them.
  ]] -- http://www.osafoundation.org/technology.htm

Maybe mail a url of this report to their tech list?


"Universal Brokerage Package for Learning" project needs a ref
I assume this is UNIVERSAL - http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/~univ/
or http://www.ist-universal.org/

Projects and Tools

I don't see any mention to the Ximian Evolution calendar tools

  Ximian Evolution Calendaring Framework
  http://developer.ximian.com/articles/whitepapers/calendar/

which provides a software API to their calendaring model.  It does
the usual stuff such as iCalendar and syncing to palms.  I can't find
anything more detailed than the above just now.  I think the GNOME
project has a calendaring model/API too, somewhere near
http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-pilot/.  But since I can't find
anything specific, feel free to ignore this.


References

Can you list some of the important references here too, such as
iCalendar, the schemas, all the stuff that is more document-like than
code-like, which is already in the last section.

Cheers

Dave
