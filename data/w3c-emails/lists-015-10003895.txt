  But only obeying standards do not solve the problems with usability and
  accessibility. There can be an infinite number of specifications and
  articles written, still it's obvious that most designers create adequate
  pages.

  Idea of a "deaf or blind boss" is good: there should be an strong authority 
  which keeps reminding a designer that others may not see or feel same effects 
  he's/she's feeling at the moment. But does such an authority exist?

  This is true. "Learn Web Design in 24 hours" etc. I've noticed by following
  several forums that for some reason many designers can't figure the differ-
  ence between of creating structure, presentation and controls, probably cause 
  of using WYSIWYG editors.

  These designers forms a group, which may design and work actively for the
  web without a clue about standards and recommendations. Now when someone
  comes and tells them to start obeying standards, everything stops:
  "Have I been doing wrong for years? But how does my browser displays 
   everything properly? Well, it's worth giving a shot.."
  When the validator gives first errors about FONT tags and improperly defined
  dimensions for table, designer usually gives up - rather than starts finding
  a solution.

  But how can we create those "good examples and attractive sites" when nobody's
  watching or listening? Should there be an inofficial W3C, which would create
  more practical and easier-to-understand examples for teachers/professors at
  schools, designers in major companies, etc.? Or is it ok just to wait for
  re-designs to happen?

  There's still more factors and authors which gives an image that there's no
  need for obeying standards nor care about users with impairments or limited
  client programs. I'm not saying these factors should be overruled by the
  "absolute truth of designing", but sometimes it seems futile to claim 
  something which really has no other support than few articles written in the
  web when there's large corporations/books/teachers on the other side.

  Happy New Year,
