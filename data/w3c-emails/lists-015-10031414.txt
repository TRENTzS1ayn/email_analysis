People learn languages, spoken or technical, for the purpose of
communication and information exchange, not for the sake of learning the
language itself.  Language is a "means" not an "ends" in both cases. 
People generally only learn enough of the language necessary to fulfill
their specific needs.

Many people who speak english don't know what "anterior" means because
they generally don't /need/ the term to express what they personally use
english for.  Similarily, many people writing web pages don't know what
a "div" is, because they generally don't /need/ it to express what they
personally use HTML for.

Yes, perhaps people would be better off to learn the meaning of both,
but neither are required, and are thus used rather infrequently.  If you
find a person who is capable of expressing any concept they wish while
speaking english, you will have a difficult time getting them to learn
new english words.  People generally just learn enough to do what they
want to do, learning more only when necessary.
