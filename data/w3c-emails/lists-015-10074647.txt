I'm not sure the CSS should be a bag that contains XHTML documents .. 
that seems wrong.

CSS is the way the boxes are presented - maybe the table they sit on.

Turn the table round through 90 degrees, and you have a different view 
of the same objects (media="voice"). Rotate the table again, and we have 
another view of the same objects (media="print"). Rotate again, and we 
have yet another view (media="handheld").

The XHTML object haven't changed - it's just the way we are viewing them.
