Hello:

         My name is Charles Cedeno. I am now focusing in one online
opportunity.I have tried several of these opportunities full of hype
promising us thousands of dollars every month. I would get all excited and
run to my family and friends with another "Great Money Maker ".  It is a
sad fact that many people who are in need of additional income, are being
victimized by these fly by night scam artists.
As a result of trying all these opportunities, I finally found the
company which is true to their words. Not full of hype, but consistently
send me the monthly check. They have given me the best compensation plan
with their high % commission. I didn't have to perform some juggling act
to maintain some 60 to 40% balance in my legs. It is not a pyramid, so
there are no legs. It is not one of those binary compensation plan
failures either. Everyone earns commissions here. They are providing a
real service not the one that simply transfers wealth from the new signups
to the people at the top.
  When you join, you will have a team of up line sponsors who will help
you succeed every step of the way. Instead of being left alone, you will
be guided step by step by real people, not those auto responders. Only you
can make your own success together with the help of your sponsors. If you
have 2 to 3 hours a day, you will be able to earn a full income in a few
months. And there is absolutely no limit as to how much you can earn. It
is designed to gain momentum after some time. But I prefer to avoid such
statements as "You will get rich". I read it everywhere and will not allow
myself to sound like them. I experienced it personally, you can be
comfortable.
To get your FREE membership ID, send email to 
charlescedeno@yahoo.com and
put "REGISTER ME FOR FREE" in the subject and your full name in the body
of your email. Also include the statement below in the body of your email.
"By submitting a request for a FREE DHS Club membership I agree to receive
emails from DHS Club for both their Consumer and Business Opportunities."
I will then register you into the system. You will receive a confirmation
email asking you to verify. Open it up and activate your free membership
immediately. Then set back and watch as your new business explodes.


Best regards,


Charles Cedeno

I am not undertaking any actions myself (yet) against this person, 
other than notifying you (reader) of the observed practice. I hope 
the W3C mailing lists stay free of commercial messages like these.

Regards,
