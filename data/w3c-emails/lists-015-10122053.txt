I think that some people will talk about it here.

So I think you have already read this entry of Mark Pilgrim.
http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/01/13.html#semantic_obsolescence

about http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xhtml2-20021211/
and http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xhtml2-20021211/mod-text.html#s_textmodule

I remind people that:
1. XHTML 2.0 is still a WD
2. You send comments about this XHTML version to the mailing 
list. Specs are also made by the public... if this public send 
comments to the mailing list. The process of W3C has to reply to all 
comments sent on the mailing list when they address specific issues.

"Public discussion of XHTML takes place on
www-html@w3.org (archive). To subscribe send
an email to www-html-request@w3.org with the
word subscribe in the subject line.

Please report errors in this document to
www-html-editor@w3.org (archive)."

I hope that Mark Pilgrim will send his comments to the www-html 
mailing list too.

Thanks.
