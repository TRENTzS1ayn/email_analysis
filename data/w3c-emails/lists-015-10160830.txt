- About Mark
No profanity at all. The role of W3C is to reach the consensus inside 
the WG. The comments of the public must be addressed and the W3C Team 
or people inside WG are not in an ivory tower. It's why comments of 
the public are always interesting even if they do not please a part 
of the community.

I have noticed like you that the tone of Mark Pilgrim was a bit 
angry. We are here to have a dialog and a discussion. I will not 
adopt the position of the ostrich (put our head in the sand) and 
ignore comments even if they are not favorable. The role of W3C is 
not to enforce but to find a solution which leads to interoperability.

Evolution means that sometimes you have to drop features and 
sometimes you have to keep some. Not so many people know the process 
of W3C even if the document is widely accessible. And it's why I have 
invited Mark to send his comments to the list.

*Topic Mark Pilgrim closed*

*Topic XHTML open*

in the QA Specification Guidelines (which is a WORKING DRAFT too), we 
recommend in the guideline 7. Identify the relation between 
deprecated features and conformance.

See http://www.w3.org/QA/WG/2002/12/qaframe-spec-20021220#b2ab3d293

with the following checkpoints

7.1 Identify each deprecated feature. [Priority 1]
7.2 For each class of product, specify the degree of
     support required for each deprecated feature and
     the conformance consequences of the deprecation. [Priority 1]
7.3 Include an explanation for the deprecation. [Priority 3]
7.4 Include examples to illustrate how to avoid
     using deprecated features. [Priority 3]

I will review with my QA and Conformance hat the XHTML 2.0 WD when it 
will be close to the Last Call Stage to recommend the HTML WG to 
declare every choices like against the QA Spec Guidelines.


I remind to the people that it's really important to send your 
reviews and comments to the www-html list if you want to raise your 
voice.


PS: you can call me Karl.
