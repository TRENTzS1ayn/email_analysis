Interesting point. Following your logic, which comments are
uninteresting? Who is the judge here? I ask because I saw a great
number of letters which were never addressed. Perhaps these were
"uninteresting", huh?

Mark was angry because he didn't know what he wanted. He finally stuck
to HTML 4, and that's great. No one was *forcing* him to move to XHTML
1.1, because in the end all the W3C produces are recommendations,
not laws. He also misinterpreted the WAI guideline 11.1 [1]. Mark
thought if he uses the W3C technologies he immediately goes into
ecstasies. When it didn't happen he bursted out writing essays on
"funky markup" [2].

Features were kept at least three times: from HTML 3.2 to HTML 4.01,
XHTML 1.0, and XHTML 1.1. It's like from monkey to a very large
monkey, to a hairless monkey, and to a orthograde monkey. It's the
time to introduce a smart monkey (aka a man). XHTML 2 in our case. :)

The sad thing is that a lot of people have read the document, but
honestly, Karl, are you sure all the W3C folks have also read it?
If you're not at the W3C it means no matter what letters you
write and no matter how many. Most of them are simply ignored.
Not "half-answered", not "forgotten", just ignored. I really
understand why Mark doesn't write to www-html, for example.

I agree it's important. However it's also important to actually
respond to those letters.
