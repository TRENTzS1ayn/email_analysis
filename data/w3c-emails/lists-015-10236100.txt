5.2.2 Last Call Working Draft

Entrance criteria. Before advancing a technical report to Last Call 
Working Draft, the Working Group must:

    1. fulfill the relevant requirements of the Working Group charter 
and those of any accompanying requirements documents, or document 
which relevant requirements they have not fulfilled;
    2. formally address all issues raised by Working Group 
participants, other Working Groups, the Membership, and the 
***PUBLIC*** about the Working Draft.
*******************

formally address is defined in
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010719/groups.html#formal-address
********************
In the context of this document, a Working Group has formally 
addressed an issue when the Chair can show (archived) evidence of 
having sent a response to the party who raised the issue. This 
response should include the Working Group's resolution and should ask 
the party who raised the issue to reply with an indication of whether 
the resolution reverses the initial objection.
