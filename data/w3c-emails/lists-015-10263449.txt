I feel interaction between working groups and the general public could
be improved dramatically.

What about having working groups being required to issue a monthly
newsletter stating what they have done in plain English? Requesting
feedback on issues?

Other than answering questions on the public mailing lists and drafts
from time to time, I feel we actually get reasonably little feedback
directly from the WGs.

And also, couldn't we have scheduled real-time public meetings? Public
IRC discussions? That would allow direct conversation and interaction
between members and the public, and would be fantastic imo.
