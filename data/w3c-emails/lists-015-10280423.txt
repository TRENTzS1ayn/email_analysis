Being a participant in a WG, I can assure you that the fact that WG have
to publish a draft every 3 months (as required by W3C Process Document)
is already a very heavy requirement compared to the resources available
in WGs. I'm sure that most WG do their best to reply to any issue raised
in the right forum, to document their issues resolution and to highlight
their open issues in their draft, but requiring them to have more formal
communications on all the front is unlikely to happen due to resources
constraint.
