I agree formal communication with the public is not a reasonable
requirement, however I do feel a public issues list (perhaps with some
issues censored if necessary) published a number of weeks before a draft
moves phases, so the issuer has time to discover if their issue is being
discussed, or has been missed.  There is little extra cost in this other
than any censorship required to make the issues list public, rather than
member only.

Jim.
