Where is that requirement?

  "At least every three months, each Working Group must provide the
   public with an update of their progress. A progress report may take
   a variety of forms, including the publication of a technical
   report"
   - http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process-20010719/groups.html#three-month-rule

An update could simply be updating a WG homepage as far as I can see.

Something else I'd like to see are more timelines like the CSS WG have
with CSS3 at http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work#table. Not exact
release dates or anything, it's just nice to have some idea when the
next draft might be coming along.

Indeed, and they do do an excellent job. The problem is that the
mailing lists can take a bit of finding, and often aren't very
friendly to people new to the W3C (see "Three design-related (HTML or
CSS) elements for your consideration" on www-html for a recent classic
example of that).

Replace an internal WG meeting with a public one every so often? I
don't know how practical that would be. Even WGs publishing a simple
report of progress they have done ever year would be nice.
