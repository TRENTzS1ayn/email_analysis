What we need to formalize is the notion of the "opt-in panel" comprising
those who took the trouble to contribute comments.  There are multiple
points, minor review phases, where the people who should have a voice are
those who took the trouble to exercise the invitation to voice comments in a
closely related earlier phase.  This could be reflected in access rights,
tracking notifications, etc.  The notices or digests of activity should come
automatically out of the Bugzilla installation [issue-tracking engine] and
be controlled by individual preferences as to immediate notification on
individual event vs. weekly or whatever periodic updates.  The user can also
profile what issues they wish to track.  But they have to take the time to
get on the reporting-administration site and edit the profile.
