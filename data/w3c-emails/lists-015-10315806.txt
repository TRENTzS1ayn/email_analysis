I agree, though I would not call it a "panel" since W3C, by design,
does not operate on the basis of consensus with public; W3C operates
on the basis of consensus within W3C (AFAIK). Public participants have
the right to submit comments and should have the right to see those
comments addressed. They should not, however, have formal "votes" when
the decision is being made. Moreover, W3C does not have to make it
easy for the public to _group_ their voices;  WG-individual contacts
should be sufficient. This is the key difference between IETF (a free
opt-in public panel) and W3C (a for-fee opt-in semi-private panel).

Bugzilla is a good interface for the WG-individual communication, and
will make WG accountability relatively simple. However, just
installing Bugzilla would make little difference -- there needs to be
a formal requirement for WGs to address/close pending reports before
each major milestone. I do not know if W3C is willing to assume such
an obligation.
