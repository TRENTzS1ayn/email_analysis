a) I did not mean to imply any particular voting protocol, or voting status.
  The 'panel' I referred to is a bag of individuals who have distinguished
themselves by contributing comments and to whom it may be beneficial to the
overall mission satisfaction to afford ancillary services (as individuals),
such as notification of state changes in the processing of comments.

I called them a 'panel' because these people should get asked to verify that
the changes actually made to the document address the issues that they
raised in their comments.  At a point where the general public that hasn't
spoken up in the public comment period don't get so asked.  This bag of
individuals is a quality resource, and we need to recognize this in our
process theories and capitalize on it in our process automation.

Beg pardon?  The formal requirement is already there in many cases, to
notify individual commentors of the disposition of their comments and to ask
them to indicate their acquiescence or opposition with regard to this
disposition.  So far we are missing satisfaction of this requirement too
often, and when we do satisfy it it is not done in a way that actually
delivers the quality assurance value that could be extracted from the process.

What we have found in practice is that this communication has to happen in
at least two waves, when the working group reaches a functional intent as to
the resolution, [when the precise language of the docuement change has been
proposed to or agreed to by the group,] and when the re-drafting resolving all
comments has been complete.  Errors often creep in between the first of
these steps and the completion of the last.

This requires better issue tracking tools to make it efficient enough to
do it right, and it is most logical to treat commentors inside
and outside the W3C much the same in this regard.

Our rate of satisfaction of this formal requirements is, say, 70%.
Less than we would like.  Communication with commentors is an area which
clearly has room to improve.  The only thing that the public don't know
is that it's not just them.  The same holds for internal communication.

Not to get too deeply into internal matters, here, we should acknowledge
that this is a known problem and that it is the intent of the process
crafters to gain the maximum advantage from the knowledge and insights
of all who take the time to read and comment on the documents.

This is why, in a companion mail, I am suggesting we need a more visible and
customer-friendly ombudmanic function so members of the public will more
readily trust that they are being listened to.
