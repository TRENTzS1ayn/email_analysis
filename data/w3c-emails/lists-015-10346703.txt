QA Activity has published two W3C Notes: CHIPs and CUAP

    CHIPs is a set of good practices to improve implementations of
    HTTP and related standards as well as their use. It explains a
    few basic concepts, points out common mistakes and misbehaviors,
    and suggests "best practices".

    CUAP explains some common mistakes in user agents due
    to incorrect or incomplete implementation of specifications, and
    suggests remedies. It also suggests some "good behavior" where
    specifications themselves do not specify any particular behavior
    (e.g., in the face of error conditions).
    CUAP is a republication.

CUAP should take the form of the CHIPs Note for readibility
