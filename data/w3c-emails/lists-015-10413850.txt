Good, starting reading it now.

Something in between. I believe your article is a very worthy addition 
to the existing material, and knowing our audience, I'm certain it's 
better to have one good article rather than two to cover this topic. 
Hence the need to merge. I suppose a full rewrite won't be needed, and 
a copy-paste won't be good enough, but something in between should be 
OK.

Thoughts?

cheers
