Hi everyone, 

Sorry to barge in like this, but I have come up with an idea to help
finance Mozilla which I think is worth mentionning on the public place.

As you may already be aware now, the Mozilla Foundation has just set up
a Paypal asccount on their website (www.mozilla.org). I am throwing in
some sort of a challenge to get as much people as possible to go and
donate, even if it's only one dollar. Upon registrering to Paypal, every
new member gets 5 dollars for free. I figured if everyone gave their 5
bucks to Mozilla (plus their little dollar), that could end up being a
lot for the Foundation. This could very well make the difference for
them.

I have explained the whole thing on my website, but since it's in
french, most of you won't be able to understand. However, for those who
do, here's the URL : http://makeashorterlink.com/?F16C21455 (shorter
link to make it easier, you'll be redirected automatically).

If every one that cares about Mozilla spoke about it on their site, we
could create a mass movement. Together, we cal all make a difference !
