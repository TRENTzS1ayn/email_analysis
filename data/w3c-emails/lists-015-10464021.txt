Hi Bjoern,

> What's the current status of this project?

This is so interesting that you ask this today.  I was coordinating this for
WaSP, but things got busy and you know how that goes.  Just yesterday I
referred someone to the article we did back in December, and I realized that
this was a very worthy project and I would like to resume working on it.

That said, I do have a good follow-up article that I was working on with
Olivier and Karl, so I will commit to finishing that and publishing it on
the WaSP site.

I'm really grateful you asked this question because combined with my thought
only yesterday it confirms my sense that this is a very good opportunity and
one that I don't want to see lost by the wayside.

The help I could use here would be a list of great topic ideas, this way we
can put together an editorial calendar of sorts and work on a topic a month.

I look forward to everyone's thoughts!

Molly
