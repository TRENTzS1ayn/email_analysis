I've just completed an update to my 25 April 2003 post, "Web standards 
and accessibility weblogs, 
etc.":http://www.lynnparkplace.org/vot/archives/accessibility/000015.html

New in this version are entries pointing to single items (rather than 
sites) -- reports, articles, findings -- relevant to standards and 
accessibility.

I *think* I've cleared up all the commitments I made to people who had 
comments or e-mail suggestions. I apologize for the length of time it 
has taken to get caught up. As always, if there are problems or 
inaccuracies or other references, please send them along.

Regards.                         ...edN
