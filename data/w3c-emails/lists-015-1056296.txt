Hi

I've just added everyone from w3c-swad-europe who hadn't subscribed to
public-esw@w3.org

This is the publically visible mailing list for SWAD-Europe. It is
generally for our (ie. project team) use, though we can open it up to
discussion with collaborators as things proceed.

Public archives are at lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-esw/

Current membership is listed below:

Andy_Seaborne@hplb.hpl.hp.com
der@hplb.hpl.hp.com
mf@w3.org
B.M.Matthews@rl.ac.uk
M.D.Wilson@rl.ac.uk
Martin_Merry@hplb.hpl.hp.com
StephenB@stilo.com
c.bardrick@bristol.ac.uk
charles@w3.org
danbri@w3.org
dave.beckett@bristol.ac.uk
dd@w3.org
em@w3.org
jan.grant@bristol.ac.uk
kate.sharp@bristol.ac.uk
lesly.huxley@bristol.ac.uk
libby.miller@bristol.ac.uk

As discussed at the face to face, a more private list for
admin and finance will be hosted at University of Bristol.
Kate and/or Libby will be in touch about this. We can then phase out
the Member-visible w3c-swad-europe list and do content/tech discussion on
public-esw, with project internal admin/finance/reporting discussions on
the new not-yet-created admin list.

We'll police public-esw socially rather than technically, just as
we do with other publically-readable W3C lists (eg. WebOnt WG, RDF Core
WG). In other words, this won't be a free-for all, but it needn't
be entirely restricted to allow postings only from project-partner staff.
We can work out a balance as the project work gets under way.

Let me know if you have any questions etc.,

Dan

(re-emerging after 2 weeks in day long meetings...)
