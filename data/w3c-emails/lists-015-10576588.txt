I think it's very difficult to identify the authoring tool automatically 
in the absence of a meta generator tag. (And even then, the user can 
change the meta tag.) Some tools do leave obvious fingerprints, which 
can be identified by examing the code, but others do not. Sorry I 
couldn't be more helpful.
