Thanks. This is likely the best solution currently. There have been some 
other ideas floating around about how best to aggregate (and to 
maintain) this resource. It's probably getting to the size and scope 
where those ideas should be explored more thoroughly.

For example, if it's feasible and I can figure out how to do it in MT, 
perhaps a unique RSS feed would be useful for that entry, instead of or 
in addition to my having to post a new entry to VOT and post a notice to 
the list.

This does nothing to deal with the management, integrity and 
organization of the entries themselves, of course. And it is currently  
location specific. I can scratch my head about that too. But suggestions 
and comments would be a help.

Thanks.                       ...edN
