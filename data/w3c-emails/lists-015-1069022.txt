Hi folks,

How do people feel about holding the international workshop in conjunction
with the Dublin Core conference in Florence in October, and holding a
workshop at HP as discussed as our other required developer workshop in that
period?

The International workshop should be a little more of a general public
introduction to the project than a normal developer workshop, although it
should also have a technical focus of some kind, and the Dublin Core
conference seems more appropriate for that than a single-topic workshop based
on the fact that we potentially have members of the WebOnt working group
available.

There are several possiblities - the workshop could potentially be held as a
workshop session on the workshop/tutorial day of the conference, or the day
after the conference itself. Obviously we would need to sort out the details
with the organisers of that conference. For that reason in particular, I hope
we can get fairly rapid feedback on the idea.

cheers

  Hi all,

  Following the Kick-off meeting, I am responsible for making sure we organise
  the International Workshop. We are proposing to hold it on the topic of RDF
  Querying, in conjunction with the W3C Web Ontology working group meeting in
  Bristol 7-8 October.

  At this stage I would propose holding a one day workshop on Wednesday the 9th
  of October, and we hope that Hewlett-Packard could host this workshop.

  Cheers
