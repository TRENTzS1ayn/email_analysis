This is possibly OT - if someone could let me know what other W3C list this 
question should go to, that would be great.

I have a question about the status of the cHTML standard. Does anybody have 
a feel for what direction the W3C prefers for serving content to mobile 
devices, either one-document-serves-all XHTML with handheld-specific 
stylesheets, or separate XHTML+CSS files for screen and cHTML-with-no-CSS 
files for the little guys? According to webopedia "cHTML has been fading 
into obsolescence as XHTML gains acceptance and replaces cHTML", which I'm 
willing to believe considering I've only just heard about cHTML. On the 
other hand, even Jakob The Great expresses doubts about whether a single 
XHTML source can really work across such disparate devices and mediums:

Basically, I saw a news article about Opera saying they support cHTML for 
iMode compatibility, which sparked my wanting to get a better feel for 
what's going on with the emerging phone browser world:
