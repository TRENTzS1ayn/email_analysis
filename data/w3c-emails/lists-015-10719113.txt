The discussion is interesting and it would be very good to have an 
overview here. The mailing list for question about HTML, XHTML etc is 
www-html@w3.org

For Cell phones the Spec which has been designed is XHTML Basic
http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/

How to serve XHTML documents is explained in this note
http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-media-types/


See the summary:
