Thanks Drew.

It's why I'm inviting people to send their comments about the tools 
and what are the things that could be improved or missing features. 
When all the people will have expressed their requirements, we'll be 
able to see how to write a document to address these issues and work 
with all authoring tools makers to improve the products.

Best.
