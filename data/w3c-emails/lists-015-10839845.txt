It's not a blog but a daily journal fronting a soon to be converted but
non-standards based site - and concerns web standards,  accessibility and
field trips in Cornwall which we run every year (and this year's our eighth
annual bash)

If you think it worth it, include it. It is developing, so look and feel
changes on a regular basis. I've set it up after encouragement from my
students who are ripping the code off (with my permission and
encouragement) to analyse it.
