My apologies to all who received my promises that their corrections and 
suggestions would be done forth-with last week. I failed.

However, I've just finished updating 
http://www.lynnparkplace.org/vot/archives/accessibility/000015.html to 
reflect what I think is all of the input I've received so far. In 
particular there are a number of Czech blogs listed, a major addition. 
Thanks to Marek Prokop for the pointers.

Regards.                    ...edN
