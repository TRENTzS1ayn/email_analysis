Hi,

After an e-mail discussion with W3 staff people (Olivier and Karl, from 
the QA group), we came to the conclusion  that sharing my experience 
with Web standards promotion could help other people replicating and/or 
adapting the French projects I have been participating to in their 
respective countries and regions.

You'll find a very first draft on 
http://www.nitot.com/temp/Acting_locally_detailed.html

It is more or less supposed to be a sequel to 
http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/08/LocalAction

It may eventually, after review, being published on W3.org.

Suggestion, critics and reviews are more than welcome.

Cheers,


--Tristan
