This article looks very good indeed. You're saying it is a draft, how 
far do you think it is from completion? Do you want a review from this 
list now, or for a later draft?

Given its scope and the scope of the existing "LocalAction" article in 
W3C QA space, I believe both could easily be merged. What do you think?
