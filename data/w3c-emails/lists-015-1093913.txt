One idea we discussed was to base the workshop around the idea of bringing
practical DC use cases, requirements and priorities to RDF tool
developers, with goal of making sure RDF tools are solving real world
metadata problems. Flipside of this is to have RDF developers sanity-check
the DCMI DC-in-RDF specs by investigating how they work in RDF database,
API, query etc environments.

My own views on this went into an abstract for DC2002 with Dave and
Libby, but we didn't get a paper finished on time. I'd be interested to know
whether what we drafted chimes with anyone else's view:

As a paper abstract, this is of course more opinionated (and downbeat,
re-reading...) than would be appropriate for a whole workshop. But I think
the basic idea, of connecting practical metadata apps (DC and related) to
RDF technology issues faced by implementors is close in spirit to much of
the SWAD-E workplan.
