As always another site which has singularly failed to swallow it's own
dogfood, you cannot serve XHTML 1.0 as text/html unless it follows Appendix
C of XHTML, the above document does not follow Appendix C, and is served as
text/html so whilst the material looks incredibly useful and valuable, the
fact it can be shot down so easily makes it useless, we can't use it to
educate people.

Jim.
