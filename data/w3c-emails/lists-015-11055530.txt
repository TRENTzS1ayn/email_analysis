Hi Jim
   Thanks for the comments.
I assume you're referring to Appendix C in:
http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/
(which states that "This appendix is informative.").
   It's not clear to me what I should do.  Are you saying the page
should be XHTML 1.0 strict, that I need an XML PI, that I need to use a
different character encoding  or that I should use another MIME type?
   Hmm.  Have just read section 3.1 in
http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-media-types/
which does not seem to *ban* this MIME type although it's clearly not
recommended:
"In **general**, this media type is NOT suitable for XHTML. ..."
"The use of 'text/html' for XHTML SHOULD be limited for the purpose of
..."

  I'd be happy to move to  'application/xhtml+xml' - but there will need
to be testing for any problems with other resources on the Web site
(which aren't managed by me).

   The document is XHTML 1.0 compliant (append ,validate to the URL)
   Note that I've not said anything about MIME types in my documents -
but I guess this would be a useful document to be produced.
