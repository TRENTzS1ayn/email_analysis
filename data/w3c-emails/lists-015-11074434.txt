XHTML is only "allowed" to be served as text/html if it's under Appendix C,
if someone would like to correct me on that and say Appendix C isn't
normative and any old XHTML can be served as text/html then I'll withdraw
the criticism.

but it's not Appendix C compliant which AIUI is required to be served as
text/html (C.7 for example, I didn't bother looking beyond.)  Also  xhtml
1.0 SHOULD be served as application/xhtml+xml, and I find it hard to explain
to people that some SHOULD's are to be ignored, and others are to be obeyed,
how is a non-expert supposed to judge which, surely we need to either have
all or none?
