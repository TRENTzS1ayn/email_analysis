The actual content of the briefings are all excellent, and I would very much
like them available to a wider audience, either through being repurposed for
the QA site, or just linked to/advertised to get the wider audience (the W3
stamp of approval by being hosted on w3.org would be useful, but not
essential).

One comment is the often links to bobby, I'd rather this was to a variety of
tools, as my experience has shown people often don't like bobby's warnings
about things they get right, if you suggest a variety of accessibility
checkers they often put things differently and people can judge quicker that
one of them just isn't very good at mechanically checking that feature.

Jim.
