Hi Bob
   Thanks for the email.
   I understand your (and Jim's) rationale.  I got the impression at the
WWW 2003 conference that the problem with dodgy XHTML was to be addressed
with XHTML 2.0. Anyway I don't have any disagreements with the logic of
your position.
   I guess my current interest is in the deployment of the application/xml
MIME type in a University server environment (typically a mixture of XHTML
and HTML; PHP, etc).
   Thinking about it makes me wonder if the advice on format independent
URIs ties in with MIME type mapping.
   BTW the reason I'm using XHTML 1.0 is (1) to gain experience of
problems - as I'm now finding; (2) to be able to use XSLT to transform
the resources (e.g. to RSS) and (3) is the most recent W3C recommendation
for HTML and its use is preferred (this is my current understanding).
   I get the impression that this (esp. point 3) isn't your's (or Jim's
view).  I guess your position is that the best approach is
XHTML+application/xml (or whatever) and if you can't guarantee to provide
the MIME type (for whatever reason) you should stick with HTML 4. If this
is felt to be the best approach, shouldn't there be some advice on the QA
Library covering this?  As I pointed out in a previous message the XHTML 1
spec does allow text/html.  I think additional caveats about the denages
of this approach are needed.
   (My apols if this is going over old ground or slightly out of scope
for this list).

Brian
