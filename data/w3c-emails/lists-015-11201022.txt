hi people, i have a question, if i have
<node>
<menu>
<item>what ever</item>
<subitem>title 1</subitem>
<subitem>title 2</subitem>
etc...
<item>same thing above</item>
<subitem>...</subitem>
etc...
</menu>
</node>

in XSL can i get all values of all items and subitems?
I use PHP as an example, but, i just can get this values using the PHP
language (making an array parser), not the XSL language.

This is possible to do with XSL?

Thanks
