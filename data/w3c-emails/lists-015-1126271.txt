Hi all,

I've been looking through a few tools Dan and I worked on to try and
track SWAD-e events, especially for Kate.

This was because we did get deliverables to palm working and this
month's deliverables poppped up on my palm....! This needs a bit more
work though (there's the probablility of making a horrible mess with
duplicates at the moment) - so I'll send a separate note about that
sometime.

So I noticed that in addition to Dave's report and Kate's first
management report we are due to do a dissemination and use plan by the
end of this month. Dan, Charles and I are on the hook for that - we'll
be looking at it this week.

<pm:deliverable>
<rdf:Description  rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/plan/workpackages/live/esw-wp-3.html#del_3.5">
 <pm:name>dissemination_use_plan</pm:name>
 <pm:deliv_lead_email rdf:resource="mailto:danbri@w3.org" />
 <pm:deliv_interest_email rdf:resource="mailto:libby.miller@bristol.ac.uk" />
 <pm:deliv_interest_email rdf:resource="mailto:charles@w3.org" />
 </rdf:Description>
 </pm:deliverable>

I thought I'd better write up some of what we did for future
reference, and so that people have a better idea of what
we can do with SWAD-Europe management tools as they stand.

You can see the deliverables due using my calendar tool:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/view/
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/view/calmonth.jsp?url=&rdfweburl=http://sw1.ilrt.org/discovery/2002/05/rsscal/esw-delivs.rdf

(writeup:
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200207/rsscal/xslt-rss-events.html)

I generated the information from the raw deliverables in RDF output:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/plan/workpackages/live/rdf/_esw_projdata.rdf

which were in turn generated using Dan's Perl program from the
workpackages in xhtml

Perl program:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/plan/workpackages/live/bin/extract_projdata.pl

sample xhtml file:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/plan/workpackages/live/esw-wp-1.html

I used Dan's Ruby code to generate a pseudo RSS+events file from the raw
RDF:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/plan/workpackages/live/bin/esw-delivs-events.rb

and also combined the deliverables information with the information from
the face to face about who is responible for which deliverable, so
that we get the combined information - what is to be done, and who is
responsible.

who does what file:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/plan/workpackages/live/rdf/whodoeswhat.rdf

Squish query used:

select ?deliv, ?email, ?num, ?date, ?dd,
WHERE
(pm::deliv_lead_email ?deliv ?email)
(pm::name ?deliv ?dd)
(pm::number ?deliv ?num)
(pm::realDateDue ?deliv ?date)
USING
 pm for http://www.w3.org/2002/02/esw/pm#
foaf for http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/'

We need more tools to help with this sort of thing - such as - a tool
which tells me what I'm supposed to be delivering when, for example.
Any other ideas - especially from Kate - would be very welcome.
