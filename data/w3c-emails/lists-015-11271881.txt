Greetings.

Next week I'm presenting a talk ("The Quest for Compliance") on using
W3C standards when creating and redesigning Web sites
(http://www-conf.slac.stanford.edu/interlab03/).

Does anyone have suggestions where I could find specific, concrete facts
to back up the benefits of using W3C standards on Web sites? I have one
good measurement: size of the same page rendered using tables and using
XHTML/CSS. Taking the sizes multiplied by number of page views in a
given period, and then cost in bandwidth.

Any suggestions would be most welcome.

Thanks.

Kim Nylander
