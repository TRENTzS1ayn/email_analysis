It's quite a coincidence that this article be published this week 
because we're having quite a passionate discussion related to this in 
the french web standards community these days. Like anywhere else, 
people are concerned about who's right and who's wrong in this. Is XHTML 
such a bad thing ? Is HTML too old for it's own good ? Ian Hickson who 
believes HTML should be used attracts the attention of a minority of 
purists (and I mean that in the most respectful way), and Jeffrey 
Zeldman who says XHTML is the one to go for (which seems to attract the 
broadest pack of followers).

I'm looking forward to a discussion on this because, while we have 
plenty of ideas and opinions, most of them are led by personnal beliefs, 
not actual proven facts.

Those of you who can understand french will get a glimpse of all this 
mayhem here :
