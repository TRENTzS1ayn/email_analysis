Hi,

The WASP asks the W3 article says:

HTML 4.01 is the last version of HTML, yet http://www.w3.org/TR/html (the
latest version of HTML according to the HTML 4.01 spec) points too XHTML
1.0.

I'd certainly be very glad to hear that HTML4.01 is the current version of
HTML, however I believe this isn't the case, can you confirm the latest
version is indeed HTML 4.01 - so I can ask the HTML WG to fix the link?

Cheers,

Jim.
