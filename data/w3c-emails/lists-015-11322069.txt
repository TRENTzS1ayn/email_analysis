Jim and I had a similar discussion a few weeks ago.  This helped me
clarify my thinking, but I don't necessarily agreed with all of Jim's
views.

Anyway, in the context of the WASP document:

Why use XHTML 1.0?  

One possible reasons:

It's the latest recommended version of HTML, according to W3C. If this
is not the case (it's experimental, browsers aren't ready for it, etc.)
the W3C page should be updated to reflect this otherwise W3C are giving
the wrong signals.

The WaSP page says "XHTML is easier to maintain".

I would agree with Jim that this is misleading - the current generation
of tools aren't XHTML-ready; XHTML validators aren't widely deployed,
give ambiguous results, etc.

The WaSP page says 'The margin for errors in HTML is much broader than
in XHTML, where the rules are very clear.'

I'd draw the opposite conclusion.  The HTML spec allows mixed case for
elements, quoted or unquoted attributes in many cases, etc.  HTML is
therefore more tolerant of not only errors but also different approaches
to producing compliant HTML; unlike XHTML which does not provide such
flexibility.

The WaSP page says "HTML is easier to teach and to learn
The syntax rules defined by XML are far more consistent than those found
in HTML and therefore easier to explain than the SGML rules on which
HTML is based."

Partly true, but most people won't be learning from scratch and will
have to unlearn current HTML.

The WaSP page says 'XHTML is XSL ready'

I agree this is a valid reason - but there's still the MIME type issue
to consider.

Incidentally the MIME type issue is a reason why XHTML is not easier to
maintain.  Put an unescaped ampersand or an MS Windows character in a
HTML page and it's still viewable on many platforms; do the same in an
XHTML document with an XHTML MIME type and you get nothing.  XHTML is
less fault-tolerant but more rigorous - a simple "XHTML is easier to
maintain" slogan is quite clearly incorrect.

Wouldn't "Switching from HTML 4.01 to XHTML 1.0 currently brings almost
no 
direct benefits for the visitors of your Web site but the ability to
make use of XSLT provides the potential for a range of benefits" be a
reasonable comment to make?

The position I'm coming to is that XHTML + correct MIME type should be
deployed today in circumstances in which compliant XHTML 1.0 can be
guaranteed - typically with software which can impose compliance doing
the creation.  XHTML 1.0 is not recommended for use with HTML authoring
tools unless they can force strict compliance or unless there is a
publication process which addresses these issues (and using vi to write
directly to Web file store can't do that!).
