It depends on what are the meanings of the words.

HTML 4.01 is where the last version of the semantics has been defined 
and so the semantics for HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0  are defined in the 
HTML 4.01 specifications.

http://www.w3.org/TR/html doesn't define a conformant link to a dtd or 
whatsoever.
