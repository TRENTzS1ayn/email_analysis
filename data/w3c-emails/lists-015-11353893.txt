Okay, trying to be simple so there's no ambiguity:

Is XHTML1 HTML?

It's a link to what the HTML 4.01 Rec defines as "the current version of
HTML"  The DTD is not the only arbiter of what is valid in a HTML document
(for example prose limits the checked attribute to input type=radio or
type=checkbox, something which even the W3 homepage chooses to ignore)
