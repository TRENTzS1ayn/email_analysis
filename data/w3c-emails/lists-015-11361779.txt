First of all, I want people read clearly something:

"""C. HTML Compatibility Guidelines
This appendix is informative."""

The whole C Appendix is not normative at all.

> [in XHTML 1.0]
> "empty elements are terminated using a space and a trailing slash"

> whitespace is not relevant.

Agreed. I don't often put a space in my own pages. I even tend to 
avoid it. Web authoring tool like BBEdit does it very well. You have an 
option to warn you or not about this behaviour. so you have the choice 
of doing it or not.

> Next is not strictly an error, but in the context of authoring XHTML 
> 1.0
> today, where Appendix C compliance is essential, the example has:
>
> <p xml:lang="fr"> ... </p>

As you said it's not an error and "The value of the xml:lang attribute 
takes precedence." It's again the choice of the user.

There's no such thing as "Appendix C compliance". It's a strong and 
wrong abuse of words for the meaning of the spec.

> This is not allowed under Appendix C. which requires that xml:lang and 
> lang be duplicated.

Appendix C doesn't require. The section is informative.

? I don't understand this comment

argueing on expression, between elements and tags, I guess here?

http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/intro/sgmltut.html

"""
Each element type declaration generally describes three parts: a start 
tag, content, and an end tag.

The element's name appears in the start tag (written <element-name>) 
and the end tag (written </element-name>); note the slash before the 
element name in the end tag. For example, the start and end tags of the 
UL element type delimit the items in a list:

<UL>
<LI><P>...list item 1...
<LI><P>...list item 2...
</UL>

Some HTML element types allow authors to omit end tags (e.g., the P and 
LI element types). A few element types also allow the start tags to be 
omitted; for example, HEAD and BODY. The HTML DTD indicates for each 
element type whether the start tag and end tag are required.

Some HTML element types have no content. For example, the line break 
element BR has no content; its only role is to terminate a line of 
text. Such empty elements never have end tags. The document type 
definition and the text of the specification indicate whether an 
element type is empty (has no content) or, if it can have content, what 
is considered legal content.
"""

The benefits are the ones listed all along the article for people who 
need it. The points of the article is certainly to not make the switch 
a requirement, but just a choice.

We don't explain and WE WILL NOT explain that you must switch to XHTML 
1.0, it's a choice for most of the users. Nobody is bad because they 
still use HTML 4.01. Both solutions are perfectly usable.

Bis Repetita: There's no such things as "Appendix C compliance".

Some of the things are detected by BBEdit for example, I don't know 
about other tools. Would it be nice if you were developping a module in 
Perl to add to the LogValidator which look at the Appendix C items.

A detailed warning analysis of the Markup validator, it would be nice 
to do. As you know, Jim, Markup validator is made by volunteers like 
Terje, Nick, Bjoern, and I'm pretty sur such a detail analysis for a 
future warning mode would be very helpful. Giving your knowledge and 
your strictness on the HTML specifications, it would be a valuable work 
for the Web community.

In the context of education and using HTML 4, the rules are less 
systematic. Sometimes you can avoid the end tag for an element, 
sometimes not and except if you read the DTD... you can't decide which 
ones. I have taught HTML and XHTML, and I can tell certainly that XHTML 
is easier to teach without ambiguities.
XHTML rules are systematics.

Yes it's a problem of the specification now. Appendix C is not 
normative.

It's fine Jim, often, when people review documents have a tendency to 
pick up errors or being extremely critics with them, but that's the 
goal of the review, there's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't mean 
the document is bad.

We don't defend a bad technology. we explained different choices. As a 
personal point of view, I prefer to use XHTML because it's a lot more 
convenient for me in my daily business.
