I've compiled a list of related conferences for planning purposes. At
the moment they're available as an RSS 1.0 +events channel, though maybe
HTML would have been better - when I have a sec I'll do an xslt
stylesheet that converts RSS to html.

Viewed with my calendar RSS viewer:

If there are some I've missed I'd be grateful for information.

cheers
Libby
