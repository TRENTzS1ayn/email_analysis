Says (wrt to app/xml and text/xml)

"It is also important to note that for either of these MIME types, Internet
Explorer will display the source code instead of correctly interpreting it
as XHTML . "

It suggests that IE is performing incorrectly in this, could I have a source
for this behaviour being incorrect, AIUI there is no requirement for
documents with an XML mime-type be rendered in a particular manner.  You may
say that IE's behaviour is not desired in this case, but I cannot see
anything that says it is incorrect, could you point out the relevant spec.

IE makes no claims to support XHTML, so even if it was required for an XHTML
conforming browser to render XHTML elements when served as */xml, there can
be no such requirements on IE, which only renders XHTML as tag-soup HTML, it
is an html user-agent.
