Either would be good, I'd just like to see it addressed really,  as I've yet
to see anywhere address it, and it seems to be a common problem:

<URL:
http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=sCl5b.1501%248_5.331665%40newsfep2-gui.server.ntli.net >

Which contains

|But my impression is that no one has
|posted the killer response to "what is the advantage to the developer of
|bog-standard web sites in switching to XHTML?")

and it would be good to point people at the argument - I of course need
convincing too, but I may just be a luddite in this respect.
