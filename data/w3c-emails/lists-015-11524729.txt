Totally!  Listen, we're taking notes, I promise.  It was me who dropped the
ball on this project last year, and now that we have some terrific new WaSPs
on board, there's a real opportunity to take the resources we have and use
them.  I'm excited we're getting it going again and grateful for the
feedback.

Along with Steph and Holly and other WaSP members, we're putting together a
list of questions that we will then fashion into future articles.  Your
input is necessary!  So these are very helpful comments.

If you have specific questions that you'd like to see addressed, don't
hesitate to let me know--not sure if this list is the right place to ask
them or not--but either way, we're creating that list and will be using it
as a guideline for all future WaSP Asks editions.

Thanks!
Molly :)
