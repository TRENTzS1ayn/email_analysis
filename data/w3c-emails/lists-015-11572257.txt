For info, use of XHTML can cause problems with other types of user
agents.  For example, I know one indexer designed to index Dublin Core
metadata embedded in <META> tags which won't work with <meta ... />.  

The indexer in question is the indexing tool bundled in with the
Microsoft SiteServer software.  Note that I don't think this can be
classed as a bug in the indexer, as the software wasn't designed for use
with XHTML.

Has any work been done on problems with user agents other than browsers
with XHTML?
