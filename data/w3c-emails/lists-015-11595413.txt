There is some validity to this comment, however evangelists and other 
interested parties should benefit from at least a glazed-eye 
understanding of what is at issue regarding the things they are 
evangelizing. A discussion such as this -- although likely more well 
informed than most -- pre-figures the kind bush-whacking talk that takes 
place in meetings where evangelists dip their toes (and often withdraw 
quickly, scalded.)

My take away from this discussion so far is the HTML 4.xx Strict is the 
most viable place in which to invest evangelical effort. XHTML is simply 
too fraught with complexity, controversy and immaturity. I'll be 
gratified to read the "Why should I server XHTML?" response; the sooner 
the better as far as I'm concerned. Let's get to it!
