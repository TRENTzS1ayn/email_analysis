Either there is a specification that ensures such behaivour or there is
no such specification. If there is, application/xml can be considered an
alternate MIME type for XHTML documents, if there is not it cannot be
considered an alternate.

  Since MIME dispatchers work off of the MIME type, use of text/xml or
  application/xml to label discrete media types will hinder correct
  dispatching and general interoperability.

Something is not interoperable just because it works in some browsers.
It seems perfectly reasonable for a search engine robot to skip all
application/xml documents when it only supports HTML/XHTML.

As a content provider, I care about user agents other people use and I
do not want that my content causes unexpected behaivour which I would
risk when relying on undefined behaivours.

In response to my last call comments, yes. However, as long as RFC 3023
does not get updated, interpretation of fragment identifiers for
application/xml is undefined and it is thus not reliable to use this
type if fragment identifiers are involved.

As much as any XHTML Family document may be served as 'text/plain' or
'application/octet-stream'.

Because RFC 3236 does not allow it.
