Greetings.

Following the creation of the QAIG contributions guidelines, the QAIG 
now sports a new homepage focusing on participation to the various 
activities of the Interest Group. Certainly worth a visit if you think 
the IG is all about discussion on these lists but would like to 
participate more, or differently.

Cheers, olivier.
