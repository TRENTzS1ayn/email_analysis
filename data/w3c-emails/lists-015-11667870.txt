I spent over two years contacting major web sites and web developers 
around the world trying to educate them about authoring according to the 
W3C Standards. I know from experience how they will respond to comments 
that their sites work in Internet Explorer due to bugs in Internet 
Explorer and do not work in standards compliant browsers:

"It works in IE. Why doesn't your browser follow the standards set by IE?"

Besides non-standard script and invalid markup, examples which are still 
rampant on the web today include invalid SGML comments and inappropriate 
MIME types being reported by servers. I can show numerous examples in 
the Mozilla Tech Evangelism project to show the inability or 
unwillingness of sites to author correct HTML or to even configure 
servers correctly.

HTML is a lost cause, however XHTML still has a future as a useful, 
well-defined markup language _unless_ you succeed in redefining support 
for XHTML to be whatever IE supports.

A perfect example of what is happening:

<http://www.zeldman.com/>

served as text/html with doc type

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
     "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

contains

<style type="text/css">
<!--

#secondarytop a:visited {
font-weight: normal;
background: #c60;
color: #fff;
text-decoration: none;
}

ul.inny {
margin-top: 0;
margin-left: 0;
padding-left: 0;
}

.inny li{
display: inline;
padding-right: 6px;
padding-left: 6px;
border-right: 1px solid #ccc;
}

li.first {
padding-left: 0;
}

li.last {
border-right: none;
}

-->
</style>

which will be ignored by any browser that supports application/xhtml+xml 
  if the page is served as such.

If and when IE ever does support application/xhtml+xml then I will bet 
dimes to donuts that it will still apply these rules insteading of 
ignoring them at it should.

If your goal is to allow the dominant, monopolist browser which will not 
receive major updates to it's standards support for the next 2-4 years 
(if ever) to define XHTML as tag-soup HTML and destroy any browser that 
attempts to support the standards strictly, then your approach should work.
