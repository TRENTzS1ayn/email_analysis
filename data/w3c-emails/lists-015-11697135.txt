Hello,

I was just reading here about character encodings:

http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines 

Down in section C.9, it states: "the best approach is to ensure that the
web server provides the correct headers. "

I would like to do this, but I'm unsure of how to configure my Apache
web server to send the correct headers by default. Could someone post an
example of what the correct headers would be and/or an example of a
"correct" Apache configuration for this?

Thanks!

Mark
