Provided that all your xhtml files have a uniform extension (say .html)
and a uniform encoding (say iso-8859-1), and provided that you serve
them as text/html (but this applies trivially to application/xhtml+xml),
you can add (or amend an existing entry) the following directive:
AddType text/html;charset=iso-8859-1html

Hope this helps,
