Of course (being in internationalization but also from a practical
standpoint), I'd suggest UTF-8 as a preferred uniform encoding -
especially useful if you ever need to stray outside Latin1 (eg. for
turkey, czech republic, etc - not just arabic, chinese, etc.)

One thing to bear in mind (that many don't realise) is that this
directive applies to all files in all subdirectories below the point
where you add it.  You, of course, always have the possibility to
override it by adding another directive lower down if needs be.

Hope that helps,
