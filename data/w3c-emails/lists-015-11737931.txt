Thanks. Just to clarify my specific case:  

We are an American web hosting company. Nearly all of our pages are in
American english. Some pages will include declarations to declare their
own content type, others won't. I think in our case it's reasonable to
assume that for pages that don't declare a document type, defaulting 
to a standard American english kind of character set is reasonable.
