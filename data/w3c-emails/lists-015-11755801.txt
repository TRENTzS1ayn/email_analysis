each directive has good and bad side.

UTF-8 is quite universal, but you'll have to use html entities (such as 
"&eacute;" for "?") instead of accented (non-ascii) characters. This 
makes accented text painful to read and edit.
using 8859-1 allows you to insert accented characters in your html, 
provided they belong to the latin-1 charset . This is the solution that 
I use, because I write in French and in English only. If I wanted to use 
characters outside of the iso-8859-1 charset, (e.g. for czech) I'd have 
to use html entities or switch to UTF-8.
