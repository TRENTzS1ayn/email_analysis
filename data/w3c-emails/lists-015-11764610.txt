Hmm.  I think you somehow have this the wrong way round.  UTF-8 means
you have no need to use character entities, since it covers the whole
Unicode repertoire.  As you say, its because ISO 8859-1 only covers
characters used in Western European languages (plus a few other simple
Latin langs), that if you wanted to represent, say, the Czech c caron,
then you'd have to use a Numeric Character Reference or entity.

For an example, see
http://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/samples/wrapping-no-dhtml.html (10
scripts on one page and no NCRs or entities other than &amp;)

You do, of course, need an editor that supports utf-8, but that's not
difficult to find these days.

You are right, though, when you say that it's better not to use
character entities, but rather actual codes.
