:) let's clear up a bit. Both of you are right, in some context.

* If you have an editor (authoring tool) which can NOT input utf-8 in 
your text and you still want to use utf-8 for your document. You can 
use this low tech method which is
? -> &eacute; for example, so you will have only us-ascii characters 
in your document and us-ascii is a subset of utf-8.

* If you have an editor which can input utf-8. Just type your accents.


BTW, it would be good that someone on the mailing-list makes a list of 
all editors and their support of utf-8.
