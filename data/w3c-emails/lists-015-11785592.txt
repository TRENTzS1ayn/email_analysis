Yep.  I think I alluded to this further down in my message.   However,
I'd like to encourage the mode of thought that it's a much better plan
to try and find a utf-8 capable editor than to just fall back on the
entities.

In my experience, many English speakers don't think this is a big deal,
but as Tristan said, it can seriously affect readability and
maintainability of the source in a language like French (not to mention
Chinese or Russian, or even Czech [see below]). As Tristan said using
&eacute; is to be avoided if at all possible.

Here's an example of Czech text where accented characters use NCRs.
It's almost impossible to read.
