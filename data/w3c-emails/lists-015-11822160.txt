There are similar utilities for Windows users.  Uniconv is one that
comes to mind.

There's also a simple trick that tends to be easily available to most
Windows users but in my experience not well known: use MS Word to read
in the file as **encoded text** (not Word format !!), then save it back
out again. You are offered a very large choice of encodings to save it
in, one of which is utf-8.

Note that you can do a similar thing with Notepad on XP, but it's not a
good idea since it adds a byte order mark to the beginning of a utf-8
file which then causes problems in some browsers.

(Of course, it's much easier just to edit in or save out as utf-8 from
your editor ;)

For example to convert from iso-8859-1 to utf-8

karl% iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 fileold.html > filenew.html

If you want to convert a lot of files, create a small scripts like that.

==================
#!/bin/sh
#
# Shell Script
# to convert a file from Latin 1 to utf-8

WEBDIR=`find  /home/mywebsites/files/ -name '*.html'`

echo "********** Converting File *******"
for i in $WEBDIR;
do
     iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 $i > $i.new
     mv $i.new $i
done
