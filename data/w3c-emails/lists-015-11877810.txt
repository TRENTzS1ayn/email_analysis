-=====================================================================-
-     W3C Link Checker - version 3.9.2 - first standalone release     -
-=====================================================================-

It is with great pleasure that we are announcing today the first
standalone release of the W3C link checker (a.k.a checklink), the
popular free tool and service for checking the status of links on a web
site: finding broken links and solving authentication issues made easy!

Previously bundled as part of the W3C Markup Validator suite, the free
online W3C link checker service has been updated with this latest
release version:

http://validator.w3.org/checklink

In addition to that, we now distribute checklink as a free, standalone
tool, which should be very easy to install and use as a commandline
tool, or a service on your Web site.



**  DOWNLOAD the LINK CHECKER  **

The Link Checker is available for downloading on the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network (CPAN) at:

http://search.cpan.org/dist/W3C-LinkChecker/



**  FEEDBACK  and  DEVELOPMENT  **

The link checker is a living, evolving tool, and we are committed to
make it even better than it is today. You can help us by sending us
e-mails with your thoughts or bug reports to the *public* W3C mailing
list www-validator:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/

Note that this list is used for feedback on several different tools, so
we suggest that you tag your messages regarding checklink in the subject
of your e-mail, e.g:

Subject: [checklink] bug report - ....


Developers are encouraged to get the latest development version of the
code for Link Checker at any time from our CVS repository:

http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/perl/modules/W3C/LinkChecker/

Patches, comments and insight on the code are absolutely welcome, also
on the *public* mailing list www-validator.



**  CHANGES  **

The major change between the previous stable version and this release
is obviously the fact that the Link Checker is now distributed as a
standalone tool, but there are other notable improvements:

* Better documentation
   - documentation for the command line use
   - an embedded man page
* New features
   - New option to disable checking documents on non-public IP addresses
* Bug fixes
   - Improved redirect loop detection
   - Recursion scope checking fixes
   - Markup improvements
   - Various other small bug fixes

**  CREDITS  **

The first version of the Link Checker was developed in 1998 by Renaud
Bruyeron, then Hugo Haas rewrote it more or less from scratch in 1999.
The Link checker is currently maintained and developed, with the help
of many volunteers, by the W3C QA Tools Development Team, especially by
Ville Skytt?.
