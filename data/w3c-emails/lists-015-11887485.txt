I didn't know this Web site, but now it's done. Quite cool.


http://www.webstandardsawards.com/

  The Web Standards Awards aim to highlight the best in 
standards-compliant  web site design, therefore there are some checks a 
site must pass before  we will consider it for an award.

  Mandatory criteria:
 Main pages should validate as HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 compliant using 
the W3C validator. Some exceptions may be given for obvious 
typographical errors and the inclusion  of rich media, such as Flash.
  Pages must maintain ? in  spirit ? a separation between data and 
presentation, such as that enabled by the coupled  usage of XHTML and 
CSS.
  Appropriate tags must be used to mark up data i.e. tables  are for 
tabular data.

  While assessing a site, the judges will consider the following  points:
 Visual appeal
 Degree of separation between data and presentation
 Quality of code
 Usability
 Accessibility
 Uniqueness
