hello,
i,m W. You,
i have a question :
i saw in older documents the html tag ISINDEX and i thought maybe 
this older kind of html tags should be reconsidered after all,maybe they
are not so useless as it seems they are, or maybe used together with newer html
tags would help increasing the relevance of an html webpage.
why i'm saying all this?  because people tend to still use  the normal html documents
there are smaller quantities of xml  dhtml  document pages on the internet.
it is interesting to see some examples of older and newer html tags used together
in a webpage and the relevancy of such a html document compared to a similar one 
in which are used only the accepted html tags.
best regards
 
W. Yuo
