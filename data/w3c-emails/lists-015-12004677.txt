Hi Olivier, Karl and Dom,

Please see below ... can we please come up with a suitable longdesc for the graph in the recently published "WaSP asks W3C" (WaW)?

Thanks,

Hey Nigel,

The alt text is exactly what alt text should be, as far as I'm concerned
- simple and to the point. But a longdesc or even title would be
beneficial in this case, since there's so much extra data that's
locked-up in the image.

Any suggestions on how we'd go about summarizing a multi-tiered graph as
text?

Hi Dave,

In the following recent WaSP article:
http://www.webstandards.org/learn/askw3c/feb2004.html

The alternative description for the image 'graph of ccpp' is
disappointing, surely there should be a longdesc?

Cheers,
Nigel
