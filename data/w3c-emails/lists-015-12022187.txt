I am still not sure what you are talking about.

*Could you give more context?*

Why? What? How? etc.

- - - Is it stats of usage for the browsers?




Things like http://www.upsdell.com/BrowserNews/stat.htm

Which are never quite exact, for example, Opera Browser to be able to 
access some Web sites which do browser detection fake its id and is 
counted as IE.

You have also plenty of browsers that are not counted but still are an 
important part of people using the Web.

Voice Browsers
Braille Readers
Mobile Phones (a lot in Europe and Asia, North America is years late 
on this topic)
Text Browsers
Authoring Tools which can be browsers too
Bots

etc.
