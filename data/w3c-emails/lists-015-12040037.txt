People (and others) are currently using virtually _all_ released
versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape browsers as well as many
other browsers. Are you interested in the currently most popular
browsers and their versions? The answer will depend on your web site

If you are interested in making your pages "look good" in currently
popular browsers, you can start with

HTH,
