Hi,

Something that could be very useful  for Web developers would be to 
have Implementation Report of Open source software. I would like to 
know if people have ideas to organize that and in which fora.

The test suites are often available, we just need tables for each open 
source products.

In the QA Matrix [1], we can find links to already existing Test Suite, 
like the ones made by the CSS WG (Tantek, Ian, and Co)

+ Should we invite the Web community to test the softwares?
+ Should we encouraged the Open Source community to do it themselves 
giving them a few recommendations.
+ Where should it be hosted?
+ Should we use EARL [2] or not?

Ideas?

Examples of Implementation Report:
