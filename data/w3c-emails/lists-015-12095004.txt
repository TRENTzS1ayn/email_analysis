You may want to get in touch with Peter Schonefeld and the  SVG Foundation
who are currently producing a way to make it easier for the implementation
report of SVG more accessible to producers and less burdensome on the WG.
We've also evangelised the KSVG people into providing a review of KSVG when
it's released, and that should be there.  I think it's a very good idea to
encourage the community to do this, especially if we can provide an
automated method
