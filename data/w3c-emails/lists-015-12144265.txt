Interesting discussion is happening these days on Weblogs. It has 
started with XML Error handling, and shows the importance of QA like

"""Ask someone who does HTML/CSS quality assurance (QA) for a Web 
browser, or who has written code for a browser's layout engine. They'll 
go on at length about the insanities that they have seen, but the short 
version is that pretty much any random stream of characters has been 
written by someone somewhere and been labelled as HTML."""

and
"""Specifications should ensure that compliant implementations 
interoperate, whether the content is valid or not."""
