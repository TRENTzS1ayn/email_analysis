A new version of W3C's Log Validator, the modular Web server log 
analysis tool with a strong focus on quality, was released today.
http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/LogValidator/

In addition to a few bug fixes and additional features, this version is 
shipped with two new log processing modules, one validating documents 
against the W3C CSS validation service, and an experimental survey 
module.

* Thanks *

Thanks a lot to Matthieu Faure for contributing his SurveyEngine 
Module. The module is still under development and we hope to improve it 
further and make it a very useful global statistic module for the Log 
Validator.

Also, thanks to Bjoern Hoehrmann for his 
WebService::Validator::CSS::W3C perl module, which made the iterfacing 
of the Log Validator with the W3C CSS Validator straightforward.


* Changes *

Extended list of changes since the latest stable version (0.2 - May 
2003)
   - adding CSSValidator Module
   - Adding (experimental) SurveyEngine Module
   - adding support for "w3" log format
   - changed output for clearer display of results
   - added an option to set the From: address in Output::Mail
   - the LogValidator now checks for the actual Content-Type of 
documents with no extension (e.g format negociated)


* Feedback *

The Log Validator is an open source project maintained by the W3C 
Quality Assurance activity. For any feedback, question, suggestion or 
contribution regarding this tool, please send e-mail to the public list 
www-validator[1] (mention the log validator in the subject) or to me 
(ot@w3.org) directly.
