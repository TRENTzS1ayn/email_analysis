FYI: The use of W3C Standards in danish authorities home pages
I have made a fresh minor survey for the use of W3C Standards in Denmark
(February 2004) In Denmark, the Danish Ministry for Science, Technology
and Innovation strongly encourage all governmental/national/municipal
authorities to use W3C standards (HTML/XHTML standards) on their Web
pages. This survey has run a test on 2033 danish authorities home pages.
The testing tool was the W3C Validator. Only 3,05 % of the home pages
was valid according to the W3C Validator. 71 % of the testing home pages
did have problems with the missing DOCTYPE-declaration and character
encoding labeling (iso-8859-1, UTF-8 etc)

You can find an english summary and major findings from the survey here
