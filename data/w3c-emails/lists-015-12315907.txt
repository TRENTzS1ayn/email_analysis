It's a very impresssive *manual* work you have done.
* Have you thought about using automatic tools to do it?
* If no, was it because you had not all skills to create a program for 
that purpose?
* Or have you identified things which can not be done automatically?

What would we be your dream tools to do that.

Your process seems to be:

1. List of URIs
2. Detect if Frame or Not
3. Doctype Yes/No
  - If no doctype -> invalid
  - If doctype -> send to the W3C Validator
4. Which Doctype?
5. Encoding Problems (what kind of test? validator? visual? -> 
web-sniffer.net)
6. Number of Errors Validity (Not a good criteria because of 
cascading). density of errors is a better criteria, but still not 
perfect.

One possible problems, the Web site does browser sniffing and the Web 
page which has been sent is not really the home page, but a message 
page (error or indirection).

Do you have examples of tools producing the right code?

Interesting comments. We are trying to improve the localization of the 
W3C validator.

That would be very interesting. You would be pleased to know that the 
W3C Mark-Up validators is mainly developped by Scandinavian persons. Do 
you think that the Denmark government could finance such an effort for 
the Danish version?

:) Yes I see what you mean. I think that Governments have a lot of 
possible outcome on vendors if they associate their requests and 
efforts to create pressure.

Do you know Marko Karppinen effort?

which seems to have been stopped.
