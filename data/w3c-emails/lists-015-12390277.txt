Hello,

 >  does the Swedish government also recommend/advocate W3C standards

Yes they do.

At a political level there is no question about adherence to standards 
-- standards: "YES"

At a practical level, there is a great variation in how well different 
agencies succeed in complying to these standards -- standards: "we 
THOUGHT we were OK".

Part of the problem is that the public sector uses commercial tools for 
content-management/publishing, and such tools fail to comply to 
standards. The situation is gradually getting better, of course, but 
slowly (at the pace that Marko Karppinen detected in his investigation).

There was an initial unfounded expectation that if rules about web 
standards for the public sector are stated (at the government level), 
then everything will automatically become compliant. Now there is a 
growing insight that such rules only indirectly have an impact on the 
public websites:
 
    public policy is stated [standard compliancy]
     --> requirements for procurement of authoring/publishing tools
     --> tool vendors see a requirement from a potentially big market
     --> the vendors adapt their tools to these requirements
     --> the public sector agencies get good tools
     --> the public sector must learn how to use theese tools in correct 
ways
     --> .... and then we will see good pages on the web

At the moment there are a number of initiatives in the public sector to 
support the complex of web-presence of the public sector. One aspect is 
compliance to technical standards, another is living up to accessibility 
requirements (WAI), yet other things concerns usability in the broader 
spectrum, as well as interoperability across different agencies (not 
only web services, but also syndication of information).

There was a broad investigation of accessibility (WAI) issues in the 
public sector -- it created a heated debate about how such evaluations 
should be performed. I know of no large scale investigation of 
compliance to technical standards in the public sector.

But, of course, such a study could be done.
