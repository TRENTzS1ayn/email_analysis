Do you mean with regards to other specifications than HTML like for 
example accessibility?
or with regards to the semantics defined in each HTML specifications 
(taking into account, there's no conformance section defining that an 
HTML document MUST respect the Semantics of HTML.)

Do you have something else in mind?

What kind of checker would you imagine? How will it operate? 
Automatically, manually?

You could contribute to the Mailing list www-html@w3.org or you could 
explore possibilities of good markup for HTML.

http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTMLBestPractices

Someone has already started that and with the contribution of many 
people, he has explored HTML Markup. I'm pretty sure, it could be 
pushed a bit further.

He will publish a book (PS: I don't know if all people who have 
participated in the comments will have money in return or at least a 
free copy of the book ;)).
