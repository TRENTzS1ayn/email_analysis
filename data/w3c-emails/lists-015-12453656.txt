;) Yes Except that for example

http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#edef-ADDRESS

"""The ADDRESS element may be used by authors to
supply contact information for a document or a major
part of a document such as a form. This element often
appears at the beginning or end of a document."""

And has you pointed it in
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/conform#didx-HTML_document
"""An HTML document is an SGML document that
meets the constraints of this specification."""

And in the same page

"""The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC2119]. However, for readability, these words
do not appear in all uppercase letters in this
specification."""

Which makes for ADDRESS element a MAY.
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt

"""5. MAY   This word, or the adjective
"OPTIONAL", mean that an item is truly
optional."""

So you might come as best with a warning. :)


I have already an exercise with this game.

I have not done the MAY.
