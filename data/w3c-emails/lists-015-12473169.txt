I'm struggling with a question for the last month, and I would like to 
hear your opinion on it.

* What do we mean when we say backward compatible in the context of the 
Web?
* How would you define it?
* Do you define it with regards
- to the specifications?
- to the tools?
- to the authoring techniques?
