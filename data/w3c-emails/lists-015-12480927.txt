Yes :)
And it's very important to define what we consider mandatory or not. 
Conformance model of a specification is not easy to do, specifically 
when it comes to the definition of the semantics of the elements and 
their content. And we had comments for the QA Framework that we were 
abusing the RFC 2119 keywords.

I have never seen an XHTML/HTML book explaining how to write HTML not 
by explaining the tags but by explaining the semantics of text and by 
using the appropriate tags when needed. Maybe it will finally come with 
XHTML 2.0.

Though it would be still worthwhile to write one for XHTML 1.0. I 
remember to have discussed the topic in the past with (2 years ago) 
with Molly?Holzschlag. (ah... If I had more time).

On the validation topic from a secret informer on my messenger, with 
contenunu  <humour/> secret name has given me these interesting links
