Karl,

It could be the philosophy behind the validator has changed, but in Nov. 2002,
I reported that the validator did not check for problems such as links to
fragments that do not exist. (e.g. <a href="#tex"> with no corresponding id=tex
or name=tex in the document).
At the time it was stated that it wasn't a priority for the validator to find
problems such as this, unless it was covered by the DTD. i.e. strictly speaking
it wasn't a validation problem.

(Nov 2002 on the www-validator list.)

So my understanding is that just because a page validates, it doesn't mean that
it is likely error-free.
