I think "link checker" verifies this type of mistakes: internal links 
of a document
http://validator.w3.org/checklink

Would you be interested to
1. make the list of all requirements MUST, MAY, SHOULD, etc included 
in the HTML Spec. (MUST are already done, see my previous message.)
2. give an example on what do you think a validator should work with 
such a list. Implementation requirements for the validator to be able 
to detect or warn users.

It can be a collective  effort of the mailing list. Though I'm not sure 
of the right forum for that? public-qa-dev? www-qa? or here?

Olivier, what do you think about it?
