I agree with Tex. Ideally, there needs to be one validator that is as
complete as possible for a given environment. For example, online
checks could include link checks and HTTP compliance/robustness checks
as an option. If that validator can accept plugins to validate new
things, the validator development can be more distributed. However,
from a validator user point of view, it does not really matter.

I would also add that it would be great if that validator can be
installed as a local library of some kind, to be integrated with
content development and content generation tools. This requirement
implies writing Perl and other wrappers and/or providing a local
service with a simple socket interface.

The output can be a very simple XML output (error ID, location,
informal text), I guess. Sophisticated wrappers can be added in some
environments to provide nice rendering and additional features such as
links to specs.

Alex.
