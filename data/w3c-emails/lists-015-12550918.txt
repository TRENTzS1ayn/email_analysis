Agreed with an integrated tool but it takes a lot of efforts and a lot 
of resources and engineering to create. Do not forget that the 
validator is a volunteer effort. It is developed by valuable people who 
are not counting their time and make it true.

Without volunteers:

Terje Bless, Bj?rn H?hrmann, Nick Kew,  Ville Skytt?

and Olivier Thereaux (W3C), there would be no progress at all on the 
validator.
See the full list (http://validator.w3.org/about.html)

A common API would be valuable.

CSS Validator is a java program
MarkUp Validator is a perl program
Link checker is a perl program

You have other validators around too like the RDF, there's a new one 
developped outside of W3C which is an XForms Validator (still 
experimental).

EARL as a reporting language can do that for the report and combine 
results.
As an input usually you have a file or an URI, there's nothing much you 
can do.

Many tools already do that. They are sending files to the validators or 
they have syntax checking (like BBEdit), or they have local validation 
(like emacs)

Until now you said: internal links, which can be easily checked 
automatically.

With regards to the desires of a HTML checker:

* How do you check that a "blockquote" is used for making a citation?
* What kind of ouput would you like to see of such a tool?
* How would you test the different requirement of that section?

"""
For example, to specify that the character
encoding of the current document is "EUC-JP",
a document should include the following META
declaration:
<META http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=EUC-JP">
The META declaration must only be used when
the character encoding is organized such that
ASCII-valued bytes stand for ASCII characters
(at least until the META element is parsed).
META declarations should appear as early as possible in the HEAD 
element.
