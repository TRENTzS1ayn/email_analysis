Karl,

The efforts of the volunteers and the limits of those resources are
appreciated.
The alternative to the integrated modular approach is to simply put more checks
in the existing validator, and have a strategy that allows more error detection
than validating against a dtd and catching other frequent errors.
This is lower cost to implement, but has its own drawbacks.

I am not sure why you asked about blockquote. It is often used for purposes
other than citation, so I am not sure I would check for that.

However, being an i18n bigot, I don't have a problem with reporting errors that
the meta statement should be first among meta statements, and the encoding
should match the declaration (to the extent it can be verified), etc.
and the encoding should be declared...
;-)

In any event, I understand that you would like suggestions on output formats
and the like, but I am concerned that report formats, integration, and other
issues, are tangential to my request and a distraction. Fundamentally, I am
just looking for detection of other kinds of frequently occurring errors beyond
dtd validation, and I am happy with whatever can be easily detected. So if
blockquotes being used for something other than citations is hard to detect,
there are still others that can be detected and useful to report... Maybe the
approach should not be to review the standard for all possible violations, but
to identify problems that vendors have had to contend with and checking for
these real world, typical mistakes.
