Hi Karl
   Checkers, validators will be developed by both commercial vendors and by
the open source community, such as the W3C tools.
   It strikes me that something that is needed is a test suite for such
checkers.  For example I ran link checkers for several years before finding
out (using the W3C link checker) that the tool was not checking for broken
links in the <LINK> element.
   So a link checker should check for link in A, IMG, FRAME, IFRAME, etc.
HTML elements, links generated in JavaScript, links in personalised/dynamic
pages (e.g. user-agent negotiation, language negotiation, etc.)
   I think it would be useful if W3C could produce a test suite containing a
range of errors, which users & developers of checking software would test
their programs against.
