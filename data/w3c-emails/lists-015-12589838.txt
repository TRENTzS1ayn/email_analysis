Yes completely agreed on that. And Olivier Th?reaux has started work 
since the begining of the year 2004 on that. It will take a bit of 
time, but it's in the process.

It's mainly a test suite for the Markup validator, but I'm pretty sure 
that it will be feasible once the framework organized to have one for 
the Link Checker. If we create a flexible process, people will be able 
to contribute to the test suite.
