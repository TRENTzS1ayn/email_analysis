And who is writing a test suite to test Olivier's test suite?

Seriously, while testing never hurts, and more testing usually
increases chances of finding bugs, there is always a point of
diminishing returns. I am [pleasantly] surprised to learn that W3C has
already built all the first-priority testing tools and is now
developing tools to test test suites, including its own validators.

IMHO, a large representative collection of known-to-be-valid and
known-to-be-invalid documents that are related to W3C standards would
indeed be a vary valuable resource for validator authors and beyond. A
test suite to test test suites should be a much lower priority.
