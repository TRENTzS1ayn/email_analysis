This would be a part of the large representative collection, useful
mostly for user agents, not validators. For collection to be more than
marginally useful for validators, it has to include lots of documents,
including realistic mixes of HTML, CSS, SVG/etc.,tiny and huge
documents, documents with very complex/deep internal structure, almost
broken documents, almost valid documents, broken links, link
loops/recursion of various kinds, etc., etc. Essentially, it should be
a representative sample of the Web, where each document is classified
and categorized.

This sounds like a normal tool development QA, not a full blown test
suite to test other test suites.
