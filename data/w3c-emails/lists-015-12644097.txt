The meaning of "backward compatible" in the context of the Web is
pretty much the same as in any other broad context. How about this,
to start with:

Backward compatibility: compatibility between X and Y,
                        where X existed prior to Y

Just like compatibility, backward compatibility is only defined for
given concepts or objects (X and Y).

Alex.
