Not a test suite for test suites indeed, but, as you know, testing a 
test tool brings an additional level of complexity from any "regular" 
testing of a tool being developed.

That said, testing test suites is an interesting goal, and I hope the 
experience gained from testing test tools will help us when/if we want 
to go down this road.
