Tex, all,

Validation is a very specific thing indeed. I'll note that some efforts 
to have the Markup Validator go beyond pure SGML validation in its 
checking has received a very harsh and negative response. Some purists 
prefer validation to remain validation, period.

That does not preclude us from integrating several tools, including 
validation, into one checker, as you suggest:

...and this is pretty much where the qa-dev team is going, albeit 
slowly...

As Karl said the effort is mostly done on a voluntary basis, and each 
step (such as choosing or adapting an existing parser) takes a lot of 
time. That said,

I think a high-level discussion on the "ideal integrated Web page 
checker" would be a good thing, even now. www-validator@w3.org would be 
the right forum for that. Tex, would you start such a discussion?

Also, anyone interested in participating in the development effort (and 
that does not necessarily mean big time consuming tasks for coding 
gods, quite the contrary) should feel free to contact me directly.

We have www-validator for that, reasonably adapted.

This list seems appropriate for such a topic, I think.
