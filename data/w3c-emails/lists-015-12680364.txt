After I have publish (2004-02-28) my danish survey about
governmental/national/municipal authorities and their use of W3C standards
(HTML/XHTML standards). Then I have got some e-mails with the question
"What about Danish private companies and the W3C standards?". I have now
made a minor survey about this issue. 

I have made a test on the 250 largest Danish companies home pages.
The picture is

62 % is missing the DOCTYPE-Declaration
25 % have problems with encoding

Only one company  did  follow the W3C standard 100 %. This gives 0.4 % of
all the 250 tested home pages
