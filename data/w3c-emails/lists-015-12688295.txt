Hi Soren,

Another interesting document I think if we publish a method and 
tools/templates to create such a survey, It might be possible to 
encourage people to do the same in their own country. I'm pretty sure 
for example the interop group in France would be happy to run such a 
survey.

It might also help us to identify where the efforts are needed and it 
will attract the press on such results.


* Is there a small group of volunteers on this mailing list to start 
such a guide?

The thread we already had on the list will make it easier to write.
