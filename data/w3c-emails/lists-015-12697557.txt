Well, I've got both..., see 

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2004Mar/att-0168/ieqacmd-sample-output.txt

for pretty-printed sample output for the invalid W3C XML
Schema homepage, <http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema>, and see

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2004Mar/0169.html

for 371 such reports for all W3C Member homepages. I look
forward to (X)HTML documents generated from the latter :-)

regards.
