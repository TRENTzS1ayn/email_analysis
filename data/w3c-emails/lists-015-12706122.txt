The GEO task force has published a new article:

Serving XHTML 1.0

At: http://www.w3.org/International/articles/serving-xhtml/


This very briefly describes some, often surprising, aspects of how 
servers send XHTML to the user agent (eg. a browser), and how common 
user agents handle the markup they receive. This article provides 
background information that helps explain why some aspects of CSS 
styling don't work the way you expect, but also sets the scene for the 
approach you should use for declaring encodings.

articles, tools, tests, and soon tutorials at
