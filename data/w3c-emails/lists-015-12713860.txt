Hi,

  Evangelizing Web Standards is getting boring. All we have is dry
specifications, some web sites, geeky validators and some badges [1]
in W3C's 20th century corporate design.

I think it is time to catch up with the Web Accessibility Initiative and
advertise Web Standards through Cooler Multimedia [2] which is part of
W3C's mission [3]. WAI's approach to advertise its deliverables through
music has proven to be very successful [4], hence I propose that the QA
Acitivity launches a theme song contest as a first step to encourage the
community to make web standards cooler through music.

The contest should be public, hence all it takes is setting up a cool
and convincing contest web site, a submission mailing list, a WBS poll
to let the community vote on submissions and means to make the public
aware of the contest. For the latter I propose to add a pointer to the
contest web site on the various Validator's homepages.
