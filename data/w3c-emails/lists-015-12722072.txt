Hi

I have wrote down some lyrics for a theme song. I just miss the reggae band,
a lead singer and a chorus. The song is based on Bob Marley's "One
love/People get ready"

The chorus sings the text in ()

Title "One Web / End Users get ready"

One Web! One Standard!
Let's surf together and feel all right.
Hear the End Users cryin' (One Web!);
Hear the End Users cryin' (One Standard!),
Sayin': give thanks and praise to the W3C and I will feel all right;
Sayin': let's surf together and feel all right. Wo wo-wo wo-wo!

Let them all remove all their dirty markups (One Web!);
There is one question I'd really love to ask (One Standard!):
Is there a place for the hopeless web designer,
Who has hurt all End Users just to save his own beliefs

One Web! What about the one Web One Standard!
What about - Let's surf together and feel all right
As it was in the beginning (One Web!);
So shall it be in the end (One Standard!),
All right!
Give thanks and praise to the W3C and I will feel all right;
Let's surf together and feel all right.
One more thing!

Let's get together to fight this Tag Soup (One Web!),
So when the Validator comes there will be no, no errors (One Web!).
There ain't no hiding place from the Validator of W3C.

Sayin': One Web! What about the One Standard (One Standard!)
What about the - Let's surf together and feel all right.

Give thanks and praise to the W3C and I will feel all right;
Let's surf together and feel all right.
Give thanks and praise to the W3C and I will feel all right;
Let's surf together and feel all right.

Regards
