At the May 3rd QA teleconf, Mark Skall has asked who was going to 
New-York during the W3C AC Meeting + WWW 2004 Conference.

If people from the QA WG/IG are willing to share an evening, there 
might be a possibility to catch up or to organize something all 
together. At least a simple dinner or a bar. People from the QA IG 
(www-qa) and public-evangelist are welcome to join.

Reply with your presence date, AC, WWW 2004

Karl: May 14 - May 22, AC: No, WWW 2004: Yes
(busy: May 14 to May 16)

Others?
