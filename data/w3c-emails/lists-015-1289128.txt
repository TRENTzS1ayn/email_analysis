Hi,

Since it looks like this work is going to be part of SWAD Europe, and
upon Danbri's advice, I'm posting this to this list. I have rewritten
big chunks of parser_#5 [1], in order to make it simpler.  It now
comes as two XSLT files:

- rdfc14n.xsl, which takes an RDF/XML file and 'canonicalises' it, to
striped syntax, adding rdf:Description, turning non rdf attributes on
resources into sub-elements and so on.

- rdfc2nt.xsl produces, from the output, the n-triples. It is actually a
simplified rdf2nt-mf.xsl

These two passes cannot be done within one XSLT transform (not in pure
XSLT 1.0, at least), hence the two file.I have tested them on the
examples of the RDF/XML spec, but there must be more complex files on
which it chokes.

Let me know if you find bugs, or if you don't but find it useful.
