[Note:
I'm writing up what I've been doing for internal communication
purposes within the ILRT, but I thought it might be helpful also to
send it to the SWAD-Europe list as a precedent for regular, informal
information sharing. It will not replace or be used as part of the more
formal EC reporting proceedures. I'd encourage others to do the same,
whether they are directly working under/funded by SWAD-Europe or just
doing related work.]

Here are some of the things I've been up to so far this month.

* sorting out the details of the W3C WAI/SWAD-Europe meeting on EARL and
on image annotation. Registration is now closed, but I will report back
to the public-esw@w3.org list. Nadia is hopefully going to show us some
RDFPic enhancements; Jim Ley (of SVG image annotation fame) is also
coming.

* looking at query testcases with Danbri and generally cleaning up my
query code, including moving to the ARP parser from SiRPAC, and writing
a new Squish Parser using javacc, using an early version of Andy
Seaborne's parser to learn from. The code is looking better but not
quite ready for a release. Both Dan and I have query testcases running,
for parser and results testing.

* chatting with Kate and others about the SWAD-Europe face to face and
equipment. Ruth and Kate have ordered computers and palms, with helpful
input from Dave. We decided to get an experimental iBook as well as a
dual-boot linux/win DELL laptop. We are struggling with the possible
security problems of getting a wireless hub.

* writing some experimental Perl code to modularise Martin Hamilton's
IMesh code.

cheers
