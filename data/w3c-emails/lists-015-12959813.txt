I am a little confused, I am hoping someone can clarify:

As per the first assertion made for 10.1.9, "setvalue actions with no 
model+ref or bind attribute MUST be ignored." there must be:
  a: a model and a ref attribute present otherwise the setvalue element is 
ignored.
  or
  b: a bind attribute present otherwise the setvalue element is ignored.

However, in the spec there is no reference made to a model attribute being 
required when there is only a ref attribute present, neither is there a 
model attribute in the example given with the assertion.

Which is correct?

Susan
