Charles,

No problem - I have booked a room for 30 people (with tables) all day
October 9th.

The large conference hall isn't free that day so if you are anticipating
more than 30 people then we need to either use two rooms or make other
arrangements.  Let me know how much space you think we need.

Andy

Hi all,

Following the Kick-off meeting, I am responsible for making sure we organise
the International Workshop. We are proposing to hold it on the topic of RDF
Querying, in conjunction with the W3C Web Ontology working group meeting in
Bristol 7-8 October.

At this stage I would propose holding a one day workshop on Wednesday the
9th of October, and we hope that Hewlett-Packard could host this workshop.

Cheers

Charles McCN
