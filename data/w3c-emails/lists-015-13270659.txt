You know, the most useful thing I've got out of reading this newsgroup
is to understand what a *fundamentally bad idea* it is for nondeterminism
in technical standards to be implicit.

In C99, what I'm complaining about is the "or by the omission of any
explicit definition of behavior" part of clause 4 #2:

# 4. Conformance
#
# 2  If a "shall" or "shall not" requirement that appears outside of a
#    constraint is violated, the behavior is undefined. Undefined behavior
#    is otherwise indicated in this International Standard by the words
#    "undefined behavior" or by the omission of any explicit definition
#    of behavior. There is no difference in emphasis among these three;
#    they all describe "behavior that is undefined".

Bye
