Pierre (and all),

Here is as promised a small overview of XMLSpec and what we need to do 
for the glossary with it.

XMLSpec is a DTD that was first designed to create the XML 
Specification (hence the name), and has since been used by several 
groups to create their specs, because it provides a rich vocabulary.

Our scraping system should be able to retrieve definitions and 
glossaries from both specifications written in "plain" HTML and XMLSpec 
(even though these may have an HTML version, using the XMLSpec version 
will have its advantages).

Here are a few pointers to get you started:
