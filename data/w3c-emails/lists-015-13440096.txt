Hi all.
As promised in my previous mail to the list, an alpha version of the glossary 
management system is now available at:
http://www.w3.org/2003/03/glossary-project/UI/home

Only the search features can be tested for the time being. 
There are some limitations though:
- everything that is related to the translations is not implemented yet
- the error handling for the forms is not optimal (i.e. it gives an unhelpful 
message when there is a missing field)

As we are moving forward in the development phase of the project, it would be 
very useful for us to get more data for testing. If you have glossaries 
available that you would like to see integrated in the prototype, please 
contact anyone of us: 

pcandela@sophia.inria.fr 
dom@w3.org 
ot@w3.org 

so that we can coordinate on this.

We would especially be interested in glossaries with translated entries.

FYI, the glossaries used in the tests are not perfect: some entries may have 
been missed (and others should have been) when the glossaries were generated.

Pierre Candela
