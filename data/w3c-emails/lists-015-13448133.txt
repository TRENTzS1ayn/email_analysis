Hello Pierre,

Many thanks for your work. Some comments:

- I would not display any UI elements that are not functional
   yet (e.g. 'display translations'). It will only confuse people.

- You should just look through Recommendations on the TR page and
   find those that contain glossaries and try to extract these.
   Once you have done that, you can then ask for more material,
   but I would do that on other lists (chairs, specprod,...).
   For translated glossaries, you should write to w3c-translators@w3.org.

- In particular, I would make sure that you get some terms from
   very central W3C specifications (e.g. XML) into your repository.
   For the average user, it will be much more motivating to
   e.g. select "A" and get "attribute" than to select "A" and
   get "all WG members".

- The form is served as iso-8859-1. You should use UTF-8 from
   the start to get internationalization right. It's much easier
   than changing later. See also
   http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-forms-utf-8.html.

- The A-Z radio buttons will not scale for translations,...
   (I guess you don't want to have 90,000 buttons for all the
    characters in Unicode :-).

- The interface looks good for people who know very precisely
   what they want (look up one specific term), but it would be
   good if it encouraged more browsing. One idea is to have the
   list of sources and languages displayed directly instead of
   hidden in pulldowns.

- french (QC): This should be changed to French (CA). Language
   names should be capitalized. Also, there should be something
   for French and for English in general. Some actual entries
   may not be in a specific sublanguage, and, more important,
   users may not care about the differences for lookup.

- Please provide a link to a page describing the implementation.
   This is interesting now but also serves as a documentation later.

- Please have a look at what Ivan did for translations:
   http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/,
   http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/OverviewLang,
   http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/OverviewTech,
   http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/Overview.
   (the last one gives explanations of how it is done)

Keep up your good work!

Regards,    Martin.
