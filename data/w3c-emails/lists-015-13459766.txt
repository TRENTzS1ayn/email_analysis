Sidar maintains a number of translations in Spanish / Castellano (es - 
which has several varieties) and a couple of things in Gallego and 
Catalan (2 more of the 4 official languages in Spain).

We would be happy to offer the glossaries from any of those. One that 
might be interesting is the translation of the WAI combined glossary 
that was done and checked over by the Sidar translator's group - i.e. 
we vouch for it being an accurate translation, which we have done for 
some but not all of the translations we maintain.

I realise that W3C doesn't authorise translations, but some other 
organisations do, at least for their own purposes. Being able to find 
out whether a translation had been endorsed by any particular group 
would be handy.

Yep...

Same for Spanish - es-ES and es-AR are actually reasonably different in 
their technical vocabularies (Spaniards use a lot more spanish terms 
than Argentines, who tend to adopt terms as they find them), but people 
speaking spanish are interested in both kinds...

Yes...

Cheers
