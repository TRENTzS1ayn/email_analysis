Since May 07: 
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-glossary/2003May/0001.html)

- selected a toolkit for the back-end: RDFLib (http://rdflib.net/)
- factored my XSLT stylesheets
- implemented a couple of "query" use cases: by keywords (no wildcards 
supported yet), by glossaries, alphabetical
- implemented some "update/edit" use cases: add concept/definition, delete 
concept/definition (NB: those CGI scripts are being tested on a local setup, 
at the time being)

"To do" in the next few days:
- update my scripts et stylesheets so that they use Dom's new version of the 
schema: http://www.w3.org/2003/03/glossary-project/schema
- integrate Olivier's UI for the query results
- learn how to use CVS (may require more than a few days)
- add wildcard support for the search by keywords
- list all the glossaries in an RDF file (will see with Dom for the datamodel)

"To do" in the next couple of weeks:
- implement some more use cases: http://www.w3.org/2003/03/07-glossary.html


Once the UI of the query results is improved, we'll publish an alpha version 
of the glossary management system to demonstrate the work done.

As always, comments and questions are welcomed.
