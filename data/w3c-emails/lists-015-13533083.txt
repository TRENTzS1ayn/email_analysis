Greetings,

As a follow-up to the Technical Plenary meeting we had about the W3C
Glossary project, Wendy Chisholm took the time to write and publish the
minutes of this meeting:
http://www.w3.org/2003/03/07-glossary.html

Please send any corrections you would have on these.

Besides, the technical aspects of the project have started to be
developed: Pierre Candela, our intern in France, has written a first
analysis of the project requirements, with an informative development
schedule:

Your comments and suggestions on this are also welcome!

(hopefully, the work on the data model will start soon:
