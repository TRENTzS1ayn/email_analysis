Hi all,

Those of you who were at the first meeting in Boston may remember that 
we had thought of another face-to-face meeting during the WWW 
conference in Budapest (in two weeks) in the form of a BoF session.

I would like to know who on this list would be interested by such a 
meeting.
Could you send me a private e-mail if you are? That will help assessing 
potential participation. Thanks.

Small status update on the project while I'm here...

* Pierre has been working on additional XSLT to handle data in XMLSpec.
* We've tackled a few general issues, and Dominique and Pierre are 
still working on the Data Model.
* I'm currently working on (navigable) UI mockups

Regards, olivier.
