Hi,

As part of the Semantic Web Advanced Development for Europe (SWAD-E)
(http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/) project, myself and my colleagues are
developing an RDF schema for representing thesaurus data.  This schema and
the underlying datamodel may be of interest, as it looks like they overlap
considerably with the data and model being developed in the Glossary
project.   

The current state of the schema can be found here
(http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/SWAD/thesaurus/tif/tif.html) with a link to a
document describing the work so far done
(http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/SWAD/thesaurus/tif/deliv81/final.html).   

This work is ongoing, and comments and feedback are very welcome at this
stage.  

We are also beginning development of an open API for thesaurus (terminology)
web service.  At this stage we are looking for well-defined use-cases
relating to web applications of thesaurus & terminology data.  Any interest
and/or contribution to this most welcome also.  

Yours,

Alistair Miles.
