Hello,

Pierre Candela, our intern working on the Glossary Project, has finished
his internship at the beginning of the month; this means that the first
phase of the glossary project is now done.

A few glossaries have been entered in the glossary database:
http://www.w3.org/2003/glossary/
For instance, one of the use case for such a tool of comparing the
definitions of "user agent" across W3C specifications can now be easily
achieved:
http://www.w3.org/2003/glossary/keyword?show_def=yes&show_trans=no&offset=0&size=20&keywords=user+agent&index=All&lang=All
retrieves 9 different definitions for this term.

The full set of glossaries has hence 641 concepts:
http://www.w3.org/2003/glossary/subglossary?show_def=yes&show_trans=no&offset=0&size=20&index=All
We plan to add new glossaries over time, but with a strong preference
for stable glossaries (e.g. glossaries included in Recommendations).

Although there is some tweaking needed for the user interface (see the
todo list [1]), the interface also allows to enter translations for the
various terms and definitions; entering a translation only requires
having a W3C Public or Member Account, and each translation is
associated with the name of its contributor.
Nevertheless, we still need to refine the social process behind
translations before anouncing this to a large forum (feedback on this
aspect is welcome).

The interface also allows to add/delete glossaries, concepts,
definitions, etc., those operations being reserved to the W3C Team for
now.

This list is informed as the first customer of this tool; there is
definite need for an announce on a broader audience (chairs ? WGs ?), as
there is a need for a more detailed technical documentation on the
various technologies used in this system (Pierre's report being a very
good basis for this).

Thanks to Pierre for the great work he produced during his internship!
Please send your comments and suggestions, but note that this system is
in maintenance mode for the time being (ie, bugs will be fixed as much
as possible, but important new features will have to wait).
