Thanks :)

There isn't any real selection criteria, except the existence of an
extractable glossary... I thought there was none in XML 1.0 and XML NS,
but having looked at the XMLSpec version, there was indeed one, and they
are now integrated in the Glossary system... If you have other
suggestions of glossary, please let me know...

I have added the definition of "concept" on the home page of the
project; basically, a term conveys the idea that a concept has -
basically, the concept is the platonical idea, while the term is is the
word (or one of the word) that allows to say it in a given language.

That's something we want to do in a next phase of the project, but as I
said in 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-glossary/2003Sep/0000.html
we don't have resources right now to develop further the project; we are
in a bug fix mode, and I don't plan to integrate big new features for
now.
