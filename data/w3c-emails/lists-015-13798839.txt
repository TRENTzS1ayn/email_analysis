Indeed, I disabled it a few weeks ago - I should have mentioned that
here, sorry about that. Due to the lack of a well-defined policy on who
and how these translations should be registered in the global Glossary,
it seemed easier just not to allow them for now, hoping the translations
capabilities of the system can be used once the situation is clarified.
