Hello Dominique,

The glossary should be organized so that anybody can add a translation
(i.e. propose a translation), but that there can be different translations
for one and the same term, and they are annotated by whom proposed them.
This is important to be able to really use the glossary system for actual
work by the various translators.

Regards,    Martin.
