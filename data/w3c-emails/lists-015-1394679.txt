Hi,
I hope you don't mind, I'm forwarding your query to the Semantic Web Europe
list, as although Bali is a long way away, they're looking at use
cases/scenarios etc. My own comments below.

The way you've approached looks reasonable, though I think the implicit
stage you've skipped here is probably pretty important, the identification
of the players in the statements and the identification of the roles. e.g.
Prof. Wayan is presumably a person, so finding an existing vocabulary that
includes this so you can qualify this part of the whole statement is
probably a useful first step. The same follows with the other entities -
e.g. genetic engineering might well be an Open Directory category. But the
process I'm applying there depends on my prior knowledge of the
vocabularies - in practice a repository like the MEG Registry, the DAML
ontology lists or the SWAG Dictionary should be helpful for tracking these
down. I think the abstraction technique you used on the properties is valid.
I guess if a search for terms matching 'evoker', 'action' etc proves
unrewarding then you will have to generalise this back some more (tricky
with 'action'!), or identify the domain ('processes' in this case?) and do a
search on that. If that still doesn't get you anywhere, then it's time to
refer to the (mostly vapourware) guides on creating your own terms/vocabs.

I suppose the modelling process is essentially the same as that found in
other fields like object modelling, E-R or RDBMS schema creation. With a bit
of luck large chunks of the numerous guidelines for those could be
transmogrified into RDF design patterns.

Cheers,
Danny.
