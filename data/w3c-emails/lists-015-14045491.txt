An early draft of the WAI requirements doc can be found at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2002OctDec/0206.html (let me know if you cannot access this).  The archive contains some comments on the document from WAI personnel.

We were planning to intersect this document and add our own requirements if possible.

Please take a look and let me know what you think (I will also do so).

Cheers,
RI
