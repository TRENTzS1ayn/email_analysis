The first deliverable in WP 12.1 (open demonstrators - selection of 
demonstrators) is now due and I've just uploaded our report to the web site. 

It is currently at:
 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/open_demonstrators/hp-applications-selection.html
Please let me know if this is the right place or whether it should be moved to
conform to some naming convention.

As noted earlier we actually made some informal notes on quite a few (~60)
existing and proposed semantic web applications in RDF format[*]. The appendix
of this report contains a formatted version of this raw data. Putting the data
in the same document made it a bit large so we've separated the appendix out
into a separate document. Please let me know if you think this is not
appropriate and would prefer some different formatting scheme. 

Feedback on the report itself is welcome too!

What is our procedure for reviewing/accepting deliverables?
I assume uploading to the web site was OK given our open-source stance but I
don't want to subvert whatever "due process" we have/intend to have.

[*] We'd be happy to have the RDF files (currently one file per entry) and
associated schema public but (a) I wasn't sure on where that sort of stuff
should go on the site layout and (b) it might be better to do that along with a
web form to allow more contributions to be added but doing that well would quite
a bit of work.
