FYI.  Note that, essentially, w3c mail services are unlikely to be
affected for pretty much the whole of the day of 28th dec. (meaning
'day' in terms of the East Coast US time zone).

We have received the final date and times for the planned power outage
on 28 Dec 2002.

Pending discussion, it is likely the power outage may occur on the
evening prior to the scheduled power shutdown.

Please make note, list, and mail services, as well as write access to
the site will be suspended during the power outage.

At a meeting this morning the schedule for the power outage on Dec. 28th
was detailed and currently is as follows:

0500 NE43 closed to non-essential personnel

0700 Building power shutdown

1800 Approximate time for power-up

Hopefully, we can have the building reopened to everyone two hours after
the power is restored.

This work will put us back onto the tranformers near Main St. and the
plan is for the building to remain on those transformers until *after*
we move to Stata.
