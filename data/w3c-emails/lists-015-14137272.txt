Chaps,

You can find a first batch of VERY rough notes from me at
http://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/checklists/i18n-guidelines.html

These are all prompted by a quick reading of section 5, but I have added
one or two other thoughts that sprang to mind as I went.

I tried to roughly organise things in terms of the tasks we were
enabling the audience to complete, and made a quick and dirty stab at
which things would be relevant to what type of audience.

Cheers,
RI
