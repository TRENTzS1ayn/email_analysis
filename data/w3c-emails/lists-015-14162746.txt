Hi, I have a flu so my fevered brain might not be working clearly (well
as clear as it gets anyway), so I wonder:

1) Do we have a goal for number of FTF's per year?
2) Do we have a goal for regional distribution of the FTF's?
3) Do we have milestones which might drive the need to meet?

It might be easier to answer the questions below if we knew our
objectives.
For example, if we thought we should meet 4 vs 6 vs 8 times per year, it
would be easier to answer the need to meet in Jan, Feb or Mar.
Also if we had an idea that one in "N" meetings should be in Europe or
Asia/Pac to accomodate those members we could gauge the suitability of
Prague or other locations. We can also then tie in to other events we
might attend. Later our meeting dates will be driven by our need to
publish (and therefore meet) before milestone dates.

For the near term, I think the more the merrier so we can come together
as a team (in a social sense, with agreements on working styles and
processes).

That said, I can't make Wash.
Prague and Boston are ok.

I wonder if video conferencing is possible? Does w3c cambridge have
video conf. abilities so those of us in boston could attend Wash. that
way?

ok back to fighting the fever.
