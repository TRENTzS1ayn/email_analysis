My first reaction is that it wouldn't make much sense to have two FTF's 
close together. But on second thoughts it might provide a timeframe for 
us to work towards if we had clearly identified milestones or tasks for 
each FTF.

But its academic to me in a sense, since I could only attend either in a 
virtual sense, by teleconference or videoconferencing.

Really depends on whether we can get through enough material to make the 
Microsoft FTF worthwhile. I suspect that a FTF at Microsoft and Boston 
may be too close to get any real benefit from the second FTF, unless 
we're quite focused. Depends onhow much we can work through between the 
two FtF's within the context of our other commitments.
