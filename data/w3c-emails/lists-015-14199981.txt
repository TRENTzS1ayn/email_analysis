Richard,

It would be easier to give an opinion on when to do face to face if we had a better idea what our agendas would be for the meetings.  With out an agenda and just looking at meeting times, it makes more sense to meet in March at the Tech Plenary, than to have one  January in Seattle, One at the beginning of March for the Tech Plenary and then one at the end of March in Prague.

Regards, Russ

Chaps,

Yesterday Martin and I were discussing the Technical Plenary in March. Our discussion lead me to want to check our plans for upcoming face-to-face meetings. 

We are currently scheduled to meet at Microsoft's offices on 23,24 January near Seattle (thanks Russ!).

Other opportunities for face to face meetings include:

A] During the W3C Technical Plenary, 3-7 March in Boston.  (The Tech Plenary is a chance for many WGs to hold co-located meetings so that they can discuss things together / observe each other ).

B] Around the Internationalization & Unicode Conference, 24-26 March in Prague.

**************************
Could all WG members please send in their thoughts on the following asap (since we ought to finalise plans for the Tech Plenary today.)  
**************************


1] Does it still make sense to have a separate FTF at Microsoft, given the Tech Plenary in Boston in March?

2] Who would like to hold a meeting during the Tech Plenary?

3] Who would like to hold a meeting at the IUC in Prague?

4] If we do hold a meeting at Microsoft before the Tech Plenary, is the timing right, or should we move it into February.


Many thanks,
RI
