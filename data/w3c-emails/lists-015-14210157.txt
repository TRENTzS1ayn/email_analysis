Chaps,

Thanks to all who responded.  Sorry for the rush, but the deadline for
the Tech Plenary arrangements was suddenly upon us.  Having just spoken
with Russ, I'm leaning toward the idea of skipping the Seattle meeting,
and going for a meeting at the Technical Plenary in Boston.  Dates would
be 3 and 4 March.

Lets discuss this as one of our top priorities on Wednesday and take a
decision.

Cheers,
RI
