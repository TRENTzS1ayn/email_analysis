Nice work!

In http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/ we've put each of the other
deliverables in a directory named after the short name for the
deliverable. Makes cross-linking from other indices a bit easier.

If you could copy yours into a 'chosen_demos_rationale_report'
subdirectory, that would be good. I can clean up the other directories if
you have any difficulty doing so (remind me, how are you editing the
site? jigedit? cvs?).

Seems OK to me.

One tiny thing that jumped out from a quick skim: s/Wiener/Winer/

I do like the idea of focussing on weblog-style apps. Is nicely nearterm,
potential for mass uptake, network effects etc...

There's something of a watch-this-space where better process should live.
Checking works in progress into the site is fine...

A subdirectory of the reports dir would be fine. For other misc things,
just create a dated directory in the .../sw/Europe/YYYYMM/etc/ tree, eg
sw/Europe/200211/appsurvey-data/

and (b) it might be better to do that along with a

Yup
