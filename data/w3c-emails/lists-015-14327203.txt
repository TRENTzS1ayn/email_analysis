Very nice notes.

It would be very good to note that at least on the Web,
NFC should always be preferred. I.e. don't just say

U+00E3 U+0300 or U+0061 U+0303 U+0300
LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH TILDE WITH COMBINING GRAVE

But make it clear that U+00E3 U+0300 is the right way to go.
This will help a lot for low-level comparisons,...

I checked this one, and it was in NFC. But I didn't see
a language indication for Dinka. Maybe there is no code?

Don't at least some of these technologies offer the possibility to
define glyphs for combinations of characters? Also, please check
SVG and see whether it contains the necessary mechanisms (it should!).

A more short-time solution would be to create e.g. a True-Type
font for Dinka, which covers all the necessary combinations, and
has the right glyph shapes for the upper-case diacritics, and
give that font priority in style sheets for Dinka material.

Again, having a specially-designed font (or some fonts) may be
a short to middle-range solution.

Very good. The important thing is to take such discussion (or the
results and main points) over to unicode@unicode.org (or even unicore),
and to work on actual proposals.

For some work on the later, please see

Not at all, if possible.

[I find the en-AU in <h1 xml:lang="en-AU">Nuer test page</h1>
a bit too much, but that's a detail.]

Exactly. If the language in question has some ammout of printed works
(50 different items to be exact), then you should apply for an iso-639-2
code. if the language in question doesn't have that much printed material,
you should apply for an IANA code.


>Other key issues include charset identification in the absence of 
>"defined" character encodings.

There are no 'undefined' character encodings. If somebody
does an encoding, they should document it, and register it
with IANA. It's rather easy to do that. But working towards
getting the necessary characters into Unicode may be
much better use of your time.
