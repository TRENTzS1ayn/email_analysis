Chaps,

You can find another batch of VERY rough notes from me at
http://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/checklists/i18n-guidelines.html

I'm thinking of perhaps using the notes in the section 'Implementing
bidi text' as the basis of an article in Multilingual Computing and a
talk for Unicode (and other) conferences.

Cheers,
RI
