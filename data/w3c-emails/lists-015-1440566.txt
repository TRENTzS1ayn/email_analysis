Done. 

The report is now at:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/chosen_demos_rationale_report/hp-applications-selection.html
(though it's not a very pretty URL!).

I use jigedit and I've tried to clean up the old directory using the jigedit web
interface. Don't know if that is enough.

Fixed. Actually I swear I fixed that within 10m of the first upload - you guys
must either be fast at downloading or there is a cache somewhere that needs
flushing!

suggestions/requirements input would be welcome.

OK. I'll try to get something done on that this week. Need to decide whether to
keep the separate files or just munge into one big file.
