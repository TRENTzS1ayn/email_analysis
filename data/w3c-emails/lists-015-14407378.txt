Richard:

I think this looks like the right sequence and a great structure for the discussion.

In the section "Who are we targeting?" I'd like to explicitly ask whether or not we are targeting web application (CGI, J2EE, ...) developers (and if so, which technologies?).  I think this will help us understand how to set the scope of topics in B.3.2, and during content brainstorming.

Subject: Kick off



The kick off face-to-face meeting will be in Boston on 22-23 November.  Please let me know if you are able to make it. Detailed logistics information will follow shortly.

The aim of the meeting will be to set the initial direction for the task force.

To make the discussions as effective as possible, and allow maximum input from those unable to make the meeting, I have prepared some initial ideas at http://www.w3.org/International/geo/plan/ftf1-discussion.html .  I find it is helpful to start from a proposal when developing strategies.  Please don't take this as directive.  It is a means for developing discussion.

I would encourage everyone to make comments on the discussion document by email prior to the meeting.  Please try to build on and refer to the text in the discussion document, so that we can incorporate the ideas easily within the agenda. Alternative wordings, topics or constructive ideas are welcome!  Please try to make suggestions whenever possible.

If writing a long mail note, please try to state your ideas as concisely and clearly as possible, with a summary at the top or at the beginning of each paragraph.  Break up the text and use headings where appropriate to help the reader.

Unfortunately I have to leave for a vacation this evening, and my wife won't appreciate it if I'm reading email, so I will rejoin the discussion on Tuesday.

I look forward to reading your comments.

All the best,
Richard.
