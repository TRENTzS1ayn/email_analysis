All,

Our kick-off face-to-face meeting is now quite close, and I have created a preliminary agenda [1].  I will suggest times very soon.  Please let me know if you want to add (or subtract) topics.

All WG members [2], please confirm asap whether you will be attending or not.  Thanks.

Anyone wanting to participate by phone also please indicate what sessions you are interested in.

Please also send in your thoughts on the discussion document [3]. This is especially important if you cannot make the meeting, so that your contribution can be included.

Best regards,
Richard.
