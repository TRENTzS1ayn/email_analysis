This page http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ says the meeting is 21-22. This page http://www.w3.org/International/ws/2002/11/ftf200211.html says 22-23

http://www.w3.org/International/ws/2002/11/ftf200211-agenda.html says friday sat. 21-22 (However 21-22 falls on thursday fri)

http://www.w3.org/International/geo/2002/11/ftf-agenda-200211.html says 22-23.

My understanding is both meetings are the same 2 days in the same building. The pages should be fixed so we don't have confusion about when and where to be.

Is it correct the meetings are on the 22 and 23 of November, 2002, Friday and Saturday? tex

All,

Please note that the correct dates for the FTF meeting in Boston are 22-23 November (not 21-22nd as was initially, incorrectly stated on the logisitics page http://www.w3.org/International/ws/2002/11/ftf200211.html ).

Thanks to Steve Billings for pointing out the error!
