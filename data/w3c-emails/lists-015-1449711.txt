Agreed. You might also want to edit intro.html in the reports directory to
point to it, if you've not done that already. That page is linked from the
project homepage so there's a navigation path to this as a
work-in-progress.

I'll take a look

Could be either. We have mirrors of the site (all hidden behind dns
trickery for www.w3.org) that have updates  triggered from cvs commits;
these have been known to lag a little (usually minutes rather than hours).

Regarding bibliographies, I did (for obscure reasons) start collecting up
the ISBNs of all the books I own. Also scribbled a title/author, but the
main thing I wanted was isbns; hope is to hook into a lookup-via-isbn web
service to get richer metadata to autogenerate bibliographic records, and
provide fodder for collaborative filtering apps. I'm not sure if that kind
if bibliographic app fits with your plans, have only had time for quickest
skim of the document today...

Or perhaps both if that won't be too time consuming.
