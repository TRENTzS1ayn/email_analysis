All,

I have made a first attempt to put times on the agenda [1]. 

I also added a session.  I was very impressed with a talk given by Whitney Quesenbery, a usability expert, at the W3C/NIST Usability Workshop last week, and I've invited her to give a version of it to the group.  She will dial in, and I'll turn slides, etc.  The title of her talk in Washington was "Reading to Do: Creating Documents that Lead to Actions", and I think you'll find it quite thought provoking.

If you are intending to participate by telephone, please don't forget to let me know when you'll be dialling in, since we won't leave the bridge open unless we know someone is there.

I'm looking forward to this.
See you next week.
RI
