Hi Najib,

I'm looking forward to seeing your stuff, and hopefully integrating it
into the GEO deliverables.  

You know, it occurs to me that maybe people from areas that use the
Arabic script have specific additional questions that we should answer -
ie. as we develop GEO materials, do those folks have any special
needs/requests?

The same would apply to Isaac in China, and anyone else who has
experience of users in a non-English environment.

Cheers,
RI
