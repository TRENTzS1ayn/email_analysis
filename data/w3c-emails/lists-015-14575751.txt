Hi Richard,

I share your hope. But this will be quite modest in the begining.

Speaking only for morocco, most web sites are in Frensh,  especialy 
commercial ones for matketing reasons. And almost all of the very few 
moroccan internet users navigate in frensh and a little in english. 
Some News papers (http://www.alalam.ma/), portals 
(http://arabe.casanet.net.ma/ ) or government sites 
(http://www.justice.gov.ma/ ) offers two (sometimes many) language 
versions.

Most of arabic sites uses MS tools to design their pages 
(charset=windows 1256).  Even worse, sometimes, in the
the same page you find two potions with different encodings (perhaps 
originated from different tools?) and where some texts are in 
unicode numeric entities while other are in window-1256. There is an 
accessibility problem here. But as more than 95% of PCs use IE, and 
it is all right, this does not seem to be a "problem"...

In fact, we still have to do the work of promoting W3C technologies, 
meet web designers and get feedbacks from  people realy working with 
Arabic. Another big "chantier" is accessibility and conformance to 
standards, not only in Arabic. There is a lot to do. But the chalange 
is exciting.
