Here are my notes from today's meeting. Maybe we should spend a few minutes
tomorrow making sure these accurately represent what we agreed to:

1. When dealing with an issue where available solutions are limited by the
lack of support (in, for example, browsers) of certain aspects of W3C
standards, we will:
  A. Provide a solution that can be implemented using currently-available
technology, but also
  B. Point out how the W3C standards should be implemented (by browsers in
this example) to enable the better solution.


2. Initial deliverables will cover the following technologies

  A. HTML/XHTML (with the assumption that CSS are used)
  B. CSS (either level 1 or 2)
  C. One newer technology (to be determined)


3. Discussion points for Saturday:

  A. Create a process for generating the deliverables
  B. The third technology to cover
  C. Who is the audience? (maybe we can?t finalize this yet)
  D. Usability requirements (brainstorming)
  E. Architecture (what we?ll write in, e.g. xml)
  F. Education and outreach
  G. Content brainstorming: declare lang, declare charset, sort, time/date
formatting, etc.
