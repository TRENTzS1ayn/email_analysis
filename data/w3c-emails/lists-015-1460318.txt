Does sound like a possible fit. It'd certainly be nice to have lots of ways to
seed a bibliography record and link to several web services to fill in the known
details and ISBNs is a good example of a useful seed. Collaborative filtering of
books sounds like possible test case - at least as a thought experiment to check
how it might be built on top of whatever architecture/tool-set emerges.
