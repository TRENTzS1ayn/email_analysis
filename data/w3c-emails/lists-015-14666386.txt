All,

Please note that it is now possible to subscribe to the list public-i18n-geo without committing to the terms for task force participation [1].  This is to allow people who cannot make the commitment to more easily contribute to the I18N GEO (Guidelines, Education & Outreach) work.

The public-i18n-geo list is dedicated to discussion of work on the GEO deliverables. Note that any general questions or discussions should NOT take place on this list, but on the www-international list [2].

If you wish to be subscribed to the public-i18n-geo list, please send me an email at ishida@w3.org.

Regards,
Richard.
