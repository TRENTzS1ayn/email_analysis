What have you got?? ;-)

I'm just in the middle of a rebuild, after deciding what I'd got was getting
too crufty. I think the closest thing around to what I'm aiming for is
Tinderbox, (though I haven't got a Mac on which to play), but more node &
arc based & very web & RDF-aware. In other words a 'Personal Knowledge
Manager', although I'm not sure how far I want to go into the email side of
things. I'm approaching the first goal which is mindmapping/(semantic)
blogging with a graphic UI.

I don't think we can have too many schema registries... but a loose thought
closer to your deliverable would be a registry/discovery tool for not only
RDF-aware apps, but a kind of Citeseer for related (primarily open source)
software. For example, when I started on the current project I had a pretty
thorough search for node & arc graphing code & libraries. Nothing was really
close enough, so I coded a lot from scratch. Months later, purely by chance
I came across the library I'm using now (fortunately it was around the time
I decided on the rewrite, so I can still save some effort).

Something else which I reckon might be popular would be a 'Jena Lite'
(mentioned on that list not long ago). An RDF API for folks such as RSS
feeders that don't want everything Jena can offer, but want goes beyond
straight XML or regexp-based hacking.

Cheers,
Danny.
