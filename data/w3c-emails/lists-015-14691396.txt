The style guide incorporating quick tips is an interesting idea, 
although the format is better suited to material designed as educational 
material or for casual reading.

For more intensive uses in the workplace something more concise and 
maybe akin to the accessibility guidelines/checklists may more useful.

Ideally we need to cover both types/levels of material.

Just my 2 cents worth.
