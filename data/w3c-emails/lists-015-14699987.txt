It does sound like there may be two needs:

1. Quick tips
A list of the tips provides links into the content
Each link (tip) summarizes the action to take
2. A manual
A more traditional table of contents provides links into the content
In addition to the guidelines themselves, the manual could include
introductory sections with background material, appendices with backup
material, etc.

I'm wondering if a single source of content could serve both needs...? That
is, the quick tips simply become another window into (i.e. a set of links
into) the core of the manual (the sections containing the guidelines. There
may be a mismatch in style, level of detail needed, or navigational needs,
but if it worked it could reduce the time to produce them.

The style guide incorporating quick tips is an interesting idea,
although the format is better suited to material designed as educational
material or for casual reading.

For more intensive uses in the workplace something more concise and
maybe akin to the accessibility guidelines/checklists may more useful.

Ideally we need to cover both types/levels of material.

Just my 2 cents worth.
