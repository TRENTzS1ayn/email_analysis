Hello everyone,

I will soon be sending out a welcome message and starting up some threads in preparation for our kickoff meeting.  

In the meantime, it occurred to me that we could make some improvements to the member page at http://www.w3.org/International/geo/members.html by including the following:

1] a line after each name entitled: "Known as: ..." so people can specify what they'd like to be called.  Very useful for Chinese or Southern Indian people, for example.

2] add another line where appropriate to allow people to add their name in their native script, eg. Arabic, Chinese, etc.  I can add these easily enough if you send me in an HTML attachment (preferably utf-8 encoding).  People will only see these if they have the font, but since most people who would really need to see them would probably have the font, it may be an interesting thing to do.

Thoughts?
