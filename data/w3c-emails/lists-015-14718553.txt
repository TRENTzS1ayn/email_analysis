Great ideas. We should make our pages as international as possible
following/demonstrating our own guidelines.

We should take a tougher stand on the font issue and implement some
solutions, even if it means a backup page with gifs or svg drawings.
Most applications don't have an option to create pages with characters
that sometimes can't be seen.

People will only see these if they have the font, but since most people who would really need to see them would probably have the font, it may be an interesting thing to do.
