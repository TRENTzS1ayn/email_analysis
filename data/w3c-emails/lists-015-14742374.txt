All,

It is good to see the task force membership growing, and the discussion beginning already.  We have some other task force members currently going through the application process, and I hope they will be on board very soon.  (When they do, please be patient if they need some time to come up to speed with these discussions, or want to take us in another direction.)

As it mentions on the GEO home page [1], we are expecting to hold a face to face (FTF) kick-off meeting in Boston on 22-23 November, where we can hold detailed discussions on the way forward for the GEO work.

I have been noting down ideas for agenda topics.  Please send in any others you think of.

-review of WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) approach to guidelines
-audience, user needs, and topic areas for guidelines
-an architecture to support the guidelines (development and deployment)
-education and outreach (the EO in GEO) 
-content brainstorming: levels, scope, specific ideas for inclusion
-ways of gathering data / sources of information
-process

Over the next day or so, I will send out some ideas I have on each of these topics in separate threads, in the hope that this will stimulate discussion that can serve as input to the meeting.

Best regards,
Richard.
