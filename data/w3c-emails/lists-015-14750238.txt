Hello Tex,

Many thanks for your comments.

I think it's important that the guidelines make distinctions on various
axes. One such axis is the implementations one wants to reach. We can
easily say something like "this won't work on generation 3 browsers".

But we should also take into account that the Web moves forward,
and that we (I hope, at least) want it to move forward, rather than
backwards. Using gifs can be very helpful in some cases, e.g.
to help people to check whether their browser does bidirectional
rendering correctly, but for example using gifs instead of Japanese
characters just because somebody might not have installed a Japanese
font is probably not worth spending too much time on.

just my 2 yen.

Regards,    Martin.
