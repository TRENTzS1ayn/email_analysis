>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  Just 4 weeks to go!  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

The Internationalization & Unicode Conference is the premier technical
conference worldwide for both software and Web internationalization. The
conference (renamed from "Unicode Conference" to more accurately reflect
its content) features tutorials, lectures, and panel discussions that
provide coverage of standards, best practices, and recent advances in
the globalization of software and the Internet. Attendees benefit from
the wide range of basic to advanced topics and the opportunities for
dialog and idea exchange with experts in the field. The conference runs
multiple sessions simultaneously to maximize the value provided.

New technologies, innovative Internet applications, and the evolving
Unicode Standard bring new challenges along with their new capabilities.
This technical conference will explore the opportunities created by the
latest advances and how to leverage them for global users, as well as
potential pitfalls to be aware of, and problem areas that need further
research. There will also be demonstrations of best practices for
designing applications that can accommodate any language.

We invite you to submit papers that relate to Unicode or any aspect of
software and Web Internationalization. You can view the programs of
previous conferences at:
http://www.unicode.org/unicode/conference/about-conf.html


CONFERENCE ATTENDEES

Conference attendees are generally involved in either the development
and deployment of Unicode software, or the globalization of software and
the Internet. They include managers, software engineers, systems
analysts, font designers, graphic designers, content developers, web

- Implementing new features of recent versions of Unicode
- Evaluations (case studies, usability studies)
- Natural language processing
- Algorithms (e.g. normalization, collation, bidirectional)

We invite you to submit papers which define tomorrow's computing,
demonstrate best practices in  computing today, or articulate problems
that must be solved before further advances can occur.


SESSIONS

The Conference Program will provide a wide range of sessions including:
- Keynote presentations
- Workshops/Tutorials
- Technical presentations
- Panel sessions

All sessions except the Workshops/Tutorials will be of 40 minute
duration.  In some cases, two consecutive 40 minute program slots may be
devoted to a single session.

The Workshops/Tutorials will each last approximately three hours.  They
should be designed to stimulate discussion and participation, using
slides and demonstrations.

THE UNICODE CONSORTIUM

The Unicode Consortium was founded as a non-profit organization in 1991.
It is dedicated to the development, maintenance and promotion of The
Unicode Standard, a worldwide character encoding.  The Unicode Standard
encodes the characters of the world's principal scripts and languages,
and is code-for-code identical to the international standard ISO/IEC
10646.  In addition to cooperating with ISO on the future development of
ISO/IEC 10646, the Consortium is responsible for providing character
properties and algorithms for use in implementations.  Today the
membership base of the Unicode Consortium includes major computer
corporations, software producers, database vendors, research
institutions, international agencies and various user groups.

For further information on the Unicode Standard, visit the Unicode Web
site at http://www.unicode.org or e-mail <info@unicode.org>
