To give you a *very* quick and dirty idea of how incremental disclosure and task oriented indexing can work, please see http://www.w3.org/People/Ishida/checklists/wai-html-impl-checklist.html 

I threw this together while trying to get my head around WCAG's HTML Techniques doc v1.0.  Headings are mostly theirs. Black text is checkpoints.  Green text are directives I pulled out of the flowing text.  Click on the text to expand or contract the information.

NOTE: I'm not proposing this as a way to implement the GEO guidelines.  But it is an interesting illustration of guiding someone to task-based, checklist oriented information.  Note that the hand icon takes you to the detailed flowing text, if you need to read that.

Hope that helps,
RI
