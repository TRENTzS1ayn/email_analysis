There is now a page at  http://www.w3.org/International/ws/2002/11/ftf200211.html that provides logistical information related to the kick off face-to-face meeting in Boston in November.  Please let me know if you are able to make this meeting.  

As mentioned before, the aim of this meeting will be to determine the near term direction for the task force.  If you are unable to make the meeting, please send in comments and suggestions to the list beforehand if you can (see the archives at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-geo/).

We are working on the arrangements for dial-in.  I will send out a draft agenda in a short while.  If you wish to participate by telephone, please indicate at that point which parts of the meeting you wish to dial in to. We will establish dial in facilities just for those times.

Best regards,
Richard.
