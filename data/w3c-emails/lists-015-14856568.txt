The W3C's three I18N task forces will hold separate face-to-face meetings, in a single location, on:

   Friday 22 November 2002
   Saturday 23 November 2002

in:

   Boston, MA, USA

We are looking for a host. If you could host these meetings, please let me know.

The three I18N task forces are:

-  The Core Task Force is developing the Character Model for the World
   Wide Web and the Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)
   specification.  It also reviews specifications produced by other W3C
   Working Groups.

-  The Web Services (WS) Task Force is investigating the needs and
   problems in the area of internationalization of Web Services, in
   particular the dependency of Web Services on language, culture,
   region, and locale-related contexts.

-  The GEO (Guidelines, Education & Outreach) Task Force is helping to
   get the internationalization aspects of W3C technology better
   understood and more widely and consistently used.

Further details will be distributed as soon as they are available.

Regards,
