Well hopes, aspirations that sort of thing ...  :-)

Actually, we do have some code from our "ePerson" community information
management experiment, though that was an intranet kind of thing with no
connection to blogging so we might end up reusing some ideas more than the code.

Interesting thought. Blogged bibliography of software tools ... yes, worth
exploring.

Which library did you end up using?

Good suggestion but probably outside the scope of this particular activity. One
challenge I'd see with a 'Jena lite' would be the parser. ARP is very much aimed
at quality and full standards conformance rather than 'liteness' - hence the use
of Xerces which dwarfs jena.

Thank you for that!
