Chaps,

Given that several of us are still catching up after the Unicode
conference in Prague, and that the Daylight Savings times are out of
kilter this week (US hasn't changed but Europe & Australia have), I was
thinking that perhaps we should postpone the telecon until next week and
use the time to work on content.

If there's something you'd particularly like to discuss with a call this
week, please write to the list asap.  Otherwise, I suggest we meet at
the new times next week (I'll send out the minutes today).
