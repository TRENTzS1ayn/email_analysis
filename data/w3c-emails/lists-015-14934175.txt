While speaking with Richard last week, he asked me to share some thoughts on
the education and outreach part of our work. In our conference call
tomorrow, we can start to discuss this in more detail.

Currently, we are quite focused on the guidelines themselves. Does it make
sense to start thinking about the education & outreach part, or is it still
too early? This will obviously depend upon the content being created. When
should we start to define the medium or media within which we share this
content? More importantly, will this influence the way in which we create
the guidelines?

Many web designers (at least in the US) typically use a site such as
WebMonkey.com or Builder.com instead of W3.org. Such sites offer a quick
overview (although not always completely accurate) of the most important
aspects of a topic. They typically (in my experience) do not look to the
entire guideline on the W3 site. Can we think about methods of ensuring that
our deliverables are more easily approachable and more usable, so as to make
sure that web designers come here first to get the most accurate set of
guidelines?

Richard shared with me the URL to the draft of the expert format. I think
that's definitely a step in the right direction!
