Apologies to all for my lack of participation over the past few months. Due to a series of curious events I was unavoidably detained.

;^)

At any rate, I'm planning to attend tomorrow's call, and will be preparing the pieces I've had on my to-do list re. education and outreach prior to the meeting.

As far as your question above Phil, my opinion is that it's -never- too early to work on this part of the picture.

Stay tuned for a document or two, and I'll look forward to talking with you all tomorrow.
