Sounds interesting - anything about it online?

>Which library did you end up using?

JGraph. TouchGraph was the other leading contender, but I wanted full-blown
heavyweight JComponents as graph items, where as TG is more aligned towards
lightweight drawing. When I was trying to code this stuff myself, the glue
between my graph model and the Swing components started getting really
ugly - eventful spaghetti. JGraph only solves part of the problem, but it's
the part that was keeping me awake ;-) Also using a load of other o-s
libraries -  Jena, Jython etc. A real boon for functionality, but don't half
make for a big package <juvenile snigger/>.

Good point. It would seem a bit counterproductive to throw the quality away.

Cheers,
