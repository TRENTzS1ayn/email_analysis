That's exactly what I thought of when I first heard of I18N GEO, make
the authors and developers aware of issues, explain them and provide
hints how to deal with them. It would be great to have Q&A documents to
point at at w3.org. For example, the W3C MarkUp Validator refuses to
validate documents which do not explicitly specify a character encoding.
Many authors don't understand why this is necessary or how to setup the
web server to specify the encoding, it'd be great if I18N GEO would
provide sole document dealing with such issues.
