I don't know that our documents need to be the sole document, but it would be
a great idea to have tools like the validator provide a link to our documents
when they report an error, such as missing encoding. The error could link
directly to the section on encodings that answer the questions you identify as
user needs.

It's an interesting idea to prioritize having text for errors that are
detected by these tools. Would make our web site both valuable and frequently
referenced, and that would increase the visibility of other materials we
produce.
