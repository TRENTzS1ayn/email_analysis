Review of recent activity
===================

WCAG Techniques group asked that we look at the internationalization
issues surrounding the use of the OBJECT tag in HTML.   Notes from the
discussion:
Beware of using things like charset or hreflang attributes, if
appropriate, since they may not be updated if the target entity is
text-based and changes.
Need to clarify whether we should recommend the use of OBJECT vs. other
tags like APPLET.
If the entity pointed to is text, how does transcoding happen if it is
needed?
We probably need to address different issues according to the usage of
the OBJECT tag.

WCAG is also looking at developing test suites.  There was brief
discussion about whether we should do the same.

Tex, Russ and Andrew promised some material for the near future.





Education & Outreach Discussion
=========================

Suzanne went through the page she sent to the list and we discussed the
ideas and brainstormed additional topics.

Notes follow:
Contributions to university courses:
People might not want to participate because of ownership issues
& competition
Need statement in the proposal that university can benefit from
this
RR would universities see this as too small a niche
TT need to make the case
TT a workshop might be useful to solicit information - and
involve people
flesh out structure with an idea of workshop
list contents of such a syllabus
get people to develop it

RI university courses need a lot of intellectual capital which
we don't currently have
other alternative approaches - eg. Making things available on
web like WAI

TT suggests a brokering activity
could develop syllabus
ask them what they are trying to accomplish

ST look for other opportunities to speak to non i18n people 

PA need info on ROI
need financials

TT MLC would be willing to post status updates
Martin wrote an article 

TTtouch base with research analysts dealing with i18n
we are a resource when they need comments on a topical issue -
make the experts available
could suggest we do something with the IUC

RI We need a problem statement for the E&O document to indicate
what we want to achieve & help us prioritise


PAvisitors to w3c site take too long to find what they wanted
quick code or checklist would be useful
also could be more attractive - w3c is conservative
this is a large audience - e-developers
this is particularly the case for e-developers

STinvite other sites to get information from W3C
PAthese sites accept guest authors
RIdo want to pull?

PArun a survey past a demographic group
what tools, sites do you use? What do you need?

PA create a community around i18n issues

RRhow do other groups pull these communities together?
language institute, client side news, i18n gurus
how do we make ourselves more successful?

ACa lot of people don't want to be subject to an involved process
they need to find information quickly
we need to make information available

STso many things to look at these days

MDneed to choose just a couple of things to do

RIWe should also publicise better what we're already doing
talks: Unicode, WWW
papers: Martin's article in Multilingual Computing, Richard's
(upcoming) in RWS newsletter
we could look at providing an RS Feed
add things to website news section

perhaps have a new pages/documents section in addition to the
new events
possibly a list of topics under discussion in the mail
list/telecons

we should also announce new documents in MLC

we should revamp the hints & tips section of the site (and the
look & feel of the site itself)
and raise its visibility

we could also look for outlets for knowledge in form of short
articles like the one on charset declarations produced by the
webstandards org
http://www.webstandards.org/learn/askw3c/dec2002.html
other how to pages


offer to review articles for people (in return for a mention)


Next meeting:
==========
Same time, same bridge, next week.
