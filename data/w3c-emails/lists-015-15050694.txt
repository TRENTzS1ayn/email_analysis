Review of recent activity
===================

AGREED: The Agreement TR of Framework Document
[http://www.w3.org/International/geo/framework/] is ready for release to
the TR page [http://www.w3.org/TR/].  RI has already prepared a
publication ready version, and it should hopefully be published tomorrow
by webreq.



Education & Outreach Discussion
=========================

The guidelines work, although important and continuing, is progressing
slowly and it was felt we would like to find a way to start providing
helpful, nicely packaged advice to people in the near term and without
going through the full rigour of the guidelines approach.

We DECIDED to implement a way of providing answers to users' questions
from the http://www.w3.org/International/ site.  These could be any type
of question relating to web technology (not just HTML&CSS). The answer
could be short or long, and could point to existing material or to new
material developed especially.

We will start by establishing a clearly visible link on the
http://www.w3.org/International/ page to a question of the week, and to
a (growing) list of previously published questions.  Task force members
should take turns to develop questions. 

We decided not to put out a general call for questions on
www-international or elsewhere, nor put a form on the site,  because
Russ's experience with Dr. International would suggest that we'd get
swamped.  Instead we can identify some questions for ourselves, look at
past postings on www-international (especially where answers appear),
use or point to material we already have in the guidelines or the hints
& tips section of the web pages, and post here answers to addhoc
enquiries we receive and have to answer anyway.

We feel that this will complement our work on guidelines, which will
proceed as before.  It will provide material for the guidelines, answers
may become resources pointed to by the guidelines, and it may help us
develop early drafts of guidelines material for discussion.  The Q&A
material is focussed on answering a user's specific questions, and the
topics will develop in an evolutionary way with minimal attempts to
guide and structure the contents.  On the other hand, the guidelines
will be very structured from the outset, and attempt to help the user
who says "What are all the things I need to know at this point to
achieve X".  Initially there will be a single list of questions &
answers, but as the number of questions grows some grouping (and
regrouping) into topics areas will be done.

The proposed work process is that a member of the group develop a Q&A
pair each week, taking turns.  The material must be published to the
group on a Monday for review.  The contribution will be discussed at the
Wednesday meeting, and published for the following Monday.
