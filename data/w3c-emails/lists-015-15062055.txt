News item: 


Today the GEO Task Force of the Internationalization Working Group has
released the first Working Draft of its "Framework Document for i18n
Guidelines". 

This describes plans for producing guidelines on internationalization of
W3C technologies.  The Task Force encourages feedback about the content
of this document as well as participation in the development of the
guidelines by people who have experience creating Web content that
conforms to internationalization needs.

Best regards,
Richard.
