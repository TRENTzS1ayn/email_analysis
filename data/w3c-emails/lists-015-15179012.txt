Hello Richard,

I think this is an interesting question, but there are many
more important questions that we should put out first.

We should mention the importance of this feature for education.

For XMetaL, we have to make very clear that it does not change
tag names, it just presents them differently (I suppose it does
not do that for the actual source view).

Regards,    Martin.
