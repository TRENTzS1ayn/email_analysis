Dear GEO group,

I was in Japan last week, sorry. Some comments below:

Q&A is 'question and answer', but it is dangerously close to
QA, quality assurance. Can we call this FAQ? (frequently
asked questions)?

Icons, the title attribute,... are only secondary things, and they
have to be learned/recognized/discovered by users. I think the best
thing to do is to somehow express the relationship in the text.
Another way to do things is to point to our page, and have that
page point to others with more material.

Please don't do that. It confuses users, and in particular creates
accessibility problems.

There are many 'where can I find' questions. Before putting them up,
it would be good to have some question helping the reader to understand
what these things might be good for. This in particular applies to
ISO language and country codes, which are only used indirectly.


Regards,    Martin.
