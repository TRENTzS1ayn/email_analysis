I've been working on some material called 'what you need to know about
the Unicode bidirectional algorithm' that we could use eventually as
background material that we point to from the guidelines (which would
allow us to streamline the guidelines content a lot more).

It still needs some work, and we probably need to consider styling and
location if we use it.

Please send any comments to the list.
