Chaps,

I have been working on a test page for css language selectors for a week
or so, and since Andrew's Q&A is scheduled for this evening thought I'd
better finish and publish it.

See http://www.w3.org/International/tests/test-css-lang.html

I'd like to discuss this and the possibility of us working on other such
pages this evening.

Cheers,
RI
