Hi Bjoern,

The current test is fairly limited.  Thanks for the pointer to the
documentation.  I spoke with Bert Bos earlier about possibility of
developing our stuff in a way that would make it embeddable in the CSS
tests.  I'll also talk with the HTML guys - I think they could do with
some more detailed bidi tests, for example.

There is some documentation and guidelines for CSS tests, see
