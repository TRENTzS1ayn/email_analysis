Richard reminded me yesterday that a new Q&A had been due from me on
Monday. I just managed to finish it, at
http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-lang-2or3.html.

One specific question: Should we say 'language codes', 'language tags',
or something else, such as 'language identifiers'?
[HTML 4 (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.8) uses 'language
codes', XML (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-lang-tag) uses 'language
identifiers' for the whole thing, but 'codes' for the pieces (language,
country,...), RFC 3066 (as well as 1766) use 'language tags' for overall,
and 'code' for the pieces, the 'hints and tips' page
(http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTML-tags.html) uses 'codes' throughout
except for the title :-(]

Other comments welcome.    Regards,    Martin.
