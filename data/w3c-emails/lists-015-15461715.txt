Just fyi, I have updated the page to include the list of
languages/countries/scripts suggested by Russ, and a few other languages.

I have also tried to make the page a little more prescriptive, although
fundamentally you need to research your target audience.

I would be interested in your comments on the page, is it clear, is it
correct, does it agree with your experience...

I am also interested if any of you is working with an RTL language other than
Hebrew and Arabic.
