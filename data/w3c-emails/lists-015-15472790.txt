This will be a very useful resource with the addition of all the popular
left-to-right languages and their formats. I wonder if the right-to-left
specific title could be changed to more accurately describe this resource?
Or should this be a separate resource area to which this Q&A can link?

Notably missing are Austria, Belgium, and Switzerland, all of which are
important locales for websites so I would think they would meet the criteria
for "commonly requested languages." The latter two countries have multiple
official languages, which I think is always an important point to stress.
