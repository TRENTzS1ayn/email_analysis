Phil, I added the countries. 
Yes we might need to change the title or break it up. It now answers (at
least) two questions-
I added a point (suggested to me by someone else) about the political and
cultural overtones of choosing a script, and we might want to separate out
"Which script(s) to use" from the "Which languages are rtl?" and perhaps have
a "What's my direction?" ;-) question that the table replies to.
