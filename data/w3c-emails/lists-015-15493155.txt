Tex,

This looks good.  I do have one question.   Shouldn't it be Taiwan instead of "Republic of China".  I know here at Microsoft we use "Taiwan" as the official name of the "region"?

Regards, Russ

Phil, I added the countries. 
Yes we might need to change the title or break it up. It now answers (at
least) two questions-
I added a point (suggested to me by someone else) about the political and cultural overtones of choosing a script, and we might want to separate out "Which script(s) to use" from the "Which languages are rtl?" and perhaps have a "What's my direction?" ;-) question that the table replies to.

Updates are at: http://www.i18nguy.com/temp/rtl.html
