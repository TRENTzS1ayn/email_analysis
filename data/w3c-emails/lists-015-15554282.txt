Testing
============
We agreed on a set of baseline browser versions/platforms for use when
describing applicability of techniques found in the guidelines.  We will
only systematically test applicability to the baseline browsers or
significant later versions.  The baseline versions are as follows:

Internet Explorer / Windows v6
Internet Explorer / Mac v5
Netscape Navigator v7
Opera v7
Mozilla v1.0
Safari  version tbd

These were all chosen because they provide standards compliance.  We
should test in standards mode where the browser distinguishes between
standards and quirks modes. (ie. Using a DOCTYPE, and in the case of
IE/Win without an xml declaration).

We may still refer to important quirks with older browsers in the
ua-issues section of the XML.

Richard has put together a couple of test pages [see
http://www.w3.org/International/tests/ ], and has talked briefly with
Bert about integration with the CSS test suite.  We need to study the
CSS test suite guidelines
[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/testsuitedocumentation.html ] and
explore this further.  We should also talk with the HTML group.
