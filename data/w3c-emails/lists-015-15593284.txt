Tex,
 
Here is what the www.unicode.org glossary says:
 
Script. A collection of symbols used to represent textual information in one or more writing systems.
 
This is what we have on our microsoft www.Microsoft.com/globaldev web site:
 
Script: A collection of characters for displaying written text, all of which have a common characteristic that justifies their consideration as a distinct set. One script can be used for several different languages (for example, Latin script, which covers all of Western Europe). Some written languages require multiple scripts (for example, Japanese, which requires at least three scripts-the hiragana and katakana syllabifies and the kanji ideographs imported from China). This sense of the word "script" has nothing to do with programming scripts such as Perl or Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).
 
And this is one from Nadine's book:
 
Script A system of characters used to write one or several languages. Characters denote isolated sounds, syllables, or word elements and are governed by a general set of rules for creating text, such as default writing direction.
 
Hope this helps.
 
Russ

Does anyone have or can point me to, a good definition for "script"?
