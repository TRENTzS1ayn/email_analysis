All:

Somewhere under Richard's response below is my initial reaction to Lloyd's
FAQ about Accept-Language (A-L) and Locale. I have a little heartburn about
the specific wording of this FAQ because I feel that it stresses the wrong
things about inferring locale from A-L.

I have copied the WSTF list because our group is active in the area of
locales.

I agree with nearly all of the detail in the FAQ, but not with the
presentation.

I would prefer it if the question were rephrased "How can I obtain a locale
from a browser (user-agent)? Can I get it from the Accept-Language?" I would
like the answer to be "Yes", rather than (as it appears now) to be "No".

I actually think that nearly all of the current draft is perfectly crafted
and correct. The whole would be better, though, IMO, if it started with:
"Yes, but it is not a good idea to use HTTP Accept-Language
<emph>alone</emph> to determine the locale preferences of the user."

The page should include reference to the fact that many Web servers, server
side scripting languages, and operating environments, by default, parse and
infer their native locale objects from Accept-Language. For example, .NET
uses the A-L to determine the default CultureInfo, Java Servlet provides a
getLocale() and getLocales() pair of methods that parse A-L, and so forth.
These objects are very useful in obtaining resources and other "language
preference" material. They are less useful, as pointed out by the FAQ, in
determining many of the fine grained attributes of users or in designing the
international behavior of a site. A language preference of es-MX doesn't
necessarily mean that a postal address form should be formatted or validated
for Mexican addresses. I might still live in the USA (or elsewhere).

The rhetorical question "Do you want to shove Polish content at a user just
because they are running a user agent in Warsaw?" might be answered yes in
some (many) cases. I think that the particular approach that a website takes
when displaying the homepage depends on the application. If you don't have a
cookie, logged in user, or other information about a request, it may
actually be BETTER to follow what limited information you do have (including
A-L) than ignore it. Do you want to shove French content at a user just
because they haven't clicked on Polish yet? When all you have is an
Accept-Language, what is your implementation decision?

Finally, I think that the bulleted list at the bottom isn't all that
appropriate. Of the items listed, only one (date/time formats) can and
should be wholly or partially inferred from a locale. The remainder
(timezone, currency, measurement system, paper size, Tex's shoe/clothing
size, physical location) are all orthogonal or, at best, distantly related
to locale systems. In proper international design, one would not necessarily
infer any of these from the user's concrete locale setting, let alone from
A-L.

Thanks for the opportunity to comment.

Internationalization is an architecture.
It is not a feature.

Hi Addison,

Don't worry, I still like you ;)  I think these are generally good
comments.  You could, if you want, send these to public-i18n-geo@w3.org
now - I signed you up a few days ago.

I guess what you're missing is some information: we do have John Yunker
working on more comprehensive guidelines for navigation (and he's quite
keen on this topic).  The guidelines are more appropriate for 'how to'
type of information such as you are suggesting.  Ideally that would
exist already, and this FAQ would point to it, but one step at a time...

> If A-L is good for content selection, why not locale selection?

Hmm. I'm wavering on this...  Maybe we should soften the text a little.

Some of the points you make lower down (eg. Currency) would be worth
sending to the geo list.  Would you like to do that, adapting the stuff
relating to how-to's in the light of my earlier comment?
