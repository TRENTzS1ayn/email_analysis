The updated page is now at:

http://www.i18nguy.com/temp/rtl2.html

Per today's discussion:
changed the title
added the intro to the links at the top of the page.
added microsoft's script definition
linked the first instance of script to the question what is a script
swapped the first and second question.

those were my notes.

the suggestions were all very good, thanks.

I think its baked now!
