Chaps,

I have posted a page at http://www.w3.org/International/articles.html
that I think we should link to from the site.  Please check it out and
send comments before Wednesday's meeting.

I have one big reservation about this page... (cf
http://www.w3.org/International/questions.html )  I feel it is a bit
artificial to split up content according to whether it is an FAQ or an
'article', or soon a 'tutorial'.  I suspect people might prefer to see
all useful information we have relating to, say, Character Encoding in
one place - perhaps with small icons to quickly distinguish between FAQ,
article or tutorial.  What do you think?

I'd also like to include another link on the page, as follows:

================================
http://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/bidi/
What you need to know about the bidi algorithm and inline markup
Revised 19 Aug 2003  
by Richard Ishida 
Describes some of the basic principles underlying how the Unicode
Bidirectional Algorithm works, and some scenarios where inline markup or
codes are needed to correctly render web content written in a
right-to-left script.=================================

This would involve me making a copy of the html page on the w3c site,
(and perhaps changing the styling??)  Perhaps we should also revisit the
styling of the pages already linked to from the articles page?

Please read this bidi article and send comments to the list before
Wednesday.

During Wednesday's meeting I'd like to:
1. discuss the best way forward for the articles.html page
2. take a decision to include the bidi article, and decide whether we
need to restyle

Thanks,

RI
