Dear All, we are currently doing some preliminary research into ways in 
which we can market SWAD Europe.

We are considering having some sort of SWAD-E gadget or toy to give out
to people and although we have a few ideas in mind we would welcome any
suggestions from yourselves.

You may have attended a conference or workshop where you were given or 
saw a piece of promotional material that interested you, if so I'd like
to know.

Please email this list if you have any ideas or suggestions. 

Thank you
Caroline
