I fell upon an interesting thread on the WCAG list which you might be
interested in following.  Starts at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003OctDec/0411.html

Raised the question in my mind "When tagging language variations in
text, where do you draw the line between what is clearly a foreign
language phrase, what is a neologism drawn from a foreign source, and
what is one of the latter that has become an adopted part of the
language?"
