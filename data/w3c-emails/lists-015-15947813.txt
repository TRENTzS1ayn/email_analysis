  Well, that's why I speficically say US PST with 'S'. If this had been
when the daylight saving time is in effect, I would have written 'US PDT'.
Needless to say, always using UTC is clear and unambigous. If the wall
clock time is to be used, it can be followed by 'UTC -0800 (US PST)'
or 'UTC -0700 (US PDT)'. 'US PDT' is enclosed by parentheses because
I believe that should only be 'parenthetical'. I wouldn't expect any
'layperson' on the street to do that, but this is on I18N list.

  Obviously, that doesn't work even if we put aside arising from
different climates in different regions in the _same_ hemisphere because
there are two hemisphers in a sphere :-)

  I'm not sure what you meant by 'three appreviations'. Did you mean
things like PST, EST, JST, and BST? I don't think using them is a good
idea in any way except as an aid to 'humans'.

  Is there any reason you stick to GMT (that got obsoleted/abolished a
long long time ago) instead of UTC? I also filed a bug on ICU on this
issue a long time ago, but haven't heard back.
