Chaps,

(Heads up.)

I have spent a good deal of time since Friday lunch time studying and
updating the tests we had.  You can see the final result for the one set
I have completed at
http://www.w3.org/International/tests/test-bidi-blocks.html .

I used the CSS templates to rebuild the tests in this fashion, so
hopefully CSS and others will be able to pick up these tests for their
own test suites.  I also spent some time reading about how to write
tests [http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/testsuitedocumentation.html],
and have made some changes to enable testers to draw conclusions quickly
(eg. the image for comparison in the bidi tests, green colors to come in
the :lang tests, etc.).

I'll try to transform some more tests tomorrow (which is not so far
away, so I'd better stop now).
