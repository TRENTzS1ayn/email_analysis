Btw, the actual tests pages (eg.
http://www.w3.org/International/tests/bidi-blocks2-sec.html) are in fact
an HTML wrapper page that pulls in an XHTML test page using the <object>
tag.  I would have prefered to have had both files in XHTML, but I found
that the included file doesn't fill the available space in Firebird if
you don't have an HTML wrapper.  (You get a scrollable view about 5/6
lines deep.)

Does anyone know why?

and have made some changes to enable testers to draw conclusions quickly
(eg. the image for comparison in the bidi tests, green colors to come in
the :lang tests, etc.).

I'll try to transform some more tests tomorrow (which is not so far
away, so I'd better stop now).
