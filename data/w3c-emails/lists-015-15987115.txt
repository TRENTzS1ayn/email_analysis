Richard,

A couple comments-

Are we sure that embedding the test page as an object in another page
isn't affecting the results?

The objects are typed as text/html. Might be interesting to also type
them as xml.

On the scroll bar test I see two scrollbars in IE 6. One in the frame
the other for the page.

It would be nice if instead of test1, test2, there was a description of
what was being tested or how the tests are different. Otherwise, if
testn fails, we don't have a clue as to what is entailed in that test.

The tests are nice. Is the technique with <object> supported in most
browsers now?
