Hopefully the opposite is true.  The actual test file is isolated from
any CSS used for the wrapper and can be picked up as is by anyone
wanting to use it for the CSS or HTML etc test suites.  I'm just
following the advice for test suite development given by the CSS test
suite guidelines.
http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/testsuitedocumentation.html

"The navigation page transcludes the test page with an <OBJECT> element,
which references the test file using the data attribute and explicitly
sets the type of the expected data to "text/html". In order to encourage
a user agent to use the entire width of the document, and the remainder
of the document, both the width and height attributes are set to 100%.

"The <OBJECT> element was chosen because it is present in all "current"
versions of HTML, from HTML 4.0 Transitional, to XHTML Basic, to XHTML
1.1. This permits user agents which support any one of these languages
to easily utilize the navigational pages. In addition, the <OBJECT>
element provides an excellent immediate fall back mechanism for user
agents that either happen to not support <OBJECT>, or that have
difficulties transcluding HTML content.

"Inside the <OBJECT> element is a simple Test hyperlink which directly
links to the test file. Thus user agents that do not recognize the
<OBJECT> element and therefore ignore its markup, show the simple
hyperlink instead, thereby providing access to the test file. ....

"Note that the navigation file has no test content whatsoever. This
allows the test file to be updated to fix problems in tests without
having to update navigation files."

Note that the HTML test suite uses the same approach.  As for <object>
support, I don't know but I guess it must be fairly widespread if both
CSS and HTML groups use it.

It might indeed, and if we continue to view the guidelines as covering
XHTML 1.1 then we will need to.

That's correct.  The inside scroll bar is the one you should look at for
the test - perhaps I could word that more clearly.

OK

See above.
