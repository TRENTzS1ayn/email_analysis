Hello Bert, Ian,

I have been converting our i18n test pages to use the same model as the
CSS tests.  I'd be grateful if you could look at two of the tests
quickly so that I can ensure I'm heading in the right direction.

Note that our navigation pages are slightly different: since the pages
are still in development there is no set order for all tests yet; our
tests are used for validating the concepts in our techniques docs and
are not specific to a single specification.  I also adapted the styling
of the navigation pages slightly to create a lighter feel. 

The tests I have converted so far are:

http://www.w3.org/International/tests/test-css-lang.html

http://www.w3.org/International/tests/test-bidi-blocks.html

(To see the other tests waiting in the wings, see
http://www.w3.org/International/tests/ )

Many thanks in advance,
RI



PS: Bert, you mentioned that I should contact someone who is currently
working on test development.  Could you remind me who that is? Cheers.
