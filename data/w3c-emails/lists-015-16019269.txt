I was just updating
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/upload/2003/questions/ when it
occurred to me that it might be useful to make it more visible as an
index to the site information.

We agreeed in our meeting last week that we should have separate pages
for FAQs, articles, etc. but supplement that with a single page pointing
to all types of information, grouped by theme.  Well in the GEO question
index we already have something very much like that.

What do people think?  Should we press this into service and give it
high visibility as an index to information on the site?  Should we
remove the unanswered questions first? etc...
