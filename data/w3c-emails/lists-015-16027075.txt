I would vote to use it as a start, but remove all of the unanswered question first as long as there was a page that kept all the unanswered questions for our reference.

I was just updating
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/upload/2003/questions/ when it occurred to me that it might be useful to make it more visible as an index to the site information.

We agreeed in our meeting last week that we should have separate pages for FAQs, articles, etc. but supplement that with a single page pointing to all types of information, grouped by theme.  Well in the GEO question index we already have something very much like that.

What do people think?  Should we press this into service and give it high visibility as an index to information on the site?  Should we remove the unanswered questions first? etc...
