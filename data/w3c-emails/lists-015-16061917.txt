Hello Addison, others,

One very specific question about JSP: Is it possible (and if yes,
how) to produce an XML file where the correct encoding is automatically
put into the encoding pseudo-attribute of the XML declaration?
Also, is it possible (and how) to use the mechanisms provided
(rather than doing everything on your own) and produce a HTTP
response without a 'charset' parameter on the Content-Type
response header?

Regards,    Martin.
