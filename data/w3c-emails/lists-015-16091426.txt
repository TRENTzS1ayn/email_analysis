Here are some editorial comments:

1) The question is about setting up files, but the answer is also about
configuring apache.
The question should be reworded to more accurately reflect the faq
content.

How do I implement language negotiation on an Apache Web server?
How do I configure a multilingual web site on an Apache Web server?

2) This question shows the disdavantage of having the background at the
end, since the answer seems to start in the middle. A few words of intro
would be good to set the stage. Certainly needs something before the
discussion of the examples used occurs. It's a long faq, so it might be
good to introduce "heres what you need to do" with a brief list of 1)
choose file naming convention, 2) associate language with extensions,
etc. and then have the individual sections.
The list could be links for fast access as well.

3) Somewhere, maybe not in this faq, we should have a discussion of the
tradeoffs of having language indicated in the file name vs. in the
directory structure (e.g yadda/yadda/en/index.html)

4) You might indicate if this technique only applies to html or works
for other filetypes (e.g. image files, css, xml).

5) The comment in the para on language extension first is the files are
easier to read or edit when not on a server.
Suggest saying why. Do you mean because it ends in .html and so the tool
recognizes the extension?
Are you saying that tools will find the files even though the language
component is not specified? (I dont think so.)
It then says always type in browser address or hyperlink without
extensions.
I don't understand how the browser knows which language to retrieve if
the file is not being accessed via an apache server or with http
protocol. (ie on local disk as implied) Please explain.

6) Subsequent para is that it may make the files harder to read if they
are not on an apache server.
Pls explain why.  I presume the reason is tools can't default the
language extension.

7) On naming conventions- we should indicate (maybe another faq) when to
use language and when to use language-region
(and someday soon language-script-region...)
Also which version is the language default (does fr = fr-FR or fr-CA?
etc.)

The comment that 3066 should be followed for consistency and recognition
is a bit specious.
Perhaps say follow it as an industry convention and is consistent with
usage as language identifiers in http, html, xml etc. The codes
themselves are not always recognizable or consistent. eg ja for language
jp for country is inconsistent.

8) You mention AllowOverride being required for .htaccess but not any
other permissions or privileges.
I think for negotiation to work (but don't know for sure), some other
access rights or commands may need to be given.
We need to make this very clear. I had a great deal of trouble with my
ISP trying to get them to tell me which apache commands I was priv'd to
use, and as there were several ways to get it to work, I kept trying
things and was never show if I was misapplying the commands, missing
some commands or not priv'd.
I seem to recall multiview being required.

Perhaps we should suggest some tests that show privs and validate
behavior or example files that demonstrate correct usage.

9) Now that user has multiple pages and images etc. for different
languages, what is an appropriate test strategy to be sure that the
links are going to the right places+languages?

This might be a good page to put in another language to show proof of
concept. Even if it was just translated to pig latin... Or point to some
of the other w3c pages that are translated.

10) yes pl-PL is better than po.

11) Will someone from apach review or sanctify the page? 

12) How does language negotiation interact with user selection of a
language via a gateway page?
For example, if my browser is Japanese and by default I get the Japanese
pages, and then I select another language from the gateway page, once I
get to the new language, what happens so that I don't keep getting the
default pages?
(since the browser will keep specifying Japanese in http) Do we need to
clarify this? (maybe separate faq?)
