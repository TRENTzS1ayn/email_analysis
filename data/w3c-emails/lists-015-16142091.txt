I disagree and see it as unnecessary verbosity.  There's a link to the
background information for those who need it.

Done 5 & 6

For indicating language I don't think there is any default, other than
that fr is a superset of fr-CA, fr-FR, etc..  Aren't you thinking in
terms of locale mechanisms?

ja and jp is not inconsistent since one refers to language, the other to
country.  There is no reason to expect them to be the same.  I added the
word 'language' to the text.

See separate note.

Does anyone have any contacts? Martin?

I think the answer is not straighforward.  I think many people dealing
with gateway pages are dealing with whole sites that have been
localised, and probably more often by country than by language.  So my
guess is that they wouldn't really do language negotiation in this way,
rather they would have files in different locations.  I see language
negotiation for expressing *linguistic* variants of single or small
groups of pages.  This is getting into one of the questions you posed
earlier.

Note, however, as stated in the FAQ, that you can always point to a
specific page by specifying something like example.en.html, although as
you say as soon as you follow a link you're likely to revert back to the
language specified in your HTTP settings.

BTW, if we continue this discussion, let's make it a separate thread.

Cheers,
