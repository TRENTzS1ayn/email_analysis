At todays GEO meeting, we reviewed the proposed faq on language
negotiation

http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-apache-lang-neg.html

and decided we need an author for a faq on when it is appropriate, or
not, to use language negotiation.

========================
Some time was spent today discussing when this type of negotiation
should be used, and when alternatives should be considered. I was
actioned with posing the question to the group, to collect information
and to solicit whether someone might be interested in authoring a FAQ or
article on when to use this technique.

We thought Yves, John or Fran?ois might have a special interest in this
subject and so I cc'd them individually.

For example, there were suggestions that this approach only made sense
where every page had an exact counterpart in another language or region.
Many sites have different pages or file organization based on
differences in content.

It might be the case that Language negotiation only makes sense for the
entry page and after that page is read and a language either defaulted
or selected by the user, the rest of the content would be linked
directly, without relying on language negotiation. 

Some thought organization by language directory (e.g.
yadda/en/pages.html) might be more practical than by filename (e.g.
yadda/pages.en.html)

There were questions about server load and scalability.

There was also a discussion of roles and authorization, as content
developers may not have access to some server commands,  and we
considered there is guidance needed for content developers and separate
guidance needed for administrators.

So, we would like to ask if there is someone in the to-list who would
like to author or contribute to a faq on the subject of when to use
language negotiation and when not to, or defining situations where are
alternatives prefered.

Any takers?
