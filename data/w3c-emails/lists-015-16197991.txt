I would like to understand which principles are being applied here.
We seem to be asking about text and then working back to advice that
applies to any element that requires localization.
e.g. font, color, images, etc.

style sheet content whether translatable text or anything else is best
if it is repetitive, context-insensitive, etc.
(context-sensitive isnt quite the right wording, since clearly headers,
footers, classes, etc. are context...)

The benefits are the same whether text or other.

conditions-are the same.

GEO should have some discussion about localization of style sheets and
what is really involved. Also I have been grappling lately with whether
language or culture sensitive information should be in one style sheet
with some way of distinguishing which contents is used with which
language, or just different sheets for different languages.

So I guess I am asking, is there a presumption of an overall methodology
for localizing styles, if so what is it, or should we be describing
approaches and what is involved in their localization first, and then
get to the finer point of translatable text, and how translatable text
is different than other aspects of CSS?


Fran?ois, I hope this doesn't read like I am criticizing the question.
The question is a good one. I am unaware if there is any agreement or
presumption of what to do with style sheets in the context of
localization, and maybe I just need some orientation first.

What references are there on this subject? I am aware of Yves Savourel
book, and R. Ishida and others have done some presentations about L10n
of XML, DTD and the like (I don't recall if they covered CSS.)
