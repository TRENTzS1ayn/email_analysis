L10n of font, color, images could be part of "By the way..." section.

Embedding text in style sheets has more implication/risks on the overall
Translation and Localisation process than other localizable data.
The logic would be to warn reader of the FAQ about potential issue coming
down the pipe of the T&L process. As such, the association of text within
style sheet carries a specific risk...

The corresponding extra condition on text (compared to other localizable
data) would be the "linguistic independence" (do not know how to call it):
the text needs to be transalte-able isolated from the main text...

I did not checked yet. But the ones you mentioned are important for sure. Do
not know if CSS have been covered.
