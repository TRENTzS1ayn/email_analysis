John,

Good comments.

1) On deep linking from search engines and elsewhere, I would think that
most of the time the search would result in a page that was in one of
the languages of the user. I know it is not always true, but I wouldn't
think using lang. negotiation would be an improvement most of the time
for a deep link.

But that's a good use case for language selection being available on
every page and for it not to return to the top of the tree, but a
reasonable counterpart of the page the language switch is being made
from.

2) I don't know the answer to the question on htaccess for changing
language directories rather than pages.
I had the same question.

3) Google must use cookies to remember information from past searches,
especially your location and things like that. Too many of the searches
I do show up local companies and reasonable matches, even when I don't
provide that many keywords. You would think a search for a chinese
restaurant name would give you places randomly around the world rather
than American or Massachusetts places being most highly ranked. (Of
course the dominance of american internet helps there.) I guess I'll
have to do a few searches, then delete all my cookies to test it.
