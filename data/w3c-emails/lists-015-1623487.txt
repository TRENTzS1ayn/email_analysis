They do look fun.

A very good idea. Just prior to Rubik cubes hitting the big time I got one
through a small ad somewhere (back of New Scientist?), along with an
explanatory booklet. The booklet was more like an academic paper, delving
pretty deeply into group theory. I struggled through the booklet, learning
stuff I'd have dismissed as just too difficult/dull if it hadn't been for
the wonderful cube.

Anyone done RDF for finite state machines??

I did see a lovely toy the other day, actually nodes & arcs. The arcs were
bar magnets covered in coloured plastic, the nodes ball bearings.
Unfortunately they were about ?10 for half a dozen of each.

The only thing I can think of to suggest is e-SW angle grinders.
(Coincidentally, there some work I need to do on some concrete ledges in our
cellar). Cementic Web, anyone?

Cheers,
Danny.
