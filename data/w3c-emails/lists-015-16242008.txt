Yes, I had heard that too and had started to mention it in my comments
and then removed it because identifying
a users location by ip address isn't that reliable. For example, workers
for large companies often connect from anywhere in the world to the
corporate network and then all of their outgoing net requests look to
the rest of the world as if they came from a single client ip address,
which is a proxy for all the companies users.

There are other problems as well.

But maybe google or other search engines use the approach coupled with
other techniques...

I don't know verifia, I'll give it a look. thanks
