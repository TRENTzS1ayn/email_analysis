I agree. If the material is really parallel, e.g. stuff such as manuals,
it can be helpful to send somebody a link, and they get the page in
their language (if available).

It must be possible with Apache, because the Apache documentation
project uses it. Look e.g. at
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/en/content-negotiation.html
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/ko/content-negotiation.html
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/ja/content-negotiation.html
and http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/content-negotiation.html.
But I haven't figured it out yet, but it seems to involve more
than just simple configuration directives.
