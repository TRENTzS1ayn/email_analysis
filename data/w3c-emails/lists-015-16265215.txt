Using negotiation can mean that you get first a list of all
the files in a directory, then do a subrequest for each of
the file that has the right prefix so that you get the
relevant info (language, charset,...). That can cost a lot.
But I'm sure there are ways to speed this up. In particular,
typemaps should be a lot faster than multiviews because
typemaps avoid the above lookups and subrequests. But
they have to be kept up to date. See
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/content-negotiation.html#negotiation.

Negotiation can also affect caching performance, but it
should not if the server and the cache use HTTP/1.1
(instead of HTTP/1.0).
