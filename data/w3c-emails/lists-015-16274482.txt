I assume they're using type maps, esp since you specify URIs in the type 
maps rather than filenames.

Content negotiation appears to be implimented at the higher directory 
structure index levels like http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/ but if you 
follow a deep link into the documentation you don't have langauge 
negotiation instead you have to select a language form the langauge 
menu. Either that or my browser is misbehaving.
