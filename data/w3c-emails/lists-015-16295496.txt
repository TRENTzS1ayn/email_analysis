   I third that. IMHO, most of time using IP address is not so good an
idea. It can be a factor, but should be low in the list of things to
take into account.

 As for Google (often mentioned in this context),  I'm pretty sure a
lot of people living in foreign countries have been annoyed by Google's
ignoring 'accept-language' list on the client side. I know for sure that
it does NOT honor the value of 'accept-language'.  It does use cookies
to store the prefered UI language, but it's of no use if I use a browser
that doesn't support persistent cookies but supports 'accept-language'
(e.g. Lynx). I already wrote to Google to honor 'accept-language',
but haven't seen the change made yet.
