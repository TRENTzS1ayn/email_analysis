This is to make you aware of a discussion on the WAI  (Web Accessibility
Initiative) list.

A short while ago there was an interesting discussion on the WAI list on
whether a loan-words or phrases should be marked up for language [
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003OctDec/0411.html
thread ]. My conclusion was that one should consider the impact of not
marking up to decide - if markup wasn't likely to help it may not be
worthwhile.

Today I noticed another mail on the list questioning whether character
encoding information would be enough to identify language change, given
that "There is a lot of burden in the requiring of the <Lang> tag. Most
sites will have vocational English words in the middle of Hebrew
Paragraphs."

See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2003OctDec/0610.html
and following thread. (I wrote back to not confuse language with script,
but also wondered whether Hebrew systems can deal with embedded English
text anyway.)

I'm not sure what is the best answer - one can see that this could be a
pain for the content author if taken to the nth degree.  But where is
the appropriate cutoff?
