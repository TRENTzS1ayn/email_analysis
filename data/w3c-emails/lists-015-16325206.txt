Hello Richard,

I think the setting required by the webmaster (usually in httpd.conf) is:

AllowOverride FileInfo Options

The setting required at the location where you want to use
negotiation would be

Options MultiViews

(this is not included in Options All).

See http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#options,
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/core.html#allowoverride,
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/content-negotiation.html#negotiation.

I haven't tested this, though.


Regards,    Martin.
