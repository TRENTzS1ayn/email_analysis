I'll try to find out more. But you might be right. A quick
check gives:

http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/en/content-negotiation.var
-> Forbidden
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/en/content-negotiation.xyz
-> Not found

Using typemaps is certainly possible, but it requires some
amount of management to make sure they are correct. But then,
Apache also needs to do that because it includes links to all
available language variants in each page (which is also a
good thing to do, of course).

I have just checked that. For both Netscape 7.1 and Opera 7.2,
content negotiation worked fine, even for documents further down
in the hierarchy. I can change the order of languages in preferences
and force a reload at will. So I guess you should check your browser.
