Many tags have a title element which serves as a tooltip. Fine, nice idea.
But it seems to be problematic to have text as a subelement, since there is no
way to assign other attributes to the title text.
How can I specify language or assign a font to the title element? Sometimes
this is needed to get it to render correctly.

Any thoughts on this? Do title elements need to be limited to the language and
font of the base element?
