All,

Please find an initial draft of a framework document at
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/framework/

This pulls together decisions made at the FTF last year, and supplements
it with a small number of ideas from the WCAG requirements document,
current practise, and pointers to areas needing development.

Please take a look.  I propose to address some of the outstanding issues
during the FTF at Boston.

Cheers,
RI
