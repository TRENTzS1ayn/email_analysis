Here?s a second draft of section 3.1 of Authoring Techniques for XHTML &
HTML Internationalization:

Not all of the review comments have been addressed (see the attached table
of comments). Most of the open issues are cases where I received suggestions
that conflicted with each other. Others are open simply because I don?t yet
know what the right solution is.
