Chaps,

I have put together a mock-up of a checklist-type view [1] on the data
that's current in the HTML Authoring document [2].  This is a
hand-crafted file, but should be derived from the Authoring document
using XSLT in the future.  This version is intended to simply provide a
practical support to help us visualise where we want to go with this
idea.

Note that the table of contents to the left with expand if you click on
a heading.  Clicking on a subhead will take you to the section, where
you will see only the directive parts of the techniques.  To get the
full text, click on the icon to the right of the title.  We could also
add other icons/information - eg. Direct links to resources.

Please take a look at it and prepare comments.  We should discuss this
during the FTF.

Cheers,
RI
