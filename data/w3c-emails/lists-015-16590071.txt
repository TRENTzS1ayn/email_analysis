> I have put together a mock-up of a checklist-type view [1] on 
> the data that's current in the HTML Authoring document [2].  
> This is a hand-crafted file, but should be derived from the 
> Authoring document using XSLT in the future.  This version is 
> intended to simply provide a practical support to help us 
> visualise where we want to go with this idea.
> 
> Note that the table of contents to the left with expand if 
> you click on a heading.  Clicking on a subhead will take you 
> to the section, where you will see only the directive parts 
> of the techniques.  To get the full text, click on the icon 
> to the right of the title.  We could also add other 
> icons/information - eg. Direct links to resources.
> 
> Please take a look at it and prepare comments.  We should 
> discuss this during the FTF.
