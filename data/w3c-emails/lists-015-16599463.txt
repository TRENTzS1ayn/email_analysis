Meetings
===========
Brief discussion of agenda topics for FTF in Boston
QA want to talk with us for about half an hour to discuss needs,
expectations and position with regards to QA.
ACTION: Richard, check whether QA needs more than half an hour, and ask
for more information about what they want to talk about.
We could discuss who our audience will be in more detail
do we evangelise or document current practise?
what versions of user agent should we care about?
what about mechanisms for printing guidelines if there are
multiple pages - what requirements does printing place on us?
We could also discuss content
andrew hopes to submit something about language specification
this week
tex hopes to provide info about div vs. table layout
steve wants to produce an update of his previous submission and
start on section 3.2




Content development
===============
Discussed some points related to Steve's submission about choosing an
encoding
he has added a first technique saying choose a unicode encoding
discussion about to what detail we should help people choose a
non-Unicode character set
Suggestion that we could develop language or script specific templates
for example, a template specifically for people who want to
create arabic pages
could this be implemented using filters on the data perhaps?
We may need to invent new resource information as part of writing a
section - ie. Auxiliary pages pointed to from the techniques
techniques descriptions should probably be kept very tightly
bound to just an explanation of the directive/rule



Next meeting:
==========
Same time, same bridge, next week.
