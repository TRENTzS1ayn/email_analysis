Define the deliverables better
Review the framework document:
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/framework/
Who are the intended users?  What are their needs?
What user agents are we targeting?
What versions of those user agents are we targeting?
What is our approach: document current practise, or evangelise
better practises?
Should we be working on other templates? Eg. Script-specific?
WAI-combined?

Define better the structure of the documents I
What is the toc for the authoring doc, and the x/html and css
techniques databases
Should we have a core database?
Refine the wording and structure of the authoring toc to best
meet the needs of the users

Define better the structure of the documents II
-Look at the best way of structuring content for usability of:
-the authoring template:
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/
-the checklist:
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/upload/2003/02/html-authoring-ch.htm
l
-ie. what types of information, how to place that on the page,
what level of detail, etc.?
-how should these two interact?
-Additional questions:
-How do we deal with information about specific user
agents? Show whether everything works on specific UA versions (like
Danny Goodman's Dynamic HTML book), or point out unusual or
non-conformant features in UAs in an add-hoc manner, or both?
-How do we handle background information, instructional
text, etc. (in detail)
-How do we handle printing of the documents?
