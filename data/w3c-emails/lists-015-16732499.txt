Dear FTF observers,

Thankyou for your interest in observing the GEO face to face meeting at
the Technical Plenary in Boston.  We look forward to seeing you there.

So as not to slow down the discussion, I would be grateful if you would
read the following documents before arriving:
-http://www.w3.org/International/geo/framework/ 
-http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/ 
-
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/upload/2003/02/html-authoring-ch.htm
l 


I would also be grateful if you could note down briefly 
-what interests you in the GEO meeting, 
-what you are hoping to take away from the meeting, and 
-what days/times you are intended to attend.


You can find a first cut at the agenda at

Many thanks,
Richard
