For most groups the focus will be on QA itself: the QAWG wants to know 
what each group goals, expectations, understanding of QA is, and of 
course where they are in their own QA process.

In the case of GEO, even though we could discuss this a little, I would 
rather focus the discussion on what we have in common, i.e. outreach. 
During last QAWG f2f meeting we had Matt and Wendy as guests, and among 
others we discussed our plans and experience on outreach, which I 
believe was extremely profitable for the QAWG.

Half an hour was my suggestion, as I don't want to take too much of 
your time. If you think we can or should take more time, that would be 
great. At this point I have nothing but your group schedule for monday, 
so I may probably sit in for half a day with your group and listen.

Thanks.
