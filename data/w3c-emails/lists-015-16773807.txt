All,

I am travelling this week on non-W3C business and struggling to get
access to the internet, so please bear with me.  Just wanted to let you
know that WCAG (WAI's Web Content Accessibility Group) would indeed like
to meet with us during the Tech Plenary.  We have fixed a meeting for
5.30-6.30 on the Tuesday.  Wendy Chisholm of WCAG will lead the meeting,
explaining to us the relationships between the various aspects of WAI
deliverable (guidelines, checkpoints, checklists, techniques, tests...)
and their plans for architecture and structure of the latest WAI
techniques.  We may also have some QA attendance, but that's not yet
clear.  Towards the end of the meeting we can discuss opportunities for
convergence between GEO and WCAG approaches.

Also, I just heard from Judy Brewer that she is also interested in
having a joint discussion with ourselves and WAI Education & Outreach
people - possibly the thrust of this will be for us to keep abreast with
WAI's latest initiatives re E&O.  I will try to get a clearer idea about
this and let you know asap.

Cheers,
RI
