Hi folks,

This Workpackage is in two parts - the demonstrator and the report.

There is a demonstrator, in the form of some utilities that work with the
annotea protocol at http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200209/annodemo

These include a query tool for "off the shelf" annotea servers, as well as a
customised query for an annotea server that has been specialised to use EARL.

The report, due at the end of this month, will include explanation of how to
set up these tools and others that are available. It will also provide some
indication of possible future use of the tools.

During that development some more simple utilities are likely to be released
- the next probable development will be upgrading MUTAT -
http://www.w3.org/QA/tools/MUTAT - so that it can also interact with the EARL
service, and the existing tools may be further enhanced.

(Sorry for the delay in announcing this)

Cheers

Charles
