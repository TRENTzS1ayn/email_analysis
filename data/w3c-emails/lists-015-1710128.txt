An experiment in W3C spec overlap: using SVG, MathML, XML, RDF to
represent company accounts in the Web.


... just rediscovered some experiments from earlier this year, which I'm
hoping we might find useful within SWAD-Europe. Includes a proof of
concept implementation in N3/cwm.

Stephen, Max, any chance you could take a look at this from a MathML
perspective?

cheers,

Dan
