That's one of ours!  From the iTrust WG we are in.
I didn't think that it would be suitable for a workshop
as its too close to W3C2002.

It was an action on me to publish when these trust workshops
are.  After this one, there will be one in the autumn 2003 
(probably London) and then we are organising a larger event
in spring 2004, probably in Oxford.

This might be an interesting venue - I assume Graham Klyne can 
tell us more,
since he is on the program committee.
