Er, yes, it sometimes surprises me where my name turns up ;-)

I am a participant in the iTrust working group, whose deliverables are the 
outputs from a series of meetings, of which this conference is one.  But 
I'm just a small cog in the machine (or is that grit  ;-).

A salient characteristic of the working group, which I expect to extend to 
the conference, is its multidisciplinary approach.  At our last meeting I 
had interesting discussions with ethical philosophers and legal specialists 
as well as computer scientists.  In this respect, it should be an excellent 
opportunity for "user requirements gathering" with respect to technological 
developments in the realm of trust.
