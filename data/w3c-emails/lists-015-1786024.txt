I hadn't thought of SPKI in this context.  I agree the directness and 
relative simplicity appeals, especially when the additional metadata 
carried in X.509 certs might be supplied as signed RDF.

But ... I was of the impression that SPKI is not widely used:  do you know 
otherwise?  Do you think it's a serious contender in the public key 
security space?
