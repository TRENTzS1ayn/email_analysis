Subject: [RSS-DEV] Couple of new feeds on XMLfr (and kudos for the events
    module)

Hi,

Just to mention a couple of new RSS 1.0 feeds on XMLfr.org...

[1] http://xmlfr.org/actualites/breves/breves.rss10
[2] http://xmlfr.org/actualites/agenda/agenda.rss

The first one is for short pointers (in French) on XML news in French or
English. Unlike the usual articles on XMLfr, these are just a pointer
with a short description and I am using the content module to give this
link and the language of the article in addition to DC for metadata and
the taxo module for categorization...

The second one is for the agenda of XMLfr and is basically the same with
the addition of the events module to capture the specific information
about the events.

I had never used this module before and find it very simple and usefull.

The great think about using this module (as opposed to a specific
vocabulary for calendars) is that I have been able to reuse the
stylesheets I had already developed to display the events.

Also, it has kind of changed the way I looked at events and I am know
considering that they are both RSS new items (when I include the mention
for an events, this is considered as a news by itself for the current
date) and events (included in the calendar).

The other thing worth mentioning is the way to create new items on
XMLfr.

It's too early to formally publish it, but I have developped a very
simple bot which is subscribed to the editor's private mailing list on
XMLfr and these items (including events) are captured from emails by
recognition of simple keywords and conventions.

I know that this has been done many time on the IRC, but for whatever
reason, using the IRC isn't part of the usages amongst XMLfr editors and
the adaptation of the concept on a mailing list is working just fine.

As an example, the item about the P3P workshop is the result of the
following mail (non significant headers and content skipped):

Description: Le W3C organise cet atelier de deux jours pour discuter
des applications "?mergentes et futures" de la recommandation P3P
(Platform for Privacy Preferences) et d?terminer quelles ?volutions
sont ?ventuellement n?cessaires pour permettre ou faciliter
ces applications.

All the information inserted in the corresponding item are extracted
from the mail headers or body.

The bot itself is implemented 50% in Python (from which 50% are done
through regexpes) and 50% in XSLT and is really quite trivial to write.

It's really facilitating a lot the publishing of new items and I think
that it's a good example of how we can easily facilitate the life of our
users (including ourselves) while keeping the full power of XML and RDF
by developping some very simple utilities.
