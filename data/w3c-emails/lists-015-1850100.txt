"The semantic web area, which we've had on the books for a long time, is
more like the original web. When people do get it, you can see the twinkle
in their eye. But it's the same thing - if you show people two computers
linked together, they say 'so what'? But then imagine there are millions
of them... But because there's not that much semantic web data, you have
to make that initial leap. It takes a bit of imagination to realise that
if all the databases in the world were linked together, there are all
sorts of possibilities," he says. The project is now moving forward thanks
to research grants from the EU and the US government.
