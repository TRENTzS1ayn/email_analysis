Call for Papers and Participation

The Semantic Web is currently the most evolving area of the Internet
development. This Second-Generation Web is based not on HTML but on XML
and related technologies, such as RDF, Topic Maps, Ontologies,
Namespaces, and others. The Semantic Web is "a vision: the idea of data
on the Web defined and linked in a way that it can be used by machines
for automation, integration and reuse". The Semantic Web not only
requires adapting existing visualisation techniques and developing new
approaches, but also opens wide opportunities for their practical
implementation. The "Visualisation of the Semantic Web" was started in
2001 as the first International Symposium specially devoted to the
visual aspects of the Second Generation Web. The symposium seeks
original research papers that deal with, but are not limited to, the
following topics:

* Visualisation of Semantic Information and Metadata
* Visual Design of Ontologies and Schemas
* Conceptual Modelling of XML Data Using UML
* Topic Maps Technology
* Rendering and Viewing XML Documents
* Semantic Virtual Environments and MetaVR
* Visual Information Filtering and Knowledge Discovery
* New Visualisation Techniques for the Semantic Web
* Semantic-Oriented Use of Existing Visualisation Methods
* Multimedia Interfaces for XML Documents and Ontologies
