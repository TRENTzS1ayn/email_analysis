Hi folks,

I did some editing on this. I added more stuff about W3C as an audience,
corrected some but not all speling errors, and changed the status and
feedback address to point to this list.

While I was doing that I had the following thoughts:

  It doesn't say much about how to identify existing fora - should it?
  It should link to the calendar of deliverables but I couldn't find that
    when I needed it and had to finish.
  I will make a partners' page in the morning listing the partner
    organisations. I will try to make it minimalist and ask each partner for
    additional information and logos that should go on it as needed.

Cheers

Chaals
