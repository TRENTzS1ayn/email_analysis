Hi Folks

There is now a Partners' page at http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/partners

It contains edited versions of the information in the bid - a brief
introduction to each partner, Relevant Experience and Skill, and Key
Personnel sections.

I wondered if it was worth keeping the key personnel section, or even just
listing them and having a "people page" or links to more information about
people.

I would appreciate each partner checking that there isn't something on the
page which is incorrect or something really important that is missing. I
would also appreciate general feedback on the page...

Cheers

Chaals
