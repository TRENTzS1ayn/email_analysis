text about stilo

""Stilo has typically around 4 or 5 active Research and Development
projects, alongside
development of our own core technology. These projects usually involve
external partners,
either in industrial projects such as SophXPack which is a 4-member
consortium working on
Knowledge Engineering technology in Aerospace Design, or joint
industry-academic projects 
such as SWAD-E and MONET. There is a regular interchange of ideas and
sometimes staff 
between projects, for example we are using some Semantic Web ideas on
SophXPack. In 
addition we hold internal events (titled 'doughnut meetings'), at which
projects
are presented.""

Subject: SWAD-europe dissemination and use plan




I've been working on this, and a rough draft is at

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/dissemination_use_plan/

The plan is to send it to the commission in a weeks' time (Tuesday 3rd
September). There's a lot of tiding to be done, but this is the basic
structure we plan to submit.

At this stage we are looking for comments and for additions,
particularly in the sections on partner-specific internal audience
(Section 1.1), and in the actual DUP (Section 4) where any upcoming
conferences and other opportunities for dissemination would be useful.

The document will be updated over time as we know better what
conferences are coming up and so on.

thanks

Libby
