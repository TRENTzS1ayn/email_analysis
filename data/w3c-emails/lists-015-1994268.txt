Hi,

I have updated this to edit information provided for HP (thanks) and W3C, and
Libby has edited ILRT. I have also shortened a few of the longer sections

I also removed the "relevant experience and skill" sections at Libby's
suggestion (made on the IRC channel) - if people want them back we can do
that.

Remember that all partners can get CVS or Jigedit access to edit your
information directly if you would like to (...save me the trouble ;-).

Cheers

Charles
