Hi folks,

We have recently set up an IRC channel as a parallel to #rdfig which is in
Italian. I am not sure how many people reading this list speak Italian, but
the idea is that there are people who do, and who were struggling with RDFIG
in english. If this experiment (and it is still very much that) works, we may
try to repeat it for other languages.

Some links:
The thing was "chumped" in RDFIG on 5 September:
http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/2002/09/05/2002-09-05.html

There are two days of logs (quiet, and the logs are hand-edited so badly
formated): http://www.w3.org/People/Charles/rdfit/20020905a and
http://www.w3.org/People/Charles/rdfit/20020906 (my hope is to have a
regularl logging bot on this channel and keep the logs in a predictable
and stable place.)

Cheers

Chaals
