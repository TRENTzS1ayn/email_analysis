Cool. Reminds me that http://www.w3.org/RDF/translations.html includes
an Italian translation of the old Model and Syntax spec.

I wonder if as part of outreach efforts we could look into finding folk to
update (or create) translations of key RDF/SW specs (and other docs?).
I could bring this up in the Semantic Web Coordination Group, since it'd
need to fit with RDFCore and WebOnt WG's schedules. I'm not sure what
point in the spec lifecycle is best for encouraging tranlations... need to
look into precedents, policy etc first.

Anyway http://www.xml.it:23456/RDF/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222-it.html is the
Italian version of M+S...

ps. re stable url for logs, I hope to have esw.w3.org soon for a public
Wiki, we could use that namespace for IRC logs too. I prefer not to have
publically writeable stuff at http://www.w3.org/* URIs, to avoid
confusion...
