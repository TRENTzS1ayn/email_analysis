IST in FP6 - UK event

Record Control Number : 18930
Date : 2002-09-11
Category :  Event
General Information :
  UKISHELP and ManIST are holding a conference on IST (information
society technologies)  in the Sixth Framework programme (FP6)  in
London Heathrow on 1 and 2 October.

The conference is entitled 'Framework 6 IST: Opportunity or
threat?' and will focus on the differences between FP5 and FP6.

'In a fast changing technology and market environment it is hardly
surprising that priorities and objectives for research and
technological development funding will change from earlier
Framework programmes. We want to make sure that FP6 is seen as an
opportunity rather than a threat to UK organisations,' explained
Patrick McDonald, a Director from the UK government's department of
trade and industry (DTI) .

The event will tackle questions such as:
- is FP6 collaboration right for our developing business?
- what will be the benefits?
- what will be the likely structure for the information society
theme?
- how do we participate?

The conference will give an introduction to FP6 with in depth
presentations from DTI and European Commission officials. It will
also hold informal and interactive drop in session on FP6
instruments, partner searching, 'Go Digital' and participation.
One-to-one brokerage meetings will also be held.
