Hi, 

I think it would be best to work on the logo and other publicity ideas without 
the panic of current mid October deadline for materials. 

So propose that we design a simple fact sheet without logo for the FP6 Launch 
Conference in November while embarking on a more coherent approach for the 
overall marketing of the project. What do you think? 

It would be great to see some logo ideas etc from Coralie in early October to 
start the ball rolling, 

Kate..
