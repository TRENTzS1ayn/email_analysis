Hi everyone, 

I am circulating some ideas for agenda items for face to face meeting on Mon
23rd September, 10.00 - 17.00. Please let me know before Weds 18th Sept any 
amendments/additions you would like to see.

Technical work - update from each partner  
Conferences and workshops
Publicity
Management tools - forms, handbook, reports 
Communication - meetings, Web site 
Technical plan
Further technical discussions on deliverables due 

The meeting will be at RAL (further details to follow).

This was originally intended to be a management meeting but it was felt that 
people may like the opportunity to discuss some of the technical work that is 
coming up too so registration is open to all. 

Please confirm your attendance to me by Weds 18th September so that I can 
inform RAL who are arranging lunch. 

Looking forward to seeing you all, 

Kate..
