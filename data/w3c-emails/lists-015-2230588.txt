I had something like an idea:

http://tux.w3.org/~charles/swade.png

(if you imagine that the yellow blobs are the EU stars, that the links from
them are nicely curved like RDF arcs, and that the whole thing is done by
someone with a bit more talent, like Coralie...)

I had another idea but someone pointed out that it was more like a schematic
anatomical picture than anything else.

Anyway, I look forward to seeing whatever Coralie decides is a good idea.
