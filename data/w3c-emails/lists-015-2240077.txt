I'm looking at finalizing the agenda for this and sending it round a few
more lists. Before I do that I'd like to have a registration page if
possible. Dan, Chaals, do you think this would be possible in the next
week? I'm away till the 23rd from tomorrow and so I can send the message
around when I get back.

I can set up the text in the page, but the text I sent round is at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-esw/2002Aug/0003.html for
info.

thanks,

Libby
