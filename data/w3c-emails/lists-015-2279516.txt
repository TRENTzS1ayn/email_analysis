Heh - I like it, but it's nothing like what I was thinking of!

This is more like what I had in mind (which now looks pretty staid in

curlier w... Playing with these shapes came the challenge of doing a minimal
SVG version, but after half an hour not getting *any* arc right I gave up
and used Webdraw instead.
