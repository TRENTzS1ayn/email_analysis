...has good coverage of XML, RDF etc. in French.

for eg., http://xmlfr.org/actualites/tech/000418-000

lots of hits for 'rdf':
http://xmlfr.org/chercher/htsearch.cgi?config=htdigv2&words=rdf

I think some of the content might be translations of XMLHack articles.

Does anyone know a comprehensive list of similar sites, covering XML (and
RDF etc) in non-English European languages?

There's also btw http://xmlhack.ru/ in Russian. Non-EU, but European in
the broader sense. See http://xmlhack.ru/topics/rdf/index.html for RDF
section, which is (mostly? all?) translated from http://xmlhack.com/list.php?cat=28

I added xmlhack and xmlfr to http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/developers/
recently; would be good to collect up more such links, alongside
translations etc... Pointers/suggestions welcomed...

Dan
