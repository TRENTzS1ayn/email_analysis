This is now <30 days away and we haven't announced it yet :)

The agenda on http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/200210-init/
needs expanding and the named people and responsibilities allocated.

There are >8 hours of slots to fill and we need to work out what the
participants are going to get out of it, plus the preparation we
should do - handouts, talks, demos.

Cheers

Dave
