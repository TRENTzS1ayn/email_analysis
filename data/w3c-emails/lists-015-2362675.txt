OK, the page has been updated.

We are trying to work out whether we need a registration system or can just
get information from the folks running the DC conference - so we may put a
registration form up in a couple of days and ask peopleto fill it in.

We still need (IMHO) to know how the technical workshop will be distributed
across the several hours and two days available - just a couple of lines to
put on the meeting page so people don't get the impression it is just a vague
talk-fest spread out over slots that were available.

Cheers
