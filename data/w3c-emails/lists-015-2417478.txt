Getting to RAL
------------------

RAL is located some 17 miles South of Oxford. The nearest railway station is 
Didcot Parkway, conveniently on the mainline from Bristol to London. There is a 
public bus up to RAL ("Harwell International Business Centre"), but more 
convenient to take a taxi, especially if there are more than one person 
travelling; costs about ?12, takes about 15mins. 

By car, the M4 is about 8 miles away, take the A34 North at the Newbury 
junction (J13), (or the A34 South from Oxford if coming from that way).   RAL 
is signposted off the A34.

----------------------------------------------------------
Info on wireless connectivity from Brian 
----------------------------------------------------------

R1 CR02  has wireless available.  The user must use DHCP to get an IP
address. The address will be in the RAL DMZ to protect RAL  systems. There is 
no security on this network and for the user  who has a wireless  this should 
just work unless there is a problem with the wireless  network etc.
If anyone requires non-wireless connectivity, could they let me know in
advance <B.M.Matthews@rl.ac.uk> so I can make appropriate arrangements.

ILRT booked on to 8.15 train to Didcot from Bristol Temple Meads - if other 
Bristol people want to join us! 

Lunch will be provided by RAL.

See you on Monday, 

Kate..
