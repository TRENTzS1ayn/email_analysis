CORDIS publishes project ideas from Europe's research community in
preparation for FP6

Record Control Number : 18989
Date : 2002-09-24
Category :  Programme implementation
General Information :
  In March 2002, the European Commission launched an invitation to
submit Expressions of interest (EoI)  for research actions under
the Sixth Framework programme's (FP6)  new thematic priorities. By
the deadline in June 2002, more than 11,500 proposals were received
which will help the Commission in preparing work programmes as well
as defining the scope of the first FP6 calls for proposals to be
published by the end of the year.

CORDIS, the European Commission's Research and Development
Information Service, is publishing all the EoI (unless the
submitters have requested otherwise) . A search feature enables a
quick review of proposed projects. Each record provides contact
details, an abstract on the project, details of which instrument is
applicable and additional information.

Users can search and select proposed projects according to the
thematic priorities, new instruments, countries or keywords. Ideas
were submitted by organisations from more than 50 countries and
there is a good distribution across the thematic priorities. The
information is therefore a valuable basis for making contacts and
reviewing readiness to use new instruments in FP6.

CORDIS is supporting preparations for FP6. A fully fledged FP6
service will soon be available as well as a redesigned Partners
service. Both new sites will offer relevant information enabling
the user to keep abreast of the latest decisions, review ideas,
access documentation from the first calls and prepare for fruitful
collaboration.
