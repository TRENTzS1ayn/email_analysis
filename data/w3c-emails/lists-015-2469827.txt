Hi folks,

At this stage the next workshop we are planning is for late february, in
amsterdam, about the topic of visualising information.

Interesting work that is related includes
  Visual editors for RDF
  converting data into visual form for easy comprehension
  controlling the rendering for simpler presentation
  accessibility of visualisation

among other areas. Input to plannning is welcome at the moment - from
appropriate dates (or impossible dates) do agenda items or desired outcomes.

More detail will be forthcoming shortly.

Cheers

Charles
