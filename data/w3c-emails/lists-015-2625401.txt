hi all,

As outlined at the face to face meet, I've been working on methods of
getting coordinate information about the locations of Semantic web
researchers and groups. I wrote to the www-rdf-interest list asking for
data:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2003Apr/0252.html

so we'll have to see how that pans out. Please do add yourselves if
you've not already there (I just did a few as examples).

There are some SVG demos, developed from ones by Jim Ley, displaying the
information we have already, which I constructed as examples:

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200303/geo/intro.html#demos

So, now we have to decide on the map which we will use to overlay the
dots on. We want something that will highlight Europe, especially since
on a world map, Europe is too small to really show up on provide the
level of detail we require. At ILRT, Caroline Meek, Dan and I have had
discussions with a designer, and he has pointed us at some examples, and
we've narrowed it down to two that we rather like:

http://www.cadmium.co.uk/thumbs/brand%20x/maps%20and%20globes/t_bxp_c31027.jpg.jpg

which has the advantage of showing Europe as part of the world (we could
get rid of the arm of the globe that is showing, and alter the colours);
and

http://www.cadmium.co.uk/thumbs/ds/maps%20and%20globes/t_11407324.jpg.jpg

which would be technically simpler to do, but shows Europe in isolation
(I do like the colour scheme though).

Do people have a preference for one style over the other?

Could you let us know today if possible? We need to specify the map as
soon as possible in order to get postcards printed for www2003.

thanks,

Libby

p.s. Here's a nice similar idea:
