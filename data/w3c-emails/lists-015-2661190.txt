Hi Libby,
> What don't you like about them in particular?
The globe is too visually busy for a background (imho), and if you decrease
the opacity I think you'll lose too much of the important bits (like where
the UK is :-).   The map would be OK as a backdrop for the FOAF map if it
was semi-opaque, but (a) it misses out the rest of the world, as you said
yourself, and (b) there's a big blue empty space on the left :-).  The
atlantic is just too big** if you keep it to scale, hence my suggestion to
use more of a schematic approach.  I guess you need the cartographical
equivalent of an ellipsis, whatever that might be!

Cheers,
Ian
