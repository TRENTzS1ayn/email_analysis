sorry I missed that :(

I had a look to the #rdfig weblog - the design looks cool and nice 
color too :)

well done!

just a small comment on the back side of the t-shirt:

http://liz.xtdnet.nl/swad/back_men.gif

the Italian phrasing should more correctly be instead:

"e tutto quello che abbiamo ottenuto e' questa stupida maglietta"

or you can use t-shirt instead of "maglietta" which is fine too

cheers
