Hi,

I agree that the brains are a bit yucky and I think that a more
cartoonish style would work better (e.g. [1]), in particular would fit
the humour of the overall design better, and would match the "thought
bubbles".

The swooshy lines and the growing size of the brains as the sentence
is spelled out makes it seem that it's a single brain making its way
away from the t-shirt. Is this intended?

I like the women's t-shirt colour better, except that it makes the
brains less visible. Would it be too expensive to have more colours
for the brains?

The French is wrong (unsurprising since Libby tells me it's out of
babelfish). Better is:

Et tout ce qu'on a eu c'est ce T-shirt stupide

And it just stroke it now that that sentence is the continuation of
the front sentence. Perhaps a pair of "..." on each part would make it
clearer.

Cheers,

Max.
