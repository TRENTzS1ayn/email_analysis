Just so I remember about this later:

[[
All European Semantic Web projects, as well as other research projects
in the Semantic Web area world-wide, are invited to present a poster at
the ESWS2004. Each project presenting a poster is requested to submit a
twopage project description. Submission details will be on the web site
http://www.esws2004.org/. Submission deadline is February 28, 2004.
