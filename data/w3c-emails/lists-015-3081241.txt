The requirements specification [1] for the first of HP's demonstrators,
semantic blogging for bibliographies, is now out.

The document basically defines a small (but useful) tightly scoped core.
There are a variety of possible extensions which have been described in
varying depth. Of possible interest is an extensive survey of related work
(both in the blogging and bibliographic world) and a short user study.

Other relevant documents include
 - HP semantic blogging webpage [2]
 - Our previous report on semantic web applications [3]

As usual, comments welcome.

Cheers

Steve
