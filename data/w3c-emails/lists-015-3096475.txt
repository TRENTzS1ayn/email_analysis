CORES Schema Creation and Registration Workshop
SZTAKI, Budapest, 6-7 March 2003
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/events/cores/intro.html

This project has been funded by the European Community.

The workshop will provide an introduction to the use of RDF to describe
metadata vocabularies in the form of machine-understandable schemas. It
will focus on the publication of these schemas in the CORES Schema
Registry. Practical sessions will allow participants to learn to use the
CORES Schema Creation Tool to prepare schemas and submit them to the
Registry, and to navigate the schemas submitted via the Registry's Web
interface.

The workshop is targetted at those with an interest in creating and
managing metadata vocabularies. Workshop participants should be familiar
with a specific metadata element set which they can use as a basis for
input into the schema creation tool. Detailed knowledge of RDF Schema
semantics and RDF/XML syntax is not required, as the schema encoding
will be generated by the tool. For participants wishing to gain a
working understanding of RDF and its application to the description of
metadata vocabularies, the workshop will provide a good opportunity to
focus on some key issues, without the need to focus on syntactic
details.

The Cost of Registering for the workshop is ?70.00 (Pounds Sterling)
The delegate fee includes full attendance at the workshop, refreshments
and lunch on both days, dinner on 6th March and workshop materials.
