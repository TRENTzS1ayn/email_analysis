A pity that they didn't mention that the CORES stuff was based on the
earlier MEG Registry project by UKOLN and ILRT which used DC and RDF
for the datamodel.  The technical development was done at ILRT by
myself (server in Perl using Redland) and Damian Steer (client in
Java using Jena)

The project http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/education/regproj/
and the demo registry http://meg.ukoln.ac.uk/

We had a MEG workshop recently demonstrating these things and had
good reports from it.
