==================================================
THE FIRST EUROPEAN SUMMER SCHOOL
ON ONTOLOGICAL ENGINEERING AND THE SEMANTIC WEB (SSSW-2003)

http://minsky.dia.fi.upm.es/summerschool/

VENUE
Cercedilla, near Madrid, Spain.

DATE
21-26, July 2003

ORGANIZING COMMITTEE
Enrico Motta (Director)
Asun Gomez-Perez (Co-Director)
Arthur Stutt (Project Co-ordinator)

INTRODUCTION
The OntoWeb Network Consortium (www.ontoweb.org) is pleased to
announce the first European Summer School on Ontological Engineering
and the Semantic Web. This summer school, presented by leading
researchers in the field, is the first opportunity anywhere in the world for
postgraduate students to equip themselves with the range of
theoretical and practical skills necessary for full engagement with
the challenges involved in developing Ontologies and Semantic Web
applications. With this in mind, candidates will need to book early
to avoid disappointment. The school will be limited to 50 participants.

APPROACH
To avoid a passive learning experience we will augment theoretical
material with practical workshops. Furthermore, we will ensure that
the theoretical sessions are complementary to each other by linking them to
a mini-project. Work on developing and presenting this project in
cooperation with other participants will serve as a means of
consolidating the knowledge and skills gained from lectures and
practical sessions.

Participants will be provided with a copy of all course lectures and
access to a PC with all necessary tools and environments pre-installed.

COURSE TOPICS
Knowledge Representation and Ontologies
Semantic Web Services
Language Technologies for the Semantic Web

BENEFITS OF ATTENDING
SSSW-2003 will provide a stimulating and enjoyable environment in
which participants will benefit not only from the formal and practical
sessions but also from informal and social interactions with
established researchers and peers relatively new to the area.

After completing the course, participants will:
* Understand the motivation behind, and history of, efforts to build a
Semantic Web
* Be able to critique research papers on the Semantic Web
* Be able to use a range of tools to build Semantic Web applications
* Be able to identify possible new lines of research

ACCOMMODATION AND SOCIAL EVENTS
Cercedilla is a small village in the mountains near Madrid. The school
will be held in the Universidad Polit?cnica de Madrid's student house.
The student house has a range of facilities to make your stay more
pleasant including en suite bathrooms, swimming pool, bars and
restaurants in the village.

There will be an afternoon excursion to a local tourist destination.
Both this and a gala dinner will be included in the cost.

PARTICIPANTS
We welcome applicants from anywhere in the world. Normally applicants
will be first or second year postgraduate students in relevant
disciplines with some knowledge of ontological or knowledge
engineering and/or the development of applications for the World Wide
Web.

COST OF SUMMER SCHOOL INCLUDING
ACCOMMODATION, MEALS AND EXCURSION

Euros 625

TRAVEL AND LOCAL INFORMATION
The nearest airport is Madrid-Barajas.
Participants will be able to use local rail links from Madrid to Cercedilla.
We hope to arrange a coach for participants.

Further information about how to reach Cercedilla is on the web site.
