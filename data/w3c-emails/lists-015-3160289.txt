From my SWAD-Europe weblog posting:

We promised to keep the two WP10 reports fresh and add feedback. 
I've had some sitting in my inbox for a while and it was time to merge
them in.  So this week I've been updating the Mapping data from RDBMS
(first published in January 2003) and Scalability and Storage: Survey
of Free Software / Open Source RDF storage systems (July 2002).  The
former gained a new section since there are actual mapping tools
starting to be available to turn relational databases into RDF.  The
latter some updates to new features of Sesame (and other tools) and
some corrections.  All the changes are in the corresponding changes
sections of each document.

http://esw.w3.org/mt/esw/archives/000025.html gives you the links

Try posting yourself - it's easy.  Don't forget to change the
pulldown menu to 'Publish' rather than 'Draft'.

Cheers

Dave
