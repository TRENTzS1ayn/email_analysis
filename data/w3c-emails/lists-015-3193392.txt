Hi folks

There are some questions that came from the Initial technical workshop which
are (I think) really frequently asked ones, and it makes more sense to me
that we collect them somewhere other than in one particular workshop report -
in part because I suspect we will think about updating the answers through
the life of the project.

The possibilities that occur to me are the following:

1. List them and what we know about answers in the report, and use something
like RSS to gather them into a document (and know where they are so we know
where to go back and update them as appropriate)

2. Create some general FAQ documents now which we edit on an ongoing basis,
and point to them from the report write-ups as appropriate.

3. Do something else...

It seems to me that number 1. is the best option, because it means I can
start by creating a few questions and answers, and we can later collect them
and relate them as we choose. But it seemed worthwhile asking if anyone
thought otherwise before I went ahead.

It would in effect be following the existing practise, as per the reports on
Scalable storage systems and Annotation servers. If we want to be doing
option 2 it is probably as well to start now as later - hence the question.

Cheers

Chaals
