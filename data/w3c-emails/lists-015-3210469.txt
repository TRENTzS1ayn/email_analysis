This is what I started to do - to the extent that I listed questions raised,
and questions raised with answers proposed, in the report for the initial
workshop.

A number of the questions raised but not answered in the workshop were
answered in the FAQ section of Dave Beckett's report on Open source RDF
stores and their scalability. So the question is whether the report should
simply link to those answers, or we should try to do something smarter.

Again, my first appraoch is to simply make the question/answer pairs in
Dave's report targets and link to them, but it seems that it will soon be
more useful to be able to extract the FAQs. If anyone ahs good ideas about
how to do this now, so we can settle on markup conventions before we have too
much to retrofit, I am interested. Otherwise we will just see what happens
later...
