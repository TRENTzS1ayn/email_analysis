I mostly agree but with a slight note of caution.

I agree that it is best to pick one, or a small number of, focused application
classes. I agree that success on the "public web" would carry more impact than
many alternatives and should be the target if possible.

My caution is that the semantic web is primarily about machine readable data and
the public web is, currently, primarily about human readable data. This tends to
leave the role of the semantic web technology on the public web as mostly
concerned with metadata about otherwise human readable documents. Metadata is
certainly useful but (a) is often internal to a site and so benefits less from
standardization and (b) is subject to the bottleneck that people avoid providing
metadata if they possibly can. 

Now I *do* think there are roles for semantic web technologies in the public
web, otherwise we wouldn't have proposed semantic blogging and semantic portals
as our two demonstrator apps! However, I'm not sure we have a clear idea of the
most useful roles. So "yes" to targeting the public web, but work needs to done
to make that more specific before you turn it into work priorities.
