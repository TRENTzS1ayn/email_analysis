Dan,

It would be good to see more RDF "out there".  Getting real use ("real"
being relative here!) both increases the visibility of the semantic web and
fuels the software that makes it all go.  We need to ask what would make for
more RDF produced and consumed.

It is hard today to author RDF or to use RDF.  One really needs to be
comfortable with the specs to make serious progress, especially if others
are going to use the RDF.  For that reason, I think there is much to do in
the software tools for RDF to make the barriers to its use much less.

This is especially true of using RDF read from elsewhere - people will be
encouraged to add/create RDF to their webs when people think it enhances the
value of their pages.

So - "yes" to use of RDF on the public web, but it is a bit of a "both" not
"either/or".

Andy

I mostly agree but with a slight note of caution.

I agree that it is best to pick one, or a small number of, focused
application
classes. I agree that success on the "public web" would carry more impact
than
many alternatives and should be the target if possible.

My caution is that the semantic web is primarily about machine readable data
and
the public web is, currently, primarily about human readable data. This
tends to
leave the role of the semantic web technology on the public web as mostly
concerned with metadata about otherwise human readable documents. Metadata
is
certainly useful but (a) is often internal to a site and so benefits less
from
standardization and (b) is subject to the bottleneck that people avoid
providing
metadata if they possibly can. 

Now I *do* think there are roles for semantic web technologies in the public
web, otherwise we wouldn't have proposed semantic blogging and semantic
portals
as our two demonstrator apps! However, I'm not sure we have a clear idea of
the
most useful roles. So "yes" to targeting the public web, but work needs to
done
to make that more specific before you turn it into work priorities.
