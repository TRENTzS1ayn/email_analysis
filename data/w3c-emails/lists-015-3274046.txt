I saw your posting.  I am just about to go into a meeting with Steve
Conibear of UKRO to discuss our proposals to  extend the work that we have
been doing on SMIL authoring systems and accessibility beyond
education.  If you received any other responses from people who might want
to collaborate on this area I would be very interested in contacts.
