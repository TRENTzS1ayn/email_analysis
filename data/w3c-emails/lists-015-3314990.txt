Hi

I have set up an installation of the Movable Type system, for use by 
interested project partners and collaborators. It is a very popular and pretty slick 
Weblog management package, not opensource but free for non-profit use(*). I've 
used it elsewhere, as has Dave and others. Chatting with Paul Shabajee earlier this 
week, we noted the overlap with the planned HP demo work on Semantic Blogging/weblogging 
and bibliographic information; we thought that getting some experience with 
this package would be good background to research/demos elsewhere in the package. 

Currently I have set up accounts for myself, Kate, Nikki, Charles, Libby, Dave. I 
can create additional accounts for any SWAD-Europe project participants who are 
interested: please let me know, providing your W3C member account Web username. For 
technical and admin reasons this is on a separate box and subdomain from the rest of 
the W3C website, but I'd like at least to make sure usernames match up. Ideally
it would be good to have occasional updates, however informal, from each project partner.

Currently, there is just one Weblog set up under this installation; we could add 
more, eg with invited participation from the RDF Interest Group on specific topics 
(calendaring, query, thesaurus...). The site currently has some brief news items on it 
from me, Libby (re calendaring) and Dave (re his workpackage). There's probably a 
balance to be found between putting stuff on the weblog (better for broad dissemination, 
classification etc of articles) versus posting it to this list. I'm sure we'll 
figure out which works for which purpose as time goes on. For me at least, I find 
weblogs a useful way to keep research notes and be more open about what I'm working on...


Public URL for 'esw' weblog:  http://esw.w3.org/mt/esw/
Admin interface: http://esw.w3.org/mtcgi/mt.cgi (username/passwd'd)
Movable Type homepage:http://www.movabletype.org/

It also automatically generates an RSS 1.0 (RDF) feed 
describing new items, so our postings can get picked up by RSS syndicators.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

cheers,

(*)I intend to register a copy, regardless of whether we're non-profit or not as 
a project.
