same here - we got some simple RDQL regression tests distributed with  
rdfstore and you can have a look to them on the CVS rep at sourceforge.

we are not going that far at the moment just having some test data,  
queries and some expected num of results; everything is in perl code at  
the moment but it would be great to have some good ones expressed in  
some RDF, like Libby/Dan ones and jena.

I was proposing to Libby eventually the possibility to add links on  
that page to actually add test data to specific use-cases or examples  
together with some test results i.e. link up the tests to the query  
language example to the use-cases.

is there an RDF Schema for Libby's tests-manifest somewhere? not that I  
need one at the moment :-)

cheers

Alberto
