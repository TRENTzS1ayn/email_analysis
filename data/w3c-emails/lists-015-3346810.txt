Hi Libby!

good question; it seems to us that a query is simply
a set of triples where bnodes play the role of variables
we then basically can apply a resolution process

[[[
The resolution process starts with a query. A query is a tripleset.
The query will be matched against the triplesets of the initial
graph G and against the rules. The set unifies with a rule when
one of the triples of the set unifies with the consequent of the
rule. The set unifies with another set if all triples in the set
unify with a triple of the other set. This can possibly be done
in different ways. The result of the unification of two triple
sets is a list of substitutionlists.

and this is work done by Guido Naudts in his master thesis

we also have some running code at http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/
and some testcases starting at http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/etc5

but there's still a lot to do...

Hi all

We have some effort in SWAD-Europe [1] to write a document about RDF
query [see [2]]. Part of this will be FAQ-based - a start is here [3],
(and I'd be grateful for any FAQs or answers).

The main reason for sending this message it because I've chatted to a
few people who feel that a collection of RDF query testcases would be a
useful thing to have, and I can put some effort into this - maybe as a
minimum, finding out what's already available, and maybe look into some
ways of enabling one query language implementation to use another's
testcases.

So, would anyone out there like to share their test and their
experiences of writing them? I can infer that Jena and 4suite have
them; I think Mozilla has some too. I've got some here for Inkling:

http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/rdfquery/tests/
http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/rdfquery/rdf/
http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/rdfquery/queries/

Basically the test scripts read in
http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/rdfquery/rdf/query-results-manifest.rdf

which specifies the RDF/XML file to pull in, the query to use and the
expected number of rows in the resulting table. So it's only a very
basic test of whether the query engine is functioning.

Any more? Any thoughts?

cheers,

Libby
