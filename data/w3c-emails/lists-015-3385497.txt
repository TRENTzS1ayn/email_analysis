I didn't realise Semantic Blogging was being followed up as an e-sw case
study, until I found the link on the new blog...

Anyhow, one of the apps I've been working on for my Ideagraph project is
semantic blogging and to help with this I've started writing up a vocabulary
(RDFS) for 'Issue-Based Information Systems', the idea being to use terms
like 'Argument', 'Question', 'pro', 'con' within blog (and other) discussion
threads.

Very much a work in progress, suggestions welcome.

Cheers,
Danny.
