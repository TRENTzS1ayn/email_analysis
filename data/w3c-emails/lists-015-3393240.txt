Hi Danny,

co-coincidentally MT just happens to be the blogging tool we are playing
around with at HP for the SWAD-E demonstrator 12.1
We're likely to use it in some form so it's likely that we will produce some
MT+RDF combo.

Cheers

Steve

PS I like your semweb blog, a very useful source of info!

Excellent. Blogged [1] & blogrolled [2] ;-)

Two related things I'd like to see around here somewhere (both within SWAD-E
scope?) :

* a list of semweb related blogs (I've got a handful listed on [2], but most
of those, e.g. dajobe's, I found by chance)

* tips/scripts for semweb-enabling blogging tools (things on top of RSS 1.0
feeds) - dogfood!

Coincidentally I just set up an Movable Type blog [1] for personal stuff
(the other one's really just for bookmarking semweb-related sites), so I'd
be particularly interested in anything MT+RDF you come up with.

Cheers,
Danny.
