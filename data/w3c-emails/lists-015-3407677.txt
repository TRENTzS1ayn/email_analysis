That's great! I'd really like to see some more interesting stuff done with
it (trackback etc is pretty cool already), especially since virtually
everyone seems to be viewing RSS 1.0 merely as just another XML dialect
rather than using the RDF capabilities. Even something as simple as a
template for including FOAF links could make a lot of difference.

Cheers,
Danny.
