Hi Danny,

the vocabulary stuff you are looking at sounds like it is extending
the thread vocabulary produced for Annotea (or for that matter the original
Annotea vocabulary of annotation types) to allow for discussion threads
to be tracked. This seems to me like a good idea.

http://www.w3.org/2001/03/thread

The ability to provide user-friendly interfaces for this (such as the
icon-selection that Amaya has for marking different types of annotation - see
the help file at
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/attaching_annotations/configuring_icons) is a
promising paralell for the use of graphic RDF editors (IdeaGraph, IsaViz,
RDFAuthor, etc)

cheers
