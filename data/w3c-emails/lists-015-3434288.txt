Thanks Chaals, this is excellent - it's been a long time since I looked at
the Annotea material and I'd forgotten all about this stuff. You're right -
IBIS should mesh well with the thread vocab.

fyi, my starting point with the vocab was the other IBIS material by Jack
Park (of Topic Map fame) and others. There's also the ScholOnto vocabulary,
which is promising but IMHO a bit too focussed on discussing academic papers
and also Dave Menendez's Thread Description Language
(http://www.eyrie.org/~zednenem/2002/web-threads/) which is more focussed on
blogs etc but (again IMHO) crams a little too much in.

Thanks again - one sub-block of Ideagraph I've nearly got working is holding
user preferences in RDF (not unrelated to the XUL kind of thing, but closer
to the Java Properties class for holding attribute-value pairs). Tying this
together with the thread terms could look very cool.

Cheers,
Danny.
