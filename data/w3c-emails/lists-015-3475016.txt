A couple of people have asked me about the Weblog, generally being favourable 
but not sure when to use it instead of the mailing list, and wary of splitting 
discussions across too many fora / technologies.

There's no right answer, but I guess the thing to bear in mind is that the 
Weblog is abit more outward facing, so readers there may not care so much about 
workpackage innards, meetings etc. And may need a bit more context on what 
we're up to.

In general, I suggest sending major project related progress stuff to the list, 
and if of likely wider interest, also noting it by reference with a quick Weblog 
entry.

For eg., I just scribbled this note http://esw.w3.org/mt/esw/archives/000015.html
about the Schema annotation experiments. It took a couple of minutes, which 
since the weblog is RSS-syndicated is probably worth the effort, as it can 
keep a wider audience up to date with our ongoing work. 

I also share such links in #rdfig, the RDF Interest Group IRC channel, since that too
has a Weblog and RSS view (see http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/) and is widely read by 
RDF folk. Unless you are a regular there, I doubt many will want to enter their 
URLs/descriptions a 3rd time though.

Hope this helps,

Dan
