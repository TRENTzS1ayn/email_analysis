As a startup for WP8 (Thesaurus) I have requested a mailing list
for RDF/thesaurus discussions: public-esw-thes

WP b/g:
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/plan/workpackages/live/esw-wp-8.html

This work hasn't formally begun yet, but I'm finding there are various 
offlist conversations on this topic happening, and it would be good 
for the project if we could play host to RDF/thesaurus discussion.

BTW I am also thinking of moving my RDF/Wordnet vocabulary across to 
SWAD-Europe since the namespace needs to change anyway, and it provides 
RDF classes for many thousands of common category terms, as well as 
placing them in a hierarchy. This is useful for image annotation, 
amongst other things. 

That work is currently at http://xmlns.com/2001/08/wordnet/ and uses
http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/ as a namespace URI.

cheers,

Dan
