I have set up a SWAD-Europe Wiki installation, as a place for quick note-taking, 
FAQ drafting and link sharing. Like many Wikis (and mailing lists, though that's 
a bit different), it is currently configured as a publically writable space. 
It may prove useful as a tool to support discussions in the RDF Interest Group 
and associated spin-off task forces (eg. RDF calendaring). Time will tell.

More context: In the RDF Interest Group, we get a fair amount done by email and 
irc, but the same topics tend to recur without answers being drafted. Often an 
email or irc discussion thread will go some way towards answering the topic, 
but we've not yet been good at seeing things through to final documentation.

One goal I have for the Wiki installation is to allow active RDFIG members to
gather FAQ background materials without centralised bottlenecks (or quality control 
 / review). Hosting a Wiki (ie. a publically writable Web-based scratchpad) is 
an experiment towards seeing how well this works, and how the tradeoffs between 
centralised control vs community scribbling pay off in the RDF developer world.

The Wiki entry page is at http://esw.w3.org/t//view/ESW/WebHome and could do 
with better boilerplate, intro text and a few link fixes etc. I wanted to get this 
made public so that it could be used in the RDF calendar and RDF query test case 
discussions that are ongoing (www-rdf-calendar, www-rdf-rules lists). 

Libby, would it be worth mentioning this in the Calendar IRC meeting on weds? Do 
you think that group would find a Wiki scratchpad useful? What about Query?

Comments etc welcomed,

Dan
