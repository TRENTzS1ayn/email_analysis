Hi Danny,

This sounds interesting, and is a limitation that irritates me too.

The various solutions we have mulled over are:
1). Simply putting the categories in a taxonomy is a good start (they're not
currently in MT)
2). Explicitly share a taxonomy (OK for small groups).  
3). Allow lightweight mappings between related taxonomies, using something
like an RDF version of XFML [1]

We're likely to adopt (1) and (2) for SWAD-E demonstrator 12.1, with (3) as
an optional extension
Your wordnet approach is another interesting angle, let us know how it goes!

Cheers

Steve

This thread has provided the answer to a problem that I've been mulling over
for a few weeks ;-)

Some blogging tools (such as Movable Type) allow the user to categorise
their posts, but the categories used are totally arbitrary, just strings
decided by the user. To be able to index across systems, some sharing of
taxonomies would be needed. It occurred to me that a lookup of something
like Wordnet would allow the mapping of Cats (in Danny's blog) to
http://whatever/worndet#Cat and thence to Cats (in Libby's blog). So it
looks like pretty much any of these query tools would be up to the job. The
next stages are I suppose setting the 'dictionary' up as a service, then
implementing a user-transparent interface.

Cheers,
Danny.
