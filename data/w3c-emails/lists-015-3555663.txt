I think I've circulated this before, but to put it back on the record 
with a findable Subject: line, here is a page that partially documents 
a worked example I hope we'll study in more depth in WP6 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/plan/workpackages/live/esw-wp-6.html for the 
Month 21 deliverable, (6.2: xml_sw_prototype_math_logic).

The writeup and test data is at http://www.w3.org/2002/04/corpinfo/semweb-scenario 
...and includes files (http://www.w3.org/2002/04/corpinfo/) that give basic
'company reports' markup for several companies, in RDF. There is also an N3 
representation of some mathematical rules relating the various things that 
appear in these reports. Very much work in progress (except that nobody is 
actively working on it) but interesting I think as a testbed for exploring when
MathML makes sense, when RDF rules are more appropriate, and how it all 
fits together.
