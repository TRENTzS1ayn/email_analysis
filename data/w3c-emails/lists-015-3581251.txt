Hi Danny, Charles,

I hear that DanBri, in reference to HP's open demonstrator (WP 12.1) has
suggested sharing ontologies for describing inter-document links. 
I'd certainly be keen on the idea, we certainly need to define such an
ontology and these look highly relevant.
The other one that I'm aware of is ClaiMaker[1]. Danny, did you ever get an
RDF schema [2] from the KMI folks?

Cheers

Steve

Hi Danny,

the vocabulary stuff you are looking at sounds like it is extending
the thread vocabulary produced for Annotea (or for that matter the original
Annotea vocabulary of annotation types) to allow for discussion threads
to be tracked. This seems to me like a good idea.

http://www.w3.org/2001/03/thread

The ability to provide user-friendly interfaces for this (such as the
icon-selection that Amaya has for marking different types of annotation -
see
the help file at
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/attaching_annotations/configuring_icons) is a
promising paralell for the use of graphic RDF editors (IdeaGraph, IsaViz,
RDFAuthor, etc)

cheers
