Dan,

I haven't had a chance to look at your cooperative whitelist pointers yet, 
but this is the response I got back from Paul Hoffman, who is not prepared 
to release his whitelist for such a scheme.  And now I think about it, it 
is a glaring vulnerability.   (And that's before even thinking about the 
privacy concerns you mention.)

The bottom line is that the security will need to be much more carefully 
thought out if this is going to fly at any significant scale.
