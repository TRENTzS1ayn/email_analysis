Michael,

I seem to recall hearing that ELSTT (or EELS?) thesaurus was represented
using this schema. Can you confirm? and if so, is this online?  Are
there any other thesauri that are using this schema?

I've heard rumors of generalizing some of the NISO Z39.19 [1] work to
support multilingual thesaurus and I believe that an RDF schema that
supports this requirement would be well received as the basis for such
work. Having several thesauri represented this way would make for a more
compelling argument.
