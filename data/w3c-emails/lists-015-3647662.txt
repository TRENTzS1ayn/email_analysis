  Authors: Dave Beckett, Jan Grant

  Abstract:
    A public report on mapping triple stores and RDBMS concentrating
    on surveying the schemas used and discussing mapping approaches
    to and from relational schemas. It describes current best
    practice for using such systems for Semantic Web data including
    feature comparisons, recommendations for particular applications
    and advice on tradeoffs.
