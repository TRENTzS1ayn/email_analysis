If I understand the intent correctly, I think this modelling works fine.

When I was playing with modelling access control, the modelling problems I 
ran in to with the style use use here were when the truth of the RDF 
assertion was dependent on one or more of the assertions being present.  I 
think you can remove any of your assertions and the rersult-set assertion 
statement remains true.

Hmmm... I wonder of there should be links to, or identifiers of, the 
knowledge-base and query used, so that valid results from different queries 
can be differentiated.  In practice, I think this kind of testing is a 
relatively closed-world activity, so maybe it doesn't matter.
