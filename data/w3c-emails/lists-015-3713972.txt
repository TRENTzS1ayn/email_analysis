I'm not sure which way round you mean "multiple valid resultsets per query":
the vocabulary allows multiple solutions per result table.  And also
multiple result sets per result graph because it is rooted from a single
node.  The example uses <> as that node but there is no reason it has to be
that; you could have a bNode there, and have another starting bNode
somewhere else.

Could you give an example of when there would be multiple result sets?  I
can image a "query request" to actually consist of a series of "queries" all
of which should be executed.
