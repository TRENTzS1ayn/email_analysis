I guess I mean that if you were associating a resultset with a query,
there might be several different resultsets that would be ok. by this I
mean several tables which are valid depending on whether the KB does
transitive closure on classes or not etc. Maybe it does this: I find it
difficult to read N3, and RDF schemas in general. Examples are the thing
for me, so I guess I should get on and try and add to yours from the
data we have.

Many thanks for doing this Andy :)
