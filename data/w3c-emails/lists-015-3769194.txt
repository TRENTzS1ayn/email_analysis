Re:  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-klyne-message-xml-00.txt

I'm reviving an old project of mine to define an XML format to carry 
information from email and related message formats.  This work started life 
as a proposal for an instant messaging format, but since attracted interest 
from XML application developers who wanted to process email-related 
information.  The goal is, in part, to create an XML message format that is 
also RDF compliant; i.e. accessible to RDF parsers with conversion.  (The 
goal is NOT to do email-in-XML.)

My plan for this is to update the document with feedback I'm getting from 
some interested folks and request publication as an informational RFC.
