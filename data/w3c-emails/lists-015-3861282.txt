Subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Raptor RDF Parser Toolkit 0.9.11


   Raptor RDF Parser Toolkit 0.9.11
     http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/raptor/

               Supported by EU IST project SWAD-Europe
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/

Raptor is a free software/Open Source C library that parses RDF
syntaxes such as RDF/XML and N-Triples into RDF triples.  It handles
all RDF vocabularies such as FOAF, RSS 1.0, Dublin Core and OWL.

Raptor was designed to work closely with the Redland RDF library but
is fully separate.  It is a portable library that works across many
POSIX systems (Unix, GNU/Linux, BSDs, OSX, cygwin, win32).  Raptor
has no memory leaks and is fast.

This is a major stable release of Raptor and the 1.0 release
candidate since it now handles all the RDF Core working group test
cases.  At version 1.0 the deprecated functions will be removed.

Summary of changes:

 * Completely handles the revised RDF/XML syntax
   (including post W3C Last Call changes)
   - Added Unicode Normal Form C (NFC) checking for literals
     (requires GNOME glib 2.0 at present)
   - Added Exclusive XML Canonicalization for XML Literals
   - Added many more checks for bad syntax (mostly illegal property attributes)
   - Updated parseType="Collection" triples after RDF Core WG changes.

 * Added an experimental RSS Tag Soup parser to read any pile of XML
   that has elements such as channel, image, item tags with title,
   description etc inside them into coherent RSS 1.0 RDF triples.
   (Requires libxml 2.5.0 or newer)

 * API: Added new methods raptor_get_name, raptor_get_label.
   Added new methods to control generation of IDs.
   Modified utility function raptor_xml_escape_string arguments.

 * Ripped out ISO 3166 country code parts since commercial use might
   be subject to a license fee.

 * Improvements to GNOME GTK example 'grapper'.

 * Several internal reorganisations for pulling out a SAX2 API, XML C14N.

 * Other minor bug fixes.

The release consists of the full sources, RPM binaries and source RPM
packages for RedHat Linux 9.  These are also available from the
Redland SourceForge mirror site at
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/librdf/

The main web site lets you browse and check out the latest version of
the sources in CVS and use Raptor in various demos (as part of Redland).

I post updates about Redland and Raptor to the redland-dev list
which is one of the lists you can join from the list page at
  http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/lists/
