My goal was to organise this and help run it as part of the outreach
that the SWAD Europe project which I work for deals with.  Since I
am involved with the guts of semweb data storage, and (co-)written
the reports you mention later, that was the outline of my idea.  Deal
with key implementors in europe (but others are very welcome) on
practical issues and solutions, problems with storing and manipulating
semweb data.

Thanks for the offer

I was hoping that it might be possible to get ensure some of the nearby
people at the Amsterdam universities such as Frank van Harmelin,
Guus Schrieber, co-chair of the web ontology group interested.

I wasn't proposing peer-reviewed workshop papers but position papers
are probably in-order.

I've had a few private mails with interest from several groups.

See below

I think over two days, maybe 10pm day1 to 4pm day2

Aiming for Oct or later, taking care not to clash with ISWC in Florida
20-24 Oct.  There also might be clashes in September.

Possibly (but more focussed on ontologies, higher level applications??)
  Frank van Harmelen, On-To-Knowledge
  http://www.cs.vu.nl/~frankh/

  Guus Schreiber, co-chair of webont, IBROW, Ontoweb
  http://www.cs.vu.nl/~guus/ 

Now both of them are at vu.nl

aim for 20

Our SWAD Europe project, via myself, would be happy to organise the
admin parts of registration, papers, web site, etc. but would need local
help with logistics such as accommodation, rooms, web access, food etc.

I enclose below an updated version of what II proposed originally to the
public-esw@w3.org list which is the public list that SWAD Europe works
on.  Feel free to join that last, in fact I'd like to move the workshop
discussion there if possible, or at least CC: it.

==============================
Proposal

Title: SWAD Europe Workshop on Semantic Web Storage and APIs

Date: TBD - suggest October - December 2003
  (avoiding ISWC 20-24 Oct)

   Propose a two day event 10am day 1 to 4pm day 2.

Scale: 20 participants

Location: TBD - Amsterdam or nearby suggested

Current Identified Stakeholders (NOT an exclusive list):

  In Europe:
    AKTORS 3store - University of Southampton, UK
    Jena - HP Labs, Bristol, UK
    KAON - FZI / AIFB, Karlsruhe, Germany
    RDFSuite Group - @semantics, Greece, Netherlands, Italy
    Sesame - Aidministrator, Netherlands
    Redland - Dave Beckett (myself), Bristol, UK

    and ... other groups related to the above ?
      On-To-Knowledge - Frank van Harmelen, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam
        project includes University of Karlsruhe - KAON, Aidministrator above
      IBROW / OntoWeb / WebOnt co-chair - Guus Schreiber
      Ontoweb projects
      FOAF implementors
      W3C/ERCIM ... 

  Elsewhere, the Europe in the title not withstanding.
    4Suite - Buffalo, USA
    Mindswap - Maryland, USA
    Mozilla - ?, USA
    TAP project - Stanford, USA
    HP USA - DSpace, SIMILE etc - USA
    n3, cwm, ... - MIT/W3C, USA
    rdflib - Daniel Krech, USA


Workshop outline

Existing APIs for the RDF family of technologies (RDF, DAML+OIL, OWL ...)
are maturing after several years of development and improvement.

There is no single dominant API either across multiple languages (ok,
Redland has some of that) or in a single implementation language.
Each of them covers a different goal and has different strengths.

This workshop would aim to bring together existing and new developers
of semantic web storage and APIs to share their experiences and
lessons.  In particular this workshop could cover

  * Implementation techniques
  * Storage models and database schemas
  * Scalability, aggregation and provenance
  * Lessons from using RDBMSes for semantic web storage
  * Test data and queries for performance comparisons across designs.
  * Implementing RDF Datatypes

Possibly covering (might be a bit too off-storage):
  * APIs for query languages
  * OWL and logic layer functionality - inference engines, validation

Expected Outcomes

  * State of the current APIs
  * Indication of state of potential API standardisation
  * Implementation techniques
  * Updated SWAD-E deliverables 10.1, 10.2
  * Proposals for a performance comparision test suite
  * Some Implementation reports on RDF and OWL

Relevant SWAD-E Work

This relates to at least the following SWAD-E work and completed
deliverables (as well as later work).

Other Events

At ISWC 2003 there is a workshop on
  Practical and Scalable Semantic Systems
  http://km.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/ws/psss03
 
  (site down right now)

so need to take care with not duplicating work.
(Also the event is not in Europe, so tricky for EU pariticpants)
