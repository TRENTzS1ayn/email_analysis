my 2'penn'oth

I think that this comes near the nub of the question around
interoperability using RDF and its relationship to XML Schema.

Many organisations are spending a lot of time taking 
the opposite approach to Charles by carefully crafting XML Schemas
for their own use (e.g. see the UK e-Gif Schema repository
http://www.govtalk.gov.uk/schemasstandards/schemasstandards.asp),
reusing components of other schemas and then wanting to use them
for interchange.  Combination of elements from different 
schemas is then controlled via namespace - and as they are keen on 
syntactic validation only in pretty restricted circumstances 
(avoiding "the unpredictable tag soup").  From this PoV, the 
free mixing of vocabulary advocated by Charles and Dan looks 
pretty anarchic and uncontrollable.  

There is a challenge to RDF here to convince them:
 - its more than just the namespace (Trent's question)
 - it can help enable the interoperability required of the XML Schemas
   when they get into difficulties through conflicting XML representations
   of the same thing.  But they will still want the structural
   framework of XML Schema (or similar).

SWAD WP5/6 is looking at this.
