RDF IG,

Forwarding (see attached) Carine's draft to the W3C Web Services public 
discussion list of a 'Semantic Web Interest Group' charter.  I'm copying the 
SWAD-Europe list too since we're looking into doing further work in this 
area. The original thread (useful for tracking followups) is archived
at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws/2003Mar/0028.html
I sent my notes on this proposal last week, see 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws/2003Mar/0018.html
(drop/keep CC: list in followups according to taste...)

I'd be interested to hear views from RDF Interest Group members on this 
proposal. It connects also to our own need to start thinking about the 
future of the RDF IG over the coming years, and about priorities for future 
work within W3C. Do people here see "SW Services" as the next big thing?
As a blue skies research area? As ripe for standardisation? If there were 
an Interest Group, or Working Group, or 'taskforce' or mailing list 
devoted to this topic, would you be interested in participation? I'm more 
interested to learn about people's interest levels than go into detail of
W3C process decisions (WG vs IG vs mailing list) at this stage. In 
general, is this an area that RDF / Semantic Web developers feel would benefit
from some special attention and support? Do you have running code and 
burning questions? Test cases and usage scenarios to share? Services up and 
running already? Ideas about business models and their interaction with 
technology/standardisation issues?

Do let us know what you think! Carine initially solicited feedback via 
www-ws@w3.org so you could send mail there too, I'll certainly send a 
pointer to that list of any discussions here.

cheers, 

Dan

(RDF Interest Group chair)


attached mail follows:


After Hugo's report on the BOF during the technical plenary meeting[1]
I made the draft charter of a "Semantic Web Services Interest Group"
publicly available at:

http://www.w3.org/2003/03/swsig-charter.html

Please review this DRAFT, express your comments & thoughts here
on the www-ws@w3.org list!

(sample questions:
Is this a good idea to create an IG? Is the scope well-defined? Would you
prefer a WS-IG rather than a SWS-IG? Would you participate in such an
IG? What would you expect from it?...)

Thanks.
