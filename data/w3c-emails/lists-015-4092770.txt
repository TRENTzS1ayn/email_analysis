We are actively involved in developing and deploying within a major
consumer packaged goods company 'semantic web services' in which we are
using DAML and WSDL-based services to allow businesses to communicate
cross-enterprise.  We are very interested in a SW Services interest
group and aligning with others in promoting standardization.
