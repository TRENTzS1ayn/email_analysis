IMO, semantic web services are critical in areas like Web service 
discovery and orchestration.  Additionally, I believe web services in 
general are a catalyst to other semantic web activities as they increase
organizational awareness of open, layered metadata and the potential for 
semantic interoperability (as opposed to syntactic interoperability).  It is 
that 
potential that makes the next step from web services to semantic web 
services both obvious and desirable.  

So, in essence, Semantic Web services may well be the watershed event 
to the larger vision of the semantic web.

I would definitely be interested in participation.
