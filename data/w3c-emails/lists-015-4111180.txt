Hi all

We would like to have some SWAD-E publicity materials ready for
WWW2003 (late May) and if possible XMLEurope (early May).

Given the short time span, I propose something simple such as a
postcard. We have used these effectively for publicity at the ILRT, and
they would  be relatively quick to produce. In addition they would point
straight back to the webste, where we can explain in more detail the
content of the project and the Semantic web.

Here's an example postcard from 234car, which came from the publicity
firm that we use at ILRT:

http://www.234car.com/Bristol_postcard_v2.pdf

on the reverse there is a short piece of text, perhaps as long in total
as the WAI Quick Tips

http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/tips.gif
http://www.w3.org/WAI/References/QuickTips/

If we decided to go this route we would need to think of a picture and
some text. The 234car picture is auto generated and shows starting
points for car sharing. Something along those lines would be nice I
think.

What does everyone think? is it a good idea? any ideas for pictures,
text?

cheers

Libby
