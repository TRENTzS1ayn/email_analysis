To resurrect an old thread...

We've started looking at ontologies for 'semantic links'. We had a look at
IBIS, Annotea threads and Claimaker.
Our requirement is to be able to link bibliographic blogs - primarily using
'agreesWith', 'disagreesWith'.

Our take on this was that Claimaker dealt primarily with concepts (not the
papers themselves). IBIS appears to me to take a similar line, making useful
simplifications to the Claimaker model. These approaches are both good for
'argumentation networks'.

For dealing with the items themselves (which is what we want to do), Annotea
threads offer quite a useful schema. Not a perfect fit to our domain, since
we are not dealing with threaded discussions, and we might want to extend
the schema to different semantic relationships. But certainly good enough to
start with. So we are looking to make threads a pluggable version of our
semantic ontology. 

The reason for this rambling mail is to ask whether Danny, Charles or anyone
else on the list is aware of, or would recommend, any other ontologies for
encoding such semantic links.

Cheers

Steve

Hi Danny,

the vocabulary stuff you are looking at sounds like it is extending
the thread vocabulary produced for Annotea (or for that matter the original
Annotea vocabulary of annotation types) to allow for discussion threads
to be tracked. This seems to me like a good idea.

http://www.w3.org/2001/03/thread

The ability to provide user-friendly interfaces for this (such as the
icon-selection that Amaya has for marking different types of annotation -
see
the help file at
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/attaching_annotations/configuring_icons) is a
promising paralell for the use of graphic RDF editors (IdeaGraph, IsaViz,
RDFAuthor, etc)

cheers
