[snip]

Just a brief note to let folks know that I've made an attempt 
at writing up this use case in the ESW Wiki,
http://esw.w3.org/topic/OpeningHoursUseCase

For now I've stuck with the example from this email thread,
but my intention is to extend/augment it with real data 
describing real local businesses (from Bristol initially),
and include photographs, contact details, geographic markup etc.

If folks have additional examples, do feel free to edit the Wiki
entry(*).

The page currently has two examples, the first is the 
un-edited raw ical for the repeating event, the other attempts 
to mix in additional data. I have taken (for now) the approach of
inventing a new property (foaf:openingHours) that relates a
resource (some kind of unmodelled business entity) to a 
specification of its opening hours. Not sure if this works well, 
yet. It would be nice to have some bulk data to play with... does 
anybody here have suggestions on that front? SKICal folks maybe?

Thanks for any suggestions, additions...

Dan
