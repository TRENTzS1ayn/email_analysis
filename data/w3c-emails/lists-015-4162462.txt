Hi,

I was wondering if there had been any developments on this as the DotGNU
project appears to be navigating directly into these waters. From the latest
post on their list:

[[[
> I suppose DGEE [DotGNU Execution Environment] makes use of service
discovery?

It will do.  Right now it's just the execution container - ie the place
where
webservices are actually found - with discovery ability coming as and when
ready (ie when there is something to discover :o)

> Does it use RDF?

Internally no.  Externally, almost.
The DGEE will export information about its webservices in XML, RDF and other
formats - I just need an RDF fragment suitable for representing DGEE
webservice info and we're off!

(btw, I've suggested DAML-S as a possibility - anything else?)

Cheers,
Danny.
