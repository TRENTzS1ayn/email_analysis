Is anyone aware of any groups tracking commercial take up of semantic web
technology?

Some of the applications we included in our applications survey report were
commercial but I sure there are lots more that weren't covered in that.

In particular, I was intrigued to notice this quote in an Interweek article on
the Semantic Web:

   "But W3C spokeswoman Janet Daly said RDF technologies are in use today 
    by AOL Time Warner Inc., Hearst Corp. and LexisNexis. "

Anyone know what any of these people are using RDF for?
