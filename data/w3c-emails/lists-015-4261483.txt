hi all

I'm struggling a bit with the text for the SWAD-E postcard

We need to explain the map on the front of the card a bit...
Here's what I've come up with so far with everyone's help (thanks
Dan, Dave, Stephen :)

[[
Building a practical Semantic Web 1.0 (maybe on the front?)

* how can I get involved in the Semantic Web?
* which standards should I use?
* where are other Semantic Web developers located?

SWAD-Europe is an EC funded project aiming to ensure that the critical
technology components required for widespread Semantic Web adoption are
readily accessible to European industry, consumers, and developers.

SWAD-Europe uses Open Source tool development, community building,
outreach and evangelism, and advanced research and analysis to
support and field-test Semantic Web standards.

Our current activities include
  - bridging the gap between semantic web technology and the XML tool stack
  - reviewing and developing tools for accessing, storing and search semantic
web data
  - developing case studies and demonstration applications in areas ranging from
thesaurus management to semantic blogging
  - holding developer workshops on topics ranging from image annotation
to calendaring.

For more details on the full range of our activities visit
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/ or join us on the public-esw@w3.org mail
list, the ESW Wiki, or on IRC (irc.freenode.net #rdfig)

thanks

Libby
