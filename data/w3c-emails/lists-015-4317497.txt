With respect to you specific question, these companies are using PRISM
[1][2] to facilitate the exchange of  publishers content.

With respect to your more general question on tracking commercial uptake
of semantic web technolgies, I am (as best as possible). However some
RDF based tools for facilitating this 'cataloging' process and allowing
for this to be more of a collaborative effort would be extremely helpful
(wink wink nudge nudge :).
