Libby -
Looks pretty good.  Some assorted minor quibblage:

* (probably) most people in the EC will know what "EC" stands for, but
others quite likely won't

* "Where are other SW developers located?" - might want an "in Europe" in
there somewhere, to acknowledge that there are Other Places in the world (qv
the map discussion)  

* is open source really Open Source? :-).  Similarly, you use both Semantic
Web and semantic web - would be better to be consistent.  I don't have a
strong preference.

* "bridging the gap between semantic web technology and the XML tool stack "
my suggestion: "bridging the gaps between semantic web tools and XML tools"
or even "applying standard XML tools to semantic web problems"

* "... storing and search semantic web data" -> s/search/searching/

* "case studies and demonstration applications" -> add comma after
applications

* "holding developer workshops " -> delete 'holding' ... a workshop is an
activity, I assert :-)

* I'd reorder the second major sentence to emphasise the outcome rather than
the process, something like:

Our goal is to refine and field-test Semantic Web standards, through open
source tool development, community building, outreach and evangelism, and
advanced R&D.

Hope this is not too late.

Cheers,
Ian
