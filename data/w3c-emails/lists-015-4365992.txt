Looks good! 

Main immediate comment: Can you get him to add back in the http:// prefix?
SemWeb is pretty URI centric, so encouraging a non-URI way of writing Web 
addresses is probably a mistake.
"www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/" -> "http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/"

belated thought occurs:
Hmm I hope all those colourful geo-political boundaries are still timely;
my geographic knowledge is so sketchy I couldn't easily check. Which bits are
former Yugoslavia? Czech/(o)Slovakia? etc...
