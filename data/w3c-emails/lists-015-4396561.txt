There is something near Turkey that I don't recognise (I thought it was part
of Turkey, but it seems green when the rest of Turkey is yellow). Other than
that everything seems to be there - Czech Republic is seperated from
Slovakia, the various countries that used to make up Yugoslavia are more or
less there (I don't know the current status of the Yugoslav federation which
last I heard included Serbia and Montenegro), Monaco is squashed by the
button for Nice, but that's OK, etc...

Looks good. Is there room for a stamp and an address, and a couple of lines
("Hi Mum, semantic Web is great - I'm the button with an X drawn on it, miss
you" sort of thing)?

cheers
