Here's the message I sent to Kelvin. Subject to those changes, I think
we can go ahead.
Thanks all for your helpful comments, espacially the geographical ones
:)

hi Kelvin

Thanks for the postcard image - the consenus is that it looks great,
with just a couple of niggles

* could we have http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/ rather than
www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/ as the url on the front?

* apparantly there's a green bit near turkey which should be part of
Turkey (which is yellow) - is there any chance you could fix this for
us?

* one person asked

"Is there room for a stamp and an address, and a couple of
lines ("Hi Mum, semantic Web is great - I'm the button with an X drawn
on it, miss you" sort of thing)?"


I like this idea, but if you think it would squish the text up too much,
we can drop it...

You can see all the emails here:

- and associated thread.

thanks very much for doing this so quickly - we all like the way it
looks :)

Let me know if you need anything else.

cheers

Libby
