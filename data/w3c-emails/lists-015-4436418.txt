Looking very nice indeed.

I wonder if some geo-specific material might be needed on the site before
these get distributed - if a person gets a card, sees there's a spot on
Madrid and wants to find out what's going on SW-wise specifically in Madrid,
they'll point their browser at http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/  and
then..?

Cheers,
Danny.

who appears to have dropped off the map :-(
