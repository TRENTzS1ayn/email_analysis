WP7

* work on RDF query interoperability and testcases; rewriting big chunks
of the Inkling code

I should be able to get a release out this week.

From an RDF query testcases irc meeting, I implemented this:

ACTION libby convert squish and RDQL jena tests to ntriples and
circulate by date of next meet

- and I have a small test framework that can test using Ntriples
versions of Andy Seaborne and Alberto Reggiori's RDQL tests as well as
my Inkling tests. This is limited to conjunctive only queries, and not
all get the same answer ... yet. But there's definitely some measure of
interoperability.

The tests are here:

http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/rdfquery/tests/

WP3

* postcard, supporting documentation, data

see
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-esw/2003May/0032.html

for pointers to various technical things about it

http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/discovery/2003/04/svggeo/imgs/SWADpostcardv3.pdf

is the final version (for now).


* chairing 2 irc calendar meetings, two irc query testcase meetings and
contributing to Dan's geo meetings

calendar

http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/2003/04/23/2003-04-23.html
http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/2003/04/09/2003-04-09.html

These meetings focused on calendar/geo overlap (describing a journey,
opening hours of a thing that has a place),
usecases for cal/geo data:

and also EventDiscovery, sources of calendar data
http://esw.w3.org/topic/EventDiscovery

query

http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/2003/04/24/2003-04-24.html
http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/2003/04/10/2003-04-10.html

These had two main aspects - implementing and testing very simple query
formats (ntriples-based) using manifest and resultset formats; and
better RDF query languages  - optionals, provenance and transformation
into RDF queries.

We had a topic maps and RDf query languages BOF at XMLEurope
http://esw.w3.org/topic/TMQLBOF

and there is an upcoming BOF at WWW2003:
http://esw.w3.org/topic/RdfQueryTestingBudapestMeeting


geo meetings

http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/2003/04/30/2003-04-30.html
http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/2003/04/16/2003-04-16.html

These has the following agenda items:

opening hours of a thing that has a place
describing a journey
update on DAML spatial work
DanC update on travel tool writeup
Relationship to GML (chat w/ Simon Cox)
heads up from zool re noderunner and nocat developments
Bus and train route visualization

There's a lot of interest in this area, and a new mailing list:
http://lists.burri.to/mailman/listinfo/geowanking


I also went to XMLEurope - report to follow.

cheers,

Libby
