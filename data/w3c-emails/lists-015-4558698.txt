recently,

wp2/3:

 -lots of IRC meetings in RDF Interest Group irc (calendar, query, geo)

 -discussions w/ various folks about future of the RDF IG as a broader 
  Semantic Web IG. Begun charter drafting at 
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/interest/charter.html 

 - met up w/ libby and caroline m at ilrt re geo/map project and trying 
  to find caroline m some non-geek intro materials on SW. There isn't much.

wp4 (web services):
 - looking at wsdl/rdf mapping issues with eric p (w3c/mit), talking to 
  Bijan Parsia (Mindlab) re his presentation tommorrow to the WS description 
  working group on the use of rdf and owl for ws description. Hope some 
  useful future work items come out of that.

wp5 (re schema anno):
 - contrasting ericp's RelaxNG schema anno work with the previous 
   tools from Henry Thompson that I was working with. Trying to get 
   clarification re opensource licensing of the edinburg work.

wp7: some progress on hooking up the RDF Query testcases to my RDF 
  query system. Stumped at moment as I don't have a parser for 
  parseType="Collection" bundled.


Also somewhat glacially catching up on variosu other things. 
+ prep for ww2003 (rdf query bof; also i need to present a few slides 
on swad-europe during w3c track).

Dan
