As discussed our last telcon, here's more on the potential workshop
that I suggested is organised and run.

OK, I ran out of typing energy, comment away.

Workshop outline

Existing APIs for the RDF family of technologies (RDF, DAML+OIL, OWL ...)
are maturing after several years of development and improvement.

There is no single dominant API either across multiple languages (ok,
Redland has some of that) or in a single implementation language.
Each of them covers a different goal and has different strengths.

This workshop would aim to bring together existing and new developers
of semantic web storage and APIs to share their experiences and
lessons.  In particular this workshop could cover

  * Implementation techniques
  * Storage models and database schemas
  * Scalability, aggregation and provenance
  * Lessons from using RDBMSes for semantic web storage
  * OWL and logic layer functionality - inference engines, validation
  * Implementing RDF Datatypes
  * APIs for query languages
  * Network APIs for semantic web services - SOAP, REST, P2P, ...
  * Web Service APIs - i.e. web service description such as WSDL


Expected Outcomes

  * State of the current APIs
  * Indication of state of potential API standardisation
  * Implementation techniques
  * Updated SWAD-E deliverables 10.1, 10.2
