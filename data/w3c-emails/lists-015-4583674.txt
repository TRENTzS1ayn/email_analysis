I think is a great suggestion.

These topics are good and focus on the storage issues. I'd like to add:
  * Test data and queries for performance comparisons across designs.

The later topics are in danger of making the workshop too broad and I'd suggest
dropping them. The first few:

>   * APIs for query languages
>   * OWL and logic layer functionality - inference engines, validation

might be OK but the last couple:

>   * Network APIs for semantic web services - SOAP, REST, P2P, ...
>   * Web Service APIs - i.e. web service description such as WSDL

feel like they diffuse the topic to much.

How about adding:
   * Proposals for a performance comparision test suite
?
