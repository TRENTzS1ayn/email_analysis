I just announced the workshop details; there are 22 expected people, 3 flying in
from the USA and a good selection of people, which I'm pretty pleased about.

So you've got a week to have a look at the position papers and think
about the issues before I have the pleasure of meeting you all in
Amsterdam.

If you have any questions or problems let me know, otherwise
I'll see you next Thursday.

Cheers

Dave
