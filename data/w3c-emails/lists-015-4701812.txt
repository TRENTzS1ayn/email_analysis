Agreed.

Would need a lot of owl:differentFrom assertions in order to actually have 
the cardinality constraints bite but that would be the case anyway.

That was sort of what I was suggesting earlier, except that I'd use 
xml:lang to convey the language and was suggesting a descriptorSchema 
property for descriptors.

The to me this is better modelling but you can't express the relevant 
cardinality constraints in OWL.

That doesn't help with the cardinality. What Alistair wanted was a 
cardinality constraint that means there is only one perferredTerm in each 
language (in each descriptiveSchema). It is the "in each" subclauses that 
is hard to express in OWL without introducing an artificial looking class 
hiearchy.
