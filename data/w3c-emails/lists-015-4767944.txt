You assume right.

Yes, there could be something to prune out here, but I'm not sure which
ones. rdfs has been implemented the most, owl next and datatypes probably
the least so it is a question of whether to talk about what has been done or
what has not been done (yet).

Personally I'd support some on the API/interface side of things such as
query, WS, programmatic APIs.  When you store the stuff, how you get it
in/out is important.

It seems somewhat that removing or reducing the OWL mentions would make
it fit better into the time.  However it would be a shame to have
nothing about that since there are people working on it now/recently for
OWL's CR so getting them together would be useful.  I guess they
are all off to the ontology conference in Florida anyway so maybe
that's not so criticial for this event.

Right.

OK
