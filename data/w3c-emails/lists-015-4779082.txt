After a lot more editing of the page, link and reference chasing, I
think this is ready to announce.  I'll send an announcement something
like the message below to www-rdf-interest and directly to the already
identified stakeholders (some of whom are probably already on this list),
to start this off.

     SWAD-Europe Workshop on Semantic Web Storage and Retrieval
 13-14 November 2003
     Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

     http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/20031113-storage/

This is a small workshop (max 25) that aims to bring together
existing and new developers of semantic web storage and APIs to share
their experiences and lessons learnt - what worked, what didn't work.

The workshop is organised by the EU IST project Semantic Web Advanced
Development (SWAD) Europe project and locally hosted by VU, Amsterdam.
