Subject: Re: Fw: Liverpool Digital and the Semantic Web

Hi Libby

Many thanks for getting back to me. If you could post this on the public
mailing list I'd appreciate it.

I'm identifying business ideas to develop into a commercially sustainable
digital industry product using the Liverpool Digital site as a catalyst. The
overall objective is to turn 7 or 8 ideas into reality, of which the
Semantic Web might be one. The business development process is to provide a
mechanism to attract and secure sufficient and suitable commercial activity
for the Liverpool Digital initiative at terms acceptable to the North West
Development Agency.

I'm excited about the opportunities to use Semantic Web developments in new
machine readable applications to exploit time based or geographic data on
the web. Potential business models for Liverpool Digital are a 'Semantic Web
application development house' or a 'training and development organisation
to encourage companies to develop SW applications'. With either model the
process would be to got out to tender for organisations to run it on a
commercial basis.

The first phase of the business development process is to generate ideas and
then phase gate review them (other competing ideas are being generated by
other groups) - the ones that pass will go onto a feasibility study. I'm up
against a deadline of the 23rd October to get a one page summary for the
phase gate review by the Liverpool Digital board. Essentially - what is the
opportunity, benefits, value add, business model, indicative costs etc.

Regards

Philip
