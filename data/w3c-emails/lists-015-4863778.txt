Subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Raptor RDF Parser Toolkit 1.0.0


   Raptor RDF Parser Toolkit 1.0.0
     http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/raptor/

               Supported by EU IST project SWAD-Europe
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/

Raptor is a free software/Open Source C library that parses RDF
syntaxes such as RDF/XML and N-Triples into RDF triples.  It handles
all RDF vocabularies such as FOAF, RSS 1.0, Dublin Core and OWL.

Raptor is designed to work closely with the Redland RDF library but
is fully separate.  It is a mature, portable and high performance
library that works across many POSIX systems (Unix, GNU/Linux, BSDs,
OSX, cygwin) and others. It has been tested on multiple architectures
(x86, IA64, powerpc, alpha, sparc).  Raptor has no known memory leaks
and is suitable for embedding in long running applications.

This is the start of the 1.0 series of Raptor after nearly three
years of development.  Fixes to this series will be given 1.0.x
versions, changes will be in version 1.1.0.

Summary of changes:

 * Several long-deprecated functions were removed and consequently 
   the library shared version number was increased to 1.
 * Fixed scanning for rdf:RDF so that RDF/XML in other XML works, such as SVG
 * Normalize RDF/XML xml:lang and N-Triples language to lowercase on input
 * Worked around libxml2 bug causing a crash on some error reporting
 * Added raptor_parse_file_stream for parsing a C FILE*
 * Other minor bug fixes.

Raptor was tested as working out-of-the-box (configure; make; make check)
with the following systems:
    i686-pc-linux-gnu        - Redhat GNU/Linux 9
    i686-pc-linux-gnu        - Debian GNU/Linux unstable
    i386-unknown-freebsd4.8  - FreeBSD 4.8
    powerpc-apple-darwin6.6  - Apple OSX 10.2.6
    x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu - SuSE GNU/Linux 8ES on AMD64 Opteron
    sparc-sun-solaris2.8     - Sun Solaris 8

The release consists of the full sources, RPM binaries and source RPM
packages for RedHat Linux 9.  These are also available from the
Redland SourceForge mirror site at
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/librdf/

The main web site lets you browse and check out the latest version of
the sources in CVS and use Raptor in various demos (as part of Redland).

I post updates about Redland and Raptor to the redland-dev list
which is one of the lists you can join from the list page at
  http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/lists/
