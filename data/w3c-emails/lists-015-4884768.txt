Subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Redland RDF Application Framework 0.9.14


       Redland RDF Application Framework 0.9.14
http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/

               Supported by EU IST project SWAD-Europe
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/

Redland is a C library that provides a high-level interface for RDF
allowing the RDF graph to be parsed from XML, stored, queried and
manipulated.  Redland implements each of the RDF concepts in its own
class via an object based API, reflected into the other language APIs
- Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Tcl. Some of the classes
providing the parsers, storage mechanisms and other elements are
built as modules that can be added or removed as required.

Redland 0.9.14 is a minor release to synchronise with the
Raptor 1.0.0 RDF parser library. The main changes are as follows

   * Added a new utility program rdfproc - a general RDF processor
     for Redland that allows command line use of the library.
   * Made the Node class intern every node.
   * Fixed the broken use of Perl UNIVERSAL::isa

See also the detailed 0.9.14 release notes at
http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/RELEASE.html#rel0_9_13

The release consists of the full sources, RPM binaries and SRPMS
packages for RedHat Linux 9.  Experimental Debian debs will be
available shortly.  It is also available from the Redland SourceForge
mirror site at http://sourceforge.net/projects/librdf/

The main web site lets you browse and check out the latest version of
the sources in CVS and use Redland in various demos.

I post updates about Redland and Raptor to the redland-dev list
which is one of the lists you can join from the list page at
  http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/lists/
