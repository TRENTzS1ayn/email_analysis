Hi Alistair

Yes, thanks for this - I read it with interest.
I like the way they describe the issues we discussed at the meeting
(essentially, the way that a variety of semantic relations are confusingly 
modelled as subsumption relations) & this has been good for me in terms of 
developing a "correct" vocabulary with which to talk about these things.

They make a good problem statement for the mapping of existing thesauri 
that carry the legacy of a pre-computer-age approach to the creation of 
thesauri.
And it is interesting to see their suggested approach for the preparation 
of thesauri that are to be mapped to each other (i.e. a particular 
thesaurus' use of subsumption relations, and identifying the qualia under 
which subsumption hierarchies are created etc.)- this gets quite complex & 
probably labour intensive ! But necessary, because they are defining the 
aim of the solution space to be to bridge the gap between the methodology 
used by thesauri creators & technical implementors.

So thanks, & I'll get on to replying to your other email ...

Nikki
