[going to public list, to be linkable]

These comments I made last week I forgot to forward, still apply to the latest draft

  http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/SWAD/thesaurus/tif/deliv81/final.html

Sorry for not forwarding till now.

    Term-Oriented Model

    In a term-oriented model, although it may be tacitly implied that a
    set of terms stands for some abstract concept, the concept is not
    reified in the model. Terms which are preferred terms are used as the
    nodes in the generalisation hierarchy. In this model it is usual to
    distinbuish between the class of objects that are preferred terms and

distinguish^

    the class of objects that are non-preferred terms. This model is
    illustrated in figure [???].

    Summary of the TIF RDF Schema

    Figure 3

Thesaurus class isn't related to anything else?


    Scope-Note (rdf:ID="ScopeNote")

      Defines a comment on a concept, prescribing the bounds of appropriate
      usage of the concept. Sub-classes of this class are used to describe
      specific types of comment. A General-Note refers to [???]. A
      History-Note refers to [???]. A Hierarchy-Note refers to [???]. A
      Translation-Note refers to [???]. An Editor-Note refers to [???].

    Properties

    The domain/range values for the properties of the TIF schema are
    illustrated in figure [???] and also in table 1.

    Figure 4

rather wide figure - 1146x158


has-classification-code (rdf:ID="code")
    Defines a unique [???] identifier for a Concept.

? is this a reference or just being unsure?

is-defined-by (rdf:ID="isDefinedBy")
    Relates a Concept to the Thesaurus it is a part of. [Use
    rdfs:isDefinedBy ???] 

It could be used but rdfs:isDefinedBy remains vague


    Language Identifiers

    The Language class and identifiers for all languages defined by
    ISO639-1 are supplied in a separate file (see Appendix [???]).

Appendix V

    Summary of TIFS RDF Schema

    "...and UF (use-for)...."

never mentioned till now

    Classes

    "...absence or presence of the use property..."

use-for ?

Later I see use/use-for are an inverse pair of properties relating
preferred to/from non-preferred terms

    Deriving TIFS from TIF

what is ^<sup>-1</sup> terminology?  inverse relationship?


    RDF Schema or OWL Ontology


    in appendices [???]. [should the ontology extend descriptions for
    the same resources as the schema, or use different ones???].

appendices II (RDFS) III (TIF OWL), IV (TIFS OWL)

Better say which OWL - OWL DL, OWL Full, OWL Lite


    Example: ELSST, a Multilingual Thesaurus

Refers to March 2002 as a future date - this reads as out of date.


    Conclusions and Future Work

    The TIF is built as an extensible framework of classes and
    properties. In this way it may be extended to express other kinds
    of semantic relationship between concepts or terms. For example,
    we could introduce ACK /AF relations between terms for
    abbreviations and acronyms, such as in the DAML+OIL ontology from
    DRC, ..

reference and citation needed

    ...  or we could express the diagonal relationships
    related-broader-concept and related-narrower-concept, such as in
    the ETB thesaurus schema. ...

ditto

    ...  We could also model categories, as are
    found in many thesaurus, as a sub-class of concepts or terms, and
    the semantically more precise relationships that go with them.


    Appendices

Links to the RDF/S and OWL files would be good.

Which OWL version (date) are these?

There are problems with # and rdf:ID in these docs.

<!ENTITY tif "http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/2003/07/31-tif-owl#" >
xmlns:tif="&tif;"
xml:base="&tif;" 

and later:
    rdf:ID="Thesaurus"

which will give a URI http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/2003/07/31-tif-owl##Thesaurus

Correct:
<!ENTITY tif "http://www.w3c.rl.ac.uk/2003/07/31-tif-owl" >
xmlns:tif="&tif;#"
xml:base="&tif;"
