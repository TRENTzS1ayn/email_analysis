Hi all,

I wanted to consult you all on this matter.  I have agreement from the EEA
to publish the GEMET environmental thesaurus in the SKOS/RDF format.  The
next step is to work out with them the URIs they wish to assign to their
thesaurus and concepts.  I'm not sure what to recommend to them on this
matter.  

I thought to use an http:// based URI base (e.g.
http://www.eionet.eu.int/GEMET) and then add the id number of each concept
(e.g. http://www.eionet.eu.int/GEMET#204).   

A first question is, is it OK to use http: URIs for concepts?  Sorry to drag
this old chestnut up again, but I need some clear answer on best practices
for this.  Are we not at all concerned that the same URI may identify both a
thesaurus concept and a resolveable network resource (i.e. the file
containing the RDF data)?

What do you think of info: based URIs for concepts?

Hope to hear from you on this,

Al.
