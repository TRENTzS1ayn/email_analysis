Dan Brickley's Wordnet vocabulary service[1] at xmlns.com seems like a
useful model. Essentially, each concept is given a (non-fragmentary) URI
which, if dereferenced, returns a description of the concept. Mr
Brickley's system only returns RDF/XML presently, but there's no reason
it couldn't also return HTML or something else via content negotiation.

That works, but my preference would be for something like
<http://eionet.eu.int/GEMET/204>. In practice, using a fragment ID means
that an HTTP request to a term's URI will return nothing or else a
description of the entire vocabulary, which I'm guessing is pretty
large.

It would be confusing for a URI to identify a thesaurus concept and an
RDF file. The key, as I see it, is the idea that the response to an HTTP
Get is a representation of the resource, not the resource itself. The
fact that <http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog> returns an RDF/XML
document, doesn't mean that it identifies that particular document. If,
for some reason, you wanted to talk about that RDF/XML document instead
of the word "Dog", you would need to use a blank node or a different
URI.

Not everyone agrees with this position.

less useful because it can't be dereferenced.
