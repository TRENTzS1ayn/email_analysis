I would prefer to say that the described thing is the abstract concept 
of Dog (Dog-ness ?) because the word "class" can be misinterpreted as 
meaning the OWL class Dog, for example. But I think you understood me 
correctly.

In principal I agree with you that this would be a good way to go, and 
it fits nicely with a RESTful view of the world and I think it fits well 
with the distinction between resource and representation. However, I 
struggle with how to annotate the RDF/XML resource - how do I say that 
the author of this resource was John Smith ? In this case I am not 
interested in finding out more about Dog-ness, but I want to know more 
about this RDF description of Dog-ness - perhaps to establish whether or 
not I trust the source of information.

While writing this, a lightbulb went on and I think I now understand 
something I had missed in your previous posting.  In a prior email on 
this thread, you suggested that a way to refer to a representation could be:

[ a Representation
  ; source <http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog>
  ; date "2004-04-23T01:28:00Z"
  ]

So I suggest that we might extend this model to include the 
content-negotiation parameters and then we can attach representation 
metadata to the blank node.

I need more coffee before I can write out the RDF/XML syntax for this, 
but hopefully you can see what I'm getting at enough to tell me if we 
are on the same page or if I misunderstood.

Cheers,

Kal
