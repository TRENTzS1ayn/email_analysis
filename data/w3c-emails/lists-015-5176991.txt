Hi folks,

more information will be forthcoming in the next couple of days, but there
will be a SWAD-Europe developers' workshop in Madrid (kindly hosted by
Universidad Politecnica de Madrid) on image description on the 7th and 8th of
June.

This workshop will be open to anyone interested in the topic, primarily
targeted at developers who are working on RDF-based systems, or users of such
systems, and aiming to look at the state of the art, in particular whether
and how it has advanced since a similar-themed workshop in Bristol in
mid-2002, and at useful strategies and avenues for further development, or
avenues which it seems should be investigated further.

Please watch this space for an announcement of a proper meeting page, agenda
details, and so on, but feel free to pass on the news (or put the dates in
your own diary).

Cheers

Charles McCathieNevile
