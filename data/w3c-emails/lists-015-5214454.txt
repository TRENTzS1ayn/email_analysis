Personally I like this approach. The recent TAG document endorses a REST
view; so basically you're saying that

http://www.eionet.eu.int/GEMET/[version]

"names" the thesaurus, and

http://www.eionet.eu.int/GEMET/[version]/[conceptID]

"names" the particular concept. That's fine - I ought to be able to ask
(via content negotiation) for a representation of a concept (or a
thesaurus) by an HTTP request for each of those URIs. What advice are
you offering on the stuff that's found at the end of those URIs?

It'd be reasonable to generate (for instance) RDF describing an
individual concept (that perhaps links it to related concepts) but it's
not immediately clear to me what content might live at the "whole
thesaurus" URI. Perhaps the whole thesaurus? Or a document with RDDL
content that points to related web services, etc..?
