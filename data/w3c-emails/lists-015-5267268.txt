Some RDF/RDFS/OWL vocabs end in a / and others end in a # and others do
other things. This is the current state of affairs. The confusion is
only a problem because these different approaches have different
technical and standards characteristics (and those aren't well
explained, currently).

An important but relatively independent problem, I think.

I've a few years experience using the http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Cat
etc approach, and have to say it is useful. The ability to return a
useful chunk of information from a larger dataset is something I am
reluctant to give up. Surely in the future we'll have richer (SKOS API,
RDF DAWG etc) interfaces to these datasets, but the current approach can
be implemented with a simple filetree or CGI script, and has proved
reasonably popular.
