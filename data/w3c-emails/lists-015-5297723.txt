With content negotiation, you can do both: requests asking for HTML get
HTML, and requests asking for RDF/XML get RDF/XML. (The rare case where
the request states no preference is probably someone using "curl" or
"wget"; I'm guessing they'd want RDF/XML, but there's no real negative
consequence to choosing either way.)

It's even possible to do content negotiation when serving static files,
thanks to mod_content and equivalents.

I'd have a description of the thesaurus at its base URI (again, in both
HTML and RDF via content negotiation), and put the whole content at a
separate URI if desired.
