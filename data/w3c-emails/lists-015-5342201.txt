I released a new version of Redland on Saturday.  This includes the technology
developed for the demonstrator D12.4.1 that I'm still writing up (nearly done).

Also in the last few days, there's been some interest in taking up using
Redland in the GNOME desktop world as part of their desktop metadata
indexing and search system.  Just at the investigation stage so far.

       Redland RDF Application Framework 0.9.15
http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/

               Supported by EU IST project SWAD-Europe
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/

Redland is a C library that provides a high-level interface for RDF
allowing the RDF graph to be parsed from XML, stored, queried and
manipulated.  Redland implements each of the RDF concepts in its own
class via an object based API, reflected into the other language APIs
- Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Tcl. Some of the classes
providing the parsers, storage mechanisms and other elements are
built as modules that can be added or removed as required.

Redland 0.9.15 is major release and main changes are as follows

  * Update to synchronise with Raptor version 1.2.0 (RDF/XML and
    N-Triples parser) -- gaining the Turtle Terse RDF Triple Language

  * Added new storage backends:
    + MySQL written by Morten Frederiksen
    + AKT Triplestore
    + File and URI-backed in-memory storage

  * Several classes modified to use unsigned char* for
    UTF-8 encoded URIs and Literals

  * Added fixes to make Redland compile cleanly under C++ (tested with g++).

  * Added assertion checks and reporting for function arguments.

  * Added a method for finding statements in a context.

  * Added a method for listing the contexts in a graph.

  * Many improvements to the rdfproc RDF processor utility.

  * Many other minor changes and fixes.
