hi all,

I've compiled slightly edited, often shortened versions of January's
weblog posts to create the SWAD-E newsletter for January:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-esw-news/2004JanMar/0000.html

Please let me know about any formatting or other issues. In future it
might be good for people to write a fairly self-contained paragraph at
the beginning of weblog posts for this purpose, although I think this
one reads ok.

Many thanks for all the contributions.

Libby
