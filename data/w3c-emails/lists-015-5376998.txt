hi everyone,

The next SWAD-E newsletter will go out at the end of February (probably
27th as I'm away the first week of March), so this is a reminder to
put some news and FAQ items up there by then. Thanks Al for putting
an news item up there already :)
I'd think it would be good to aim for at least one news item and one FAQ
answer per partner if possible.

The weblog is here:
http://esw.w3.org/mt/esw/

and the editing interface is here:
http://esw.w3.org/mtcgi/mt.cgi

I can let you have a username and password if you don't already have
one.

Many thanks,

Libby
