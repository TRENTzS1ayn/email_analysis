Oh, that was an oversight. The process is more about using visualisation to
work with RDF data, and the assumption (which turned out to be correct, and
as you point out should have been explicit) was that visualisation methods
that didn't rely on understanding a serialisation designedd for computers
would help users.

I'll edit it and fix the link (should be zones not zone). You need Adobe SVG
viewer running, and you probably now need to leave the thing sitting around
for a day or so to get the data :( But you can look at the source code :-)

Cheers
