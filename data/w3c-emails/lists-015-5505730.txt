------- Forwarded Message

I'd like to announce an updated version of the little language I've
been developing for a while:

  Turtle - Terse RDF Triple Language
  http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/2004/01/turtle/

  (previously called N-Triples Plus)

The language is based on the N-Triples[1] RDF test case language with
the addition of several (now 9) items taken from Notation3[2] that I found the
most useful and most used.  The last one I've just added was the (...)
syntax for RDF collections which is a handy short form.

It's defined in an EBNF and I give a few examples, although many N3
ones are also valid if you stick to this subset (mostly subset, see
the QNames section).

The document also links to a pre-print paper that describes the
ideas behind the development.

Turtle is also implemented as a language in it's own right in my
RDF parser Raptor http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/raptor/
with the latest addition in the CVS version only; will be in
the 1.2.0 version.

Let me know what you think.

Cheers

Dave
