hi all,

In a previous message[1] I outlined the sort of information we need for
the new newsletter, essentially an FAQ answer from each partner and
some short pieces of information about what's been happening in the
project via the SWAD-E weblog[2] or from elsewhere (e.g. for Steve
from his Semantic Blog[3]).

Thanks to those who have already added information to the weblog.
Information about how to do so is here[4].

FAQs:
I've sent individual emails with suggestions, but please answer anything
that you think is relevant and interesting. FAQ ideas can be found on
the wiki FAQ ideas page[5] (see also the links from there), as well as
mailing lists.

Project news:
The aim of using the (or a) weblog is to disseminate widely within the
blogging community, as well as to provide information for the
newsletter. Please add something if you can.

For FAQ answers and blog posts or other news, I need the information by
the end of Monday (26th Jan) so that I can pull together the newsletter
by the end of January.

Many thanks,

Libby
