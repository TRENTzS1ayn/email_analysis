Hi folks,

for those who find the subject line cryptic, CPH is the airport code for
Copenhagen.

That is where the Danish National Library Authority is hosting a SWAD-E and
CEN/ISSS MMI-DC joint workshop, on the topic of metadata for a multilingual
world. It will take place on July 15/16 and registration is free, but please
register before 1 July. You are also expected to provide some brief notes
about your work and interest in the area - preferably with links so other
people can do some homework before the workshop if they would like to.

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/200407-cph/ is the workshop
information page, which lists the approximate goals as:

Bring together developers working on the use of metadata and the semantic web
 in multilingual contexts
Examine a number of questions with regards to using metadata for multilingual
 content, including
  Translation, versioning and approval processes for multilingual vocabularies
  Multilingual metadata description and encoding
  Multilingual and multicultural interoperability of metadata
  Reuse of RDF vocabularies in the global community
  Interoperability of metadata in global community
Provide a brief survey of available tools, development projects, and areas
 where further development would be useful

hope to see some of you there

best regards

Charles McCN
