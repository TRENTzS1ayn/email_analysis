Subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Raptor RDF Parser Toolkit 1.3.1



   Raptor RDF Parser Toolkit 1.3.1
     http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/raptor/

               Supported by EU IST project SWAD-Europe
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/

Raptor is a free software/Open Source C library that parses RDF
syntaxes such as RDF/XML, N-Triples and Turtle into RDF triples.  It
handles all RDF vocabularies such as FOAF, RSS 1.0, Dublin Core and OWL.

Raptor is designed to work closely with the Redland RDF library but
is fully separate.  It is a mature, portable and high performance
library that works across many POSIX systems (Unix, GNU/Linux, BSDs,
OSX, cygwin) and others.  It has been tested on multiple architectures
(x86, IA64, powerpc, alpha, sparc).  Raptor has no known memory leaks
and is suitable for embedding in long running applications.

This version is a minor update mostly for portability bulding on win32
along with some other fixes.

Summary of main changes:

 * Correct raptor_print_statement declaration argument statement to
   have one less 'const', to match the code.
 * raptor.h now includes stdarg.h
 * Updates to Turtle[1] parser to only allow language with non-datatyped
   literals; allow a '_' immediately after a ':' in qnames and make
   bare ':' work. 
 * Added a warning for unknown rdf:parseType values, when parsing in
   lax mode. This is controlled by a new parser feature
   warn_other_parsetypes 
 * The Turtle parser was fixed to re-initialise correctly when
   performing multiple parsings
 * Fixes to the file: URI support for %-escaping and for Win32 filenames

for more information

Raptor 1.3.1 was tested as working out-of-the-box (configure; make;
make check) with the following systems:
    i386-pc-solaris2.9          - Sun Solaris on x86
    i386-unknown-freebsd4.10    - FreeBSD 4.10-PRERELEASE on x86
    i686-pc-linux-gnu           - Debian GNU/Linux unstable on x86
    i686-pc-linux-gnu           - Redhat GNU/Linux Fedora Core 2 on x86
    powerpc-apple-darwin6.8     - Apple OSX 10.2.8 on PowerPC
    powerpc-apple-darwin7.2.0   - Apple OSX 10.3.2 on PowerPC
    x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu    - Debian GNU/Linux unstable on AMD64 x86

The release consists of the full sources, RPM binaries and source RPM
packages for RedHat Linux Fedora Core 2.
These are also available from the Redland SourceForge mirror site at
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/librdf/
Debian packages will be made available shortly and are provided
in the standard Debian unstable archive.

The main web site lets you browse and check out the latest version of
the sources in CVS and use Raptor in various demos (as part of Redland).

I post updates about Redland and Raptor to the redland-dev list
which is one of the lists you can join from the list page at
