Announced today.  This is an extra deliverable under WP3.  I don't
think it has a SWADE deliverable number yet.

Subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Rasqal RDF Query Library 0.9.1



   Rasqal RDF Query Library 0.9.1
     http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/rasqal/

               Supported by EU IST project SWAD-Europe
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/

Rasqal is a free software/Open Source C library that handles RDF
query syntaxes, query construction and query execution returning
result bindings.  It currently handles RDF Data Query Language
(RDQL).  Rasqal was designed to work closely with the Redland[1] RDF
library and Raptor[2] RDF parsing library but is entirely separate.

This is the second release of Rasqal and is beta quality: working but
the API may be modified or extended.  Rasqal is a portable library
and has been tested on multiple POSIX systems and a variety
architectures (x86, IA64, powerpc, alpha, sparc).  It has no known
memory leaks and is suitable for embedding in long running
applications.

The only main change in this release is to alter the query results API,
which is now separated from the main query class. Detailed changes
are given in the 0.9.1 release notes at
http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/rasqal/RELEASE.html#rel0_9_1

Raptor 0.9.1 requires Raptor 1.3.1[2] to provide parsing support and
also can use either Raptor or Redland[1] to provide a source of
triples.  The final requirement is a POSIX regular expression library
such as PCRE or one built into the C library.  It was tested as
working out-of-the-box (configure; make; make check) against an
installed Raptor 1.3.1 with the following systems:

    alphaev67-unknown-linux-gnu - Debian GNU/Linux on Alpha
    i386-pc-solaris2.9          - Sun Solaris 5.9 on x86(*)
    i386-unknown-freebsd4.10    - FreeBSD 4.10-PRERELEASE on x86
    i686-pc-linux-gnu           - Debian GNU/Linux unstable on x86
    i686-pc-linux-gnu           - Redhat GNU/Linux Fedora Core 2 on x86
    i686-pc-linux-gnu           - Redhat GNU/Linux Redhat 8 on x86
    powerpc-apple-darwin5.5     - Apple OSX 10.2.X on PowerPC(*)(+)
    powerpc-apple-darwin7.3.0   - Apple OSX 10.3.3 on PowerPC(+)
    sparc-sun-solaris2.9        - Sun Solaris 9 on Sparc(*)
    x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu    - Debian GNU/Linux on AMD x86

    (*) Failed tests requiring PCRE/POSIX regex libraries which were
        not available 
    (+) Using Fink from http://fink.sourceforge.net/

The release consists of the full sources, RPM binaries and source RPM
packages for RedHat GNU/Linux Fedora Core 2.
These are also available from the Redland SourceForge mirror site at
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/librdf/
Debian packages should be made available shortly.

The main web site lets you browse and check out the latest version of
the sources in CVS.

I post updates about Rasqal, Redland and Raptor to the redland-dev list
which is one of the lists you can join from the list page at
