> SKOS stands for Simple Knowledge Organisation System.  The Goal of
> SKOS-Core is to provide a framework for bringing existing knowledge
> organisation systems such as thesauri and the semantic web together.  
> 
> SKOS-Core exploits the features of RDFS and OWL to provide a flexible and
> extensible framework within which different types of KOS can interoperate.
> SKOS-Core is ideal for modelling thesauri, and can cope with the
> variations commonly found in thesaurus design and structure.
