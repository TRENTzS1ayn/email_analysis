Server-side negotiation can be very effective in combination with the
Accept headers.

For example:

    GET /foaf/0.1/ HTTP/1.1
    Host: xmlns.com
    Accept: text/html

returns a description of FOAF in HTML, while

    GET /foaf/0.1/ HTTP/1.1
    Host: xmlns.com
    Accept: application/rdf+xml

returns a schema in RDF/XML.
