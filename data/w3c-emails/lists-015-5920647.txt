One of the points is the if.  If everybody followed all applicable standards
all the time many of us would be out of jobs. As you note below, there are
many real-world examples where people don't follow 2788, and some of these
arise in use cases such as the first attempt at merging two thesauri, or in
producing linguistic thesauri (like Roget's), or from time to time in
collaborative and dynamic development of a thesaurus.

My actual poinnt was that it would be interesting to have a note explaining
why a particular term was not preferred. This can be done with rdfs:commment
- for example, where developing a glossary for use in W3C specifications it
would be helpful to note for other developers that I avoided the term
"relative unit" as the preferred term for a concept because it was used by
someone else to describe a different concept. Nonetheless, the term is often
used to describe the concept I mean, and for a while it was a preferred term
(before it had to be used in a larger community, where the clash became
apparent). So it is helpful if people can search via the term and find both
concepts.
