This calls for engineering guidelines, which probably means the issue 
should be shunted onto the SWBPD WG.

Yes, this approach is immediately useful. I suspect it would be sensible 
for any future interfaces to retain the http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Cat 
kind of behaviour. This is akin to getting the concise bounded 
description of the resource, which as an RDF representation over http in 
RDF/XML seems to make a lot of sense. Similarly, for the root "service" 
URI it would probably be consistent, and make pragmatic sense for the 
default RDF representation returned to be a concise description of the 
service rather than the whole caboodle. Having a recommended means of 
retrieving the whole dataset may well be useful, but I'm not sure how 
this could be done without conflicting with general architectural 
requirements. All that comes to mind is use of the same URI but content 
negotiation for an "application/rdf+kitchensink" mime type.

Cheers,
Danny.
