Attached is a paper which Alvaro and myself have just completed and
submitted to
The Eleventh International Conference on Artificial Intelligence:
Methodology, Systems, Applications
- Semantic Web Challenges - AIMSA 2004, in September.
http://www.aimsa2004.org/main.html <http://www.aimsa2004.org/main.html> 

Comes under the WP6 - extension activity on modelling.  Currently much as
submitted, but
I'll reformat/modify it as a SWAD-E note in due course.   In the meantime,
comments welcome!
(particularly if I have completely misunderstood OWL-S!).

thanks

Brian
