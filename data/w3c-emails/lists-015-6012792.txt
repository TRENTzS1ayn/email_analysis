I apologize if you don't understand me perfectly (I'm French).
Well, I subscribe to your list and I don't understand all you talk about but
I feel that I don't understand why this list was created. Well, not
important in facts but maybe you'll be able to answer my question.
I write here a mail because of Xiti. I don't know if you've heard of this
service. It's French. The service is : you put a button "Xiti" on your site
and you can have some details about your visitors (with some javascript).
It's free (but there is also a Premium service).
Well, I try at this moment to validate my web site. I use Xiti and that's a
big problem for the Validator because Xiti doesn't respect at all the
javascript standard, and we mustn't change the code (if we do, a robot will
say to Xiti there is a problem). And I can't build a code to do the same
thing as Xiti (for example : build a script to say me if my visitors are in
800 x 600 or 1024 x 768, if they are on Windows or Linux...). I will try of
course but I don't thing it will be as pretty as Xiti's service.
Like I wrote above, I don't know really if this list was create for this
kind of problems.
If not, I apologize. But tell me !
I thank you for reading my letter....
