Hi all

Does anyone know what the current status of the braille media type is?
Currently it seems like only the print and aural media types have 
anything definite behind them and the print one is really great to use.

Is there a free (or relatively inexpensive) device that can be used to 
test an aural css?

Sorry, lots of questions :-)

Thanks
Josh Campbell
