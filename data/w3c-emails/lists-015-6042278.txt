Greeting, standards lovers

I'm in the process of writing an article trying to show why someone
ordering a web site to a web agency should definitely require standard
compliance in its final product.

This article probably needs more review and suggestions before being
"officially" published. I would so appreciate if you could find some
time to review it:
"Buy standards compliant web sites"

Let me first thank Kim Nylander who did a very careful review of a
previous version of this document (I integrated the changes she
proposed).

Please send any suggestions, comments and corrections to this list,
except for spelling, grammar and more generally language errors that you
should send to me in private to not encumber the mailing list.

Thanks for your time,

Dom
