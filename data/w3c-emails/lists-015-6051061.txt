Hi,

Interesting article by Paul Boutin

"Web standards? You can't afford to ignore them anymore.

Just two years ago, coding your site to the emerging guidelines from 
the World Wide Web Consortium was next to impossible. After all, any 
surfers were still saddled with browsers from the days when Netscape 
and Microsoft deliberately built incompatible products."
