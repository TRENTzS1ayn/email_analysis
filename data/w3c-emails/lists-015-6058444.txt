Greetings!

I just found out about this list from Terje over on www-validator and
decided to sign up.  I've read a few of the 'intro' posts from the
archive and figured I'd introduce myself.

I am a Web developer at Arizona State University, soon (19 August) to
become a full-time doctoral student in modern European history.  I'll
be continuing to work on various Web sites here, but won't be full-time
IT staff any more.  I anticipate actively developing both instructional
and research Web projects for the whole of my academic career.

I've been doing Web pages since 1995, and I remember how exciting the
first Netscape browser was.  (I still have some nostalgia for the old
NCSA Mosaic, but my browser of choice is now Galeon.)  I've never used
WYSIWIG editors for real work -- there weren't any when I started doing
HTML -- and my "authoring tool" is Vim.

I am a passionate partisan of standards compliance (and that includes
WCAG, not just XHTML/CSS) and Free (libre, not gratis) software, and am
therefore quite concerned about patent encumbering in future W3C
recommendations.

My latest interest is working with XML/XSLT.  I'd like to come up with
transformations that will allow secretaries to save openoffice.org XML
files and have them automagically converted to servable XHTML (and some
TeX variant for generating pretty-printable PDFs).

That's me -- a little background as to where my deranged rants will be
coming from ;)
