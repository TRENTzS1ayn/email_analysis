"Of primary concern to some Web developers is the W3C's warning that XHTML 2.0
will not be "backward compatible" with HTML 4.0 and XHTML 1.0. That alert has
raised concern that billions of Web pages risk obsolescence unless they are
translated to the new Web language."

Someone doesn't understand the idea of namespaces and doctypes then...

But, at least the article is positive towards XHTML in general.
