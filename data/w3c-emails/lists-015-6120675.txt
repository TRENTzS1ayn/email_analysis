Karl,

There seems to be a server problem (or maybe a standards problem? it's
IIS/ASP) -- I'm getting a blank article at that URI.  (Galeon 1.2.5 on
Debian 3.0.)

(getting a HEAD on that URI shows a 302 to the same URI minus the
articleid param . . .  that seems to be the problem)

Is there another URI that actually serves the article?
