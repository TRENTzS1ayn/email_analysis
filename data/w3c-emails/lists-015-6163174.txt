That's often the problem when the author is not the publisher. The 
only the author can do is try to convince the people that it must be 
deliver as standards. Unfortunately, the publisher usually doesn't 
care or doesn't want to fix all the system for one person requesting 
it.

But maybe it's another way to ask for more standard, but will work 
only with big voices. I don't come to your conference if your website 
is not standard.

The other side of it is we are in an educationnal phase, and the 
conference organizer can say, not a problem we'll ask for someone 
else.

So what's the best?
