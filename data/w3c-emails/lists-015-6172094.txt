That's unpleasant indeed, doesn't look very serious, and I'm certain
that people against any form of validation/web standards will have an
easy job to laugh at the article.

But think of it this way : the article is not published on the author's
website[1] (which itself is -hum- almost valid), and it's been written
to convince librarians, including the people running the library
journal, that they should follow the standards. I respect the author's
choice to publish the article on an invalid website rather than spending
the same amount of time trying to convince the "library journal" only.
Makes sense to me.

In times of need for educational material about web standards, yes I'm
disappointed to see a good article on an invalid website, but it's
certainly better than no article at all, IMHO.
