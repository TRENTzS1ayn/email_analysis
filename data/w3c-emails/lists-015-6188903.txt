Not exactly the best article about standards ever, but something is
better than nothing. It does make some very common mistakes however...


"Valid XHTML requires that every image on a web site includes
descriptive text that tells the user what the image is."

No, no, no. It doesn't. XHTML requires alt text on every image (but
alt="" is totally valid, and often needed) - and alt text is *not* a
description of an image, it is the meaning. Putting a description in
every alt attribute often leads to confusing and over-verbose pages.


"XHTML also requires that headers, lists, and other structural tags be
used so readers on assistive technology are presented with a coherent
document that flows logically. "

XHTML doesn't require this either. This is an option you have. You can
mark everything up with <pre> if you so wish, it would still be valid
XHTML.


"Furthermore, as a light version of XML, XHTML will help developers
transition to full-blown XML, a richer markup language that will soon
afford even greater interoperability to web sites."

Eh?? XHTML *is* full-blown XML. Why do people have such a problem with
understanding this? XML isn't going to "replace" XHTML by any means.


"In XHTML, even "empty" tags like <br> and <img> must close themselves
by including a space and a forward slash at the very end of the tag"

Not very good usage of "must". It is a good idea to, but you don't
*have* to.


Yeh, I'm being picky. But I'm in a picky mood. So there :)
