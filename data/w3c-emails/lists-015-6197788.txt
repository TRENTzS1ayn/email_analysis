There seems to be some conflation of WCAG and XHTML.  I've encounted
this in my own work when I introduced valid XHTML, CSS, and WCAG
compliance as part of a Web accessibility initiative.  The whole effort
had a tendency to be reduced to "CSS" or "ADA" (the Americans with
Disabilities Act) in some people's vocabulary.

True, but the difference is subtle to someone first encountering the
concept of text alternatives.  I wouldn't be overcritical there, given
that it's written for a `layperson'.

This is where I think she means WCAG, not XHTML.

Proposed interview question for Web `designers': ``Please explain the
relationship among SGML, XML, HTML, and XHTML.''

Since so few Web `experts' have any clue what SGML is, or what it has to
do with HTML, it's not surprising that the XML::XHTML relationship
confuses them.

I don't understand you.  If it's X(HT)ML, empty elements (she conflates
elements and tags here, too) _must_ be closed, whether as <br /> or
<br></br>.  We prefer the former so ancient noncompliant browsers don't
barf.  But it must be one or the other, or it's not well-formed XML,
much less valid XHTML.
