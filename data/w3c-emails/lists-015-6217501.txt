There is an excellent resource of tips put together by Mark Pilgrim at:

http://diveintoaccessibility.org/

perhaps some of these could be used - or a link to the site could 
be added from the HMTL validator page.

> The WAI Education and Outreach Working Group - http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/
> has been around for a long time (since 1998 IIRC) and has produced a lot
> of important resources for WAI education (I'm sure many of you know the
> WAI quicktips card, for example).
> 
> public-evangelist - http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-evangelist/
> is the (rather young) list of the Quality Assurance Interest Group's
> EO activities, born to host discussion and coordination about "Web
> standards Education and Outreach" at large.

> 
> Now to the point : about one year ago there was an little, yet

> I encourage everyone to have a look at this, and if you like, please
