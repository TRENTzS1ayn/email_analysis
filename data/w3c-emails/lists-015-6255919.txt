The good news is that if you're standards-compliant, the Mac and
Linux/Unix browsers other than NS4 will be generally OK.  Opera is
a similar situation.

The bad news is that all versions of MSIE for Windows have broken
standards compliance, IE4 being very bad and IE6 still having serious
problems.  You'll need actually to test back to IE4 if you want to make
sure things work with its bugs.

As far as serving a special page for NS4, do the `powers that be' demand
that the NS4 version be as `pretty' as the accessible version?  An easy
solution, if you use true XHTML 1.0 Strict with all presentation in
external CSS files, is simply to hide the CSS from NS4 by exploiting the
`media="all"' bug.  Then the NS4 users will simply see a plain,
grey-background page with all the default settings.  You might even
include a note (hidden to CSS-grokking browsers) suggesting that the
user upgrade to a standards-compliant browser.
