First, this is a great article. I learned a lot with the "legal history" 
thing. This may be the kind of ammo to hit the marketeers with. :-)

When you mention PDF not being accessible, you may want to be more 
specific, as it looks like Adobe is making progress in this field

see http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/pdfs/pdfaccess.pdf ,
 http://access.adobe.com/ and http://www.pdfzone.com/news/101078.html

When you mention that Javascript is needed for navigation, you may link 
to http://www.thecounter.com/stats/2002/April/javas.php , which states 
that 11% of people do not use javascript while browsing. That would make 
marketeers think, maybe. Oh wait, they decided not to support macs :-(

Cheers,
