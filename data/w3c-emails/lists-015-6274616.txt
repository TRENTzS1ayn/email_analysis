Dominique,

I have some editorial suggestions (minor grammar/style fixes).  What
would be your preferred format for that?  I could send you (off-list)
the HTML source with <del> and <ins> elements marking changes, or an
OpenOffice.org file with change history.

On a related note, are W3C documents like this meant to conform always to
U.S. usage?  Is there a preferred style, i.e., Associated Press versus
Chicago Manual of Style versus American Psychological Association?
