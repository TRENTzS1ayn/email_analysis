After reading the recent story about the forthcoming Opera 7 on news.com, I felt it necessary to respond to some of the statements made by the one Web developer they interviewed. And they actually published the letter!

Perhaps a few people will actually notice, and perhaps a few of those will actually think about the issue in greater depth than "everyone should just code to IE and forget about the standards".

I'd urge others on this list to write letters when they see other articles that deserve similar rebuttal. If we just leave these out there unchallenged, most of the readers will just assume that's the way everybody thinks.
