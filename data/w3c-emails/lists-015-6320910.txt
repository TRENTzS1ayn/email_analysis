I should not post at 1:30am... I have posted with my personal 
address. Thank you to the people who already sent comments to me in 
private at the right address.

It's good to post the comments here, because when the ideas are 
shared and debated, we can improve our documents.

Thank you.
PS: I'm also in holidays for 3 days now and for 10 days more :)
