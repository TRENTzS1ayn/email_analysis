I am going to try and start a webmastering club at my school to both 
take over the website after I graduate at the end of this year and to 
teach quality webmastering.  If anybody comes through the Indianapolis, 
Indiana area, I would be interested in possibly inviting you to speak to 
us about webmastering with accessibility and the standards in mind if I 
get the club started.  If interested, email 
brantgurganus2001@cherokeescouting.org.  Thank you.
