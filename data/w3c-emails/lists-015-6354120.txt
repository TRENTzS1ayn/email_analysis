We are in the process of redesigning a multiple company extranet and have
learned that a huge number of our users have Netscape 4.X as their browser.
Consequently, some of our team is reluctant to design using standards (the main
concern is using CSS) since it will mess up the design we have already created.
The concerns include CSS becoming overhead and that keeping track of how the
various workarounds for Netscape 4.x work and don't work, along with the
inheritance issues, will take a huge amount of time. I would love to know what
some of our options are, but don't have the technical expertise to make a strong
case. Any advice?
