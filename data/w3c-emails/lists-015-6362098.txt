Short and simple:
If you want Netscape 4.X support, you do not want standards.

The Hacks'R'Us department is somewhere else.

I apologize if that sounds crude, but welcome to the real world. Either you
want standards (with a small degree of customizations) or you do not want
standards and you can keep on using TABLE/FONT/IMG-spacer-based layouts.

Give up Netscape 4 or give up standards.
