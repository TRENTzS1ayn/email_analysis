  Molly here, 
    I'm protecting myself from receiving junk mail. 
    Just this once, click the link below so I can receive your emails.
    You won't have to do this again.

  You are receiving this message in response to your email to molly@molly.com, a Spam Arrest customer. 

  Spam Arrest requests that senders verify themselves before their email is delivered. 

  When you click the above link, you will be taken to a page with a graphic on it. Simply read the word in the graphic, type it into the form, and you're verified. 

  You will only need to do this once per Spam Arrest customer.
