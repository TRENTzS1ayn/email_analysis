Ok. Maybe I'm crazy. But what kinds of designs are you speaking about, the 
ones that are impossible to achieve in NS4 using standards?

Maybe some sample sites you could direct me to, or even screenshots or

Either we're not on the same page concerning visual design, or we're not 
on the same planet.
