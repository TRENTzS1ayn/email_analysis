We are in complete agreement on those points ;)

I think this is where I got off on the wrong foot on the interpretation with
Austin. In my opinion (and personal as well as professional situation), we
have moved beyond HTML4 and into XHTML + CSS. The only browser we had to
leave behind was Netscape 4, and considering that Denmark has less than 1%
Netscape users (combined), that was hardly a difficult choice.

Of course HTML 4 Transitional is still a valid standard, and if Mike wants
Netscape 4 support he will most likely have to settle for it. I just hope he
is now aware of the limitations and degredations that he willingly impose on
himself through that decision.
