Thor, I think you ferreted the disagreement out quite admirably. When you 
say standards you mean no tables for layout. When I say standards I mean 
simple tables for layout.

I agree that in an ideal world, we would only use tables for data, but 
tables are a perfectly acceptable part of the XHTML 1.0 specification. You 
can create NS4 compatible websites using XHTML 1.0 and CSS, without 
sacrificing your visual design.

But these limitations easily cover everything you could do with a font tag.
  The font name (verdana, arial, times), the font size, the color of the 
text, and bold or italic or both.

CSS positioning and line-height are two that come to mind. Advanced in the 
sense that they're not reliably supported in NS4. As a side-note, 
line-height isn't *that* important. And the positioning can be handled by 
tables. Other formatting like borders, like line-height, are also not that 
important and degrade perfectly (to nothin, which isn't so bad).

Simple tables with CSS formatting help avoid the above statistics.
