Hello Thor,

 I apologize if that sounds crude, but welcome to the real world. Either
you  want standards (with a small degree of customizations) or you do
not want  standards and you can keep on using
TABLE/FONT/IMG-spacer-based layouts.
Give up Netscape 4 or give up standards.

And what must I give up now Netscape 4 or the  XHTML 1.1 standard
when you look this page  even coded without tables for layout?

When you look the CSS you can see the image also float  in Netscape 4.7
