While this is all true in the unvarnished sense, I'm finding that 
Netscape 4 is a useful target for what I would call "base-line" output.

In other words, it can be a good target for emulating text-only, 
accessible pages. This view of the content gives designers the 
opportunity to optimize the so called document order of the content to 
be most accessible and usable by people who must/will use text-only or 
screen-reader technology. Examples might be, placing banner graphics and 
menu bars at the bottom of the document so that the text-only reader 
encounters the content immediately and doesn't have to sift through 
unnecessary material; a skip link can be inserted at the top or an 
access key combination used to jump directly to menu options.

At the same time, the content is formatted such that no linking or 
navigating functionality is lost to Netscape 4.x users. In other words, 
the pages look like pages looked in 1989, at the beginning of it all. 
Sometimes this is not necessarily a bad thing.

On the technical level this is accomplished by "hiding" the CSS styling 
mechanism from Netscape 4. Modern browsers, on the other hand, will see 
the same base-line document but will organize the visual, cosmetically 
enhanced version according to the rules in the style-sheet.

If this approach is a non-starter for your people, then I'd say you have 
a very difficult and, more importantly, very expensive project on your 
hands because virtually everything will have to be done twice, the Bv4 
(BeforeVersion4) and the Av6 (Version 6 and beyond.)
