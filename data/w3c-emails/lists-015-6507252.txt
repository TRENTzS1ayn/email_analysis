Web Standards embrace:

HTML 4.01 Transitional Document
HTML 4.01 Strict Document
HTML 4.01 Frameset
XHTML 1.0 Transitional Document
XHTML 1.0 Strict Document
XHTML 1.0 Frameset
XHTML 1.1 Document

Anything that is valid in any of these markup varieties is valid and standard compliant.

And from http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/tables.html#h-11.1

?Tables should not be used purely as a means to layout document content as this may present problems when rendering to non-visual media. Additionally, when used with graphics, these tables may force users to scroll horizontally to view a table designed on a system with a larger display. To minimize these problems, authors should use style sheets to control layout rather than tables.?

Should, not must.

So layouts containing tables are valid if they pass the W3C validity tests. They may not be futureproof and have problems with browsers or other client devices, but what we?re talking here is W3C validity and not WAI accessibility.

But I?m looking to use table and frameless layouts ? and I?ll cater as best I can for NS4, but put a warning on my pages (in plain text) to this effect. But it is for me and for others a learning curve. Until the only languages in use are XHTML 1.1 and higher, then we have to embrace the standards we?re all so hot on, even if we think some of them are not disappearing as quickly as we like.

Regards

John
