Greetings,

W3C switched today its home page to a full CSS layout instead of the
previous table-based one. See:
http://www.w3.org/

The techniques used in this layout has been documented at:
http://www.w3.org/2002/11/homepage
It is basically realized through the float property.

As you may know, using CSS for horizontal layout has some important
benefits:
- respect of the HTML semantics (tables are really for tabular data)
- better accessibility
- better device scalability

The downside is that some non-CSS2 aware browsers do not render it as
intended; the page keeps completely readable though.

The W3C Communication Team is interested in hearing comments on this
change on the publicly archived mailing-list site-comments@w3.org

(which doesn't prevent us from discussing some related bits here :)

Dom
