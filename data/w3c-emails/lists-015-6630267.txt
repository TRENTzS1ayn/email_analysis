My browsers sends accept headers including "application/xhtml+xml; q=0"
There's nothing more I can do as a client to make it clear that I do not
support, and therefore cannot render XHTML in an appropriate manner, I do
support text/html.  Why will the W3 not send me an HTML representation of
their homepage, why insist on XHTML 1.0?

Indeed, and many do not support  application/x-chickens  that's why we
have the accept-headers!  There's no lack of browser support of HTML 4.01
so, indeed it's difficult to find a UA that will have any problems with
it unlike the xhtml, why not serve it?  Rather than work at trying to
match Appendix C, which as we see later, is already causing difficulties.

It is an abbr surely, so use the appropriate markup - I do not want my
speech agent to attempt to say "W3C" as a word, it's not going to do a
good job of it.  I realise that you're using acronym for browser support,
but I see no point in breaking the semantic meaning of a element purely
to get a particular visual representation in some browsers.

Of course, my issue is that the name is suggestive of a particular visual
rendering, and that the span in question was there purely for the
presentational effect.

<span class="invisible"><a class="bannerLink"
title="Skip introductory links and the mission statement"
href="#technologies">Skip to Technologies</a> | </span>

Is the pipe character really useful to the situation where's it would be
"invisible", would not normal whitesapce be better, especially as the
UA's I'm aware of will distinguish the link as a link in any case, so

<a class="bannerLink invisible"
title="Skip introductory links and the mission statement"
href="#technologies">Skip to Technologies </a>

Would've been appropriate and would've included purely presentational
elements, this is what's done elsewhere with the <p class="invisible">
... </p>  I also think another name would've been appropriate just to
stop people thinking it was presentational.

My criticisms were intentionally petty, the page has to be beyond any
complaint.

Cheers,

Jim.
