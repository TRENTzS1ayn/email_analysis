I'll gladly accept any feedback anyone wishes to give, and will debate any
of the design compromises I have chosen, just as I hope others will debate
their design choices, I feel the W3 need to explain the rather strange
design choice to choose the poorly supported XHTML as text/html over HTML
4.01 - if there are good reasons for it, then we need to know them so we
can include the same.

Certainly from an CSS perspective, and semantic layout itself it has much
to be applauded.

Jim.
