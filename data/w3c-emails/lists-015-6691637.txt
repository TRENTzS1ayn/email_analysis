I'm really getting puzzled by al this insistence on HTML4.01. As I 
understood it, HTML4.01 is the last of the line of HTML recommendations by 
W3C, we're now onto XHTML 1.0 (an XML application) and XHTML 1.1. XHTML2.0 
proposals have been published. So why try to tie into a dying legacy 
language that has absolutely no future?
