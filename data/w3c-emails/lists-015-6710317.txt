John,

Please let me provide my viewpoint on this issue.

The page http://www.w3.org/ is served as text/html and as such really is 
just HTML. It will invoke the HTML parser in Mozilla and Netscape 7.0 
and not the XML parser. You gain no real benefit from using XHTML 
content if the page is to be served as text/html.

Take a look at

http://dev.bclary.com/w3/index.html   (served as text/html)
http://dev.bclary.com/w3/index.xhtml  (served as application/xhtml+xml)
http://dev.bclary.com/w3/index.xml    (text/xml)

in Mozilla, Netscape 7.0, Opera 7 beta 1 and Internet Explorer 6.

Mozilla, Netscape 7.0, Opera 7 beta 1 will display each version 
correctly.  Internet Explorer can not display the page if it is served 
as anything but text/html.

 From my point of view, XHTML served as text/html is useless. So, why 
use XHTML on this page ?
