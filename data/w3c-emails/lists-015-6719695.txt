Both initiatives are great steps in the right direction. I understand 
that in a perfect world these pages should be served using XML content 
type, as stated in http://www.hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml . But I also 
understand that in such a perfect world, non-perfect browsers would not 
exist.

Anyway, I applaude the effort that makes the consortium's web site to be 
better aligned to the principles it preaches. not _perfectly_ aligned, 
but still.

Kudos to the web team, and specifically, Dom.

You guys rock!
