In an effort to assist developers and designers in understanding detailed
issues when working with web standards, WaSP and the W3C kick off a new
project today.

The project, "WaSP Asks the W3C" involves WaSP Steering Committee members
culling questions from supporters and asking members of the W3C's Quality
Assurance Group for insight and details. WaSP hopes you'll find the project
worthwhile.

The first article is on properly specifying character sets.

Discussion can take place here.

Looking forward to your thoughts,
Molly
