Hi Ian,

Thanks for your great suggestions.  I really like what you say about
clarification and audience.  Obviously, this is the first toe in the big
pool, and everyone's comments are more than welcome/necessary to help make
this a success.

I'll look at your suggestions and modify the document a bit for clarity.

Thanks again,
Molly
