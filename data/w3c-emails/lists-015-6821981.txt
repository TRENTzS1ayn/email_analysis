I would like to refer, for a moment, to the XHTML 1.0 specification. It 
is available on the W3C website at http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1 . I am 
not, however, interested so much in the specification itself. The 
subtitle is what I would advise you to see.


The subtitle reads, ???A Reformulation of HTML 4 in XML 1.0.??? While I 
understand your argument from a theoretical standpoint, in the fact that 
it does take a minute or two to learn how to properly notate <br> and 
others in XHTML, there is no fundamental change in the vast majority of 
the specification. Unless you are referring to HTML 3.2, 2.0, or 1.0, 
there is no real argument for HTML 4 over XHTML 1.

I hope I am not mistaken in any way, but if I am, I would be glad to be 
enlightened.

Wes
