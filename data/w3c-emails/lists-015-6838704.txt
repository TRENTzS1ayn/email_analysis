I understand the transition from HTML to XHTML, and I fully support the 
use of XML itself. The problem with XHTML, for me, is that in their 
infinite wisdom the W3C made all the tags in XHTML lower-case. This 
alone is enough to prevent me from ever using it (with the porssible 
exception of if I'm being paid to do it).

As I'm sure others will agree, creating HTML code by hand, or at least 
creating templates by hand, give the best results (rather than using a 
WYSIWYG, or similar, editor). I've been doing this for years, using 
upper-case HTML tags, without problems. The problem I have with XHTML is 
that I simple can't edit it, or use my own style, because it's based on 
XML, and is therefor case-sensitive.

For me, XHTML represents a complete waste of time on the part of the W3C 
because of this - I'm never going to use it, instead I'll just switch 
from HTML 4 to XML/XSLT when that time comes (getting mighty close, I 
might add).
