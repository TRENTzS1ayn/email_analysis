I don't like the idea of having to scroll so much.  The homepage should have been broken up into the homepage and subpages.  The top navigation line and the first paragraph could be the homepage.  The search field could be on all of the pages in the upper right-hand corner.  All of the other sections could be broken up into various subpages in the following manner:
* W3C A to Z
* News
* Past News
* Contact Us
* Get Involved
* Mission
* Member Area
* W3C Team
* Past News

Some of these sections can be popup windows instead of pages and linked at the top and bottom of Webpages.

Sandra.
