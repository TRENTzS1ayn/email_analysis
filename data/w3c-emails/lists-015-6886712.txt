Sorry - this should have gone to list rather than the one person

Which will mess up most of the accessibility criteria

From
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/

"  . .  changing the current window or popping up new windows can be very 
disorienting to users who cannot see that this has happened. "

"10.1Until user agents allow users to turn off spawned windows, do not 
cause pop-ups or other windows to appear and do not change the current 
window without informing the user. [Priority 2]"

And as far as I know, the criteria for user agents to allow the turning off 
of spawned windows, or otherwise handling them, then the requirements will 
not be met.

Regards

John
