I too have noticed this.  Schools teach the worst Web design since they 
think they have to use fancy text books (which cost money, take time to 
make and purchase, etc.) when they could just use the actual 
specifications which are sometimes even easier and are monetarily free.  
By the time the textbook is printed, it is probably out-of-date and if 
adopted, it takes about five years before new text books are adopted.  
In the worst cases, Web design education is at least six years behind 
the Web specifications.  That is why you still see people writing 
presentationally using invalid HTML 3.2 through a Web editor.  Such is 
the case with my school.  Despite all my efforts, they fail to realize 
that HTML is a markup language that adds meaning, not fancy colors.  
They fail to see that this makes the language easier, not more difficult.
They seem to think:
  I have to be  a nerd to read HTML code.
  I don't want to be a nerd.
  I refuse to read HTML code.

Not only is that false logic, being a geek or nerd is not a bad thing.  
A geek is simply someone with a passion for his or her profession or 
hobby whether it be computers, sports, or something else.

Well, I hope those ramblings didn't stray too far from the original topic.
