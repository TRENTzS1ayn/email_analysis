Sounds about right to me. I've no problem with admitting I'm a geek (not a
nerd :-).

My concern is that we'll end up with two Web Developer communities that have
little relation to each other, those using the latest standards and those on
HTML who don't know or care. (even more so than how it is now)

And there's no way Browser manufacturers will move browsers to a non
backwards compatible language until a very high percentage of users are
aware of it.

I too have noticed this.  Schools teach the worst Web design since they
think they have to use fancy text books (which cost money, take time to
make and purchase, etc.) when they could just use the actual
specifications which are sometimes even easier and are monetarily free.
By the time the textbook is printed, it is probably out-of-date and if
adopted, it takes about five years before new text books are adopted.
In the worst cases, Web design education is at least six years behind
the Web specifications.  That is why you still see people writing
presentationally using invalid HTML 3.2 through a Web editor.  Such is
the case with my school.  Despite all my efforts, they fail to realize
that HTML is a markup language that adds meaning, not fancy colors.
They fail to see that this makes the language easier, not more difficult.
They seem to think:
  I have to be  a nerd to read HTML code.
  I don't want to be a nerd.
  I refuse to read HTML code.

Not only is that false logic, being a geek or nerd is not a bad thing.
A geek is simply someone with a passion for his or her profession or
hobby whether it be computers, sports, or something else.

Well, I hope those ramblings didn't stray too far from the original topic.
