Following on from what everyone else has said, I work with someone who
started learning web design at an evening class at a local college.
After a couple of weeks, she came up and asked me why I wasn't using
FrontPage.  I despair - this isn't web design, it's "lets see what
prettiness I can make with a WYSIWYG editor" (or to use a great phrase
stolen from someone WYGIWYD (What You Get Is What You Deserve)).  The
people running these courses are really damaging the web!

I think I'm going to have to spend some time explaining exactly what web
design is, rather than what colleges and other such places promote ot as
to get bums on seats and money in the bank.  It really irritates me.  I
get called a geek by my intranet manager at work - this coming from the
man who won't use CSS and uses FrontPage for "ease".

I have to say that I'm looking forward to getting my hands on XHTML2.0
but I share the fear of others that as it isn't designed to be backwards
compatible, it may well put people off.  Also, considering the hacks
that we have to use if we want a page to be viewable in numerous
browsers, it's going to be a while until we get decent browser support.

Have a good new year

Francis
