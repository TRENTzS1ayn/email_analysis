The problems lie in human nature and a little with Microsoft, but 
Microsoft certainly is not at fault.  They are simply making a product 
that their customers want so the problem lies more in human nature.  
People think that "coding" is a geek thing.  The mission is to change 
that, especially for markup languages such as HTML/XHTML where you are 
telling what you mean or CSS where you tell what you want it to look 
like.  Coding scripting languages and understanding the DOM is beyond 
most people, even me sometimes so that cannot be expected.
Using standard technologies is like building the Tower of Babel (except 
we are *not* trying to reach Heaven).  Using proprietary technologies is 
like building the Tower of Babel before God made man speak different 
languages.
