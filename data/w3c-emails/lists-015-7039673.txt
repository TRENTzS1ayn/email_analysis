IIRC, the Web was invented to ease information sharing in the first
place. The structure versus presentation separation came in later and
is secondary.  Moreover, regardless of the original design goals, the
question is whether humans should be tought to write better markup OR
whether computers should be built to generate better markup (based on
inputs from a human-oriented interface).

OK. It is technically trivial to show users how their pages look/sound
in all non-IE browsers. I am sure W3C can make that kind of service.
Of course, it would make no difference until there are enough
``non-IE'' users out there! So do we wait until there are more non-IE
users around, then?

Or is it possible to build tools that generate markup that works OK
for non-IE users based on a naive non-markup [FrontPage] user input?

In other words, who is responsible for content-versus-structure
separation and other good-design principles? Is it a grandma posting a
picture of a flower on the Web? Or is it the software that helps the
grandma to post that picture?

If the medium is so powerful, flexible, and complex, should not it be
the computer job to cross-compile user input so that it works well in
many environments?

Are we expecting the majority of Web designers to program in and be
excited about a Web-equivalent of an assembly language? Should we try
to learn from past mistakes and migrate to something more
human-oriented like a Web-equivalent of C++ or Java, leaving assembly
stage to the computer?
