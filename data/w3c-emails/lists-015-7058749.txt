Unless you're also teaching serving XHTML 1.1 with the correct MIME type, 
why that matters, and what it means to legacy browsers, it's my option that 
teaching to XHTML 1.1 is overkill and possibly even a disservice.

There's no reason that an HTML 4.01 course cannot be done that also teaches 
good semantics, separation of content/presentation, standards, 
accessibility, etc.  Just because 4.01 allows for paragraphs with no ending 
tag means one has to teach coding that way....

With the skills mastered, they transfer to XHTML 1.0, 1.1, and forward into 
the future.  It's just a matter of understanding the 
grammatical/syntactical differences, knowing what may have been 
deprecated/obsoleted, and so forth.
