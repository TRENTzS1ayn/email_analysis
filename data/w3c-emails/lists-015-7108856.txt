I think the point is that no one should have to look at the HTML 
or really understand what CSS is :) It's the content that matters,
not how it's done.  But a tool like this which may aid designers
in the creation of Web templates would be nice.

Does anyone here know of any software developers (or would can collate
a team together) to make such a tool a reality?

The W3C specs were never really geared for the general Web development/
design audience - I presume the target audience of the specs is for
those who actually implements Web software, be it user-agents or
editors. 

IMHO, it's not enough to just say the W3C should really promote this
or that - they are comparable to a standards body - lately, when I
describe the kind of standards evanglism I am involved in to non-Web
people, I mention a similarity to the ISO. Don't you think it is really 
up to us, designers and developers who have been converted, to preach 
to our colleagues and educate the next generation of developers?

I wish all a fabulous new year. :)
