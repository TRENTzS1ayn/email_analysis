Yes, yes, and once again, yes! This is the only way that standards will get 
known about - by talking about them. Peer example, peer education, peer 
pressure if you like - to get more and more people talking about standards 
and the reasons why they a great advantage.

I got into standards because I was (and still am) lazy - I was looking for 
ways of writing pages once for all browsers and browsing devices rather 
than writing exceptions and exclusions. This is why the standards route was 
attractive to me, and then I started learning about problems with 
accessibility as I learned more about people's use of the web.

And now standards seem so attractive rather than any non-standard route, 
not as an end in themselves but because I can continue to be lazy and code 
once for all users.

As an aside, I wonder if IE7 will be less buggy with regards to stylesheet 
compliance? If there ever is going to be an IE7, that is.
