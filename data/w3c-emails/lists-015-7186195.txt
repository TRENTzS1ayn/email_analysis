I though I would be the first to post to this new list by introducing 
myself and my evangelism efforts.  I am a high school senior with a 
large interest in computer, the Internet, and the World Wide Web.  I 
learned HTML, CSS, and the other World Wide Web technologies from the 
actual specifications.  I have since become involved in Mozilla 
Evangelism where I have submitted a "Standards Redirector."  I am also 
creating some articles to publish at moz.zope.org about the Mozilla 
Evangelism effort.  I believe the best way to urge other webmasters to 
follow the standards of the Internet and the World Wide Web is by 
example and by creating standards-compliant browsers such as Mozilla 
which do not always show pages correctly if they do not follow the 
standards.
I would like to hear about the Evangelism efforts of other people so 
please reply about my activities or about your own.
