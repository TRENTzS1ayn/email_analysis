Hi, and welcome on public-evangelist!

Thanks for all of you that have subscribed so fast to this new mailing
list: this is a good omen for the work that we want to see happen
here!

Let me just introduce quickly the context and goals of this forum: it
has been created as part of the Quality Assurance Activity [1] at W3C (I
assume you all know what W3C is :). Formally speaking, it is part of the
educational mission of the QA Interest Group [2].

As described on the mailing list home page [3], this forum aims to be a
place to coordinate the efforts of people trying to make the Web a
better, more interoperable system by inciting compliance to open
standards. The kind of cooperations we can imagine:
- sharing resources, documents, tips and tricks, experiences
- writing articles, publicizing them across various audiences
- helping articles and books writers with understanding the standards
the right way
- organizing some network events to publicize the standards (?)

This is of course not an exhaustive list, and any ideas to complete it
would be a good start of discussion! 

Some important points:
- this is a publicly archived mailing list, so everything you sent here
will be available to anyone (and this includes your email address and
any information in your signature)
- we'll have to set some limits on how far we can help tech writers: we
don't give any "W3C seal of approval", nor can we do their jobs for
them.


I know that we have some people from the Mozilla Tech Evangelism Team,
some from the WASP project, but probably many others I don't know
anything about: please feel free to introduce yourself and explain what
are your expectations from this forum, the projects you have in mind and
any other relevant informations!

Thank you very much, and again, welcome.

Dom
