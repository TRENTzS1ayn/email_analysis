I'm here because this is a big job and every bit helps.

Well, that is why the standards were created.

At home I can play as I like, at work I am faced with a committee or two and specifications that are not open, and a narrow subset of browsers used for testing.

The writing of an educational site for someone else (a charity) made me realise that it was sea change that was needed. For this Im concentrating on blindness and colour blindness as a start. The RNIB (UK sight organisation) has been helpful in providing guidelines for some of this.

I have never written a website for hire. All sites I create are 
standards-compliant and because I don't have to go through a review 
process, I can keep things simple, accessible, and admistratable.

>So my aims are to write everything in XHTML 1.1 using CSS and minimal client side scripting  Ill have to use server side scripting using PHP to access MySQL  and display results in non-conformant browsers (e.g. NS4 series) with a warning message. Ill test in Opera 6, IE,6, NS 7 and Moz 1 as there are the browser offering of the future, and also internet devices and mobiles as and when I can persuade my friends to see how sites look on theirs. Ill also try to find speech browsers so that I can check that my sites make sense.

Hey, I haven't figured out if XHTML 1.1 is actually the latest HTML. 
http://www.w3.org/TR/html gives XHTML 1.0.

>Regards evangelism  Im in the middle of writing a personal site promoting Web Standards for the amateur site builder  and trying to assist friends in making sites compliant. At work I am running education courses for Web Standards  but I really need big guns to get on my side for this to have a real effect.

Well, if you saw my other message, I want to complile a list of sites 
like this.

>And from this forum  hopes that there are sufficient people contributing from the grass roots of web design rather than just the experts  and one of the things Im looking for is ideas on how best to promote standards and education material which is as good (or better) a quality as that already available for non-standards HTML.

I think a Evangelism day would be cool, similar to Bug days for Mozilla. 
We would write an article or something about the standards and submit it 
to as many places as possible.

I learn from the actual specifications since most references are 
outdated or encourage presentational markup instead of semantic markup.
