I'd like to come up with a good set of references.  I'd like to start by 
listing sites that have articles about writing standards-compliant HTML 
or how to fix problems with proprietary HTML:

   * http://www.w3.org
   * http://mozilla.evangelism.bclary.com
   * http://www.webstandards.org
   * http://developer.netscape.com/evangelism

Please add sites you know of to the list.  As I receive responses, I 
will add them to my home page.
