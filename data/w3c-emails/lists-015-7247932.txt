Hello everyone,

Thanks to Karl Dubost from the QA group for getting me involved. We met at
the WWW conference in Hawaii not long ago, and I was very happy to hear
about plans for this then, and to see it come to fruition now.

My intro:  I'm Molly, I write books on HTML, XHTML, CSS, and web design and
development topics as well as train and speak internationally on W3C
technologies.  I am always working harder to better personally understand
and in turn be able to express W3C ideas and methods to practitioners, and
my participation here is in hopes of gaining support, insight, and guidance
when working to present this information to the public.

I am a steering committee member of WaSP, on the Buzz team and co-editor of
the LEARN section (http://www.webstandards.org/).  I am working with the
World Organization of Webmasters (WOW) to boost their interest in standards
(and convince them to get their site up to par!) since they serve a very
large population (http://www.joinwow.org/).  For more about me, you can
check out my web site at http://www.molly.com/.

I look forward to working with everyone here.

Very best,
Molly :)
