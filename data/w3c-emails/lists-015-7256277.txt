I'm here because I love the web. It's wonderful how it is, but no-one has
yet even begun to realise the potential of what we can do with this thing.

If the web is going to keep evolving, it needs to do it based on a set of
standards which everyone follows, which luckily seems to be the direction
the tools, and quite a few of the authors are currently heading towards.

As I become more involved with newer technologies, I'm finding a distinct
lack of any decent documentation, suitable for the average person at all.
If we do want to build the future's systems, I think that there needs to
be better learning materials, and tools, such that it's easy for anyone to
participate in it. Things like RSS are fine, but they don't become as
powerful as they should be until everyone starts using them. I want to be
one of those who joins in in being ahead of the pack, implementing new and
cool stuff, and making sure everyone else is able to follow.

Therefore, I want to see good powerful standards released, and I want to
see people such as myself playing with them, figuring out what we can do
with them, contributing towards making the next versions even better than
the previous ones, and most importantly teaching those who haven't reached
that level yet so that they can participate, and add to the tapestry that
we're all building.
