I guess I better had then, now I've been outed as a lurker! ;)

As Drew has already mentioned, I'm another WaSP DW Task Force member. I'm 
doing an increasing amount of writing on the subject of web standards - I 
am a co-author of 'Dynamic Dreamweaver MX' for Glasshaus - writing about 
best practices in development with CSS and XHTML/HTML within Dreamweaver 
MX, and have a few articles dotted around the web.

Looking forward to some interesting discussion here =)
