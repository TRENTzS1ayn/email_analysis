Hi Alll.. I'll attach my introduction and I'll probably be lurking from here
on out.

I'm on the Women Designers list with Rachel and just happened to click on
the WaSP link in her sig today. I've
been spending a lot of time at W3.org to help with CSS assignments for
school. My first attempt at validating a
page I coded from scratch was really scary!

I'm a baby as far as all of this standard/xml/css/php and all the other
acronyms. I've learned what I know.. by doing.
I've been a volunteer for the herplanet.com network for two years now and
dove right in and taught myself a lot of the html/coding
and scripting along with teaching my young ones a few curse words along the
way (sorry kids).
I won't be asking newbie questions or flooding the list with "how do you do
this? or how do you do that?"
I'm just here to absorb as much as I can.

In school full time for Digital Media: Web Production emphasis and currently
taking a beginning Web Design course which includes xml/css/javascript.. and
the next class in the series teaches php. I started with front page.. we
still use that program..and learned html just because I had to troubleshoot
the fat code that netscape despises. I'm trying to pull away from depending
on WYSIWYG programs.. but it's hard not to fall back on it.

I'm just here to learn as much as I can. Out network is a bit behind the
times and I'm hoping to influence them towards web standards and getting
away from frames and includes.. a standby in our network.

I am also a single WAHM to six kids ages 5 yo to 17 yo.
