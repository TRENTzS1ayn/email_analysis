Non-standard workarounds are always a little spooky to me....

Absolutely not, I hope.  Standards are what defines these bugs as "bugs" in
the first place -- compliance standards are powerful because they don't
compromise.  Once a standard begins to patch itself to accommodate the
behavioral quirks of the browser industry, we slip right under the table
again, into the days of "hack it until it works".

And if the W3C doesn't hold Microsoft to spec -- who will?

It's better to declare the emperors's lack of clothes than pretend
otherwise, I feel.  You might lose face in front of a few ill-informed
people, but others will realise that the opposite is true -- the _browser_,
not the W3C, is wrong.
