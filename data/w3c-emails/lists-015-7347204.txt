There seems to be a fair number of designers and web developers on this
forum, and that's a very good thing, since it should allow the
evangelists ones to get some feedback and ideas on their work.

Specifically, I think it would be interesting to know what designers and
web developers would see as useful resources: 
- to help them with build standard compliant web sites
- to help them with convincing their managers you should do that
- to clarify classical errors/misunderstandings they have been through
due to bad education outside for instance
