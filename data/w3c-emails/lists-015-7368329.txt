Let me thank you (again) for joining this mailing-list. I am extremely
pleased to see a lot of people sharing the same goal of making a better
web through education.

My intro: I'm Olivier Thereaux, part of the W3C staff, and I am working
on Systems (e.g. the mail search for W3C mailing-lists, which you may
have used already) as well as QA. I'll be one of the maintainers of this
list, along with Dominique.

I joined the QA activity soon after its birth, with a strong
desire to develop its Education and Outreach work (via the Interest
Group), so it's an understatement to say that I'm thrilled to see this
forum exist (at last), and that I have great expectations for it.

In some sense, the future of the web will depend on authors,
web evangelists and teachers such as yourselves, as much as it will
depend on new technologies being created or polished at the W3C.
It will, of course, also depend on the quality of web authoring
tools, web automating tools, browsers and emerging technologies
being created around the globe.


Firstly, let me point out that we have some ongoing Education work going 
on at the W3C:
- WAI-EO[0] comes to mind, of course
- Tutorials[1] are another example
- our validators (HTML[2], CSS[3], RDF[4])
- Tools (e.g the soon to be released LogValidator[5])
- and more coming in (QA has a few notes in its pipe).

This means the situation is not "W3C versus the Web Standards Education
world", nor is it "W3C trying to control these people", but W3C working
along with them.

Secondly, the birth of this forum is intended to help web evangelists
in their work by (and I'm borrowing Molly's words here) "filling the
gap between the web education world and W3C", and by sharing their
experience and expertise.


Looking forward to discussing with you all.


Kind Regards,
Olivier
