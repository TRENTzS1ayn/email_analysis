Hi,

I'm Dave, a web developer for TALL [1] at Oxford Uni, where we are still
working towards fully valid and accessible content. I'm currently developing
an XML Schema for online learning materials.

I'm looking forward to the web's progression from proprietary mish-mash into
the accessible, compatible, standards based information tool that it wants
to be.

Cheers,
Dave.

[1] If you're interested, it's the Technology Assisted Lifelong Learning
division of Oxford University's Department of Continuing Education.
