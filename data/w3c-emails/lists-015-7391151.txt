Hello everyone :)

I'm Steph, a web developer/designer currently (though perhaps not permanently) 
based in Melbourne, Australia. 

My chief interests with regards to advocating Web standards lie in effective, 
convincing and persuasive education based on sound arguments; telling someone 
what may be the 'right way' isn't necessarily going to achieve much, but 
showing them concrete evidence why they should is an essential step
forward.

I am also awfully concerned at the number of Web design courses out there 
which are not necessarily teaching the right thing to upcoming generation
of developers and designers.

There is a lot of talent to be tapped on this forum - so perhaps we can
discuss points of attacks and come up with some good ideas: 

* outreach in the current Web designer/development community
  Books and articles published on known Web sites are valuable resources.
  Is this enough? Are audiences within this group addressed
  appropriately?  Where does a new Web designer pick up their
  skills from, how could they be influenced?

* outreach in colleges, schools, University curriculum
  Education in Web standards in this particular area is very poor.
  Some University degrees are catching onto accessibility and
  usability and mention of Web standards, but on the whole, 
  it is not adequately taught due to various factors. A university
  lecturer said to me recently, "I would love to teach them xhtml, but it is 
  beyond the scope of my course to try and even explain XML when some students
  barely know how to work Windows." What can we do about this?

* convincing Management
Concrete evidence of the benefits of deploying Web standards,
  (tangible) cost-benefit analysis. We don't seem to have this
  information, how can we get it? What else?

Let's get the ball rolling!
   
cheers,
