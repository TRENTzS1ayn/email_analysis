Hello all,

My name is Jeff.  I'm a web developer working and living in the Salt Lake
City, Utah,  U.S. area.

I work for an e-learning company doing dhtml stuff for the online courses we
produce. Recently I've been working on upgrading our stuff to dxhtml. I
still have a bit to go.


I am very excited about this forum and what we can accomplish. Thanks w3c
for starting this.
