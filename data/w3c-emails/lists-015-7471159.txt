All,

If someone could set up a wiki that would be really cool. (Unfortunately I
don't know how to do it).

For those wondering what a wiki is, it's a collaborative space where anyone
can post info. Here's a link http://www.openwiki.com/

  The svg community has been using one for awhile now and it's incredibly
helpful. Here's a link to there's http://www.protocol7.com/svg-wiki/

<I should say 'ours' - I've been in the svg community and on the
svg-developers@yahoo list for almost 2 1/2 years now! ;) >
