A consistent implementation at the same level of the standards across 
the various browsers.  Specifically, those browsers are Opera, 
Mozilla/Netscape/K-Meleon/Galeon/Gecko-based, and Internet Explorer.

A clear list of advantages versus disadvantages of using the standards. 
 Obviously, we want to lean toward the advantages side, but the list 
must be balanced to be effective.  A list of only advantages will show 
that we don't care about the other side of the balance beam 
(metaphorically).

I think we need to educate properly from the beginning.  We need to make 
free up-to-date educational materials available to schools.  As a high 
school student, I know that school will typically buy the cheaper text 
book.  In the case of the World Wide Web's technologies, this is a bad 
idea.  The text books I have seen teach how to use FrontPage 
(proprietary) and other WYSIWIG environments.  Those that do teach HTML 
include the proprietary <marquee> and the deprecated style elements of 
HTML 3.2 and 4.0.  Likewise we need to make it well know that HTML marks 
up semantically as opposed to syntactically.  People think "How do I 
make this big, bold, and black?" instead of "How do I mark this as a 
heading (HTML) and once it is a heading, how do I tell that it should be 
big, bold, and black (CSS)?"
