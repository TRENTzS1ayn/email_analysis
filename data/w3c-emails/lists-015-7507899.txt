Hi everyone,

Thought I'd introduce myself for starters. I'm Shirley Kaiser. I'm on the 
Web Standards Project (WaSP) Steering Committee[1] where I co-lead the 
Learn section with Molly Holzschlag, contribute to WaSP's BUZZ blog, and 
pow-wow on ways to help implement and teach others about Web-related standards.

I'm also involved in the online community quite a bit via discussion lists, 
weblogs, independent projects, and more, where I try to help others with 
standards-related issues especially.

I have my own busy web design business, SKDesigns[2], where I've been 
designing and developing standards-compliant sites since 1996. I've also 
written tutorials, contributed to web-related books, do tech editing and 
reviewing, and write a daily weblog[3] primarily about website design and 
the Web.

In my other life I have a master's degree in piano performance, write 
music, give concerts[4], have two kids, and a dog to help keep me out of 
mischief.

I'm especially thrilled about this new discussion list to share ideas, 
experiences, and more in our efforts toward quality standards 
implementation and learning. I'm here to learn what I can and contribute as 
I'm able to as well.

Warmly,
Shirley
