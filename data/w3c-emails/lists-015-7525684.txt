a thought:

what about the possibility of creating some kind of ranked index
of tutorials, reference and source materials on web standards
created by developers and designers?

something in the vein of daypop's top 40 list [1], perhaps. given
the volume of material out there, it would be a site that points
to the best sources, as determined by the developer community.

from my own experience, i will often come across a site that best
explains a given standard, programming trick, etc. and will then
bookmark it and refer to it again and again. i would suspect that
others do the same, and having these "people's choice" sources in
a single location might be worth while...


cheers,

anthony
