Hi all,

I'm Bryce and I'm a web designer/developer in the central Kentucky 
region.  Quite frankly, I'm a little in awe of the company I'm keeping 
on this list, and will probably endeavor to just stay out of the way and 
learn what I can to help spread the Standards Gospel intelligently.  

Most of my web development experience comes from working at 
GEAppliances.com, where I evolved (and hopefully still evolve) from 
being just another hack HTML writer to being a serious web developer who 
strived to make the pages I created as  standards-compliant as I was 
allowed.  Starting next week, I will be moving into QA for that  
website,  and believe I will be in a unique postition to further 
evangelize the decision-makers as to the benefits of 
standards-compliance.  But as with many corporations, it's the bottom 
line that's important for them, and one thing I hope to derive from my 
association with this list is a series of good, sound arguments as to 
why coding for standards will benefit GE Appliances (and any future 
clients I may serve later).
