Citrus PunchHi there

I'm Keran McKenzie, I run a resource site at www.studiowhiz.com and am on
the HUNT for good solid XHTML, CSS, and such like tutorials, if you have
any, want to write any etc ... please feel free to join us.

Me? I've been around the net for too long, I love web standards, and I love
Flash ... and I think both work well.  I'm trying to make a big PUSH into
the NZ Web Industry to get more people using webstandards, but I find a
large number of designers and clients .. just don't care.

I'm in the middle of updating the course I teach from HTML to XHTML and web
standards so the next generation of designers are at least aware of these
standards.  I also run http://www.kiwi-interactive.com and am promoting the
company as New Zealands' only (okay maybe not only but the FIRST) company to
build web standard compliant sites :)

Anyway I'm rambling ....

K.
