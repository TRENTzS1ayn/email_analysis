Hi All

I'm Peter Raftos, a web developer and trainer at the Australian National 
University in Canberra, Australia.

I have been involved here (in my particular area of the university) in pushing 
for greater awareness of, and compliance with, W3C and associated standards for 
web publishing, including accessibility.

If it's not XHTML+CSS, I am not publishing it...

And now, back to lurking.
