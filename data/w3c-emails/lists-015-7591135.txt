Don't forget to take into account the costs of running the site after 
it's been completed. Things like size of page comparisons (bandwidth 
costs), future updates for new browsers (won't be needed beyond maybe a 
few lines if you've been coding right from the start), ability to serve 
different media from the one site (maintenance only needs to run on the 
one version, instead of having to update multiple versions of the site), 
etc.
