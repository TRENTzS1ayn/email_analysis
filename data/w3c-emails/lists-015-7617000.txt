Hi! I'm bruce Lawson of glasshaus, a UK publishing house going since March
this year.
We write books of interest to web professionals on all range of topics that
present standards, usability and accessibility as an inherent part of web
development (rather than a nice-to-have extra).

I'm brand manager, 35 years old, an ex-kindergarten teacher and prematurely
grey-haired.
