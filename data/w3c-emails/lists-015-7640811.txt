Thanks Chris

I'll digest what you've sent and reply.

What I was looking for was not so much the
definition as the perception of the term 
accessibility amongst those who are not part 
of the loop promoting it - in this case the 
net savvy, a lot of them with their own 
websites and/or involved in the production 
of websites, mostly public sector so come
under any disability discrimination
legislation (the term in use in the U.K.)
If the majority had understood 
the term I wouldn't be bothered, but as only 
a third of respondents mentioned anything to 
do with the term as we understand it, it 
needs explainaing (as you've done) or 
exemplifying in other ways.

Still working on this one.

BTW, the websites to which I referred are 
public sector
