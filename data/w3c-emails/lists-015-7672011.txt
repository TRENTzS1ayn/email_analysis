Hi.

I'm Simon Hill. I'm an addict.

A W3C XHTML/CSS addict that is.

Why W3C?
Because their work is technically superior.

I'm a web-monkey, but I come from a coding background. So I appreciate
well-documented and well thought-out design documents.
I know there are a whole range of other benefits to the work of the W3C,
but that's my main focus.

Me? I'm just a uni student. 3rd year CS geek, with the odd spurt of web
work.

NB: I have a very... uncompromising attitude towards certain mangled
markup, and certain broken user agents.

That is all.
