heya all

i'm tom zito and i'm a developer

i currently work for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
and luckily enjoy a position where we have a mandate to convert our 
current 'official' technical documentation pages to be standards 
compliant and adhere to U.S. section 508 guidelines for accessibility.

so luckily for us the whole cost-benefit question isn't as much of an 
issue.

back to lurking

cheers
tom
