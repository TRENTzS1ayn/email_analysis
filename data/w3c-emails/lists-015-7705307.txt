I've been trying to think about how we could quickly and efficiently come 
up with some figures to use in such a CBA. I don't think it's practical to 
expect a good number of designers to measure their time designing and 
maintaining non-compliant websites and then to compare that with the time 
spent on compliant websites.

But those are the figures we want.

Meanwhile, I've been reading Tufte's first book on information graphics.

While driving to work today, it occured me, we can use his equations for 
"chart junk" (the amount of unnecessary clutter in a graphic) to determine 
actual numeric ratings for "code junk" in a website.

Compliant websites have less code junk, and it would be simple to connect 
the amount of code junk on a page, and the time required to edit, maintain,
  design, or serve that page over a server. And time is money.

Maybe a basic equation like this (and this may be way wrong. I'm just 
brainstorming here, and I have no background in math or statistics):

actual weight of content / mark-up = code junk rating

What do you think? Bad idea? Misapplied? I'm curious for your responses.
