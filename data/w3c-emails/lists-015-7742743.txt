This occurred to me - and to some extent it depends on the kind
of questions one asks. For example, "What proportion of your time per 
week do you spend on (such a such a task)?" is possibly a better
question than "How many hours do you spend ...".

It is easier to get a feel for the subdivisions of time rather than 
exact number of hours.

I do not know if it's reasonable to only target designers.
The cost of a project is spread over more than just designers,
so if there's a project manager, that would be the best person
to be asking these questions (one hopes). 

Thoughts ?

Very interesting idea.  How would you measure/establish the actual weight
of content and the mark-up (hm, what does this mean?)?

If we can assign a code-junk rating to a site, it might be an 
'encouragement' factor for someone to overhaul their site.

Hehe, we still need to know the average time taken to edit/maintain/
design. :) If we have statistics from the metrics I have been proposing,
this should be achievable.

I think you can only calculate an average time to work on a page
for a particular site, because it may depend on what technology
they use, how the site is structured - dynamic content or not? 
existing CMS? and so forth.  I don't know if this is a reasonable 
assumption or not!

I'm very open to ideas. :)
