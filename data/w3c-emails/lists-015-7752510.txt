I am putting together a document to, primarily, show the strengths of 
the standard technologies and the weaknesses of the proprietary 
technologies.  Please review it at 
http://moz.zope.org/Members/brantgurganus2001/standards_evangelism/comparison 
and give me your feedback.  I plan to work on more documents and 
publishing them here as well.
