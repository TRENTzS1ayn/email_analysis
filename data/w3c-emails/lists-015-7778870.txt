I normally don't introduce myself on lists but I've been impressed by
the number of Australians (or at least residents and ex-residents)
introducing themselves that I thought I'd join in. We're going to take
over the brave new standards-compliant Web world ;)

My name is Dean and I'm a standards-a-holic. It's been 3 hours
since I last validated.

I work for the W3C from Canberra, Australia (this makes me the most
remote W3C Team member!).

I'm in the Graphics Activity and am the Team Contact for Scalable
Vector Graphics (SVG). I also am the editor of the SVG
specification. I see a list like this, the WASP and general
web-standards evangelism in general as something that will help
demonstrate the benefits of SVG to the world (over other proprietary,
closed and less accessible formats).

I see a lot of evangelism for XHTML+CSS, but I'd like more for
SVG (I notice the WASP mention SVG in their new charter.. woohoo!).

Likes: pretty pictures on the web, XHTML+CSS

Dislikes: ugly pictures on the web, HTML (it's time to move on 
to XHTML+CSS)
