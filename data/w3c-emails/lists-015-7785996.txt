Hello, My name is John Deighan, and I'm not from Australia.  I've been 
unemployed for the last six months (thank you Osama, thank you Enron, 
thank you WorldCon), but when I *was* working, I was with the web 
services group of a minor telecom company.

My observation:  Web standards (and adherence to same) makes "my" job 
(as a web page creator/maintainer) easier.  However, the main 
"consumers" of these web pages is the marketing department*.  The 
engineers want things to be orderly and logical on "their" web site. 
 The marketeers want to SELL SELL SELL and to make "their" site as 
flashy and sexy as possible: after all, will Joe Average remember you if 
your site looks like everybody else's site?

Web standards don't stand a chance unless we show the marketeers how all 
this makes their job easier as well, and we turn "our" web site and 
"their" web site into a corporate site we can all be happy with.


    Cheers,
    John Deighan

* well, ultimately it's Joe Average out in the great Internet Cloud: and 
if we don't get repeat hits, we gotta scrap the design.  The first 
hurdle a site has to go through in the "real world" is the marketing 
department...
