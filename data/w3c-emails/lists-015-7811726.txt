Since nobody has announced that reading endless introduction is frustrating, 
I'll introduce myself as well.

I'm from Finland (Northern Europe > Scandinavian) an work as a IT Support, 
mostly maintaining server and Intranet, doing (web) applications and user
interfaces. I also study in Business Polytechnic, expertising in programming and
web designing.

Web designing has been part of my life since 1997 and programming since 1995. 
I've been interested following standards only couple of years, yet doing active
research, which has provided me wide knowledge of different techniques.

Besides my studies and part-time work I'm working with different (both client-
and serverside) projects. I'm also a chairman of student's ICT (Information & 
Communication Technology) team in our school (without wage :().

One reason why I got interested following standards, still allowing proprietary
techniques, is when I started moderating in WA Forum (currently 
CodingForums.com), at HTML&CSS section. It's very concerning to see how many
"web designers" has no idea why to follow standards and why to visit at W3C's
page frequently. All our moderators are pressuring a lot that every member
learns to follow standards.

My main "things to do" is to participate writing a book about advanced and
modern web designing..or write a book completely by myself :). I'm also always 
ready in writing guest articles to one's website whenever needed about:
(X)HTML, CSS, client-side scripting / DOM, which are the areas i'm expertized.

Hope we'll have a fruity conversation in future. Pleasant and warm summer to
everyone,

Zvona
