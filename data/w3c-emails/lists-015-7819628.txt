I am just pointing out that what a non-proprietary browser will do. 
 Some browsers might skip the unrecognized element entirely, some might 
render it as if the unknown tags were not there, some might attempt 
emulation which may or may not work.  Basically, what happens cannot be 
predicted.

I meant to add that.  It is there now (locally).  I will wait until I 
get some more feedback if any before uploading again.

There is a hidden advantage that is brought to mind by that.  If a 
browser follows the standard, it *should* render the content of an 
unknown element as if the unknown tags were not present.

I think linking to more in-depth pages for each point is a good idea. 
 Thanks.  If you know of any pages that have content fitting a point, 
let me know.  Some points could probably link to the same page since 
each advantage usually has a disadvantage: Standards are expensive now, 
but they are cheaper in the future.

Thank you for the feedback.  Let me know if you see anything else I 
should add.
