I would suggest that "Support for standard technologies will never end." 
should be qualified, as certainly technology gets left behind all the time, 
whether it be an 8-track tape or a deprecated FONT tag.

Proprietary technology can be more innovative, since proprietary technology 
can be developed faster by its owner than a standard can be invented and 
agreed upon by a standards body.

Standards behavior is not always guaranteed, as the standard can be changed.
