That raises the corresponding point that proprietary technologies tend to be
limited to a particular implementations - layer only worked on Netscape
Navigator, similarly marquee only worked on Internet Explorer. So if a
proprietary product is not hugely successful rather quickly, it doesn't
become adopted by competing or complementary products. document.all is an IE
only device, and although used in a browser with +-90% penetration, still
isn't supported in other browsers, although the non-proprietory
document.getElementById is better supported.
