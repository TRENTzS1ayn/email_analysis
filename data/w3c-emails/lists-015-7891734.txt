Ironic, I find myself doing the reverse: stumping for disabilities accessibility by talking about how great it will be when networked refrigerators can cruise the Web.  Maybe I've got it all backwards!

Seriously, a major hurdle to standards evangelism is the unfortunate residual backlash against disabilities access.  I've seen supposedly enlightened professors in a university setting decry the "extra work" necessary to provide accommodation to students with disabilities.  The notion that accessible websites are "more work" is unfortunately all too pervasive.

A link to share on accessibility: WebAIM ("Web Accessibility in Mind", http://www.webaim.org/).  Their screen reader simulation, http://www.webaim.org/simulations/screenreader/, is an eye-opening look at the (lack of) accessibility of a hypothetical university website.  It's a Shockwave screen reader "emulator" that shows how awful an experience an inaccessible site can be.  Easy to share with the people we preach to.

Cheers,
