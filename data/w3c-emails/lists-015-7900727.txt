This was prompted by 37signals, my favorite web agency, launching a 
XHTML/CSS redesign today.

Why not start a collection of standards-compliant sites? You know, have a 
linkdrop where we post standards-compliant sites and people can go to one 
resource to see working examples of what the evangelists are talking about, 
the way k10k-type portals showcase what's going on in the design community. 
It's one thing to read the tutorials and try stuff out in your own 
backyard, but it's great to see what other people cook up too. I know my 
personal interests lie in finding commercial, non-experimental sites like 
37signals that put their money where their mouth is. The only other company 
like that I've come across was from a Zeldman link a while back, 
http://www.spazowham.com/

Good idea?
