I agree ... and we are starting a links database at www.studiowhiz.com one
of the catagories slated is the XHTML, CSS built sites. I'll let you know
when this goes live

I've also just rebuilt www.kiwi-interactive.com to complete XHTML Strict and
CSS. This little project is my company site. I'm going to use it as a living
example of Standards Based site design. As I learn more, and push my own
boundaries it will change. I've yet to add more graphical designs to this.

The one thing I find...this is me wearing my designer hat for a moment. 99%
of XHTML & CSS driven sites that I 've seen look very similar and have
really lacking imagry.

You mention k10k ... okay I personally think it's icky .. BUT ... look at
the graphically RICH interface there. How on EARTH do you rebuild that AS IT
IS using standards based HTML?  IE: no tables!

I'd love to be able to do this

.contentCELL {
    top-right-corner: 1px curve green;
    top-left-corner: 1px square green;
    border: 1px solid green;
    bottom-left-corner: 1px curve green;
    bottom-right-corner: 1px square green;
}

Or similar to enable more "designy" type interfaces like K10K.  The most
common thing I run into is that XHTML & CSS sites are often boring.

So I'm all for finding really AWESOMELY designed standards based sites, to
show that these too can appeal to designers.

*removing desiner hat*

Thanks
