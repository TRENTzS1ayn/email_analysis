| You mention k10k ... okay I personally think it's icky .. BUT ... look at
| the graphically RICH interface there. How on EARTH do you rebuild that AS IT
| IS using standards based HTML?  IE: no tables!

i don't think it would be too difficult -- the k10k uses
a lot of graphical titles and other text items, which you
can position absolutely on the screen. 

for html-based text, you could use iframe content blocks,
which would allow you to absolutely define both the height
and width of the content area. no worrying about stretchy
content.

and, to support the absolute positioning of all items on
the page, you could launch k10k in a separate browser
window, with the height and width of the window defined.

am pretty sure that they already down browser-sniffing
and css stylesheet swapping for netscape and ie users
to begin with...

who knows... maybe we could get 37 signals to do a
"37betterK10K" site for showcasing this. they just did
a css/xhtml overhaul of their own site.
