The major factor influencing any decision to "use" disability discrimination
legislation to promote web standards is that is the only way that the law
backs you! (if you see what I mean). Invoking regulation is a far more
powerful way of getting people to agree with what you're saying because
it's a sort of gotcha - don't do it and you're in trouble.

There's no such compulsion for adopting Web Standards per se.
