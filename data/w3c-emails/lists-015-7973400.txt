Hey one thing that crossed my mind was this...

Last year I was developing solutions for Rich Media advertising. I was looking
into TopLayer and other things. The thing I ran into time and time again is that
these solutions don't work on Macintosh, and with limited results in anything
OTHER than IE on Windows.

When I querried companies about this they all came back with the same thing

Why should we spend money developing a solution that works on all systems that
costs XXXXX when we can get one that works on 95% (IE users) of web users for
half the price.

Is this the same attitude designers have to web Standards? Why spend extra time
making sure we've all the tweaks, tricks etc built into our sites when we can
build it and know it works in 95% of our visitors.

Pesonally thats 5% I don't want to loose ... but companies I've talked to ..
don't seem to care
