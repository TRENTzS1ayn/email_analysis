  Hey all,

   My name is Rick Smorawski, currently working as a Unix System 
Administrator for an ISP.  I am debating a move to website developement 
area.  I have extensive 'off the record' experience with Perl, PHP, 
html, xhtml and some dhtml via javascript & dom.   Being a close mozilla 
follower for the last 2 years (M8?), as well as an MS hater, I have a 
vested interest in seeing established standards provail over De-Facto 
standards.  I'm am currently working on an XML/XSLT based  content 
management system (for the practice, mostly).

Regards
Rick
