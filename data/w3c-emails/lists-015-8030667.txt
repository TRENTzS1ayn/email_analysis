All,

It's been mentioned here before (in the post titled "fdw:vkit") but for
those of you who aren't already involved, there is a group that has been
formed, that is paralleling a lot of what we are doing here. The group is
called maccaws ("making a commercial case for adopting web standards").
This group is trying to come up with all the logical arguments for "why web
standards" and creating resources (white papers, etc) that explain the
arguments. There is a lot of complimentary overlap being done in terms of
trying to come up with arguments for using standards. 

Although the group started temporarily as a yahoo-egroups
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vkit/), it's just a launching pad. The group
now has a web site www.maccaws.com and a wiki http://www.maccaws.com/wiki/
and plans are to eventually host the mailing list off that site.

You should seriously check it out - I read the fdw:vkit on this list, went
and investigated, and now I'm in both groups.
