  My name is Greg and I work for a pharmaceutical information company in a
department called Change Management. It is my job to approve changes to code
in  production which now includes heavy Web site activity. I have been
writing standards for directory structures, 3rd party software and much
more.... But am desperately seeking other business examples of such
standards. I'm looking to get examples of how other companies deal with the
Development, Integration, User Acceptance then Production life cycle and how
they control, protect and manage code as it moves thru these life cycles
into a true production environment. How do they setup NT platforms to
support multiple web efforts, how do they handle 24/7 availability while
still allowing software upgrades, patches, etc to these platforms.... And
much more. Any direction or info you can provide would be very appreciated -
thanks.
