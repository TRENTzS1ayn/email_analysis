In seeking to modernise my development knowledge, I'll be reading a bunch
of XHTML and CSS books over the summer.  I noticed that a good deal of
these books (like Eric Meyer's impressive "Cascading Style Sheets: The
Definitive Guide") are a few years old, which seems to be at odds with my
efforts to get *really* up to date.

In the past two years, have standards changed in any way as to make some of
these volumes incomplete or obsolete?  At what mean point do standards lose
their timeliness?  For example, a good book on HTML 4.0 is still useful,
but I can't consider it modern or timely.

Lastly, it terms of good general/technical info books for today's XHTML/CSS
standards (and real-world browser environment), do my esteemed colleagues
have any recommendations?

Hopefully,

-Joseph
