Thanks for the tip...  I was already thinking about that one, but had
concerns about the scope of the articles.  If Zeldman learned something, it
must be wide!  I think a visit to Amazon is in order.

I agree, and have found a possible match.  Edited by our fellow list-mate
Molly Holzschlag (hi Molly!), "Usability: The Site Speaks for Itself" is a
real-world exploration of some big name, big audience sites (eBay,
metafilter, BBC News, Economist...).  The usability aspects of each site is
described in detail by the actual developers, so you're learning from the
horse's mouth as it were.

I haven't read it yet (just ordered), but the reviews are universally
five-star.
