Hey Joseph, thanks for the hat tip! :)   ALL: I would like to unabashedly
recommend my own book, Special Edition Using HTML and XHTML.  It came out in
May, from Que.  For some reason, it's NOT getting a lot of attention.  It is
not esoteric, nor is it to beginnerish.  It's geared right at the
professional who is moving toward or working with standards-compliant sites.
Perhaps the title is confusing to some readers, but obviously won't be for
the readers here on this list.

sr_8_3/002-7193928-4777623

I wrote it, with Steve Champeon as Tech Editor.  I had a lot of assistance
from various WaSP members during the process too, and other
standards-oriented people with concern for the future of markup.

If you'd like to review it for publication let me know and I'll see about
getting you a review copy ASAP.
