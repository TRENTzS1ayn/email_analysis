All this book talk--we should start a list of books that people
like/recommend for standards-related topics.

Karl, anyone else--would this be something we can coordinate and place
online on the W3C somewhere, something like "books recommended by interested
parties" -- wouldn't have to be a W3C recommendation per se, but a resource
to external sources that the W3C can provide?
