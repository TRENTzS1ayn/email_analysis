Pardon me, but I'm not sure this is a good idea for the following reasons:
1. It generates yet another list that people may need to monitor and manage.
2. It is "context free" in the sense that it doesn't seem to serve any 
purpose other than bibliographic unless...
3. What does "interested parties" mean? We've recently seen some 
shameless and not so shameless (self) promotion and adulation consuming 
band width on this list; no doubt well deserved, but does it take up any 
less bandwidth on its own list?

Maybe before one runs off "getting organized" there might be a little 
open air to create an opportunity for comment and concensus?

Regards.                 ...edN
