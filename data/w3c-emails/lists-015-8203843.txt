There are many free and open source softwares to create websites, 
only a few of them, respect the basic requirements of Web Standards 
like having a DOCTYPE, having accessibility features, etc.

I think it would be worthwhile to help people to fix this software, 
so to participate to the development or at least to send patch to 
their authors to help them to have better products.

Something like Mark Pilgrim [1] did in his Dive Into Accessibility 
[2] is very useful because for each software, he comes with a 
practical solution to implement in a few weblog products.

What Mark did could be extended to other products like having binding 
to his own 30 days. For example, I want to apply the recipes of Mark 
to the Product AcmeLog, what must I do?

Another thing is to try to push people from the list who have 
technical background to make a report on a particular software and 
help the developper to fix it. Fixing the softwares (and open source 
ones) will help to fix the web.

The owners of the code have all to benefit from that kind of 
participation. The problem is to choose which one to start with. [3]
