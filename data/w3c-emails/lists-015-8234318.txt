Hi there

Some of you may know I run www.studiowhiz.com a online resource site.
One aspect of our site is a forum system, which is growing slowly.

Well I've expanded our forums to include an area for Web Standards, to
help promote and push this important area.

http://www.studiowhiz.com/_boards/  you'll see Web Standards number 3 on
the list.

Please feel free to join and post ... I'm looking for some "moderators"
to help with this area too, if anyone is keen.

Thanks all
