Hello all

I suppose the following announcement could of interest 
to this group, because it's strongly related to the web 
standards and their popularization.

Small group of Czech web designers have just published 
Dogma W4 (W4D) at:

http://www.pixy.cz/dogmaw4/

W4D is a compact set of rules aiming to more accessible and 
more usable web page design. W4D doesn't claim to be the only 
universal method. It's rather a proclamation of its authors' 
belief and opinion -- that's why it's called Dogma. If you find 
it useful, you can adopt them for some or all of your web sites, 
however you can as well reject it as too restrictive and use 
the full range of existing standards instead.

I'll highly appreciate your comments, questions, etc. Also, 
please notice, that authors of the W4D Proclamation are not 
native English speakers, so the language of the document is 
far from perfect. Thus your spelling, grammar and stylistic 
corrections or suggestions are welcome as well.

Thank you,

Marek Prokop
