Hi

We've been asked to give some advice on the issues involved with
having an English language website translated into Mandarin. This of
course is not something we've done before! :)

We're not so much concerned with the translation (as that will be done
by the client) but with the issues involved in marking-up and
displaying the HTML pages.

I'm after advice/tips/places to go for more information etc.

I'm looking at:
http://www.w3.org/International/
and trying to find stuff through Google, but anything else (including
war stories) would be much appreciated!

I'm happy to summarise what I find for the list.

Thanks!
