Wired.com announced 3 days ago that they switched to a fully standard
compliant backbone:
http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,55675,00.html
"Wired News has a different appearance, but the new design isn't just
about look and feel. The site now complies with standards recommended by
the World Wide Web Consortium for greater access to all users."

(this very page has actually a small HTML error, but the second page of
the article is indeed XHTML 1.0 valid and with a lot of CSS - try the
various available style sheets with Mozilla).

Great news :)
