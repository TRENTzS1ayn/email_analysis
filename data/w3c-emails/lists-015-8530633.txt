Strongly disagree here. I do not think that Tag Soup, including use of
Fonts, absolute sizing, improper nesting, Headers for bolding.
blockquoting for indents, and sizing is better than XHTML, even if there
are some minor items needing a change.

Of course we woud need a nice definition of what TAG soup means to apply
reasoning adequately.

On a more general approach, TAG Soup, to me, means excessive extra tags
and no organization, application of tags or elements not in the ways
which were meant.

I see:
< meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"
/ >
and not the other mentioned, unless we are looking at different pages -
this is on the index.html
page that I see this.

Not sure where a problem with this one may be?

|   <!-- BEGIN colMain -->
|   <div id="colM">
|   <div class="content">
|   <div class="storyCap">
|   <div class="pgTitle">
|
| aren't examples for good XHTML either.

Why not on these items?
Choice of words?
Mixed case? [attribution words are not limited to lower case]
Use of class vs ID [re-usable styles for same doc page need class, one
time use per page ID]
or?

Does this page work on Text only or Lynx view and make sense?
Will an HTML doc with Tag Soup, degrade similarly for those cases, and
allow as many user options?

Interesting thoughts you posted, but I would like to hear more about why
or how this XHTML fails and why tag soup would be better?
