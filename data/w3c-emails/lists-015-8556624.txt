Ok. Well I was under some impression that there was php type server side
options or switches, for those without scripting options? But maybe my
impression was false? And if this is the case and it is tied to only DOM
or JavaScript enabled use, perhaps linking to a PHP sheet switch may be
in order... though cookies enabled may also be a factor in having this
apply to each new page load. [In which case it may be better to leave
all these options up to a user and his or her learning how to use their
own tools, devices, or browsers to enhance their web viewing] It would
be optimal if browsers put these option buttons clearly on the main
browsing menu bar as default, and also allow advanced users the option
of customization of same bar if they wish to take it off.

Other than that, the page, if written appropriately, is always resizable
via browser options, and there are many ways that a user can define or
set their own style sheets to replace any sheet on a web site, or use an
Opera browser to switch them off or another on, resize text more
quickly.

Personally, the text sizing feature is just an added extra service and
not mandated nor required on any site to display. More or less this item
or option is a short cut to options already included inside a user's
browser, already, and may in fact be rather limiting in size range as it
works now.

Personally, though nice, I think the range is geared and offered to a
rather average using group, and not as much towards all accessibility
users. Those users are more likely to have a battery of tools or options
to use, including knowledge on how to increase their text for their own
viewing after using the web enough.

Though it is nice to offer added extra help in these ways, it is not
really our option to train or teach users how to use their computers or
devices? is it? If we feel or wish to help or give some hand in that,
this is an extra plus on the choice of the designer, though not
necessary.

In no way am I stating or saying that we should not make web sites
accessible or available to user options.

Do we now need to supply various browser use information and options
with all web sites? How to use your browser to optimally view a web
site?

holly.
