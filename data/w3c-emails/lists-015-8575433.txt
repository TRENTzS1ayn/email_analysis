I didn't say that. I noted that this page uses XHTML which is not
well-formed. Strictly speaking, this is not XHTML at all. When delivered
with a MIME type such as "application/xhtml+xml", XHTML user agent won't
render it but give you an error message.

This is worse than tag soup because HTML user agents have learned to deal
with invalid HTML.

Of course that's what I'm referring to. This kind of character encoding
declaration *is* unsufficent in XHTML, see
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#C_9>.

It doesn't work unless you enable JavaScript. Anyway, changing font sizes
can be easily performed within the user agent.

They tried to separate content from style. The only child of the <div
id="colM"> element is the <div class="content"> element. So this element is
obviously superfluous and serves no function of the contents.

In <http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2002/wired-interview/>, Douglas
Bowman states that he wrote "nested tables 10 levels deep". Well, he's going
to make the same mistake again, this time with div's instead of tables.

  <div class="buffer"></div>

and

  <div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>

are other examples for markup without any meaning.

No. Did *you* try it? The "Skip directly to ... Content" link doesn't work,
and all these navigation and search bars at the top of the page really don't
make sense.

I don't see any advantages at all.
