Staying positive and learn from the past mistakes is always more constructive.

Wired has switched. I will say bravo even if it's not perfect. But 
more, what we can try to find is why they failed on certain points, 
as how we can understand why they have chosen this more than that.

This story gives a good opportunity to write a better tutorial and to 
improve explanation for people that will wish to do the same. People 
may even want to work with Douglas Bowman to improve Wired XHTML 
move, version 2.0.

We all learn of others mistakes, so we have to be indulgent and 
helped them when it's necessary and try to make it better at each 
version. Nobody's perfect but the openess will help up to achieve 
quality.

As Olivier will say "STEP BY STEP" and I might keep the role of the 
"STRICT GUY" ;)

So look, identify, learn, and improve your methods, this is the keys.
