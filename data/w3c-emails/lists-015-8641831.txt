You're missing an important point in the note.  The note clearly states 
that if the HTML Compatibility Guidelines of the XHTML 1.0 spec are met, 
then XHTML 1.0 may be served as text/html:
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/NOTE-xhtml-media-types-20020801/#text-html>

It only later says that if you are serving XHTML 1.0 to "XHTML user 
agents", then it should be served as applicatoin/xhtml+xml:
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/NOTE-xhtml-media-types-20020801/#application-xhtml-xml>

Clearly the vast majority of user agents out there being catered to are not 
XHTML ones.  They're HTML ones.
