vspace and hspace were not allowed in HTML 4.0 Strict either, only in HTML 4.0 
Transitional.

That certain old elements or attributes from HTML 4.0 are not included in XHTML 1.0 
Strict is irrelevant; a valid XHTML 1.0 Strict document can still be compatible with HTML 
4.0.

If the note says "XHTML 1.0", it obviously refers to all three variants.

XHTML 1.0 Strict is not, but an XHTML 1.0 Strict _document_ can be.

And that is what makes XHTML 1.1 incompatible with HTML 4.0. For certain functionality, 
such as named anchors, you must add the name attribute to be HTML 4 compatible. You could 
do that in XHTML 1.0 Strict, but not in XHTML 1.1.
