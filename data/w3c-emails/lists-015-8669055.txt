Hello,

Using XHTML don't guarantee me being a competent designer, but personally I've
been using XHTML 1.1 DTD[1] for some time. There has been no problems with older
browsers, excluding thead-tfoot-tbody -structure. Last weekend I had to make
one compromise using "border" attribute for an anchored image to prevent it
being bordered with NN4.x. As we know, CSS's border property don't render 
properly in NN4.x


When one should re-write a HTML 4.01 -document straight to valid XHTML, there
may appear some problems. For instance, CSS is treated partly differently[2] 
with XHTML DTD, and "converting" element's attributes to CSS can also bring 
problems.

If people keep waiting and asking "Has the time come for ...", nothing actually
evolves. Start using XHTML when you think it'd be appropriate - not when someone
tells you to do so.

Best Regards,
Samuli Hakoniemi

    depending on DTD.
