Thanks Karl,

I was reading this article[book excerpt] at Digital Web this morning and
thought it was great and had good examples. I wonder if others even know
that their extensive work arounds are starting to break in newer
browsers?

[looking forward to seeing the published book]

In reading the article, down towards the bottom is the short quoted
phrase...

_Write once, publish everywhere,_
