Holly,

There is curriculum being developed in a variety of ways.  The World
Organization of Webmasters (WOW) has actually been very active in
educational pursuits and has certification programs mapped to university and
college programs.  It is a very rigorous program and there are numerous
advisory members collaborating with instructional design experts to come up
with really strong models and tests.

Also, Macromedia has created a Digital Design: Foundations of Web Design
course that also maps to WOW curriculum and will likely be used in a wide
range of institutions.  I haven't reviewed it yet but it's here on my desk
and I'm optimistic that some important standards issues will be discussed
there.

The WOW site is going to be completely redesigned in the next few months to
be up to snuff standards-wise, which they aren't now.  They have made a
formal commitment to supporting standards in all of their educational
initiatives and I'm very pleased to see this happen.  Their web site will
certainly be a great place for this kind of thing to occur, since they
really are the leaders in providing formal education initiatives to unis and
colleges at this time.

If you're interested in hearing more about any of this, check me off-list.

--Molly
