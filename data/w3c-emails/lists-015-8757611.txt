It's an interesting indicator that I hope Marko will run as often as 
possible. I know that he will do it every 6 months.

The home page validation is an indicator but a loosely one, because 
imagine members start to worry about the validity of their home page, 
they will achieve a better press coverage... but it will not mean 
that the rest of the Web site is valid or all Web sites that a 
compagny has in charge.

For example, it would be good to define a relative scale of validity 
for a whole website.

proportion of
valid pages
-----------------------------
<50%  BAD
50%-70%  you're on the good way
70%-90%   good
90%-100%  Great!!! you have a valid website.

After the same time we "evangelize" for validity, we have also to 
evangelize for the correct semantic use of tags and the accessibility.

for example
You can make a valid document, which is completely incorrect for the 
semantic, like using a "blockquote" element to indent un text and not 
for a citation.

So we have work.

PS: When I come back from holidays, I will update the document 
Web-Quality with ideas that have been sent.
If people feel that I have missed bits, examples, or they would like 
to see more things in it. Please send your comments here.
