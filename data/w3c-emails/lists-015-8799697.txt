There's more than that, there are requirements in the W3C 
specifications which can not be defined with a DTD. So can make a 
three level rocket ;)

1. Validity with regards to the DTD
Automatic process if the validator checks everything and does 
not contains errors.

2. Conformance with regards to the specifications.
For example, the stylesheet language when you are not using a 
style element or/and an external style sheet.
See http://www.la-grange.net/2002/04/03-styleatt-wo-meta.html

3. Respect of the semantic as you said in your mail.


On top of that we can add the respect of the semantics. :)

I think the respect of the Semantic will be the most difficult to 
achieve even if it's the easiest to achieve and understand.
