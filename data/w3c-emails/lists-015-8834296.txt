   Other sites may tell a different story:

    In the group to which I belong at Netscape, where we're involved 
in standards support, we recommend that site authors who need object 
detection do the following:

    if (document.getElementById)
       doStuffThatWillWorkInW3CCompliantBrowsers;
    else if (document.all)
       doStuffTailoredForIE4.x;
    else if (document.layers)
       doStuffTailoredForNN4.x;
    else
       warningMessageAboutLostFunctionality;

...or something like that.  The point it that we tell them to detect 
for the W3C DOM detection first, because more browsers support it. 
Then the fallbacks come.  This assumes that they feel a need to even 
have the fallbacks, which most commercial site developers do.  It's a 
small performance win in standards-compliant browsers, too, since the 
first test is to recognize them.  You can shortcut the rest of the 
testing branches that way.  In some cases that can actually have a 
perceivable effect on performance.

    See for example the rather lengthy discussion contained in 
<http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=154589>.

    Indeed so.
