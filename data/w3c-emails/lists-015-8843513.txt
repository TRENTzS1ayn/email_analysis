Hi, Public Evangelist readers.

Here is some information on a Workshop extension that might appeal to 
you. You can follow up with the NIST organizer with any questions. 
Thanks for your consideration.

The Call for Papers for the W3C/NIST Usability Workshop has been
extended to 30 September 2002.

There are three aspects that the workshop will consider:
         1) the usability of W3C specifications
         2) how they affect usability of software based on them, and
         3) how to improve the overall usability of the Web.

You can learn more from the Workshop Homepage at:

For questions, please contact Sharon Laskowski, NIST, at

Best regards,

Janet
