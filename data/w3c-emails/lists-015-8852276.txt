Hi,

a few corrections, minor updates to the article Web-Quality
http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/Web-Quality


I would like to add two points, but I need your help.

* "Major companies have invalid websites. They don't care about 
standards, why I should care?"

* "I'm working in the real world, I'm doing business with real 
clients and they don't care about standards, they want something that 
works."


Please reply to the list.
