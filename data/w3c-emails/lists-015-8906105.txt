If you are going to provide instructions, as you do in regard to the 
points/inches box example, they should be comprehensive enough to work 
properly, on all platforms if possible or, alternatively, to alert 
readers to the unavailability of the feature.

For example, on my W2K system with my combination of graphics card and 
monitor installed, I find neither the option tabs you mention nor a 
"virtual ruler" with which to make adjustments or comparisons.

Finally, you might want to enhance the message by including some 
scripting that provides sniffing/feedback to the reader about the type 
and version of browser they are using, lists more egregious 
limitations/bugs, and provides links to upgrades.

Otherwise, it's a good message even if I were to have aesthetic quibbles 
with a very busy page design. Just because something *can* be done 
doesn't always mean is *should* be done.

Congrats and good luck.              ...edN
