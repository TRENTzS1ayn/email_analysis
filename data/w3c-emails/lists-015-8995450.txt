I didn't say they should not be simple enough to be read by hobbyists,
just that specs were not aimed at them but at implementors and
"translators" (book and tutorial authors are translators from spec-lang
to real-world language, IMHO). I believe we agree on this point, don't
we?

Good point, but my main argument remains valid : once people are aware
of a problem, it's useless to complain about them, especially since (at
W3C) there is plenty of room for people to help/participate in a
constrictive manner, through public comments list, through the QAIG,
etc.
 
Cheers, olivier.
