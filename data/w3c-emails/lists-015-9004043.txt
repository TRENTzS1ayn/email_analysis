There was a similar situation in England in the 19th Century. GWR used 
wider tracks than the other three main railway companies. In London, where 
all the networks met, they needed to use track with three rails so that 
both widths of cars could fit on them. I've been looking for a picture of 
this on the Internet, but couldn't find one.

A more up to date example would be Betamax verses VHS. By going for 
propriety standards rather than vendor neutral standards the video industry 
was divided.

Neither of those are quite the same as the situation wrt web standards, but 
there are parallels.
