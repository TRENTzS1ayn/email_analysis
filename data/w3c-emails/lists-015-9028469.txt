IANAL, but wouldn't it be a copyright law violation to recreate (copy
and publish with modifications) a site without permission? To do a
decent job (in many aspects), you would need to use same images, same
text, same presentation style, which would require copying of
copyrighted things. Some say caching violates copyright law; the
activity being discussed is probably "worse" than caching from a legal
point of view.

As a workaround, you could start with high-profile "open source
friendly" sites like sourceforge.net or oreilly.com.
