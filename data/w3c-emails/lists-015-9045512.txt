Hi there

I was just reading over an article called "The Web's Future"
( http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-xhtml/?n-wa-9192 )

This is kinda interesting BUT I've some questions

There is the thought of replacing the <br /> tag with 
<line>content</line> which to me makes NO sense at all. For one it 
bloats your files, and if I wanted to wrap things I'd do it with a P 
tag or a SPAN style

And what's this rumor about removing the <img /> tag? With an object 
tag... hmm what about ALT tags and such like for accessability?

I do like the new HREF becoming part of the common attrributes .. but 
again what about accessability on these?

Anyone care to clear up some of these ... I know it's still a rough 
working draft ... but some of it sounds cool, some of it leaves me 
wondering :)

K.
