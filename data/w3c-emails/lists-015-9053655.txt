br is supposed to be presentational whereas line isn't.. i don't really 
care either way, personally.

Firstly, they're alt attributes not tags. Secondly, object is *more* 
accessible. the alt attribute was whacked on at the last minute to add 
acessibility, whereas object is designed for it. If a user agent doesn't 
support the content-type of the object, then it falls back by parsing 
it's children instead. Thus you can have multiple nested objects, and 
your alt text is replaced by what is inside the object tags. Thus you 
can also tags for its 'alternative' text, as well as all the other 
things that tag contents can do which attributes can't.
