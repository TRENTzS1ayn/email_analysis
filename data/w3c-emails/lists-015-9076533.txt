And 4. `Ownership' of the code. I wouldn't mind contributing to, say, 
Dmoz.org[1] for free, but I wouldn't want to spend several tens (or 
hundreds) of hours on a commercial website without some benefit to me. This 
is obviously even more complex when you think about a group effort.

As an initial site, it might be interesting to build a (X)HTML (4.01|1) 
Strict directory using the Dmoz.org RDF dump. Anyone any experience of 
using Dmoz.org RDF data? Using Dmoz data would cover 3, and possibly 1.

/me toddles off to cpan.org
