I think the amount of time is very much dependant on how the site is 
generated, and how much of the site needs fixed. A dynamically generated 
site can be very easy to fix, or an absolute nightmare, depending on the 
underlying programming.

I recently fixed up a small site, entirely static HTML, for one of our 
clients. The markup was completely unstructured and it took me the best 
part of a working week to get it to the stage where CSS could be applied 
with consistency.

Were you thinking of individual page fixes or whole site corrections?

Don't worry, I wasn't being completely mercenary :-). I live an annoyingly 
busy life at the moment, and whereas I would be happy to work on projects 
for the good of the Internet as a whole, I am reluctant to spend a lot of 
time fixing a commercial website for free. A few hours per week on 
commercial websites would be OK.
