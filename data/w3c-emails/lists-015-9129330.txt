You might be familiar with RichInStyle.com's Test Suite?
http://www.richinstyle.com/test/
Generated from a database of 2000 tests with results submission and 
automatic reporting on bugs, etc.

They also have a Bug Table generated from the results, which will show you 
just how buggy your browser really is:

Should be everything you're looking for.
Go Moz !  :)
