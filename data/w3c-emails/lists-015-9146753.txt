My concern with IE and other browser like it is that it "fixes" problems
with code so that Web developers and users never know if there is a
potentially serious problem with a page such as a missing tag or botched
code on a secured page that would make the page unsecure.  The last browser
to require Web developers to code page correctly was Netscape Communicator
4.79.  I still use this browser and, because of it I am able to launch top
quality Websites.  I also find a lot of poorly coded Websites, many of them
high-profile, corporate Websites!  The frequency of discovery is increasing!
