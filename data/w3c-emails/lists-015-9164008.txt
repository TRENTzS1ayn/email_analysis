It shouldn't always be the job of the browser to validate. What do
you suggest MS do? Make IE chuck an error if it finds an invalid tag?
Make thousands of websites instantly stop working and annoy users?

No.  I expect Web developers to do shoddy work and get away with it.  That
way, if I enter my credit card number on a less-than-secure page on, say
Amazon.com, the entire world will have it.

Well then, define correct HTML for me.

Pending your response, I view my pages in Netscape (and IE) to see how the
browser will render them.  Netscape is honest enough to "tell" me when a
table or paragraph tag is missing.  It doesn't try to do my thinking for me.
Browser standards should require correct coding not gloss over sub-quality
work.

Er... lucky you. Or something.

Maybe it isn't in fact they're being marked-up worse, more than
they're moving to standards, and don't work in your broken and
outdated browser?

I have a Pentium-1 computer that works just fine, except for the computer
industry's planned obsolesence, which renders a perfectly good computer
useless.  Outdated is a relative, and in the computer industry,
predetermined term.  Likewise, Netscape 4.79 works quite well.  However,
because Microsoft has the computer industry by the prverbial floppy disks,
the "standardars" are leaning in its direction.  Consequently, everthing
that is contrary to the proclaimations of Bill Gates (who legally should be
in jail) is considered broken and outdated.
