http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/ - Tada!

Although, NS4 and IE/win's HTML4 support is comparable - the support
for other technologies such as CSS is what really matters.

NS6+, Mozilla and other Gecko-powered browsers can often be *much*
stricter in parsing HTML too. In fact, if you use XHTML and serve it
with a correct MIME type like application/xhtml+xml, then one unclosed
tag and the page won't render at all.

But they will still attempt to parse and render "tag soup" pages -
they have to, or nobody would even consider using them.

Netscape 4 is an outdated, old, obsolete, stoneage, broken,
non-standard, and generally buggered-up browser. Do the Web a favour
and upgrade to a modern, standards-compliant browser. Or even
downgrade! At least NS3 didn't attempt to parse CSS and then fail
dreadfully.

And just a quick question: why on earth are you on this list when you
use NS4?
