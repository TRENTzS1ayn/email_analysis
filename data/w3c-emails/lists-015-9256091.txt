I concur.  However, I believe that the problem browser was Netscape 4.76 not
4.79.  In any case, hopefully, Mozilla will be aggressive in hawking its
browser as a viable alternative to IE.  For that matter, maybe the Linux and
Unix communittees will get their acts together and launch a decent offense
against Microsoft and present a higher quality standard for the entire Web
industry.  I just felt like saying that.
