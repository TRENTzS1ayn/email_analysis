Hello Sandra and everyone else,

as far as I know, everyone of us are after standards. Everybody has 
much to
learn, but also much to share. Thus, existence of this list can be 
considered
very practical.

I know you feel offended due to many comments posted last few days. 
However,
there are many point of views and one never can assume his/her own 
opinion
is the "absolute truth".

It's no use to have hostile environment on this list and I'll believe 
there's
nothing personal in the air. Personally, I hope you stay with us and 
help
building Web to be better place both for designers and users.

Regards,
Zvona
