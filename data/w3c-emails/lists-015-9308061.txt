I believe this should be a very rare thing to do, people are coming for
your content - ie we trust you on information about the band, whilst we
know we can trust you for browser evangelism, encouraging the general
site author to do the same is unconstructive.

In which case you SHOULD NOT be sending it as text/html and Netscape 4
will not be even trying to render the document so NN4's handling is
pretty irrelevant, or if you are sending it as text/html, then can I
evangelise the use of W3's recommendations and recommend you use the
correct mime-type. (or a correct version of HTML for text/html.)

Please do not mis-use javascript in this manner.

Jim.
