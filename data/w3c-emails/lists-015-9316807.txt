Agreed, now if every Web site builder and browser maker would understand 
  this. But that is why this list and other organizations promoting Web 
Standards are here for.

I also agree, although testing with links and/or lynx does not give 
complete accuracy of how a screen reader or other agents perform it is a 
good test, and sometimes I do use lynx quite a bit myself.

Web site builders and browser makers are the ones that need the most 
convincing. Average users for the most part do not really care. It's 
like the long time Linux users vs Windows users. Linux users say "It 
should be done this way." Windows users say "Why? It works fine this 
way." Linux "But it's wrong." Windows "oh well, it works for me." and 
round and round.

Although there is probably a better solution. I still use the 
display:none and have a small note that says "This site may be viewed in 
any browser or Internet device, but looks best in one that complies with 
   Web Standards." With a link to the Web Standards Project, in hopes 
that some user or author may click on through and get an understanding 
of what Web Standards are.
