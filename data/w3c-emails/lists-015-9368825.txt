Surely this depends on the level of standards that you are working to?
Once you move away from transitional 4.01 and 4.01 strict and xhtml, css
isn't a nice to have, it's essential.  I'm guessing that most people on
this list are trying to push for:

A: standards in general (in the main)
B: a move away from html and into xhtml

Yes, you can have a perfectly valid page with loads of depreciated
elements and the like using an HTML transitional DTD, but once you start
getting into XHTML the validity is gone.
