I feel now is a good time to remind everyone what the scope of this 
list is:

[[
[ excerpt from http://www.w3.org/QA/IG/#list-evangelist ]
This mailing-list is :
* A place to discuss about web standards Education and Outreach with 
web standards evangelists, authors of books, articles or other 
resources on web standards.
* A neutral ground for communication, coordination, and 
cross-pollinisation between groups involved in web-standards Education 
and Outreach.
* A forum to improve the quality of web-standards related books, 
publications, lectures and training courses. 
]]

I would like to stress out the fact that "*discussion* and 
*coordination* about web standards education and outreach" is quite 
different from "*arguing* about web standards, about compliance of 
vendor X, etc".

I believe that slightly off-topics messages can lead to interesting and 
productive results if people participate with basic netiquette and list 
scope in mind. Reviewing or asking for opinions on a resource may be a 
little off-topic (unless it is your resource, then it fits), but if it 
is made in a constructive way (sharing good resources, useful 
criticism, discussing and building counter-arguments or corrections...) 
it is very welcome on the public-evangelist mailing-list. However, 
"rants", "raw" criticism, aggressive messages towards other posters, 
etc. should be avoided here, as well as in any other W3C mailing-list.

This place is a wonderful forum for an important task, let's keep it 
this way, shall we?


Yours sincerely, olivier.
