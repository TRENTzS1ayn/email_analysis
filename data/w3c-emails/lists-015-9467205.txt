Hi,

A new beta release of a tool helping people to improve the validity 
of their website (or any kind of criterias).


Log Validator is a web server log analysis tool which finds the N 
most popular documents matching a particular criteria. Thanks to its 
modular design the criteria can be whatever one chooses, however the 
Log Validator has been first written with Validation (HTML, CSS, 
etc.) It can thus help web content managers find and fix the most 
important invalid documents on a Web site.

Log Validator - http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools/LogValidator/
Validate your site step by step - http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/09/Step-by-step


The Log Validator is Free and Open Source, anyone is more than 
welcome to use it, modify it, or develop modules for it.
