Anyone know of any good bloggers that rant about W3C Standards, hopefully 
something positive?

I read Kurt Cagle's stuff (not really a blog) - http://www.kurtcagle.net and 
a lot fo the MS .Net bloggers, but I was looking for some other view points. 
  I have my own - www.dotnetweblogs.com/donxml , but I'm looking to cross 
link my .Net stuff with some W3C stuff.

It would be great to get people like Chris Lilley, Dean Jackson, Liam Quin, 
Michael Kay and Dan Connolly starting blogging, and help spread the word.

Always listen to experts. They'll tell you what can't be done, and why. Then 
do it.
