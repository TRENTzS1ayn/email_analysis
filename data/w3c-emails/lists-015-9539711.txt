Thanks to everyone for their input.  I knew there were folks out there, but 
couldn't find them, and knew this was the place to ask.  A writer in Silcon 
Valley calls blogging  a secret society, and sometimes it does feel that 
way.  But once you get plugged in, it is anything but secret.

And yes I know that my blog site does not validate.  It is written in 
ASP.Net, and that is one of the biggest compliants, you can't produce valid 
XHTML easily.  There is a core group of .Net developers trying to work on MS 
to make it easier to produce valid XHTML, but I'm looking for more fuel to 
add to the fire, and these blogs should help.  The problem with ASP.Net is 
that they wanted it to render in almost any downlevel browser (like Netscape 
3), so they sacrificed sticking to known standards.

Plus, the site I'm using is hosted (for free) by someone else.  I'm working 
with others on an open source blogging system written in .Net, and that one 
I'm doing my best to make sure it validates.

Always listen to experts. They'll tell you what can't be done, and why. Then 
do it.
