Err, I'm not sure you are interested, but for the bloggers among the 
list, I just started to use B2 (GPL, available for free from 
http://cafelog.com ), which produces valid XHTML 1.0 transitional 
content out of the "box".

I've installed it in 10 minutes on a very cheap hosting service ($15 per 
year), http://apinc.org

It's quite interesting. Having something similar in the .Net world is 
indeed a good thing.
