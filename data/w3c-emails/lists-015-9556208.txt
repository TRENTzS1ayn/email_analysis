You can, from what I've seen (although I'm not an ASP.NET developer,
I've only played with it for a bit). You just have to keep clear of
the Web controls, which nobody forces you to use.

ASP.NET can be used just like ASP3, without the server-side controls
stuff. Some people say that's a fundamental part of it, but you can
still make working pages without it.

Or you can always re-write the controls to produce valid HTML, or
write your own ones from scratch.

Heh, MS have repeatedly stated that everything ASP.NET generates is
XHTML-compatible, clearly they think adding a forward-slash to the end
of every empty element is enough.

The problem is, they didn't even manage to stay compatible with IE6 -
if you disable scripting, that is. JavaScript pseudo-protocol links
pop up everywhere with ASP.NET (for instance, see the download links
on <http://asp.net/ibuyspy/download.aspx>).

I think ASP.NET should be viewed as a major target for evangelists,
there are more and more broken and invalid ASP.NET sites popping up
every day. It's easy development, at the cost of compliance and
accessibility.
