The quality of the translation depends on the content and on the
quality of the the original article. If the article is well-written,
uncomplicated and gramatically correct (with no spelling mistakes), you 
can get a very reasonable translation. :) If the content is more poetic, 
utilises slang and cultural/language specific quips, then the translator 
will only be able to translate these literally, hence the original 
meaning might not come through very clearly.
