Huamn translation is probably best. When I was young, I learned
Bastillian based spanish: read, write, speak ... Though like any other
country and language there are variations for different regions or
groups. Some of those nuances get lost in the translation and can make
for some odd differences.

I suspect, for the most part, many of us that speak a few languages
realize this and allow for some differences. Sometimes, the automated
translations can be funny, or challenging to understand. Though most
times it is not too difficult.

p.s. you have a great site... I enjoy reading it.
