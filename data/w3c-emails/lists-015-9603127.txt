I've taken the liberty of culling from the lists of weblogs, magazines 
and community servers posted today. You can find it here: 
http://www.lynnparkplace.org/vot/archives/accessibility/000015.html.

It's a rough job of cut and paste further chewed via Textile. I've tried 
to clean up spelling problems, etc. and I've tried to add some value by 
going to each of the sites and getting an impression of what it's about. 
However, I admit I may have resorted to "easy humour" on occasion as I 
got punchier and punchier with the work. For that I apologize.

However, the comments about legibility come from a boomer, 
post-fifty-type guy with tri-focals whose eyes have seen many glories, 
but are getting dimmer with age. You might take that to heart in 
particular with respect to the more pastel of the text-color choices. 
Neutral and desaturated text is also a major chore.

If you find errors, dead links, etc. OR if you have additional (high 
quality with sustained content please) links, please forward them or put 
them up on the list. In addition, the HTML (or Textile formatted) source 
can be got for the price of an email request to yours truly.
