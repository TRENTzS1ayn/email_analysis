Wow, great initiative! This is a wonderful idea :)

We should definitely try to make it as complete as possible, for everybody's
references :)

However right off the bat two things should be clarified :

Tristan Nitot - the webblog
URL should be pointing to new address : http://www.standblog.com/ , not old

Eric Daspet - looks like a project journal about the [re]design of the blog
site.
This is more like a Weblog on technologies and opinions. While it is
focussing on it's redesign at the moment, it is much more than that :)
