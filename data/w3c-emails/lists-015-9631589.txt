This is a great start, but what I was eventually going to suggest is an 
aggregator site (preferably on the W3C site since that is who benefits from 
it).  For the .Net world we have sites like 
http://activehead.com/dotnetweblogs/ which is a great place to start if you 
want to hook into the .Net bloggers.  I was envisioning something similar 
for W3C standards stuff.  The problem with this approach is that not 
everyone has RSS feeds, and then people tend to mix topics in their blogs.  
What some of the .Net guys are working on getting people to use the category 
support in RSS 2.0.  This way aggregator sites can pull in only the blog 
entries that are relevant to them.  Mix all those blog entries with the W3C 
RSS feed, and you?ve got a great standards evangelist site.

Always listen to experts. They'll tell you what can't be done, and why. Then 
do it.

I've taken the liberty of culling from the lists of weblogs, magazines and 
community servers posted today. You can find it here: 
http://www.lynnparkplace.org/vot/archives/accessibility/000015.html.

It's a rough job of cut and paste further chewed via Textile. I've tried to 
clean up spelling problems, etc. and I've tried to add some value by going 
to each of the sites and getting an impression of what it's about. However, 
I admit I may have resorted to "easy humour" on occasion as I got punchier 
and punchier with the work. For that I apologize.

However, the comments about legibility come from a boomer, post-fifty-type 
guy with tri-focals whose eyes have seen many glories, but are getting 
dimmer with age. You might take that to heart in particular with respect to 
the more pastel of the text-color choices. Neutral and desaturated text is 
also a major chore.

If you find errors, dead links, etc. OR if you have additional (high quality 
with sustained content please) links, please forward them or put them up on 
the list. In addition, the HTML (or Textile formatted) source can be got for 
the price of an email request to yours truly.
