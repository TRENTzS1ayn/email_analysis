Ok. Thanks for the mail, the comments and the trackbacks. I've 
incorporated comments and suggestions and updated the post. I think I've 
done justice to everyone's input; if not, let me know.

And...

Yes, it occurred to me that I was working "fast", but not particularly 
"smart". I didn't mean to get in your way, Don. Apologies.

I wonder if this great aggregator idea doesn't need a bit more lead-time 
and planning? For example, what I've posted is really not as "pure" on 
the subject of standards as it could be; there is a mix of the personal, 
the mundane, sometimes the bizarre and also the standards related. If 
there were an aggregator, you'd like to have only the standards and/or 
accessibility topics getting pinged through. That kind of leaves it up 
to the individual blogger to organize the site in a compatible fashion. 
Not impossible, but in need of some discussion. Have no idea how close 
to this we might be right now.

W3C *is* the logical place to put the aggregator and if someone can push 
some buttons to get that working, that makes a lot of sense. 
Alternatively, there might be other venues. For example, the Internet 
Topic Exchange (http://topicexchange.com/) is already up and running and 
seems to be a self-administered utility. This might be worth a look. It 
might happen more quickly and it might get more spread given it's a link 
exchange venue that attracts diffuse interests.

What do you think Don?

Cheers. ...edN
