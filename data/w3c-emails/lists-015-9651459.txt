Ed,

Your not getting in my way, whatever is best for us.  I'm just throwing 
around some ideas.

And yes, letting individuals make the decsion on what category an entry 
relates to will not always work, but it is the best way for now.  What the 
DotNetWeblogs do is to self administer.  Anyone that starts to cross link 
just to get readers are warned, and ifit continues, eventually dropped form 
the site.  It is easier to say, than to do, but you got to eliminate the 
"static", otherwise you'll get too much static, and people stop reading.

Always listen to experts. They'll tell you what can't be done, and why. Then 
do it.
