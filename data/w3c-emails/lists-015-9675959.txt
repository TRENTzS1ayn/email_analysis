Kynn,

Thanks. I've looked and it looks great (it took a long time to load for 
me for some reason?). I'll do another edit to include your site sometime 
late in the weekend, after I've picked up more one's and two's.

The news aggregator is interesting too. Do you maintain it yourself? by 
hand? What's involved in making it a user subscribable, self-managing 
thingy?

We're kind of becalmed here with respect to the aggregator idea; I guess 
someone is going to have to "do" something. My problem is I don't have a 
good idea what, if anything, folks want to do. For example, should we 
wait for input from the list moderator about the feasibility of doing it 
on W3C facilities? Or just go ahead and do something else? If so, what?

My preference would be to get some feedback from the QA/IG side or at 
least wait until the silence becomes deafening..

Thoughts?                                     ...edN
