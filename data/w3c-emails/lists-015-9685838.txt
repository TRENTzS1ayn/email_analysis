I'm just reading this post on Seb's Open Research. It's called "The 
dynamics of ridiculously easy group-forming" and it talks around what 
we're thinking about with the standards aggregator idea. He's a big fan 
of  Internet Topic Exchange (http://topicexchange.com/), probably 
because it's the first implementation of the idea. Take a look and see 
if anything clicks.

Here's the link: http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/2003/04/25.html#a928

Cheers.                        ...edN
