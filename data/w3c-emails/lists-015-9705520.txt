Hi Ed,
This is great. Let me compare your list to one I have in html and see if
there are a few you did not list. Looks like most of the standards,
guidelines, and accessibility blogs are present, though I think I missed
seeing a few. Will get back to you tomorrow on this, and if I forget,
email me a nice note.

I need to make a collection of these for another purpose or two. So we
are going to be able to attack two situations with one task.  [smile]

Thanks,
holly
