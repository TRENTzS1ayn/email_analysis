Greetings,
[ Please follow-up to www-qa@w3.org. thank you. ]

As you probably know, the QA IG does not have any specific deliverable.
However, the discussion among participants can (and often do) trigger 
the creation of new resources for the QA Library.
   <http://www.w3.org/QA/Library>

Given the success of recent contributions and the increasing demand for 
such a resource, QA chairs and Team have developed the following guide 
for contributing new material to the QA Interest Group.
   <http://www.w3.org/QA/2003/06/Contrib>


Please note that direct contribution of material to the IG is there to 
ease the creation of useful resources on the W3C QA Web space but 
should not replace the usual discussion/idea/production way.

Feedback on these guidelines are, of course, welcome, and we expect the 
guidelines to evolve after some time of use "in the real world".

Regards,
