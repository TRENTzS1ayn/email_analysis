Hi,

In March 2003, we have tried to start to collect information[1] for a 
Note that would be the companion of CHIPS[2] and CUAP[3].

Unfortunately, we don't think there's enough material to create such a 
document. A few issues arise when we start to collect a few guidelines 
for such a document.

What's an authoring tool: Wysiwyg? plain text? Script generating 
pages? libraries? Converter?
Once you have addressed the fact to produce valid content. What are 
the other issues?
Should we recommend scenarios when they are not defined in the 
specifications?
Which technologies?

All these issues are complex and sometimes do not have a single answer. 
I would encourage people to review W3C specifications and question the 
editorial part.
- old specs: What's missing?
- new specs: Should we ask for more details on the editing techniques 
part?

So except if there's an important number of contribution, We decided to 
not create such a document.
