The CSS working group published updated documentation for the CSS test
suites, including instructions for people who want to contribute and
authoring guidelines based on experience with existing tests.

    http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/testsuitedocumentation.html
    http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/guidelines.html

(The previous version is also still available.)

One of the main goals of the documentation is to make it easy for
people to write test cases. The format is meant to be suitable for
writing tests "by hand" and for generating them automatically. We hope
people will adopt the format and send us their tests.

Another goal is to make it easy to reuse tests and to separate the
tests from the harness that is provided for navigating them. E.g., the
tests for a specification can be used also for a "profile" of that
specification, because they are only included by reference. In most
environments, in particular in modern desktop browsers, this inclusion
by reference is transparent to the user.

For now, reactions and tests are best sent to www-style@w3.org. We may
open a dedicated mailing list later for people involved in CSS
testing.
