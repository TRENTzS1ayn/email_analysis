Hello,

    I meant to give this list a heads-up that Netscape DevEdge 
(http://devedge.netscape.com/) has been redesigned with valid HTML 
and CSS for layout, and no tables used for layout, but I forgot to do 
it until just now.  From the newsletter we sent to everyone 
subscribed to our outreach list:

    Now DevEdge is not only a great source of tools and information for
    developers, it demonstrates extensive use of web standards for
    accessibility, maintainability, and user interaction. When navigating
    DevEdge, you will find features such as customizable themes, default
    print style sheets and an accessibility-oriented interface. The site
    framework is now HTML-tableless, uses advanced CSS and it's optimized
    for standards-compliant web browsers.

You can read more about it, and find links to articles that explore 
our CSS and JavaScript efforts for the new design, at
<http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2003/devedge-redesign/>.
    Note that you may find a few places online where people have said 
the site doesn't validate.  At the moment they wrote those comments, 
they were correct: I made some really dumb mistakes that didn't get 
caught before launch, and for its first 22 hours the new markup was 
invalid.  Those errors have been corrected, and the majority of the 
site now validates.  There may be places where legacy content 
prevents validation, but the common code that all pages share is 
clean.
    Any feedback should be sent to the DevEdge team (which includes 
me) via the contact form at 
<http://devedge.netscape.com/community/feedback/>.  If we get a lot 
of the same comments or questions we'll create an FAQ about the 
design and publish it on DevEdge.
    Apologies to those of you on the list who will be seeing this for 
the third or fourth time.
