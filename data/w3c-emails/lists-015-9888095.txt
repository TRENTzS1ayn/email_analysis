Does the W3C take an official stance on Browser standards?
Netscape 4x browsers specifically?
Is there any documentation about this specific Browser?
If so is it posted on W3C.org?

I see that W3C has shown many things that need to be in place to show that
it's w3c compliant...but I can't find an actual stance on Browsers
themselves. I am specifically trying to find something that states that
Netscape id NOT supported by W3C.

I got your email off this page:

Thanks so much!
