I don't think this is valid, either, which is why I'm tying Standards to 
Accessibility, because that can have the force of the law behind it.

Teach it right from the outset and then you don't have to get them to 
unlearn, but also teach the retrofit of sites that are non-compliant. Not 
that it's impossible to make sites accessible with non-standard code - its 
just a whole load more difficult. If they want to switch off and not do it 
the correct way, then they will have to remember who's marking the exams.

And the even lazier way is to make another all enveloping CSS bag whihc can 
contain multiple XHTML content documents - but the CSS can apply to more 
than one XHTML content document, so look and feel is easier if you want to 
change it.

I will try this. The Russian Doll concept of XHTML - hmmmmm!

Thanks
