Suggestions for points to address in the guidelines on Ojects, Images, and
Applets:
  a.. How an object (such as an applet) should determine it's runtime
locale. In many (most?) cases, it makes sense to rely on the default/system
locale. Are there cases where that's not appropriate?
  b.. Are there any known issues with mixing charsets (parent charset !=
child charset) when embedding HTML objects?
