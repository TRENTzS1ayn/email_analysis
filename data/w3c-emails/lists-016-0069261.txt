kiosks, internet cafes, anyplace where someone can use an "open" machine
or a machine that is not their personal machine, has the potential to be
the wrong locale.

(Separate from the guidelines discussion:
There should be a way for a user to set their user agent locale
independent of O/S etc.
Perhaps in a style sheet? Then they can override it the same way they
might override accessibility settings.
