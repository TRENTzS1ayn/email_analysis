Chaps,

I thought it would be useful to make a very rough and ready attack at
the table of contents we might expect to see for our techniques
document(s).  I think it will be useful to help us attack from the top
down as well as the bottom up.  It will also serve as a roadmap, for us
to measure progress. I'll transfer this to an HTML document when I get a
moment, and we can regularly update it to show our current thinking.  To
make my life easier, I assumed that the audience was 'authors' in the
HTML spec sense.


One issue I'm throwing around in my head is whether or not we should
have separate HTML and CSS docs.  Someone writing HTML docs might
appreciate a fairly tight coupling of the two.  Of course, CSS is not
only used for HTML, so it makes sense to keep things separate too, I
guess.  Perhaps the knowledge should reside in two separate documents,
but we could have an 'overlay' as a navigation aid that unifies the two
in the case of HTML - and perhaps others would unify CSS with other
things like XML or XSL.

Here are two separate toc's.  They are intended to serve only as a stake
in the ground.
