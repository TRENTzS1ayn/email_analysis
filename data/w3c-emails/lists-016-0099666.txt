For what is the locale relevant? In general, it might be better
to say that applet,... writers should not depend on locale-sensitive
behavior.

There may be, in particular for data passed from the parent document
to the child applet. Ideally, such data would be passed in the platform-
wide Unicode-based encoding, but it's probably not specified anywhere.

It would be good to set up some actual examples and see if they work.
