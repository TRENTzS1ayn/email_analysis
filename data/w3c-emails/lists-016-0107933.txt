Yes. Kiosk machines usually come with various language buttons
on the first screen. Their built-in browsers should do the right
thing when a language is selected. For internet cafes, libraries,
and so on, it might be a good idea to create a startup page with
a few scripts that can set the configuration (don't know if that's
possible, will try to check, may depend on browser).

What do you mean by 'user agent locale'? Is that the language
of the menu items and error messages, or anything else?
