Today's key discussion points
======================


Meetings
=========
Action Item: Richard will update web pages with new teleconference time.
Request from WAI for meeting at Tech Plenary
Decision: Yes, we will meet with WAI at Tech Plenary in March.
Send in your registrations for the Tech Plenary
Action Item: All: register for Tech Plenary:
Registration:
http://cgi.w3.org/Register/selectUser.pl?_w3c_meetingName=TPMar03 
Information: http://www.w3.org/2002/10/allgroupoverview.html. 
Guidelines: Review of work done and next steps

Richard's ideas for moving forward:
============================
Richard put together a draft TOC, to start a top down approach and serve
as a roadmap of sorts.
Use WAI TOC as a starting point 
Start writing up what we have using WAI's format for Techiques to help
concretise our thoughts about content and format.
Experiment with creating overlays: Something like Richard's expanding /
drill-down documents. Organize a set of information in multiple ways for
multiple audiences and link into the techniques document for detail.
Overlays are like a 'skin' and provide a user interface to the available
data.  One overlay could group HTML and CSS information together (while
pointing to separate documents).  Another could group WAI and I18N info
together.

Discussion
=========
Possible approaches:
Automated: Database of pieces of information, accessed by queries which
included just what applied to a given audience. May result in duplicated
information. Or XML file with XSLT to access the right information. 
Hand-crafted ("pedestrian") route: Flags in the document indicating what
audience it's appropriate for. 
We can start w/ WAI's style for the Techniques document and build on top
of that. 
Decision: We'll start using the hand-crafted approach (not the automated
approach).
Action Item: Richard will start organizing what we've generated so far
using the WCAG techniques document format, so we can play with it and
assess whether or not it's meeting our needs. Richard may also produce
an overlay for it. WCAG headings model HTML spec headings. Overlay would
provide a different view.
Decision: We agreed to start by concentrating on a single audience: HTML
authors.
Action Item: All: Look at Richard's TOC and send in comments.
Decision: CSS / HTML: Single document or separate documents? We agreed
they should be separate with an overlay to merge them together.


Next meeting:
==========
Same time, same bridge, next week.
