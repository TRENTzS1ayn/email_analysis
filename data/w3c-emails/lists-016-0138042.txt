Chaps,

I've been busy over the weekend and today creating an initial dtd (based
on xmlspec) for the HTML techniques, creating an xml file of our latest
content, and developing an xslt stylesheet & css to publish to xhtml.
Here is the result: http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/  (add
html-tech.html for the xml file).

The final shape of the data will evolve as we go forward, but this is a
good start.  I will also try to develop an example of an overlay to help
our discussions.  

Now we need to develop more content to fill the gaps...

Cheers,
RI
