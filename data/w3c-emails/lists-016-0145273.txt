I will attend the WAI techniques telecon tomorrow morning (please could
someone remind me of the time) and try to share some ideas I have wrt
i18n guidelines.  In preparation, Wendy has asked me to send out this
information.

You can find a new version containing a little more resource pointers at
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/

The xml version of that is:

Btw, I have been asked by Wendy to attend the WAI techniques telecon
tomorrow morning and try to share some ideas I have wrt i18n guidelines.
They are hoping to produce a dtd for their techniques quite soon and
would like my input.
