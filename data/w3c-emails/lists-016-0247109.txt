Short summary:

Friday
- discussed dates for F2F at CSUN.  wendy sent options to the list for
voting.
- discussed conformance logos and gregg's proposal re: conformance to
1.0 
and 2.0.  gregg and jason took action items to propose text for
inclusion 
in conformance section.

Summary of action Items and resolutions
- resolution: checkpoint text (2.1): Ensure that all of the
functionality 
is operable, at a minimum, through the keyboard or other character input

device. word success criterion accordingly (will say basically the same 
thing but in success criterion language)

other guidelines.
- action editors: take use of word content to xtech (for glossary
discussion)

interpretation of comments from aaron and WWAAC folks)

testable"

"knowledgeable human evaluators"
- resolution (reqs for techs): incorporate these resolutions, publish

move 
forward.

for 
different votes and ask people to vote.
