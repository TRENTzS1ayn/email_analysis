This E-mail is to fill one of my action items from last weeks (16-Jan-2003) teleconference.

Here is a list of 10 rules to follow to allow HTML pages to change their layouts automatically depending on what language is being displayed.

Rule 1: Never Use Absolute Positions
Rule 2: Dialog Boxes Should Use the Available Width and Height
Rule 3: Each Control Should Be in a Separate Cell
Rule 4: Allow Wrapping Text
Rule 5: Separate Check Boxes and Radio Buttons from Labels
Rule 6: Leave Room for Growth and Avoid Fixed-Width Items
Rule 7: Methods for Sizing Buttons, List Boxes, and Group Boxes
Rule 8: When to Set Height
Rule 9: Do Not Use Left or Right Align
Rule 10: Avoid Inline CSS With Values that International Needs to Change

To read more about this in detail you can visit our Microsoft on this issue at:

Also, this is located, along with demo files, on the companion CD to Developing International Software -- 2nd.
