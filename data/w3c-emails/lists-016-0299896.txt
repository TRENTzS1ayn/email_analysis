Tex,

Thanks for the feedback.  In response to your statements, yes we do need to discuss these techniques. It was not my intention for these to be accept as is, but for them to be used as a starting point.

Not sure if this is Microsoft specific, but by doing this, the checkboxes, etc. are automatically placed on the right of the text when you change the direction of the page's text flow from ltr to rtl.

Sounds like this would be a good research project.

Looking to talking with you all this afternoon.

Regards, Russ

The recommendations need some discussion. I thought the list was good but then reading the article raised some questions for me. Perhaps it needs a detailed review.

1) Wasn't Terry Farrell the actress that played Jadzia Dax on Star Trek? Can we trust a Trill? ;-) (Sorry I couldn't let it pass.)

2) The argument for putting controls in a separate cell- is that Microsoft specific ? (points 3 and 5)

3) I agree with not using absolutes. But I notice the new recommendations (not these that Russ offered, but others) for table-less web pages and using DIVs instead, seem to make heavy use of specific pixel values or sizes to accomplish their goals. I find it very anti-i18n and anti-accessibility. I also find it very hard to do simple things, like put an image next to centered text. (I don't understand why CSS has left, right and no center, except on a background.) There are many web pages sprouting up telling people how to use the new technique. Perhaps we need to tell people how to work with DIVs in an i18n friendly way (if its possible).
