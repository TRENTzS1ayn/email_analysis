Steve, 

Martin currently has an action to work on 13.4  (He put his hand up for
that last week.)  Why don't you contact him and see how you could work
together?

Cheers!
RI

Subject: Sections to work on


In the document "Techniques for XHTML & HTML Authoring 1.0"
(http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/), here are some sections
I'd be interested in working on:
    
    13.4 (Forms: character sets, encodings)
    Anything in section 3 (character sets, encoding, entities)
    Anything in section 10 (Objects)
