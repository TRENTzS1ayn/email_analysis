thanks. Good point about bidi. If we use tables, bidi is taken into
account.
If we use a series of divs, bidi is not addressed automatically is it?
(I need to research.)

By microsoft-specific I was referring to the wrapping issue, where it
wraps under the control.

Yes, I know you weren't offering the page as a fait accompli and
intended it for discussion. I didn't mean to imply otherwise. Talk to
you in a bit.

But I notice the new recommendations (not these that Russ offered, but others) for table-less web pages and using DIVs instead, seem to make heavy use of specific pixel values or sizes to accomplish their goals. I find it very anti-i18n and anti-accessibility. I also find it very hard to do simple things, like put an image next to centered text. (I don't understand why CSS has left, right and no center, except on a background.) There are many web pages sprouting up telling people how to use the new technique. Perhaps we need to tell people how to work with DIVs in an i18n friendly way (if its possible).
