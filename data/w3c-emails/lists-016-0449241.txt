Richard, etc.:

I?m trying to figure out how to generate our contributions to the techniques
document in a way that minimizes re-work for the editor:

1. Using software I already own, I can generate HTML using CSS. How painful
would it be to take that and incorporate it into the techniques document?
(If I can avoid spending money on new software right now, I?d like to, but I
want to make sure such stinginess wouldn?t cause pain later.)

2. Would it make sense to share a common CSS? If so, does one exist, or
should I create one?

Thanks,
Steve
