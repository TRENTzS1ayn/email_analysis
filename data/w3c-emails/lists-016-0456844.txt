Hi Steve,
 
Thanks for raising this.  I've been thinking a little about this, but
hadn't had time to send something out yet.  I'll try to put some
suggestions together right now and send them out this evening or
tommorrow.
 
Cheers,
RI

Richard, etc.:
 
I'm trying to figure out how to generate our contributions to the
techniques document in a way that minimizes re-work for the editor:
 
1. Using software I already own, I can generate HTML using CSS. How
painful would it be to take that and incorporate it into the techniques
document? (If I can avoid spending money on new software right now, I'd
like to, but I want to make sure such stinginess wouldn't cause pain
later.)
 
2. Would it make sense to share a common CSS? If so, does one exist, or
should I create one?
 
Thanks,
Steve
