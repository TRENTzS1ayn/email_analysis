Looking at the toc and topics, it seems to be a mix of tasks and
elements orientation.

I wonder if we shouldn't break into two different types of sections.
links, tables, lists, graphical buttons are perhaps elements and a
discussion of how to best utilize and manipulate or configure them.

I think the following are tasks:
Navigation,
page layout (divs vs. tables), maybe that's a part of navigation? needs
to be added to the toc
Culturally correct input


Task is a mix of authoring and end-user considerations.
E.G., how to author a page that allows the user to perform some task, in
a culturally correct fashion

A more concrete example might be-
Elements section might address how to design a checkbox so it works
bidi.
Task might take into account which situations a check box would be
culturally acceptable.

(Check boxes are not good on printed forms because some cultures check
the box that doesn't apply, rather than the one that does apply.)

Also, I might categorize or organize the references into specifications,
vs. explanatory (reference) material vs tutorial (how do I) material.
I think it helps people to distinguish the academic from the 'what is
it" from the "how do I" docs.
