i was thinking of jotting down some notes on the following areas, and 
then seeing what i could add to other sections.

3 Character sets, character encodings and entities
4 Specifying the language of content
5 Text direction
6.4 Ruby
7 Lists
8 Tables
     8.1 Mirroring tables in bidirectional text
15 Writing source text


also under navigation would it be useful to discuss navigation in a bidi 
context?
