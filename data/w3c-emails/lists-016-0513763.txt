I put up a placeholder at:

http://www.i18nguy.com/markup/i18n-glossary.html

If someone can tell me the japanese characters for mojibake, I'll test
that the page is served properly as unicode.

feel free to suggest terms to add.

The page format itself was copied from one of my other pages as quick
and dirty, and probably will undergo some other changes and start to
look like a w3c page, at least with respect to the front matter.

But it will take time which I dont have much of at the moment.
