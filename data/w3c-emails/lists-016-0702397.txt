Phil,

Many thanks for doing this !  Its quite depressing, but good to know.  I
am copying to the rest of the group, as this is valuable information.

I noticed a couple of additional things over and above what you said.
Let me try to summarise all below:

General
-several shots include an unusually small aleph - this may due to
the font
-pretty much all Mac browsers tested struggled to display 
...<p><img align="right".../></p></div> without
the graphic being displayed below the bottom of 
the div --- I changed the code to hopefully avoid
this by using ...<p dir="rtl"><img ../></p></div>
instead

Safari
-seems to support Arabic well, and does exhibit the expected 
behaviour wrt spacing before </span>, but...
-doesn't mirror parens !

Mac Mozilla
-seems to support Arabic ok, but...
-does weird things with spaces - they are very wide
-extraneous space introduced in last test ie. 
aaaaaa (     W3C) aaaaaa
-doesn't exhibit expected behaviour wrt space before </span>

Mac NN6
-doesn't support Unicode characters....
-doesn't recognise Unicode characters - all displayed as ?
(does, however, right align <p dir="rtl">)
-*very* weird handling of last test, ie. (aaaaaW3Caaaaa)
rather than aaaaa (W3C) aaaaaa

Mac IE
-doesn't support Arabic display...
-displays Latin1 characters rather than arabic
-doesn't even right align <p dir="rtl">


As time goes on I'm thinking more and more that it would be good to
develop tests for each technique that we could run on a variety of
browsers to check applicability, and link to these tests from the
techniques themselves.  I believe WCAG is doing the same thing.

I guess we should also begin opening channels with the various browser
development teams.

Cheers,
RI
