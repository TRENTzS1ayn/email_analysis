Below, CAPITALS represent hebrew characters and lowercase represents
latin1 characters, as per the UNICODE convention, and [LRE], [RLE], and
[PDF] represent the relevant bidi characters (U+202A to U+202C). The
latter are equivalent to using markup with "dir" attributes or the
'direction' property in CSS. The numbers underneath represent the
embedding levels.

   english [RTL] HEBREW [PDF] english
   11111111     22222222     11111111

...vs:

   english HEBREW english
   1111111122222211111111

Both are given in a context with a block 'direction' of 'ltr'.

The former would render as:

   english  WERBEHenglish
   1111111122222221111111

...while the latter would render as:

   english WERBEH english
   1111111122222211111111

The CSS directions are equivalent to explicit UNICODE bidi formatting
characters (U+202A to U+202E). See the bidi algorithm for more details on
how direction-neutral characters inherit their direction from the
surrounding characters:

I don't understand what this means.
