Richard, the css spec is the CSS 2.1 draft pointed to from our Q&A:
http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/css2-src/text.html#q8

Ian, thanks but I understand the bidi algorithm, my question was really about
CSS. How do I use the natural directionality of the text, when inserting any
html or xhtml element applies a direction of ltr, rtl, or one inherited from
its parent? (Which is what the CSS 2.1 spec suggested be done...)

I guess I am suggesting there should be a way to set the element to use the
direction of the text, perhaps by adding a direction of none.

The alternative I guess, and maybe what the spec is suggesting, is to know the
direction of the characters and only apply elements that have the same
direction as the text. What a silly and tremendous burden to have insert
elements only because the underlying text is changing script.

To answer your last question, the information in the CSS 2.1 draft spec is
incorrect if the element has unicode-bidi:embed set, the levels are different.
The space will not travel to the front of the B. Therefore the spec should say
that the description is accurate only if unicode-bidi:normal, the same way it
points out white-space:normal must be set.
