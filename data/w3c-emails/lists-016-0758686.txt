If the directionality of an element is the same as its parent, then
nothing happens wrt bidi. Setting directionality in CSS is exactly
equivalent to using LRO, RLO, LRE, RLE, and PDF, depending on the values
of unicode-bidi and direction.

Could you show an example where you think the current spec doesn't work?

Oh, right, I see. Yes, good point. I'll bring that up in the WG. Thanks.
