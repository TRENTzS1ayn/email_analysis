It appears I misunderstood the CSS spec, my bad. The spec already says
what you want. The 'direction' property on inline elements has no effect
unless 'unicode-bidi' is set to 'embed' (for LRE/RLE) or 'bidi-override'
(for LRO/RLO). On block-level elements it sets the paragraph
directionality as per the bidi algorithm.

In fact, no, the 'unicode-bidi' property has to be set to 'embed' for the
example to be correct. (Which is actually what it says, although not
explicitly, by saying "where the <ltr> element represents a left-to-right
embedding and the <rtl> element represents a right-to-left embedding").
