Folks,

Please take a look at the prospective Q&A at
http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-css-markup.html and
send in any comments you have.  This is not currently scheduled for
release.  It's just something I came up with while working through ideas
for my Unicode talk and the guidelines.

Cheers,
RI
