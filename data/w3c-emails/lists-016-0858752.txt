The script is Syriac, but I suspect that you wouldn't call the language 
Syriac. You'd have Assyrian, Neo-Aramaic and probbaly a few others.

Is it worth noting that some languages can be written with more than one 
script, eg Malay, Swahili, Hausa, Berber languages, Kurdish (Sorani), 
etc. just pulling out a couple form your list?

Although of those, Kurdish is the onlyy one that is commonly found in 
multiple scripts.
