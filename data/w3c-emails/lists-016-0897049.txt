I think Yiddish is a good example, but it wouldn't hurt to have one
or two more examples. That will help to: 1) Get somewhat of a balance
with Hebrew and Arabic. 2) show that this is more comment than one
might think 3) show that that can happen in different ways (e.g.
in the Yiddish case, Hebrew seems to be the main script, with Latin
as an alternative, and without much chance over time). In the
case of Aserbaijanian, it's different in that there have been
strong changes over time, and now it's mainly an issue of which
country you are in. Not that we have to explain all this, but
it may help readers to remember or discover this diversity.


Regards,     Martin.
