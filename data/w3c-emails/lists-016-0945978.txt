only - if processing is needed we should add an agenda item - although
of course clarification questions are allowed.]

list of UAs to track 



Update on framework activity

Last chance Q&A Review
****Richard's contribution: aiming for immediate publication
Likely to be edited slightly before today's telecon

http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-css-markup.html




Next week's Q&A Review
****Lloyd's contribution
URL: tba


Discussion:
****is there an issue with Mac browsers and utf-8?
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-geo/2003Jul/0002.html

****should we be concerned with distinguishing behaviour for 
[1] DOCTYPE related 'standards mode', 'almost standards mode'
and 'quirks mode'
[2] XHTML served as text/html or app/xml or app/xhtml+xml

****should we send the xml declaration with XHTML files?  It
apparently knocks IE6 out of standards mode.



Other Q&A review
****Tex's proposal: what is bidi and which langs?
