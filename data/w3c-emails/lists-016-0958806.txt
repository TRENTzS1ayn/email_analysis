Over the past few weeks the GEO Task Force has been producing questions
and answers relating to the international use of W3C technologies.

We try to publish a new question each week and announce it at
http://www.w3.org/International/

We recently decided that we ought to also announce new questions to this
list.  This is the first such announcement.  You can find all the
questions and answers, plus information about how to contribute, at
http://www.w3.org/International/questions.html

We hope you find this a useful resource.

Best regards,
Richard
