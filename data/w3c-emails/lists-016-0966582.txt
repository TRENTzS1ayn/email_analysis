Hi Steven, 

Following our discussion last Friday I proposed to amend the Q&A at
http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-css-markup.html by
inserting a second para in the section Answer -> XHTML/HTML that reads
as follows:

======================
(There is an exception to this rule. If the XHTML is served as
<code>application/xhtml+xml</code>, rather than <code>text/html</code>
it is treated by the user agent as XML rather than HTML, and so needs
CSS to map the markup to the appropriate display behaviour, as described
in '<a href="#xml">General XML-based markup languages</a>' above.)

 ======================

Some questions were raised about its validity in our GEO telecon. Would
you mind casting an eye over this para and letting us know whether it
looks correct / adequate to you?

Thanks!

RI
