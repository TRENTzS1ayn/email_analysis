Hello Steven,

To be more specific, I was (maybe among others) raising questions,
and in particular:

- Does an XHTML document served as application/xhtml+xml mean
   that I always need a stylesheet, for every aspect of styling?
- Are user agents accepting XHTML served as application/xhtml+xml
   not supposed to have a default styles sheet for XHTML? Are they
   not allowed to have a default stylesheet for XHTML? Do they in
   practice not have a default stylesheet for XHTML?

The assumption is that if there is a default stylesheet, and if
the user agent supports bidirectionality, then the default stylesheet
will contain the necessary rules for mapping bidi XHTML attributes
(and elements) to display behavior (or the user agent will in any
way act as if it contained these rules in its default stylesheet.

Regards,    Martin.
