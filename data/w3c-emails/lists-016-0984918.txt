minor points:

the title on this page should be corrected:
http://www.w3.org/International/questions.html

Also, instead of the heading "Questions and Answers"
we should use something more pertinent and specific, like:

Web Internationalization Questions and Answers
or
Web Internationalization Q & A
or
W3C GEO Web Internationalization Q & A


to help search engines properly categorize the page and to suggest to others
linking to the page that they title the link
appropriately and similarly.

I think of the 3, I prefer the last, so the "GEO"starts to carry some weight
and be associated with quality information that people can use to search for.
