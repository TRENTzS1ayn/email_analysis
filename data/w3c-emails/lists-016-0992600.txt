Hi,

1) The first para in the answer is ambiguous or misleading. If it is not
carefully read, and if the remainder is not read or thought not to apply as it
has separate headings, it seems to say that neither css or markup should be
used, and it might be thought that unicode directional control characters
should be used. This is of course wrong.

The first sentence should be the answer to the question, that markup should be
used. After that, it should be clarified that only the markup that is needed
should be used, that unicode controls should not be used, and the info on css
provided.

2) the css table entry for ltr direction says it sets RTL base direction. It
should say LTR.

3) the unicode-bidi property has a value of normal, which should be added.

more later.
