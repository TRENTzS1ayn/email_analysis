Dear task force,

Here is a very small idea that I came up with.

Given the current not-really-perfect state of SOAP with regards
to the language of fault messages, it may make sense to add the
following 'best practice' Usage Scenario, or to add this to an
already existing Usage Scenario.

Because SOAP now can send fault messages as alternatives,
it may be a good idea to have a best practice to always
send back one 'international English' alternative. This
increases interoperability because wherever on the world
the fault is received, there is some chance to find a
specialist who understands the fault message.
'International' English refers to the fact that the message
is worded in general and simple English and tagged as 'en'
(not 'en-..').

The only exception may be very, very resource-constrained
systems.

Regards,    Martin.
