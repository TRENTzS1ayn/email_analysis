I would have to agree with the idea as the practically best way
of doing things.  To be PC (not personal computer but politically correct),
I would carefully phrase this best practice, however, such as:
Always include the message in the language that has
the best chance the majority of the clients of this Web Service
can manage to understand, and tag the message
correctly with xml:lang attribute.  For the Web Services
that target the world-wide audiences, International English 
would probably the best choice, and it should be
identified with xml:lang="en", as opposed to en-US or en-GB.

By the way, is there a good reference to International English?
I have heard of this name many times but I have not seen a book
or web site that describes what it really is.   Is it based on
British spelling or American spelling?  (Can't be both, can it?)
