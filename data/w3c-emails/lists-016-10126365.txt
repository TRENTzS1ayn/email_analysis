REMINDER: the next scheduled teleconference for the WSTF is tomorrow. If you have not used the W3C teleconference bridge previously, please review the links above for instructions (it's very easy).

SUMMARY: This is an important meeting. We'll be reviewing activities related to people's positions regarding locales and language negotiation. Deb and I have both sent positions to the list. Please review these, as they'll be the main topic. If you intend to send something for consideration, you should do it quickly.

I have reserved 9 total slots on the bridge. Since we've picked up in attendence, I'm keeping the number steady for now.

Agenda 
=============================
           o Discuss Agenda.
           o Discuss Action Items.
           o Discuss next FTF meeting. Tentatively at IUC23 in Prague.
           o Activity to take on locales and languages.

Pending Action Items
====================
1. Martin: will follow up with Russ Rolfe in case MS has any space in Prague for an FTF. This is a low priority item.
2. Team: write up and send to list a "position" on the locale problem (See notes below for what that means). Due prior to next meeting.
3. Deb: send specific comments on WSUS to list.
4. Addison: post tentative calendar of activities for year.
