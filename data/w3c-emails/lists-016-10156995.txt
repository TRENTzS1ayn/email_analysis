Hi Richard,

One of the items we discussed in today's WSTF teleconference was the 
possibility of needing to adjust our charter as a task force to include 
the development of a locale tagging standard ("recommendation" in 
W3C-ese). This might also include locale "context management" for Web 
services, although we feel at this time that context management will 
likely be standardized by the WSDL WG, WS-Choreography-WG, or externally 
by WS-I. In any case, we are now working on the requirements document 
for locale negotiation, with hopes of having an early draft in the next 
two weeks and possibly publishing that draft in the next month.

One of the possibilities is that these recommendations will result in a 
specific proposal or competing set of proposals for locale "tags". Our 
charter as a TF currently only extends to developing requirements and 
not to developing a recommendation ourselves. This adjustment will 
require, I'm given to understand, a trip back to the AC group for some 
charter tinkering or it may be undertaken by another I18N-WG TF, such as 
Core, or another WG. In any case, I'm writing to inform you of this 
not-yet-ripe, but distinctly possible turn of events.

I'll keep you up to date as our work matures. Please advise about any 
information you might need as we progress.

Addison
