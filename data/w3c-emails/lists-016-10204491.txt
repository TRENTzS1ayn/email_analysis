All:

I have just posted to the website a very early draft of our requirements 
document. As we discussed, much of the text in it is recycled from my 
ULocales papers and from the email threads we've had in the last few 
weeks. It is rather too long and the requirements section includes a 
lengthy block of text that does not belong there that I hadn't decided 
what to do with yet.

What this document really needs now is:

1. It needs links to our other documents, notably the Usage Scenarios, 
WS-Arch docs, and cetera.
2. It needs more requirements. Try to phrase your suggestions in a 
generic way (don't specify the solution, specify which usage scenario(s) 
you are addressing and what the requirement is).
3. It needs some text about contexts and policies. I meant to go back to 
my email and Deb's on the topic and integrate that here, but haven't had 
time. Deb, maybe you can suggest some things (we really also need some 
usage scenarios that highlight the need for contexts, such as Tex's 
contribution today, but one each, perhaps, for "runAsServer", 
"runAsClient" and so forth).
4. It needs rather LESS text in general. Suggestions for tightening the 
prose up!!

The document is here:

Please review this draft and send suggestions and comments to the list. 
Although I'm the author of the text, I'm not married to it or any of the 
assumptions that it makes if you can suggest an alternative.

I'm giving this over to our editor, Kentaroh Noji-san, for incorporation 
of edits.

Best Regards,

Addison
