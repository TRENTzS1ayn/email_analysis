I was just reading through the document and had some comments:

<citation>
Service "A" is defined on Provider "A". A fault is generated during invocation that returns a faultReason that includes locale affected values.

  a.. "The date provided, 12 November 2201, was too late."

  b.. "The argument 12345.678 was too large."

  c.. "The argument 12345,678- was too small."

How does the provider perform the substitutions?

</citation>

I'll include a bit of a document here that we could discuss:

In general, error messages should be resolved as close to the user as possible. Why do we make that claim? An error might be generated in the bowels of a server module somewhere, where the end-user's language or other information about the user is not known. If the error text is composed at that point, it may be very difficult to eventually display it to the user in the user's language.

In the globalization architecture, the error is recorded at the error site with as much information as possible, in as language-neutral a format as possible. The actual production of the error text is delayed until enough information about the user (such as the user's language) is known, so that a correct translated error string can be looked up. For example, the error might record an error key, a date, and a quantity. At the point in the error processing where the user's language is known, the error key is used to look up localized error text. The variable information is inserted in the text in the appropriate place (this place must be localizable!) and is eventually presented to the user.

Example: In Java this could look like:

// at the error site

throw MyProgramException("Missing Records", new Date(), recordCount);

// at the UI

...catch (MyProgramException exception) {

    String message = userResources.getString(exception.getMessage());

    String resolvedMessage = MessageFormat.format(message, exception.getArguments());

    visibleErrorField.setText(resolvedMessage);

}

The resolution of error messages need not take place on the client side. For example, a Web server can have the user's locale information at a high level and also have locale-specific error text. The resolution can take place in the server, resulting in the correct text in the Web page served to the end user. This also requires there to be some client-state information that the server can access, through an EJB or other mechanism.

An advantage of this approach is that the very same error message can be formatted for different users in their own languages. It is in line with the principle of exchanging language-neutral data where possible, and formatting for the user as high in the process as feasible.

This has a bearing on the notion of locale that has been discussed on this list, as well.
