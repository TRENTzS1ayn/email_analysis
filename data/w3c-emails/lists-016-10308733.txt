Hi Mark,

There is a certain amount of elision in the notes, I'm afraid.

Basically, the discussion revolved around the problem of passing locales 
to a WS: when should the WS designer need to deal with it (by specifying 
the locale in the parameter list of the actual service or in the Message 
definition in the WSDL) and when not.

Passing a locale explicitly is, as you note, a good idea when the locale 
has a natural or reasonable place in the "service contract". But it is a 
poor choice when the service isn't necessarily locale affected ("add two 
integer values"). Many if not most services fall into this latter 
category, IMO.

That isn't to say that there are no cases for passing a locale.

If one does a careful job of designing the data structures and service 
contract, generally one does not want a locale. You may need explicit 
facets of a locale (a language for natural language processing, a 
currency, a country code, etc. etc.), but not that many data structures 
  need an explicit locale, even as an override value.

There are lots of counter examples.

So that note should say something more like:

If you are making a WS out of an existing method or function call, it 
shouldn't be necessary to pass said method a locale unless the design of 
the method (e.g. the parameter list) really calls for it.

A lot more discussion (much of it off list, alas) goes with that, all of 
which fell under the rubric of "agreed about the nature of passing etc..."

Sorry the notes make this difficult to follow.
