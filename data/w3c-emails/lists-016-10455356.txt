By the bare word "locale", people can mean *many* different things, as you
did so in your two recent messages. I think part of the problem is that we
have to be a bit more precise in our language (myself included).

Someone could mean by "locale" any of the following:

1. "locale conventions" - a set of conventions for doing something (scope*
unclear, but usually includes sorting order; breaks ("character", word,
line, sentence); formatting dates, times, numbers, currency; etc.)
*open issue: how far does this go? religious preference, aisle vs window,
kosher vs vegetarian??
http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/locale/locale_data_markup.htm
l

2. "locale domain" - set of people that commonly (though not always*) use
the same locale conventions
*example: I use mostly US conventions, but use 2003-02-21 date format on my
computer

3. "locale data" - a set of data supporting operations in #2
(e.g. "January")

4. "application locale data" - a set of data used to support localized
versions of a program.
(e.g. "Put the candle back")

5. "locale ID" - a short tag used for identifying a locale (one or more of
the above)
...
and perhaps more.

The names above are just off the top of my head. But spending a little time
to come up with good, unambiguous terms for what we are discussing would be
time well spent!

Back to the other topic:

This I agree with; an example would make it clear. That is, a WS that
computed standard deviations would not expect to be passed a locale. A WS
that spell-checked or sorted, would.
