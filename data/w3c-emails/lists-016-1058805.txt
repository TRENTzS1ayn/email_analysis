Given your opening comment I don't' think you can say "which languages
are right-to-left" - perhaps something like "which languages are
associated with right-to-left text"

I don't feel comfortable with the next bit...

I don't think we need to lay it on people heavily, but I think they're
better off learning to call it bidirectional rather than rtl.  If only
so that they don't get corrected by script geeks at Unicode conferences,
but also because it reminds them constantly that enabling these scripts
is not just mirroring.

I think you should also introduce 'bidirectional's little brother,
'bidi' at this point, too.
 

I think it might be better to be more specific about what people will
gain from following this link before they click on it. It may also be
better to add it to a links section.  Also, I looked at this stuff and
thought it wasn't tremendously helpful for beginners.

You could also point to sites such as 
http://www-3.ibm.com/software/globalization/topics/bidi/index.jsp
http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/handson/dev/Mideast.mspx
Etc.

You can't say "languages ... have a preferred ... writing direction" as
you pointed out earlier.  How about "a preferred script with a given
writing direction".
I'd suggest you drop the first para, since you repeat the information
immediately below.

> Algerian Tribal, old Malay, Baluchi, Kashmiri, Sindhi, 
> Pashto, Landha, Dargwa, Morrocan Arabic, Adighe, Ingush, 
> Berber, Kurdish, Jawi/Javanese.

I think we need to check this list carefully.  
-Malay is currently written with ASCII.  Formerly Malay was
written with an Arabic-derived script called Jawi.
-I'd suggest separating out historical scripts
-I think it would be interesting and possibly germaine to provide
information about the number of speakers of these languages (maybe a
total) - its an impressive number - you can get such information from
the SIL ethnologue
-what is Morrocan Arabic?  Is it equivalent to Egyptian Arabic,
Lebanese Arabic, etc.?

I'm inclined to add what remains below to a "By the way..." section.
It's a bit of an edge case.

Not perhaps, always.  Mongolian columns flow ltr, but this is not an
ideographic script.

I'd say 'optionally' -> 'occasionally'.
Be cautious here.  It's quite rare these days, although it wasn't before
World War 2.

Not sure what this means.


Hope that helps,
