Hi Team.


There has been an unfortunate incident that has resulted in the
disabling of the archive updating mechanism.  
<snip>

The immediate concern, getting the archives back to normal functioning,
will occur hopefully sometime tomorrow.  Until then, apprise your WGs,
and anyone, else who uses the archives, that new messages stopped
archiving during the morning of 8 July.  New messages will not be
archived until the fixes are in place.  Previous archives won't be
affected.

This should be a short-term problem, and it is expected that once the
service is restored all mail sent to the archives will appear as normal.

The WAI enhancements are expected to be deployed in early August.



Simon
