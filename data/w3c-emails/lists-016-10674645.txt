All:

At the last telecon we discussed taking the time to have another FTF meeting. We seem to make more progress with these than offline.

There are, obviously, two questions that have to be answered in order to plan such a meeting:

1. When?
2. Where?

We have some proposals for both. Now we need your concrete feedback. If you are a WSTF member or interested participant (e.g. someone who might actually come to the meeting), please respond to the list with your choice below.

WHEN: Tentatively we discussed having the meeting in early to mid-October.  

WHERE: We have many choices here. Many on the telecon expressed the difficulty in obtaining travel permission given the business climate. This limits the choices to being near people's homes and offices. In the form below, please RANK your preferences for the locations listed. If you won't come if the meeting is in a specific location, please indicate NO for that location.

Dates. I would like the meeting during the week starting:
[ ] 6 October 2003
[ ] 13 October 2003
[ ] other (please specify): 

Location. I rank the locations as follows (all locations USA):

[ ] Boston, MA
[ ] Fairfax, VA
[ ] Rochester, MN
[ ] San Jose, CA
[ ] other (please specify):
