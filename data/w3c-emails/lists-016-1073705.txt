A couple of items form todays meeting (ok yesterday's meeting for you guys):

1) There seems to be at least four main Kurdish dialects: Kurmanji, 
Sorani, Zazaki, Gorani. Kurmanji uses the Latin script, Sorani uses the 
Arabic script. Not familiar with the other dialects.

So Kurdish (Sorani) may be more appropriate in Tex's list.

2) For further info on Ajami:

3) Richard was the Berber script, you were thinking of, Tifinagh?
