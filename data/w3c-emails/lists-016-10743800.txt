All,
Chris Newman's documents as per my action item from last week's meeting.

-------------

This spec creates a registry of "comparators" for searching/sorting:

  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-newman-i18n-comparator-00.txt

this spec binds the comparator registry to IMAP:

  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-imapext-i18n-00.txt

this spec is the proposed sort/thread extension for IMAP:

  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-imapext-sort-13.txt


I'm particularly interested in review of the first spec since that's 
intended
as a general purpose mechanism.  But the other two are useful to give it
context.

                 Thanks,
                 - Chris
