Hi all,

Firstly a quick question:

which web browsers (on which platforms)implement the CSS :lang() selector?

And an observation:

I've been playing around with the CSS :lang() selector on Mozilla 
(Windows). The current versions support the :lang() selector when the 
XHTML 1.0/HTML lang attribute is used. On the version of Mozilla I'm 
using (1.4), the :lang() selector does not work when only the xml:lang 
attribute is used (i.e. in XHTML 1.1).

I'm curious as to behaviour in other browsers and other platforms.

Andrew
