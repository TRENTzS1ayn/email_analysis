Here are my comments on this scenario:

This scenario is very similar to the S001 scenario I just sent to the 
list. In fact, all of my comments about that scenario apply to this one 
as well and I included some commentary about subscriptions in that other 
one.

In this scenario, the same (identical) SOAP message is sent to multiple 
receivers. The scenario suggests that multicasting is a possible option 
for the transport layer as the only change.

There is an additional internationalization observation about this 
scenario though. In S001, each SOAP document is individually prepared 
for delivery. In S002 the document is prepared once and sent multiple 
times. This means that user preferences such as language, calendar, sort 
order, and so forth must either not apply to the content or must result 
in separate sets of messages that are sent to a subset of the total 
recipient list. This requires additional care when caching and preparing 
the data and may require that the subscriber set be preprocessed into 
"groups" to ensure consistency.

Extra effort should be expended in this case in trying to use the 
"Language Neutral" service pattern (see our Usage Scenarios document) 
for the underlying service so that this additional effort doesn't apply.
