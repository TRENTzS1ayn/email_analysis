I'm not sure I can do as good a job as Addison, but I'll give
it a try.

Scenario S032 is about caching. The description says that this
can be on several levels, i.e. a whole SOAP message or just
some part. I'm not very sure the thing with the 'parts' is
practical, but anyway, this is about i18n :-).

There are mainly two internationalization considerations:

1) The potential for caching gets reduced if the relevant messages
    or message parts contain some i18n aspects, because only a subset
    of the recipients will want to get exactly the same message.
    This can be improved by using late localization as much as possible,
    by including several alternatives (e.g. having a fault message
    in 5 languages means that the same cached fault message can be
    used for an audience covering these 5 languages, rather than just
    one language). In order for caching to not produce errors with i18n,
    the i18n context has to be well-known (explicit) to the caching
    mechanism, or messages with i18n aspects have to be marked as non-
    cachable.

2) In many areas of the world, connectivity is worse, and caching
    therefore potentially more important, than in the better connected
    part of the world. Example include Africa and some parts of Asia,
    but also to some extent Australia/New Zeeland,...
