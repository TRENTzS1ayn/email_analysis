All:

The WSDL working group recently published new working drafts of their documents. Here's the news story, complete with links:

http://www.w3.org/News/2003#item100

The newest WD they released is called Message Patterns. It is a very simple document that I reviewed briefly. It basically enumerates the set of patterns for a Web service (on a gross level), i.e. inbound only, in followed by out, request-response, out only, etc.

It might be useful to consider these lower level patterns (in addition to the application level patterns we've been considering with the WS-Arch documents).

Best Regards,

Addison
