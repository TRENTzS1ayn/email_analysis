> 2. Review Choreography Usage Scenarios from Deb

Discussion about Deb's mail and Mark and Addison's comments on the list. There was an extended discussion of context and profiles in applications and how this relates to Web services. Basically, we discussed the difference between explicit context that must be exchanged in a SOAP message (e.g. in the body or in the header) and implicit context ("profiles") that are negotiated early and persisted through a transaction. An example of the latter is using a customer ID to retrieve complex information in the backing application rather than repeating the items in either the service signature or in the headers.

Martin: P3P deals with some of these issues.

Some discussion of good/bad ways to do context. Perhaps add examples to USWD to cover some of these and describe the different implications in Web services.

Discussion of WSDL vs. SOAP: how do SOAP Feature and WSDL "feature" relate? Intended as compatible mechanisms. It appears that both are not yet well formed because no one has essayed to create a SOAP Feature yet and thus there is no practice in WSDL features. This technology is not yet mature.
