All:

I just posted a new document on the website containing very preliminary comments on S003 (the Request/Response pattern). You can find the comments here:

http://www.w3.org/International/ws/2003/06/ws-request-response-pattern-scenario.html

Please send your comments, extensions, clarifications and ideas back to this list.

Hey folks: while you're at it, write one of your own! It doesn't take long and you don't have to be as fancy as I've been here. An email to the list is perfectly fine. Martin or I would be happy to drop your comments into a framework similar to what I've done here.
