FYI.

Since Andrew Cunningham sent something out on the geo list recently
about use of the BOM, I thought I'd forward this latest anecdote that
reinforces any advice not to use the utf-8 BOM. It perhaps also suggests
that we should mount a campaign to ensure that developers of user agents
and tools don't produce or fall over the BOM.

Thanks for that!  

I removed the BOM and it seemed to do the trick.  Hmm.  I don't see how
the average user will understand that.  Perhaps we should advise the
Opera guys.

That utf-8 BOM is certainly a pain.

Cheers!
