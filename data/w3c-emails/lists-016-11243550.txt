DISCUSSION:

1. This meeting's time stays the same. Next two meetings: 1 April, 15 April

2. Usage Scenarios WS-Arch document review.

WS Arch document has 38 scenarios. Our action plan for this document will be to build comments and usage scenarios for each scenario (or note that we have no comments) by end of April.

The Process:
1. tell them. We will contact the WS Arch WG and discuss our impending feedback. We expect that our comments will most likely become points on their issues list.
2. submit comments to them.
3. maintain result in our own document. Use their S-numbering to identify our comments.

ACTION: We agreed that the following members would provide a number of reviewed scenarios. Addison to circulate a list of the scenarios and each of us will sign up to produce specific ones. Addison will maintain scorekeeping on our website.

Mike: 4 or 5
Tex: some
Takao: 4 or 5
Addison: 4 or 5

3. WS-Choreography review. We felt we need to look closely at these.
