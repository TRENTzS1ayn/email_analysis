I have just posted a document to the website to keep track of who is 
working on which of the WS-Architecture usage scenarios. It's here:

http://www.w3.org/International/ws/2003/03/ws-arch-scenarios-assign.html

Anyone may sign up to review a scenario. If you do, please be prepared 
to SUBMIT your initial working document by Tuesday, 23 April 2003.

More than one (non-member) person may work on the same scenario.

WSTF Members:

Please send email showing which four or five scenarios you intend to 
work on so I can fill out the table with our names.

"Working Document" Submissions:

You may submit your work either as an HTML document (these may be saved 
from Word or some other more complext format, if you choose) by emailing 
it to me (aphillips@webmethods.com) and copying Martin (duerst@w3.org) 
or by just sending email to the list (public-i18n-ws@w3.org). I will 
post HTML documents submitted and point to them in the table. I will add 
links from the table to the mail archive if you choose the latter route.

Thanks in advance,

Addison
