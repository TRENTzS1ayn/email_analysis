All:

I have just uploaded my first draft of the Third Party Intermediary usage scenario HTML document. This can be viewed here:

http://www.w3.org/International/ws/2003/05/ws-aggregation-pattern-scenario.html

I will henceforth maintain versions of this document. Your comments are very welcome. I am preparing the rest of the missing material for this one in my ample free time.

This document is also linked from the WS-Architecture assignments page, which is here:

http://www.w3.org/International/ws/2003/03/ws-arch-scenarios-assign.html

To date I have received *NO* sign-ups for the other scenarios. Please remember to file a signup to indicate your interest in a particular scenario. I know it is hard to choose. So many remain... it's tempting to do them all, isn't it?

Please take the time to sign up for *one* for starters. You don't have to do nearly the level of detail or delicate formatting that I put into the document I just posted. We agreed to settle for an email with bullet points! But if you put your comments in, I'll ensure that they are pretty or at least available. We need your comments to flesh out the next draft of our own Usage Scenarios. We really need every bit of feedback we can get before the 12th.

Best Regards,

Addison
