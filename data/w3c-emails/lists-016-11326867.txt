Addison,
I reviewed "2.7 S010 Request with acknowledgement" as a trial,
and the result is:
-------------------------------------------------------
The example uses "DELIVERED" as a value of <n:MessageStatus> 
in <n:StatusResponse>.  Use of the English word "DELIVERED" is
acceptable as long as it is seen as a token, mutually agreed
between the sender and receiver; i.e. it should not be
treated as a English word to be displayed to the users.  
Use of a numeric code may be considered to demonstrate
this point.  Use of GMT based time stamp in the example
is very good.
-------------------------------------------------------

Is this the kind of depth we are aiming for, or am I expected to
go further by reading all the referenced materials,
"ebXML Messaging Service, Proprietary Messaging Systems, Java Messaging Service"
in this case?
