All:

I just just updated the ws-aggregation-pattern-scenario document on our web site (this is my set of comments on S030). The new material is in the section "Negotiation of Natural Language Preference". Document is here:

http://www.w3.org/International/ws/2003/05/ws-aggregation-pattern-scenario.html

I am in the midst of editing the material further. What I'm trying to do is summarized below. I'm looking for comments from the list about the exact nature of the policies we wish to promote in this area. I intend to add block of example WSDL and SOAP as with (say) http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-desc-usecases/#N10486 so that users can see what it would look like.

-- summary --
I outlined the four patterns for the execution of a Web service that we have previously discussed. These are:
- neutral
- runAsServer
- run using specific (design time) preference
- run using the client's preference

I think the best way to handle this is to define a sort of "best practice" for how services should be described and then executed with each of these patterns.

1. Neutral: This is the default and represents the state of affairs today for all services.
2. server: This is much like #1.
3. specific. Generate any outbound headers with the specific language identified using RFC3066 (xml:lang or xsd:language). Service descriptions specify which one is being used.
4. user defined. As with #3 except the user is expected to provide the value.

In my text I attempt to define the way that SOAP Fault messages should be generated, as well as the pattern (order) of generation.
