---------------------------

Discussion: Deb suggests a need for WG to review XQuery, XPath, as there are i18n issues, such as those tied to collation and string processing. Deb will try to address with the IBM rep. (Christopher Lowes) and to W3C-I18N-WG via WSTF. AP to coordinate these comments within the WG, as Core TF is more clearly responsible than we are.

--------------------------
> 2. Discussion of WS-Architecture Usage Scenarios comments from Addison, Kuro.

Discussion of neutral vs. server. Felt that these are very similar patterns in today's implementations. Highlighted minor differences.

Discussed differences in xsd:language vs. xml:lang. xsd:language defines type for modeling purposes and for data structuring, while xml:lang is more of an attribute. Note that XMLSchema refers to RFC1766 directly and XML 1.0 2nd Edition also refers to RFC3066 only obliquely (via errata).

Tex: Should show other preferences, such as (for example) Timezone, not just natural language.

Addison: A 6th pattern not shown: passing language or "locale" preference all the way across intermediary or performing language matching in the intermediary.

---------------------------
Editorial Meeting Discussion.

Discussed whether we should publish the results of the editorial meeting as a new WD of the Usage Scenarios document. The quiet period prior to WWW conference starts next Wednesday (the day following our editorial meeting). This limits time available for commentary severely.

By acclamation, we decided that the result of the editorial meeting will be published without additional review or telecon as a new Working Draft. Members can review work semi-live as we edit it next Monday/Tuesday. Otherwise we have a desire to publish.
