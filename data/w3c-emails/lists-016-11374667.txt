> -- summary --
> I outlined the four patterns for the execution of a Web service 
> that we have previously discussed. These are:
> - neutral
> - runAsServer
> - run using specific (design time) preference
> - run using the client's preference
> 
> I think the best way to handle this is to define a sort of "best 
> practice" for how services should be described and then executed 
> with each of these patterns.
> 
> 1. Neutral: This is the default and represents the state of 
> affairs today for all services.
> 2. server: This is much like #1.
> 3. specific. Generate any outbound headers with the specific 
> language identified using RFC3066 (xml:lang or xsd:language). 
> Service descriptions specify which one is being used.
> 4. user defined. As with #3 except the user is expected to 
> provide the value.
> 
> In my text I attempt to define the way that SOAP Fault messages 
> should be generated, as well as the pattern (order) of generation.
