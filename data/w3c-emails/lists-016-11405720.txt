All:

The editor copy of our Usage Scenarios has been updated after Martin, Tex, and I spent an intensive two-day editorial session in Boston this week. Very shortly it will be published as a new Working Draft. This is just a quick note to let members of the TF and interested parties see the Task Force's work in advance of the event. As always your comments and additional material are welcome (although I note that it is already too late to affect the new working draft--any comments will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the editorial copy after discussion by the TF).

The editor copy is located here:
