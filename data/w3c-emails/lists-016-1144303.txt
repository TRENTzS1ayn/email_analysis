Good point. That is of course okay if we are at the top.
And it should be possible to do that because:
- W3C does seem to have quite a bit of Google-Karma
- We will have all three words, in that order, in the title,...
- We will of course produce more and more content and will
   be linked from other places

So I'm not too worried, but of course if we have a better idea,
I don't object.
