My talk went well (there were almost no people who walked out after
the other Web Services talks and before mine :-).

A day or two ago, I started to feel that our distinction of
- Localization-independent
- Service-determined
- Client-influenced

is a very good one, but that it's quite difficult to put each
Web service as a whole into one of these categories. So what I
did in the talk was to say that these are aspects than can
appear combined in a Web service. That easily allows to
explain things such as the fact that faults should be
client-influenced even in a Web service that basically
is localization-independent. Also, it allowed to easily
add another point, data-driven, which is quite important
overall.

What do you think?

Regards,    Martin.
