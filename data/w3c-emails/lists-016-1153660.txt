Yes, but we shouldn't presume we will be at the top.
I wouldn't doubt that it is likely we will be near, but banking on it is
silly.

The main w3c pages are near the top, but certainly not all. I do a number of
searches where pages from other sites dominate.
The key to making a page have a high rank is links to the page and proper use
of keywords that you want searches to find the page with.
(e.g. bidi, unicode, double-byte, etc.)

I am just suggesting we use something that makes the page easy for people to
pull up.
