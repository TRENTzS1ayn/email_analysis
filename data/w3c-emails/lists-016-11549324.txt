Hi, 

The slides look good, and for those who have read the doc or attended your
session having it online is very useful. 
It's a bit sparse to point people that are unfamiliar to it online. It made me
think that we should add to the scenarios doc
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-ws-i18n-scenarios-20030516

a place where we list all 3 (or 4) terms with definitions, so when Martin or
others create online information it is easy to extract the definitions or link
to them.
I think links might be preferable as the definitions are likely to get some
improvements over time.

I also have some questions around data-driven- the next telecon should be a
good discussion.

Martin, what was the reaction of the audience and what kind of questions did
you get?
