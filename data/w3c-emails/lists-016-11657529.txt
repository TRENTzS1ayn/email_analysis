Nice.

1) What does "calendar-related" mean?
We are using it to mean dependent on a type of calendar (hebrew, hijri, etc.).
I think of the term as meaning driven by a particular date on the calendar.

"locale-related" is also a bit ambiguous.

Perhaps we should provide some terms & definitions.

2) I would eliminate the redundancy unless the examples become much larger and
more detailed.


just fyi, some of the countries changed to G. then went back to Julian for a
period and then back again...
