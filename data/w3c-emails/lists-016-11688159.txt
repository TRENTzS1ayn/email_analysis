With the help of the author of the XSLT for the xmlspec, Norm Walsh,
at the W3C AC meeting, I was able to use a workaround to get around
a bug in IE, so that now
http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/Overview.xml
displays reasonably in IE. The solution was to change empty-string
parameter entities (legal in XML) to parameter entities containing
a single space (also legal, and not triggering the bug).
There are still problems with the character encoding when using IE.

Regards,    Martin.
