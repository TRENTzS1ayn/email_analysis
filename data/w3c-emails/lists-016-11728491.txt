Looks great. A couple of comments below...

Internationalization is an architecture.
It is not a feature.

You've got a point. Instead maybe: "The framework provides an outline of Web
services which are useful for discussing international issues. One version
of the Web Services Architecture document [WSA] defines a Web services as
follows: // etc."

This allows us to quote the WSA document without having to worry about
whether they change it at some point (again).

The SOAP document, like any XML file, may indicate its character encoding
(charset) in an XML document declaration. Most SOAP documents use the UTF-8
encoding, even though other encodings are permitted. (End para)

Use singular??: "Many SOAP document elements may contain xml:lang attributes
to indicate the language of their content."

// I made extensive modifications of the diagram and text earlier today:
check it out! Some of that deals with MEPs and a few other things.
