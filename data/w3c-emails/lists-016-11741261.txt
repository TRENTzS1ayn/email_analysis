Hi Andrea,

Great stuff. Some suggestions on the intro and first scenario below.

Perhaps "The value returned represents a specific date on the calendar, not
a timestamp value as might be associated with a particular locale or
timezone."??

I don't think the intro to Scenario A quite captures it. I think we need to
draw the distinction with fixed-date events. Maybe:

A service calculates the date for Easter, Passover, or Ramadan for any given
year in a specified calendar type. These religious holidays are partly based
on astronomical events (such as lunar phases) as well as historical tables
and not strictly calendar dependent (in the way that many secular holidays,
such as various national independence days or leader's birthdays are) or
predictable (third Thursday in November, etc.). Thus the need for a service
to calculate the date might be necessary. // continue with... "The SOAP
request..."
