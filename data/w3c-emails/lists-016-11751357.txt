I don't know that the calendar scenario is actually that useful; most OSs have a
variety of calendars already. What would be a more compelling example would be a
server for 'business holidays', since those are not generally supported, and
vary by country and even by smaller units: states/provinces, even cities; and
may need updated frequently.

E.g. get me the state holidays in Utah.
