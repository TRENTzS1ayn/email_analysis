I'm quite confused here. Is the request to get back e.g.
Western Easter in the Thai Buddhist calendar, or Ramadan
in the Julian calendar,...? Isn't this just a conflation of
two separate tasks, namely a) getting the date(s) of the event
in a locale-neutral form (i.e. ISO 8601 / XML Schema date format),
and b) converting these dates to the desired calendar?

This seems to imply that England and Germany were using Gregorian
at that time. They probably did (or for Germany, at least a significant
part did), but I guess replacing 'England or Germany' with 'Italy or France'
puts us on the safe side.

I think the 'a locale contains far more information' is quite irrelevant.
I guess that for all the examples in all the scenarios we use, this
would actually be true.
I think what's more important is that historical times are most
probably not covered by locale information.

Again, this conflates two separate tasks in the same way Scenario A does.
