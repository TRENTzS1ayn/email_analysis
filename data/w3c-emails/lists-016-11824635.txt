Yes, it is tricky.

> Alas xsd:date allows a timezone identifier...

An (optional) timezone identifier is actually reasonable. Stating that it is
July 12, 1999 GMT does convey different information than just July 12, 1999
(undetermined zone), or than July 12, 1999 Pacific Time.

Note that July 12, 1999 08:00 Pacific Time is very different than July 12, 1999
08:00 GMT-08:00. You see that when you start to set up a repeating meeting, such
as in calendar software. If we meet every month on the 12th at 08:00 PT, that
will be sometimes 8:00 GMT-08:00 and sometimes 07:00 GMT-08:00. And in most
cases, PT is what people want instead of GMT-08:00.

Subject: RE: calendar *dependent* events scenarii



XML Schema does a lackluster job of explaing any of this.

I probably wouldn't use ranges for a calendric (non-point) date value. I'd
probably use the 'xsd:date' type in preference to a 'xsd:dateTime', e.g.
'2003-11-25' instead of '2003-11-25T00:00:00Z'. The point then is that you
should not interpret a calendric date using a time zone (either your local one
or some other value). Alas xsd:date allows a timezone identifier...

This is contrary to most date arithmetic in Java and other programming
languages, where dates are, as you say, generally just of the point type and you
must interpolate the 'right value' from a specific date object or apply the
correct usage based on implementation decisions. There is some question, for
example, of whether midnight GMT or noon GMT is a better 'default' value for a
date object representing a 'calendric value' like this (since noon actually
falls during the day for nearly all time zones, whereas midnight doesn't affect
the bits in the underlying long integer value).

In any case, the mere fact that we're having this discussion points up the fact
that most developers have, in my experience, a lot of trouble with date,
datetime, timezone, and related event-driven issues: this is a neglected topic
of discussion. It's nice to explain some of it.
