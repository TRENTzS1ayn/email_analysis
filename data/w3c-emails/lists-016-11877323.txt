All,

If you are coming to the I18n Web Services Task Force face-to-face 
meeting next week, please let me know BY FRIDAY, OCTOBER 3, 8AM PACIFIC 
DAYLIGHT TIME and tell me the following:

1.  Do you have any dietary restrictions?
2.  Do you drink a hot drink other than coffee?
3.  Do you need transportation from your hotel to the Sun campus?  If 
so, what hotel are you staying at?

If you don't let me know that you're coming, you will have to bring your 
own food.

Andrea
