All:

Today we've been busy working on revising the outline to the WS-I18n Usage Scenarios document at our Face-to-Face meeting here in Santa Clara. For those of you not able to join us, you can expect to see some more messages with notes being exchanged over the next couple of days.

If you are interested, the editor's draft appears online. Comments from the Peanut Gallery are very welcome, although it may be very hard to figure out what we're doing from our email trail ;-).

Best Regards,

Addison
