<h3>I-008: Locale Sensitive Formatted Data in SOAP Fault Messages</h3>

<p>FaultReason must substitute locale-sensitive data into a text message.</p>

<p>Service "A" is defined on Provider "A". A fault is generated during
invocation that returns a faultReason that includes values for which the
presentation depends on locale.</p>
<ul>
  <li>"The date provided, 12 November 2201, was too late."</li>
  <li>"The argument 12345.678 was too large."</li>
  <li>"The argument 12345,678- was too small."</li>
</ul>

<p>The provider should format substitutions in each message according to the
language (and implied locale) of the message, not according to the locale of
the provider or service. In the case of Language Neutral or Service
Determined patterns, it may not be possible to generate a message in the
user's preferred language (or the preference may not be available). In these
cases, the message most likely will follow the language preference of the
SOAP Provider or the service's (agent's) host.</p>

<p>Applies to: SOAP, or an extension of SOAP</p>
