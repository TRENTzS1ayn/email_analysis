All,

Here is an excellent Q&A proposal from John Yunker.  Please have a look
at it.  If we have time, maybe we can review it this evening (its not
long).

Cheers,
RI

Hi Richard,

I took a stab at a pretty basic Q&A (attached with graphic). I'm not
really sure where it fits in with the rest of the questions but I have
been asked this myself, so I thought it couldn't hurt. I think it could
use some additional text/explanation from the gang as well, if you
believe it should move forward. If not, I totally understand as well -
no worries either way.

Thanks.
