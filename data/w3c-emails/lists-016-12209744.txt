Hi Takao,

Mark Davis has kindly agreed to let us quote his nifty locale-to-text mismatch example for our scenario I-022 (see action item list from last teleconference). You can find the original here:

http://eikenes.alvestrand.no/pipermail/ietf-languages/2003-April/000778.html

Please include a note attributing the example to Mark. Let me know if you need help with the text of it.

Best Regards,

Addison
