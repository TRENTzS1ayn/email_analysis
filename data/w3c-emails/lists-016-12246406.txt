Thanks a lot Mark and Addison.  I will work on it.

Everyone, I am a bit behind on getting up to speed as I had a conflict. But
it's cleared up. I will try to get it done by early next week.

Note: that is a slightly older version. Someone pointed out an error in the
currency, the latest version is in
http://www.openi18n.org/specs/ldml/1.0/ldml-spec.htm#Language_and_Locale_IDs,
under "Written Language"

Hi Takao,

Mark Davis has kindly agreed to let us quote his nifty locale-to-text
mismatch
example for our scenario I-022 (see action item list from last
teleconference).
You can find the original here:

http://eikenes.alvestrand.no/pipermail/ietf-languages/2003-April/000778.html

Please include a note attributing the example to Mark. Let me know if you
need
help with the text of it.

Best Regards,

Addison
