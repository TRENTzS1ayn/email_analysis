All:

The Web Services task force of the W3C-I18N-WG is pleased to announce our plans for an October face-to-face meeting of the group. This meeting will be held at the Mansion on Sun Microsystems's Santa Clara, California, campus. The purpose of the meeting is to draw together and attempt to finalize our work on Web Services International Usage Scenarios, a document that we hope will serve Web Service and Web Service product implementers as a useful reference.

We invite the membership to participate in this effort by contributing:

1. Usage scenarios not currently documented.
2. Position statements on Web services and WS related issues.

Internationalization is an architecture. 
It is not a feature.
