In this case, we should change the example

from:

Time       : To do            Western/English
---------- : -----------------------
GOZEN 8:00 : Breakfast    8:00 A.M.
GOGO  0:00 : Lunch       12:00PM
GOGO  7:00 : Dinner           7:00 PM
GOZEN 0:00 : Go to bed        12:00AM

to:

Time       : To do            Western/English
---------- : -----------------------
GOZEN 8:00 : Breakfast    8:00 A.M.
GOZEN 12:00 : Lunch       12:00PM
GOGO  7:00 : Dinner           7:00 PM
GOGO 12:00 : Go to bed        12:00AM

This will illustlate the original point much clearer.

GOGO 0:00 is equal to GOZEN 12:00, and both mean Noon.
GOZEN 0:00 is equal to GOGO 12:00, and both mean Midnight.

Thanks
