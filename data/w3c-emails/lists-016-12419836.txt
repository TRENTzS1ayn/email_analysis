4.2 incorporated. I did a small bit of wordsmithing:

<p>When exchanging messages, the requester and the service that the
requester
accesses may have different default locales and language preferences. In
addition, there may be more than one service involved in the message
exchange or there may be different clients who consume the
message. Each of these may expect a different locale and language.</p>

<p>Message exchange between components with different language and/or
locales
may result a failure or unexpected result.  This section describes
various message exchange patterns that need to consider language preferences
or that have
potential failure scenarios.</p>

Internationalization is an architecture.
It is not a feature.
