4.4.1 incorporated. I added this paragraph of warning text...

<p>Use and adoption of locale-affected and non-internationalized data
structures generally requires a firm understanding of the conventions being
adopted and careful implementation. It is generally poor practice in Web
services, since the goal of having a Web services infrastructure is usually
interoperablity without deep knowledge of the underlying implementation
decisions.</p>

Internationalization is an architecture.
It is not a feature.

> 4.2 Locale/Language Dependency in Message Exchange Patterns

> When exchanging a message, the requester and service that the requester

> addition, there may be more than one service involved in the message
> exchange.  And there may be different requester, who consumes the
> message, who may expect different locale and language.
