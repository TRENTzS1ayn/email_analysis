All:

I edited Tex's text slightly, especially I-020 (I reworded it to be a scenario-style example, changing from abstract plurals to specific singular references). I also added a paragraph to the last section:

<p>If the intermediary strips off optional headers (either 
from the requester of its service or the response from its 
providers), some of the contextual information necessary to 
interpret the response may be lost.</p>

Note that this section is now Section 4.7.

The new version is uploaded on the site. I still need to finish recovering the other text sent to me and incorporate it. More as the day/week wears on.
