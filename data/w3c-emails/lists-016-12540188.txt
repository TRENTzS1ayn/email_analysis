In the section 4.7 on intermediaries, labeled: Providing Language and Locale
Negotiation

Add after this first para:

Scenarios in this section address the requirements of services that employ
intermediaries, as discussed in "Service Oriented Architecture Derivative
Patterns Intermediary" (in Web Services Architecture document[WSA]).


The following:

As the diagram indicates, one or more providers offer services. An intermediary
service makes requests from these providers and uses the results to satisfy the
requests coming from its clients. The intermediary service may process and/or
integrate the results from different providers to create a new kind of service
or it may simply pass results along. The intermediary service may also cache
either the contents it sends to clients, or the results returned to it by its
providers, for reuse with subsequent requests. In these scenarios it is
important to consider that the providers may return results formulated for
certain international preferences. Clients may also be expecting results
formulated according to their requirements. The intermediaries may be expected
to apply appropriate matching between client and provider, or to bridge gaps. 


Then delete the first para of 4.7.1.
