All:

First off, meeting times. We decided on two available slots. The preferred slot was:

Wednesdays,  4 PM PDT, 7 PM EDT, 6 PM CDT, 8 AM JST

If any of you cannot make it on a regular basis, please indicate if this would be the better slot:

Thursdays, 4 PM PDT, 7 PM EDT, 6 PM CDT, 8 AM JST

Other topics:

1. Usage Scenarios. We are trying to finish by 24 April, which means that we have two more meetings to complete the document. I will prepare an action list from the document for completion by the next meeting (next Wednesday or Thursday). I've nearly completed the updates (another version was uploaded today) and will post the action item list tomorrow.

2. Requirements. Other companies and groups indicated interest as Unicode or the W3C Tech Plenary into joining in to work on WS-Internationalization or to looking at our materials. This means that we also need to think about our Requirements document and ensure that this is up to date and contains the information that we want it to. Please review.

Internationalization is an architecture. 
It is not a feature.
