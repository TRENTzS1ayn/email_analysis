I'd have to miss a lot of the meetings, since my regular Wednesday meeting is 
3-4:30 PDT.  Sometimes we don't meet, but we meet at least every other week.

Momentarily this is doable for me.  It may happen that every other Thursday I 
may have a meeting starting at 4:30 again, but right now it starts at 5.
