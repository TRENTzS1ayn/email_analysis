All:

I've uploaded a webpage with the action items to:

   http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/ActionItemList.html

I'll add a link on the homepage in a minute.

There are 23 items in the list, of which I own about a third. 

If you don't have an item, read the document and send comments on consistency, etc., or choose one of the open items (there are a couple). I would really appreciate it if folks who have time can generate WSDL and SOAP messages to serve as examples where we have none.

Send all text and comments to the list.

Thanks and have a nifty weekend.

Addison
