All:

I have just uploaded a new version of the Usage Scenarios document and of the action items list. There is one new action item (it's your's, Martin, sorry).

I have made some editorial changes to the scenarios document in incorporating some of my changes. I'd like comments back on these, since they were not discussed in advance.

First: I inserted a definition of "language negotiation" into the section on I18n/L10n (section 3). Tex should check out my additions, since he authored the rest of the content. I did this because of the modifications below.

Second: I swapped "client influenced" and "service determined" patterns in the document (so that client influenced appears before the other). This makes the patterns easier to understand for newbies (since client influenced introduces all of the concepts like language negotiation, locale-affected, and so forth most naturally~~service determined and data driven are then special cases of a locale affected service).

Third: I started on fixing the service determined example, but am not done yet.

Action list is: http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/ActionItemList.xml (yes, the XML version)

Next meeting is Thursday SEND ME YOUR TEXT BEFORE THEN.
