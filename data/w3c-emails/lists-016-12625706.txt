Hello Addison, Mike, others,

I have made some slight changes to the DTD to reduce the chance
to produce invalid XHTML.

To make sure that these changes take effect, please:
- close the Overview.xml file in XMetaL
- delete the xmlspec.rlx file (this is where XMetaL keeps
   its own copy of the DTD)
- download the following:
   http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/xmlspec.dtd
   http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/Overview.html
   http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/xmlspec.xsl
   (the latest only if not done recently)
- Continue editing

The change to the DTD does no longer allow <ednote>s or lists inside a <p>.
If you feel tempted to put them there, just close the <p> (and open it
again after the ednote or list). This brings the DTD closer to HTML/XHTML.

Regards,     Martin.
