All,

I think that the best arrangement of I-008, fault messages, and I-022 would be:

Move I-008 to be 4.3.3, or whatever it winds up being.  Rename 4.3 to something 
like "Fault Handling" or "Fault Message Handling". Reword and repunctuate 4.3.3 
slightly as follows -

-------------------------

4.3.3 I-008: Locale Sensitive Formatted Data in SOAP Fault Messages

A service provider must substitute locale-sensitive data into text messages when 
generating faults.

Service A is defined on Provider B. A fault is generated during invocation, 
returning a faultReason. In order to properly present values inside the 
faultReason message, the locale must be known and locale information must be 
available.  For example:

     * "The date provided, 12 November 2201, was too late."
     * "The argument 12345.678 was too large."
     * "The argument 12345,678- was too small."

The provider should format substitutions in each message according to the 
language and locale of the message, not according to the locale of the provider 
or service. In the case of Language Neutral or Service Determined patterns, it 
may not be possible to generate a message in the user's preferred language (or 
the preference may not be available). In these cases, the message should follow 
the language preference of the provider or service host.

For more information on locale related formatting, see I-022.

--------------------------

My reasoning is this:  People are going to look at fault messages separately 
from SOAP messages, because they are often from different coding components with 
different people working on them.  So I don't want to merge the fault message 
locale-based formatting with data formatting.  But the data formatting example 
has some additional information that they might want to take a look at to get a 
better concept.
