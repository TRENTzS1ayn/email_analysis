I disagree with this assessment. We all agree that the error message -- when
presented to the reader -- should be localized. Thus the user should see:

>      * "The date provided, 12 November 2201, was too late."
>      * "The argument 12345.678 was too large."
>      * "The argument 12345,678- was too small."

However, *where* the localization should be done is not so simple. It should be
closest point to the user where enough information is available to formulate the
message.

Thus Service A (where the error is generated) may not actually have any locale
information available. It might then simply send back something like:

"Use MessageFormat string associated with someFault, plus data (in unlocalized
form, e.g. XMLSchema datatypes):

...
<error>someFault</error>
<date>2004-04-14</date>
<numberOfPages>1400</numberOfPages>
...

This message hops from Service to Service until it gets to one that knows (a)
what the end recipient's locale is, and (b) what the MessageFormat string
associated with someFault for that locale is.
