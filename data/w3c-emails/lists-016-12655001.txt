I agree in general, Mark, but that's not the design of Web Services.

This is something we have been at pains to point out: Faults (the Web Service equivalent of a runtime error or exception) can only generate a text message, not a complex type (data structure) in the SOAP provided XML structure. These scenarios are our way of complaining about it (we corresponded about this previously, I think).

For example, a given service can have several "outbound" messages, some of which indicate success and some of which indicate an error of some kind (such as input out of range or record not found). These responses are under programmatic control of the service, please note, and can follow the pattern you describe in JITXL.

By contrast, a Fault is a runtime exception. It may be literally and exception thrown in the body of the service or it may be an error condition detected in the Provider (such as "service not found" or "malformed input"). As Andrea points out, Faults are different from SOAP messages indicating an error, because they can contain only a Reason element (a text element containing the human readable message).

In other words, the design of Web Services is such that all Faults are resolved to string where they occur at the level they occur.

What you're describing is a service that ends normally and returns a processing-controlled error. This can be done with Web Services and we should probably add a scenario showing it.

However, abnormal ends such as a thrown exception or an error detected at the Provider (rather than service) level--that is, errors not under control of the service's normal processing--are forced to return a Fault and these must be resolved to a natural language string as shown in the example at the level at which they occur. The string must be marked with xml:lang (yay!), but there is no default message, data structuring, or language negotiation provided. Hence the scenarios including I-008 and I-022.

Does that describe the problem more clearly?
