Addison,

I have been swamped with work lately (since the Plenary). I'm on 
holiday now but I would like to schedule a time to talk about how to 
move on i18N with the Web Services Coordination call. Perhaps one way 
to do this is to invite you to address the chair on that call with a 
call to arms. Anyway let me know when you are free to talk. I'm back 
next week.

Best Regards

Steve Ross-Talbot
Chief Scientist, Enigmatec Corporation
co-chair W3C Web Services Choreography
chair W3C Web Services
