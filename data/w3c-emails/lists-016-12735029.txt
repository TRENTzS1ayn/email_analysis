Done. Uploaded.

I reworded some of the text when I moved it (to make it flow more neatly
with the text above). Check out my changes, Andrea, and let me know if I got
it right.

(PS> Mark, if you look at the document now, you'll see that Andrea's changes
put this text directly below the examples showing problems with generating
lots of languages and finding a suitable message with no default.)

> A service provider must substitute locale-sensitive data into

> Service A is defined on Provider B. A fault is generated during

>      * "The argument 12345.678 was too large."
>      * "The argument 12345,678- was too small."

> The provider should format substitutions in each message according to the

> of the provider
> or service. In the case of Language Neutral or Service Determined

> the preference may not be available). In these cases, the message
