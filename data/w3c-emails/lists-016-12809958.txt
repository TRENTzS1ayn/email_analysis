Hello Mark,

For the Usage Scenario document, we want to make a reference to
your JIT Localization document, and I have an action item to provide
that. What version/location is the best to point to (most stable)?

I have
a)
http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/icuhtml/design/jit_localization.html
(or more exactly:
http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/icuhtml/design/jit_localizati 
on.html?rev=1.1&content-type=text/html)

b) a series of pages starting at
   http://www-306.ibm.com/software/globalization/topics/jit/index.jsp

Are there any others? Which one is best?

Thanks and regards,     Martin.
