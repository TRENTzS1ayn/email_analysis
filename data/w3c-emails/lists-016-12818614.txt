The best version is
http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/icuhtml/design/jit_localization.html

(The public version IBM was taken from that, but it is not as good).

BTW, if anyone has any feedback for improvement, that is always welcome.

For reference, would it help if I submitted it as a Unicode Technical Note?

Mark
