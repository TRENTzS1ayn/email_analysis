Hello Addison,

I again got some validity warnings, and had to tighten the DTD
a bit. In general, if you can spot it, don't try to put anything
into a <p> that isn't a phrase-level element.

Please download xmlspec.dtd and Overview.xml again, and remove
xmlspec.rlx, as explained in an earlier mail.

Regards,    Martin.

P.S.: Last time, it took me an hour to figure things out, this time 10 minutes.
