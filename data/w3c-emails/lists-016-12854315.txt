Let's play blue-sky with that idea a bit. If the error message is structured,
*and* contains enough information that a further translation could still
transform it, then we would have as much information as possible. It could be
translated without loss of information, so that it could be further translated
if necessary. Let's take a more complicated one:

Service A doesn't have the ability to localize for anything, just emits English,
but with enough structure to recompose. In this case, it does know the user's
locale (some services might not, so the goalLang might be added later.

<message xml:lang='en-US' id='dateToLate' goalLang='de-CH'>The date provided,
     <data xsi:type="xsd:date" seq='1' value='2201-11-12'>11/12/2201</data>,
     was too late for the
     <data xsi:type="xsd:number" seq='2' value='1234'>1,234</data>
     file(s).
</message>

Service B can get it to German

<message xml:lang='de' id='dateToLate'>Fuer die
    <data xsi:type="xsd:number" seq='2' value='1234'>1.234</data>
    Datei war das eingegebene Datum,
     <data xsi:type="xsd:date" seq='1' value='2201-11-12'>12.11.2001</data>,
     zu spa"t.
</message>

Service C can get it to Swiss German (just for illustration, since you'd use
writing German -- and my Swiss is really rusty)

<message xml:lang='de' id='dateToLate'>Fuer d'
    <data xsi:type="xsd:number" seq='2' value='1234'>1.234</data>
    datei isch 's datum wo du iigaa haesh,
     <data xsi:type="xsd:date" seq='1' value='2201-11-12'>12.11.2001</data>,
     z' schpoot gsi.
</message>

There are still a number of things missing from this.
- as you say, one may want a URL for the messages. If that is the case, then you
really would just translate at the end, however, not along the way.
- one may want to allow parts to be translated along the way, thus putting the
current lang and desired lang on each item
- the equivalent of a
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/ChoiceFormat.html could be
used so that the singular/dual/plural (etc) forms of words could be used in
accordance with numeric variables.
