Actually I prefer j23n to JITXL, unless you mean j22n. :-P

So, sorry but I can't tell what exactly you're proposing here, Addison.  Are you 
proposing a fault message structure, or a set of fixed fault messages, or both?

My comment is that fixed messages are a very rocky road.  I remember peripheral 
discussions on doing something like that for SMTP and LDAP (I think). 
Contentious and not productive.  Relative to other things one could spend one's 
time one, I suspect it's not worth it.
