Sorry for the late notice, but...

I received a phone message this morning from Steve Ross-Talbot, the chair of
the WSCG. He would like me to address the CG tomorrow (!!) at 10 AM Pacific
(it's actually 6 PM London and I haven't looked up the actual time yet). I
haven't had a chance to reply yet or get more details.

If I do manage to hook up with him, are there objections to my setting up
that meeting to give them a synopsis of our work? We can beg off for a
future meeting instead...

Internationalization is an architecture.
It is not a feature.
