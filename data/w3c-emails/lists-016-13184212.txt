Hi Steve,

I got your message from this morning too late in my day today to really consider calling you back. We really would like to take some time to present to your CG and I would be happy to do so tomorrow (today, by the time you see this) at 10 AM Pacific / 18:00 UTC, provided it isn't too late to arrange it. Otherwise (and probably more wisely) we can do it next week or at a time of your choosing.

Several members of the I18N WG have indicated interest in participating as well. If it is possible to arrange for that, please let me know.

I assume the meeting is this one:

WS_WSCG
Web Services CG
Tuesdays
1:00pm-2:00pm/17:00-18:00 UTC
Zakim Bridge +1.617.761.6200, conference 9724 ("WSCG")
12 participants
Hugo Haas <hugo@w3.org>

Please advise. Sorry again about the late reply.

Best Regards,

Addison
