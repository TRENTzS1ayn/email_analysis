Thanks for the comments. See below for resolutions. Made just about all of
the changes, plus a few extra things beating document into submission.

New version online now. AV: please check my changes.

Internationalization is an architecture.
It is not a feature.

This occurrence fixed.

Actually a colon should be used to introduce lists. I note that this item
didn't quite make sense in its context (which is a list of items for which
there might be an international preference). I changed it to read:

<p>Natural language for text processing: parsing, spell checking, and
grammar checking are examples of this</p>

I also cleaned up the list so that all items omit an ending period and use
similar language, etc.

DONE. I used semi-colons in this list to make up for using a colon earlier.

Ah. Yes. Done.

Agreed. xml:lang is now marked up with the <code> tag throughout.

I should make 'locale' a termref everywhere that it occurs. Actually, in
doing it, I find that this is sort of overkill. I'm trying to make the first
occurrence in each section a termref.

It's consistent.

Cleaned up other references to locale to be all lowercase, except when
referring to the Java class (which we do in a couple of examples). In these
cases I replaced with <code>java.util.Locale</code> to make the usage clear.

Replaced sentence with this text:

For example, a system might define a locale of "en-US" (English, United
States). This locale encompasses
several time zones, so the user's preferred time zone...

Will spell check when done. Fixed these. Replaced vs with "versus"

You know not what you ask. I rewrote the paragraph to accommodate this as
follows:

<p>Web services, in contrast, must allow disparate systems to interoperate
in a consistent, non-proprietary manner. This design allows systems to
invoke each other without regard to the internal architecture of any part of
the system. It is helpful to think of a Web service as an remote procedure
call ("RPC"), even though many Web services do not use the SOAP-RPC pattern.
Unlike Web applications that can store user preferences in a session-like
object hidden from the requester, Web service interoperability requires a
shared model, if processing is to produce consistency between expectations
and result.</p>

Formerly:

<p>Web services, by contrast, must interoperate between systems in an
RPC-like way (even though many Web services do not use the SOAP-RPC pattern,
it is helpful to think about it this way for a moment). Web applications can
store user preferences in a session-like object which is hidden from the
requester. Interoperability at an API level requires a shared model, if
processing is to produce consistency between expectations and result.</p>

Modified substantially:

<p><emph>Description Scenario B:</emph>The same method is implemented taking
a single string argument instead. The programmer creating the method writes
logic to translate the string into the appropriate internal locale object.
This logic may be substantial and  must be repeated or shared for each
locale-affected method. There is no way to associate the string argument
with locale functionality in the provider, locale or language identifiers
available in the transport, or to describe the parameter fully and
consistently in directories. A system invoking the service might not be able
to create a string in the expected format. The provider may not be able to
validate the information appropriately.</p>

its locale information from the runtime environment is deployed as a Web
service. "

Reformatted.

Sender sends a request to a Provider, expecting a result in a specific
locale.

DONE. Some more rewording in this para.

DONE. Reworded this as:

<code>zh-Hant</code>, the RFC3066 language tag for Chinese written in the
Traditional Han script might fall back to <code>zh</code> which represents
generic Chinese and, on many systems, implies the use of the Simplified Han
script

Reworked a bunch of the items in here, making changes as suggested, but also
making the parenthetical items into fully explanatory sentences.

Moved. Graphic needs fixing still.

Slightly different rewording was done.

Unga-bunga. Reworded para as:

As an example, the XML Schema Datatype
<code>date</code>
   uses the format YYYY-MM-DD from ISO 8601. This format is similar
(and in some
   cases even identical)  to some actual formats used in some locales. The
format is unambiguous and can be
   understood by a human reading the XML file. Although it is the
appropriate format in some locales and not in others, it can be understood
to be a locale-independent format. By contrast, if XML Schema had chosen a
format
that is not
   used in any locale, such as just numbering days since a well-defined
day, it would
   have made the format much more difficult for humans to work with,
without any
   benefits.

Noted and working on it, as you can see.
