1. Introduction

I am afraid I don't clearly understand the purpose of this document from
the introduction section. Can we add a sentence like the following
before the 3rd paragraph?

"This document is intended to describe the requirements to address these
internationalization issues, and these requirements must be met in order
to successfully develop internationalized Web Services Standards."

If this is out of context, perhaps I don't fully understand the last
sentence of the second paragraph of "Status of this Document", saying
"We intend to use these requirements as input for the next phase of our
work".

2.6. R006 Multi-Lingual Service Discovery Requirements

The title of this section doesn't seem to fit well because its parent
title says "Requirements".  How about we change this to "R006
Multi-Lingual Service Discoverability"?

Sorry again if this is too out of context. I just want to make sure I
fully understand.
