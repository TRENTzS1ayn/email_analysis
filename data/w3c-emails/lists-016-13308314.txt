Hi Takao,

Let me start with number 2: how about "Multi-lingual Service Discovery"
(full stop)?

For the first one, I agree that the Introduction doesn't convey the document
purpose as well as it could. How about me adding this (slightly altered)
version of your text:

"This document describes requirements to address internationalization
issues. The Web Services Task Force feels that these requirements must be
addressed in order to internationalize Web services technologies."

Internationalization is an architecture.
It is not a feature.
