Please feel free to edit "my English" as you wish. Any alteration is
welcome.

However, I am still not fully convinced the document is clearly stating the
purpose of the doc even with your further edit.  Can we add "must be
addressed by whom"?  Will that be the people who work on the core standards,
or just ourselves as i18n TF, or someone else?
