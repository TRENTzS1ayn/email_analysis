The "whom" is presumably W3C I18N WG after our chartering... but some of the
pieces might be addressed by different groups. We can say that. How about:

"This document describes requirements to address internationalization issues
in Web service technologies. The Task Force feels that these requirements
must be addressed in order for truly internationalized Web services to
emerge and that the W3C and especially the Internationalization Activity
should address the requirements in the near future."

Internationalization is an architecture.
It is not a feature.
