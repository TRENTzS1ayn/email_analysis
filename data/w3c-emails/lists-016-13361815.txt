All:

I have been working to put real working versions of our Usage Scenario Web services on line... and I've got some starting results.

I have a copy of webMethods Glue (our Web Services provider product) running on www.inter-locale.com. So far I have five demos running. You can invoke each service using any SOAP client, including the public one at http://www.soapclient.com/soapclient

The URLs for the WSDL are:

http://www.inter-locale.com:8004/glue/shared/getTime
http://www.inter-locale.com:8004/glue/shared/serviceDetermined
http://www.inter-locale.com:8004/glue/shared/userInfluenced
http://www.inter-locale.com:8004/glue/shared/i18ndemo
http://www.inter-locale.com:8004/glue/shared/MoreDeadly

The first one is our locale-neutral example.
The second one is a service determined example: it returns whether a given date is the first day of the week (Locale == USA, TimeZone == America/Los_Angeles)
The third one is a user influenced version of the second one. The not-well-named string arguments are an RFC3066 language ID (for locale) and an Olsen/Java TimeZone ID (for timezone). Bad input leads to the USA and GMT.

The last two have a hodge-podge of stuff in them. I won't doc them here. My goal is to go back and add some more demos for each of the Usage Scenarios so that I can generate the SOAP and WSDL for use as reference material. Actually invoking the services is pretty cool as a demo too.

Thanks,

Addison
