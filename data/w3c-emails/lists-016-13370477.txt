Folks,

I've done some editing on the Usage Scenarios today. Mostly I worked on making references to requester and provider more consistent. I also placed some real WSDL examples and did some wordsmithing in 4.1 and 4.2. I added the 'isFirstDayOfWeek' example to Service Determined, but kept the huge noodle extravaganza intact.

I also generated a couple more small Java demos on http://www.inter-locale.com:8004/glue/shared/currencyExample (for section 4.2.2). I added three scenarios to 4.2.4 (the description scenarios).

Have you:

  o  signed up to write text
  o  thought about writing text
  o  tried the demos

Just curious. The list has been silent and our next meeting is Tuesday.

Ravenous for text,

Addison

Internationalization is an architecture. 
It is not a feature.
