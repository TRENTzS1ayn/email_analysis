To answer your question: "no", since we don't know any better than anyone else what the major numbered sections are going to end up doing: we were all at the F2F where these sections were created. Our work together (and mine individually) has been linear, working down to 4.x. This material has mostly been cohesive. We haven't discussed at all the structure of the following material and my edits in these sections has been confined to wordsmithing and cleanup.

Much of the stuff at the very bottom of the document is slag waiting to be moved up into an appropriate position. The empty stuff in 5.x and 6.x was the outline we created. If we can't figure out what to do with a section, maybe it shouldn't be there?

I'm a bit concerned that our document illustrate our requirements better. Some of the other material strikes me as extraneous if that is our goal.

Internationalization is an architecture. 
It is not a feature.
