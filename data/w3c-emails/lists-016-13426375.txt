All:

I just posted the latest editor's copy of the Usage Scenarios document. The main changes are that I disposed of some of my action items by incorporating Mark Davis' example for I-022, Andrea's calendar stuff, Deb's comments and so forth. I also inserted some more editor's notes to replace inline text.

Internationalization is an architecture. 
It is not a feature.
