Finally got it "done".

This borrows heavily from  UDDI, and I don't really like the discussion 
on fall-back. Even so, it should help highlight the problems and needs 
for well defined discovery mechanisms.   I can't be on the call today 
(another meeting), but let me know what you all think.   I didn't bother 
to convert to XML.

Cheers,

       Mike____
