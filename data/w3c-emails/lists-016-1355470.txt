Very good.

Well, those who don't know what they are are probably not interested
in using them. And we should avoid giving the impression that they
are something important to know.

Yes, I think this is the best thing to do.

I think this is a good, practical example. Whatever they do in
their database is not really our problem.

The software that tolerated it was faulty.

Very good. For the example above, the best thing to do is
to use XML for the separators. E.g.
value1<sep/>value2<sep/>value3...

That's what XML is for.

If they want to use XML, they should at least try to use it the
right way. And we should help them understand what the right
way is. They can always decide to do something else on their own.

Your example doesn't show that. XML has a perfect way of exchanging
structured data.

Also, in some way, the use case above looks like they just needed
*any* character. Maybe converting it to a PUA character would
be another solution (but I don't like that, either).

Yes, I think we should do that.

Yes, very good.

I haven't said that.

The paragraph that mentions base64 does not say anything about
the data being binary, and the problems for i18n if the data
is textual. If you have discussed that, and it's going to be
updated, that's good.

Some more points:

- For XML 1.1, clearly say that it is not yet a Recommendation.
- If possible, don't use notes. In most cases, they can be
   replaced with a direct link.
- In note 4, change "For example, eacute is the Character Entity Reference"
   to "For example, &eacute; is the Character Entity Reference"
