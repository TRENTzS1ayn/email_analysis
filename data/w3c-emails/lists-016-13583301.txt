Status unknown.

Not yet done, will get UDDI stuff done by next meeting.

> 6. MD: Ping WSA about usage scenario uptake.

WSA may be disbanded by end of January, and usage scenarios document is not in 
good enough shape to show them now.  May have to abandon this AI.
Discussion of what it means if the WSA is disbanded.  Martin suggested that 
working on architectural issues from a working group isn't a very effective 
approach.

> 7. AP: Ping new WSCG chair: plan to liase as our requirements emerge. [pending]

Status unknown.


2. Review work on USWD: Need to gauge our progress and see what we can do to get 
a draft out soon.

Tex went over the document.

**AI - All - by next meeting - Review sections 1 - 4.1.3.3 for content, if 
wordsmithing, let the rest of the group know via email to the list.

If someone wants to work on the rest of the doc, OK, send a mail.

> 3. Other business.

No other business except face-to-face, waiting for Addison.

Send additions or corrections.
