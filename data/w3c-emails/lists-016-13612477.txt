All,
My comments on Usage Scenario sections 4.0 - 4.1.3.3.
Andrea

4.1.1
------
Switching back and forth from "locale neutral" to "language neutral" is 
confusing and will make people think that they are interchangeable.  If we want 
to take on both cases, we should talk about them both and explain the the terms.

4.1.1.1
-------
We should clarify that this example implies there are no returned error messages 
or responses with any verbiage.

4.1.2
-----

"This may be due to how the service's code is written, how the provider is 
configured ..." => awk, how about
"This may be due to the way the service's code is written, the provider's 
configuration ...", or,
"This may be due to the way the service's code is written, the way the provider 
is configured ..."

4.1.2.1
-------
Note:  Alcohol is a risky example, due to cultural attitudes to alcohol in some 
parts of the world.  I suggest something less controversial, say, office 
objects, or vegetarian food items, or simple household objects.  How about 
noodles?  The US item could be "egg noodles", the German one "Sp?tzle", and the 
Japanese one "udon". (Can you tell I'm hungry?)

"... part number, quantity, language, description, size, list price."
                                                         ^and
"If all of the information was maintained ..." =>
"If all of the information is maintained ..." or, less preferable,
"If all of the information were maintained ..." (yes, English has a 
subjunctive/conditional tense)

"budweiser" => "Budweiser" (but again I strongly advise against alcohol in any 
example)
"kirin" => "Kirin"

" ... it's capabilities are limited ..." => "its"

" ... the service could still not offer product from ... "
                                                ^s

4.1.3.1
-------

" ... with Japanese language description."
                                         ^s

"web" => "Web" (throughout doc)

4.1.3.2
-------
"Really this is something the provider should provide, ..." need to clarify why 
this is so, even if it's a reference to another section in the doc.
