4.1.1

    Agree with Andrea re: language neutral and locale-neutral.  Stick
    with locale neutral as in the main bullets of 4.1
    2+2=4 in every locale.

4.1.1.1

    "Time of day, although it is presented with different formats around
    the world, is measured the same way everywhere and a standardized
    single frame of reference is available to be used."
           maybe change to:
    Time of day, although it is presented with different formats and
    perhaps different calendars around the world, if using a
    standardized method is measured the same way everywhere and a single
    frame of reference is available to be used.

    "... including shifting the time into the local time zone."
           maybe change to
    "... including shifting the time into the local time zone or even a
    local calendar, e.g., Arabic or a Japanese imperial calendar.

4.1.1.2

    ... does not require extra locale information ...

4.1.1.3

    No additional locale attributes or information are required for this
    pattern a locale neutral service.

This is not really that huge of an example.  But we could simplify it - 
order processing in local language only, one and only one service/wsdl 
provided per locale due to locale processing limitations.

Add "GetProductInventory" as a name for the service.  See notes to 4.1.3.1

    I've got a good example I use: "wrench".  Tools (and vegetables) are
    great because they really are different between almost every locale.
    Here are a few translations:

        en-US   wrench
        en-GB   spanner
        de-DE   Schl?ssel
        hu-HU   csavarkulcs
        jp-JA   <???>

    descriptions could be "torque wrench", "monkey wrench", etc. 
    Replace "beer" with "tool" or "noodle".

    Are there still systems with 7-bit ASCII (answer: Cobol is still
    alive :-( )

4.1.2.2

    It is unclear from the introduction to this section that you have
    one and only one service/wsdl per supported locale.  Perhaps we
    should make a simple statement to that fact.

4.1.3

    "... locale preferences specified by the user ... user's ...." 
    maybe change to "... locale preferences specified by the client. ...
    client's ..."  The client my be human, or it may be another
    application or service.  Ultimately, there is a human somewhere at
    the end-point,  but I prefer "client" for these descriptions.

    "The service should therefore provide a way for the user's client's
    locale preferences to be communicated to the service and, if there
    is a response, the actual locale values used to perform the
    processing should be returned to the client."

    "GetProductInventory" does not appear anywhere else in the doc.  It
    looks like it is refering to the example in 4.1.2.1.  Therefore, we
    should add "GetProductInventory" to 4.1.2.1 example.

    Same comment on "user" vs. "client"

    (nit) I would remove "Really"
