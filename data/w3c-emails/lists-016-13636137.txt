Hi Andrea,

Thanks for the comments. I made changes as noted below... some of the
changes were more extensive than your suggestions. These are as noted. New
version online.

This was sloppy. Original:

<quot>A language neutral service generally is one that executes in the same
way regardless of the current runtime locale or user preferences regarding
language. This implies that all or most strings embedded in the service are
not human readable. This is, by far, the most common pattern. In a language
or locale neutral service, external factors do not alter the way the service
performs. An example of this would be a service that adds two integers
together: 2+2 = 4 in most every locale.

Language neutral services, being the default, do not generally announce
themselves in their service contracts, although (other scenarios apply
here).
</quot>

I would propose this as a replacement:

<quot>
<p>A locale neutral service is one that executes in the same
way regardless of the locale applied to the service. An example of this
would be a service that adds two integers together: 2+2 = 4 in every
locale.</p>

<p>This suggests that strings embedded in the service are not human readable
and that data processed by the service is not being handled in a culturally
sensitive way. </p>

<p>Locale neutral services, being the default, do not generally need to
announce
their locale  in their service contracts, although information about the
locale
or language preference of the requester may still be useful in a variety of
cases.</p>
</quot>

I think we can leave out error messages, since these are dealt with
elsewhere. I modified the example to make the "no text" point clear, as
follows:

<p>For example, the service response would contain a single value
'currentTime' using the current
UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) time in the ISO 8601 format: hh:mm:ss.sss,
mandated by the
<xspecref href="...">time</xspecref> datatype in  XML Schema
Part 2: Datatypes <bibref ref="XMLS-2"/>.</p>

This makes it clear that the response in the example does not have a text
field. (Okay, it doesn't say "no text", but it is an example of a service
which has no text... is that good enough?)

Agreed. Changed these paragraphs as follows:

<p>In the Service Determined pattern, the service provides a specific
localized set of behavior determined prior to the request.</p>

<p>That is, the service does something in a culturally sensitive or
locale affected way. The locale used in this processing is inherent
in how the service is implemented or configured. For example, it
might be the default locale of the system where the service is running. </p>

<p>It may also be a configuration option of the service, provider,
or provider agent. One example of this would be a service that provides
several
bindings, each with a separate locale.</p>

<p>The preferences of the requester do not influence how the service
executes and may not influence aspects of the service such as the
language of messages returned and so forth.</p>

This is an awful example: it is too large for the purpose it has been given.
Before I SAR beers with noodles, we should discuss replacing it altogether
with a smaller example.

There is already a note to that effect here.
