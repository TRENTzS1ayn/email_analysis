All:

I note that, despite uploading new XML files to the Website for Usage Scenarios, the HTML doesn't appear to be appearing automagically, as advertised. I have held off uploading a new locally made HTML version, since that may mess up the automatic mechanism. So if you want to see edits, go to:
