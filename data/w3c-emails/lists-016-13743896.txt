<apphillips> web services meeting in October @ Oracle 
<apphillips> (discussion) 
<apphillips> 1. Need to research how to participate. 
<apphillips> 2. Position paper by mid-August?? 
<apphillips> --- 
<apphillips> 34 Draft UTS #35 Locale Data Markup Language  
<apphillips>    http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/  
<apphillips>    This is still on the rewiev page, although the review period ended  
<apphillips>    in early May. This should probably be reviewed by the WS Task Force,  
<apphillips>    but a thorough review may take quite a bit of time.  
<apphillips>    One thing that should be fixed is the built-in dependency on  
<apphillips>    locale identifier syntax and its hierarchy.  
<apphillips> --- 
<apphillips> (discussion) 
<apphillips> AP: closing action to core to do review in our group 
<apphillips> discussion of points of order. 
<apphillips> Action: group: review. 
<apphillips> Action: Liason: check on real due date. 
<apphillips> (that's MD) 
<apphillips> --- 
<apphillips> discussion of LDML, CLDR, rfc3066bis, draft-locales, and WS-I18N 
<apphillips> what form should locale ids take? Rec? RFC? or some CLDR related thing? 
<apphillips> who should do it? 
<apphillips> AV: use *these* identifiers is okay. W3C okay to do this? probably not right mission for W3C to define identifiers themselves. 
<apphillips> where does the pointer point? not required to point to CLDR. Can point to whatever. 
<apphillips> MD: in USA at end of June.
