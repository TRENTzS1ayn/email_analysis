All:

I have just posted the updated Action Items List complete with nifty color coding here:

http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/ActionItemList.html

We have just three remaining issues:

3.0 Also there is a lingering note to mention RFC2277... or make it a reference or something... and heck we can mention 3536 and the CharMod and some other stuff. [Owner Mike] <i>Forgot to add this previously.</i>

4.16.x Need text about SMTP, MIME, IRIs, etc. [Owner Martin]

4.13.3 Provide text  (Visa vs. Carte Bleu) [Owner Mike]

The items in 4.13 and 4.16 are basically empty shells that need filling. I don't think the ownership is particularly important, although I believe, Mike, that you had some text on the Carte Bleu thing??

The other item (in 3.0) might be disposable.

If we can clean these items out and then do a read-through, we should be DONE with Usage Scenarios.

Best Regards,

Addison
