The XML Protocol WG has reviewed the "Requirements for the
Internationalization of Web Services" WD at
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-ws-i18n-req-20031217/.

Two of the six requirements are relevant to SOAP and so are of concern
to this WG: "R001 SOAP Locale Feature" and "R004 SOAP International
Policy Feature".

The WG has no issues with either R001 or R004.  Their use of
SOAP 1.2 terminology is correct, as is the reference to Section 5, A
Convention for Describing Features and Bindings [1], of the SOAP 1.2
Part 2 Recommendation.

While the two requirements use the SOAP Feature mechanism defined by
this WG, we assume that the Web Services Internationalization Task
Force will take on the work of defining the specific SOAP Features
required.

As editorial review, in the first paragraph of Section 1,
Introduction, the text "XML based" should be "XML-based", and in the
second paragraph, the text "this document" should be "that document".

Regards,


Tony Graham
