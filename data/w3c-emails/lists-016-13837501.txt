Incorporated (at last!)

Also deleted the comment about RFC 2277.

Note: I modified the material about MIME to be more CharMod compliant (using character encoding, not charset, while indicating that the parameter is called charset in MIME).  I also wrote some experimental text about Content-Language and how it (doesn't actually) relate to locales.

I need to add a couple links and we need to address some of AV's comments.

Best Regards,

Addison
