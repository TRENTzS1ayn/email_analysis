I have found the following issue with regards to using HTTP
Accept-Language: for determining the locale of a user:

The way HTTP matches language ranges and language tags is
described in Section 14.4 of RFC 2616
(http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4):

Accept-Language: en     matches          Content-Language: en-us
but
Accept-Language: en-us  does no match    Content-Language: en

This means that browsers should send general things such as 'en'
rather than the more specific labels such as 'en-us', or both.
But for using this to determine a locale, the more specific,
the better.


Regards,    Martin.
