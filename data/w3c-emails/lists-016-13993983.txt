Hi Steve,

It was a pleasure to meet you at the TechPlenary. This is a ping just to start the conversation between the WS coordination group and the I18N WG, Web Services Task Force.

We've been hard at work on Usage Scenarios and Requirements documents, which we hope to advance to Note status soon. Some of our work is likely to serve as the basis of future i18n work on Web services or infrastructure that impacts Web services. As we discussed, sometime in the near future I'd like to do a presentation of our work, findings, and plans to the coordination group.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Best Regards,

Addison

It is not a feature.
