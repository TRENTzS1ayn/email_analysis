Hi Andrea,

You're first with your assignments! Thanks!!

I think the word 'documents' in USWD means explicitly SOAP documents or
their WSDL analogs. In this case, it probably really means 'types' such as
those described by WSDL (see http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20/#eii-types). This
may actually be a deep topic; too deep to really deal with here? Designing
internationalized data structures would make a good book length topic :-).

The timezone examples are fine.

To be honest, I think we need to decide just how much i18n primer we're
going to provide in the finished document. The timezone material seems
important to mention. In depth coverage here might be too much to ask for.

Best Regards,

Addison

Internationalization is an architecture.
It is not a feature.
