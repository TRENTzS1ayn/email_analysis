Hello Addison,

Here is the new text of section 4.1.4. Please put it into your copy
of the usage scenarios document.

Regards,    Martin.

<p>In a data driven service, locale aspects of the execution depend on  the 
data
itself, rather than the client or the server. As an example, a service 
dealing with
flight schedules will use the time zones of the respective departure and 
arrival
locations for departure and arrival times, rather than some server-related 
timezone
or the timezone preference of the client. As another example, a service 
dealing with
multiple currencies will interpret each monetary amount as being in the 
associated
currency @@@@pointer to example????@@@@, rather than assuming a currency 
based on
server settings or client preferences.</p></div3>
