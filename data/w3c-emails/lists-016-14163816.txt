Hi,

Good example. Note that translating Gozen and Gogo to AM and PM works out ok,
but the 0:00 needs to convert to 12:00. Same confusion apparently exists in
English, see excerpts from Heritage dictionary below.

> Time       : To doWestern/English
> ---------- : -----------------------
> GOZEN 8:00 : Breakfast    8:00 A.M.
> GOGO  0:00 : Lunch       12:00PM
> GOGO  7:00 : Dinner7:00 PM
> GOZEN 0:00 : Go to bed12:00AM

P.M. also p.m. or P.M.
abbr. post meridiem.
Usage Note: By definition, 12 A.M. denotes midnight, and 12 P.M. denotes noon,
but there is sufficient confusion over the meanings of A.M. and P.M. when the
hour is 12 to make it advisable to use 12 noon and 12 midnight where clarity is
required.

also a.m. or A.M.ante meridiem. 
Usage Note: By definition, 12 A.M. denotes midnight, and 12 P.M. denotes noon,
but there is sufficient confusion over these uses to make it advisable to use
12 noon and 12 midnight where clarity is required.
