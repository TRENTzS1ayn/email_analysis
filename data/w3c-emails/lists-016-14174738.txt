Agreed and you can't assume that "no parking" would not apply so late in the
evening.

I got a very expensive ticket in NYC because I assumed that meters would not
apply after 11pm.
We had gone to chinatown for late dinner and it turns out you needed to put
money in the meter through to midnight.

Now I know that when they say the city never sleeps, they mean they tax you
24x7.
