This one should generate HTML successfully. A few minor edits were made.

I promise to send the telecon notes later today. In the meantime: we decided to go for publication this coming week. We'd like to finish all work on the document, thus it is very important for task force members to review their action items to ensure completion and review the document and send in any comments BEFORE Thursday.

Thanks,

Addison
