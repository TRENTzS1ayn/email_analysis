Hello Addison, others,

I added an Ethiopic calendar example and removed the corresponding
editorial note. Addison, please download the .xml file again.

I found out that one of the months in the Ethiopic calendar is called
Megabit, but I decided to use a less confusing month in the example :-).

Regards,   Martin.
