SARing initial caps. I used Provider and Requester when refering to a
specific example ("Requester A") and provider and requester in all other
instances. Service and Locale both followed this already, it turns out
(instances of "Locale" in the text refer to the Java construct called that).

While doing this: rewrote 4.1.5.2, which had issues.

Fixed this. Removed a paragraph that use currency oddly. Now it reads
better. Examples fixed.

Fixed. Added link to ISO8601 to the biblio. Reorged the biblio (put the RFCs
together and in numeric order, added RFC822, added ISO 8601).

Rewrite changed this to: "The user could supply credentials, such as a
login, to the application..."

I did this for all scenarios, rewriting slightly to be consistent (for
example, floating references were made concrete so a sentence like: '"B"
takes a foobar.' now reads: 'Service B takes a foobar.')

Ask the questions and we'll see how well we've done.

Adding non-break spaces to all ISO and RFC references.

Don't understand...

No, the difference between a "default" value and a currency object is that
the value and currency don't travel together...

You can have many SOAP headers.

I don't see the currency examples in Pandora........
