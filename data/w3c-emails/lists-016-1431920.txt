Hello John,

Thanks, these are great ideas.

Yes, but we have to do a bit more work on that one, to get
at least a bit above the 'this is a fix, but we have no idea
why it works' level.

There are two problems here:
- What do we do if the site switches back to some legacy encoding
   (this is a question we often have with other things such as validation
    or accessability, but for Unicode, it's probably less of a problem)
- W3C is in various ways required to be neutral. We'll have to check
   with our comm team whether this is okay or not.

Very good idea. Main point may be how to word the question general
enough to catch all the audience, but specific enough to sound
interesting.

Very good idea, too. By the way, what is your opinion on
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation, in particular the
languages column?
