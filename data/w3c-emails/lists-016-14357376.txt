Seems ok to me.
I liked your additions around the UCA.

Should the "a" before Modern, be there?
"as with  Traditional or a Modern ordering in Spanish"

Maybe replace this :
"may be incorrect or be perceived to be incorrect by a human observer."

with
"may be incorrect or inconsistent with expectations."

It's not a big deal either way. (When I read about perceptions by an observer
it makes me think of Schroedinger's cat... ;-)
In the context of web services we should try to minimize the references to
humans and users.)

I didn't notice any other changes but it seems ok to me.
Upcorp it!
