Tex,
Excellent write-up!  I learned a lot from this.

For Web Services, in scenarios where the ordering of textual data is critical to its correct utilization, it can be extremely difficult to identify the appropriate collation rules to use with sufficient precision and to insure those rules are either followed by any services that operate on the data or that appropriate action is taken to compensate for any services that do not use the desired collation rules. (For example, re-sorting the data downstream).

For example, the identifier does not indicate which sort ordering should be used. Types of sort orderings include: telephone, dictionary, phonetic, binary, stroke-radical or radical-stroke. In the latter two cases, the reference for stroke count may also need to be cited. A language identifier may be suggestive as to whether a requester expects a Traditional or a Modern sort ordering (in Spanish for example) but it may not be definitive.

For example, a User Agent may provide a drop-down list which sorts the elements of the list at run-time differently from the other components of the UA. Information retrieved from a database may be ordered by an index which has no correlation with the requester's requirements. When different components or subsystems or Web Services use different collation rules, then errors can occur. They are not always hard errors (i.e. generate faults) but the resulting data, operations, or events, may be incorrect.

Should certain characters be ignored? For example, hyphens are often ignored so that "e-mail" and "email" sort together.

"St. Botolph St." (in Boston) would expand to "Saint Botolph Street". (Well on a good day, given the ambiguity of "St.".)

If sorting is performed sequentially field by field,  then significant differences in the firstname field are swamped by minute differences in the lastname field. This can be improved by treating the fields as merged and then sorting.

Searching customer names entered by keyboard would use a different collation. Searching for text in a document may use less sensitive collations for ease of use and so the requester doesn't have to make repeated queries with alternative spellings.

This can consume resources and delay the further use of the results until the entire set can be collated. Alternatively, if results are returned in the order needed by the requester, then the requester can begin to process the first records returned without waiting for the remaining records to arrive.

Database indexes are updated as the data is added to the database, not at the time a request arrives. Requests that can use the preordained collation of the index have a significant performance advantage over requests that either cannot use indexes or must resort results.
