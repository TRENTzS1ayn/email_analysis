This mail and the previous one (included below) don't appear to have
made it to the geo list for some reason. (We did have mail problems last
week).
Please have a quick check for any other mails you sent but think are
missing from the list.

Richard,

Good points on Questions 1 and 2. I'll move forward with rough drafts
for both.

As for three, I agree that it does raise many more questions, so it
probably makes more sense to focus on the navigation guidelines
document. I'll take a look.

Thanks.

Note that I have reworked this since last nights meeting.  Mostly just
editorial, but also replaced <span> with 'inline element' in the text.

Sounds a useful question, though it might be better to phrase it as "Do
any corporate Web sites support Unicode?"  We don't want to appear to be
pointing the finger at people who are not, but I agree it would be very
nice to list 5-10 sites that do.

Maybe we could generalise this a little.  Eg, "I added some foreign text
to my web page, but the text isn't displaying properly.  What's wrong?"
Then by all means use the Korean as the example.

Nice one.  :-)  We could possibly even put a select control on the
page??  This could run to quite a long answer though - use of Unicode,
what to do about fonts, select to support graphics in XHTML 2.0, how to
indicate that this is a global gateway in a non-language specific way,
is this the right approach anyway, ....   We actually have a section
planned for the guidelines on navigation
(http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/#ri20030510.103101716)
would you like to instead provide some material for this section?

Thanks for this!
