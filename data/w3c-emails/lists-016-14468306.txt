In Japanese, and probably some other scripts, there are further 
complications, as the identical word or name might be written using 
Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana or Romaji (Roman script) or a mixture of the 
scripts.

E.g. When studying for my MA, in Japanese, my name would appear on 
Japanese course material in Katakana, while it appears on English course 
material in Roman script. For someone sorting course marks by name, it 
would be reasonable for them to expect my marks to appear together...
