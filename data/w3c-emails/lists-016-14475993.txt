For publication, Addisson improved some of the alt texts, and I did
some more work. However, I realized that the four images
about international context settings (section @@@) contain
mostly text, rather than an actual image. In order to improve
accessibility, we should change these images to tables, or think
about other ideas, for the next publication. We can keep one
image to give the impression of the visual dialog.

Regards,     Martin.
