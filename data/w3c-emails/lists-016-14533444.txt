David,

That's an interesting and relevant example.
I imagine transliteration of people's names and company names and products is
common enough that a web service offering library cataloguing or even just
directory information would want to 'normalize' text for ease of processing and
matching.

For example, pepsi and coke have their names spelled differently around the
world. Someone inquiring about the company might use a native spelling but
still want results based on content in any language.

I am not sure if this is a subset of the more general translation problem
(looking for information on a particular topic in any language requires
translations and thesaurus's for the languages) or a separate issue.

Strikes me as being a legitimate separate issue.
