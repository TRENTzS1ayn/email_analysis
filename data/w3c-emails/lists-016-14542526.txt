The prior sentence is tough to grok for ESL folks, how about -
"It is even more difficult when the data is multilingual."

Er, maybe -
"For Web services, in scenarios where the ordering of textual data is critical 
to its correct utilization, it can be difficult to identify the collation rules 
to use with enough precision to ensure those rules are either a) followed by any 
services that operate on the data, or b) that appropriate action is taken to 
compensate for any services that do not use the desired collation rules (for 
example, by re-sorting the data downstream)."

But if anyone can think of a way to further break up that very looonnnnnng 
sentence, so much the better.

Are the semi-colons syntactically necessary?  or should they be commas?

remove the parens around "source standard" and use the word "or" instead

As long as you're giving an example, follow it through -
"For example, a User Agent may provide a drop-down list which sorts the elements 
  in telephone book order at run-time while the data was retrieved from a 
database in dictionary order."

or something along those lines.  Not sure what to retain from the following 
sentence.
