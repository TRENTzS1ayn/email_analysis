hmmm. Still uneasy. What happens in fact is that whenever we (or anyone else)
gets an underspecified request, we *have* to do something. So for example, if we
get a naked 'zh' on a resource lookup, then we have to pick either 'zh-Hant' or
'zh-Hans' (logically, if not physically). If we get es-BO on a collation
request, then we have to choose *some* sorting. And the default sort may be
different for different locales, that is true. But "suggestive" is not
indicative of the true process.

Of course, where there is a handshake, one can communicate back: "Don't know
what you mean by "es-BO": pick either "es-BO-x-collationtraditional" or
"es-BO-x-collationmodern". But normally that option n'exist pas.

And most should. A fully determinate sort is not generally worth the cost (see
tn9). However, when sorting, at at least the case and accent level, plus
punctuation (if applicable), they should not be ignored in sorting, although may
be ignored in searching.

The "ignore punctuation" option really means "make punctuation a really weak
strength".

It is done, but what I mean by "limited environment" is that "replace all
acronyms" makes no sense unless you have a very limited vocabulary, in a very
restricted domain, like "Dental Supplies". How are you supposed to sort "ICU"
when it could have the following expansions???

I think it just needs to be removed. Mixing operations from different languages
will always get you into trouble; this has nothing really to do with the example
you want to make.

Well, you're the only one ;-). On a short list, the performance overhead to
being precise is miniscule -- I would never recommend being sloppy just for
that!!

Me too. Same denomination, perhaps.
