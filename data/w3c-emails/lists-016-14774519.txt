>The XMLP WG has decided this week to seek Last Call for its work on an 
>optimization mechanism for SOAP messages. We expect to submit the LC 
>document suite within the next week or so.
>
>The LC suite will contain the specs:
>SOAP Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism, (aka MTOM)
>XML-binary Optimized Packaging, (aka XOP)
>SOAP Resource Representation Header
>
>In addition, we will be publishing as Notes:
>SOAP Optimized Serialization Use Cases and Requirements
>A FAQ describing the motivation for our use of xop:Include
>SOAP 1.2 Attachment Feature
>
>And at about the same time, we expect to update our SOAP 1.2 
>Recommendation errata which clarifies SOAP 1.2 in light of XML 1.1.
