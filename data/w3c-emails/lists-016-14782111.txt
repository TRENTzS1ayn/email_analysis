I have checked with the Unicode liaisons about deadlines for
LDML review. Purely editorial comments of a showstopper nature
could still be considered in this cycle if they arrive extremely
soon. But the next review cycle is comming up rather soon, so
I suggest that we have a thorough look then (which we can start now).

Regards,    Martin.
