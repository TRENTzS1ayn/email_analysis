In the cases where these URNs are being used the registered protocol
element is being treated as a Resource in the full meaning of the
term.

RFC 2141 explicitly says that URNs do not need to be resolved to be useful.
Discussion about a resolution mechanism _might_ be in order but the
namespace was needed long before the resolution mechanism might be
in place. To be exact, none of the needs for the namespace required
resolution at all.

You don't get to make that choice. That choice is being thrust on
us by the industry and by the W3C. If we don't provide this then
the current 'http:' URIs that the IANA has now _will_ become
unchangeable entity references in emerging standards.

Huh? There is no _primary_ name for the protocol paramenters. There
are standards that reference the IANA as the place to look, but there
is no way of talking about those parameters using an identifier.

A URI is going to be used regardless of what you or I would like them
to use instead of one. We get to pick whether its what the IANA currently
has at 'http://www.iana.org/whatever/whatever' or something else....

The name 'IANA' does _not_ exist in the name. I don't have a problem
with changing the parameter names to something meaningless....

The URN identifies the parameter. Not its value.

The document requires there to be a registration process.  A URN
is not created for every paramenter unless that parameter has
a need for it.

The IANA doesn't have the resources for that right now.

The document requires an RFC in order for a URN to be assigned.
We never suggest assigning them to all protocol parameters. We
originally though about the idea but after looking realized it
was rather silly. Are you sure you're reading the right version?

Unless that protocol specification actually _uses_ the URN
_as_ the protocol paramenter's name. Which some will....

_I_ wouldn't have a problem with that but the IANA and those
who wanted this document to begin with might. I would gladly hear
some debate on that. I suggest we be quick though. I know of at least
one Working Group that has this as a normative reference and they're
waiting on it....
