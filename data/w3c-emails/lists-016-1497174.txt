what is a charset?
what is a character encoding?
which encoding does country x use?
can I use utf-16 in html web pages?

how can I test that a form works internationally? what kinds of text data or
scenarios should I test it with?

I diligently mark html text with the appropriate lang language identifier. The
text doesn't display any differently. How do I test or evaluate that all the
text is marked correctly; In what situations does it make a difference?

what would an international test plan contain for a typical web site?

My web site is in several languages and is frequently updated. How can I
ensure all the links are pointing to the correct pages and languages? (what is
the easiest file/directory structure to use for this?)

for a multilingual site, should I only have one language selection page, or
allow selections from anypage?
If from any page, should I link to the main page, or to a parallel page in
another language.

can I use flags to represent languages?
