Note, that under my present understanding (making the best of present 
process) the W3C will be putting the *whole* [1] of the registration 
document into the W3C spec. I was originally pursuing the strategy [2] akin 
to 3240 but some think the spec itself should contain the registry 
information, so I will move the non-boilerplate content of [2] into the W3C 
document, and the next version of the internet-draft will be nothing more 
than a one line statement saying "see appendix foo in W3C spec." Even so, 
you get into hairy situations with which spec becomes stable first, and 
which way the references flow under this scenario (which I try to address 
with [1]) though an improved process is desired by some.
