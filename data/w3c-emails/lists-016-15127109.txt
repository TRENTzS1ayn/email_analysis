Yes - and it is likely that this will become policy over time.

That is correct and in fact the intent is exactly the reverse - to
ensure that W3C working groups consider the media registration as part
of their final deliverable, start work on it early enough, and that
the media type documentation gets the same review as the rest of the
specification (last call, candidate rec, AC review, etc).

That gets it into the spec eventuually; it would be better to be in
the spec early on and to handle IESG comments along with other last
call comments, for example.
