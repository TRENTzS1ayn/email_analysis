Hello Mark,

Here are my personal takes:

- public-ietf-w3c@w3.org is a coordination list, not necessarily for
   direct technical discussion. If the conclusion that you have come
   to is that you need to register a new Media Type, then I think
   you should just go forward and do that via the usual channels,
   and assure it gets reviewed e.g. on ietf-types@iana.org.

- I have read "resolve the URI to insert binary characters" below.
   This is rather worrying, because to me it sounds like "square
   circles". I have looked at the actual Miffy spec [3], and
   have seen similar confusing language. I haven't seen a worked-out
   example that would allow me to propose more precise language.

Regards,  Martin.
