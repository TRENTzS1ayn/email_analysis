Very good. Making various lists aware of the issue is never a bad
idea. But as I said, don't expect much feedback here, just go on
to ietf-types@iana.org.

The example is very helpful. I suggest that similar examples
be added to the respective specs. There is a huge difference
between a spec that only talks about information items, and
a spec that also contains an example to help the reader get
a start.

Also, I think it is very important to distinguish binary data
from actual character data. One concern I have is that users
of base64 in general or of this specific mechanism might misuse
it to encode character data in a binary form, which would loose
encoding identification which is done very well for XML.
Can you please try to change the wording with this in mind?
Please tell me if you want this checked.
