Where's the MathML media type documentation?
I can't find it by scanning the TOC of
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-MathML2-20030411/
nor from
http://www.w3.org/Math/Group/draft-spec/

Fielding suggests it's not properly registered.

The TAG has found that "W3C Working Groups engaged in defining a
language SHOULD arrange for the registration of an Internet Media Type
(defined in RFC 2046 [RFC2046]) for that language; see [IANAREG] for
registration instructions."

Have you guys started the registration process?

I don't see anything in the ietf-types archive.
