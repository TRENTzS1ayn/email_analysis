In future, (once there is a 'Standards Tree'), having the registration
in the W3C spec and pointing to it will be the way to go. Until Ned
Freed's ID that revises the registration process becomes a Rec,
though, the registration information has to be copied into a separate
ID not pointed to.

Its a Rec now. What was it at the time?

There is a fundamental problem in that

a) Media registrations need to reference stable documents
b) Stable is defined as Rec
c) To get to rec you need to meet your CR exit criteria
d) To do c) , you need to demonstrate  interoperable implementations
e) implementations need to use a media type
f) goto A

In future, it should be stated that the CR is a 'stable document' for
the purposes of media type registration (it has after all successfully
left last call), and thus that a media type can be registered at that
point. If subsequent changes affect this registration, then the
registration should be updated when you get to Rec.

'Telling W3C' is rather like 'telling IETF'. Clearly (and not just for
W3C working groups) the authors of a registration need to be told
whether it has succeeded or not and if not, what they can do about it.
