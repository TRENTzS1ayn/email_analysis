Is there anything you want to say to the 58th
IETF meeting? or to hear from it?

I just learned about:

  IETF Text Conferencing
  http://xmpp.org/ietf-chat.html

complete with logs:
  http://www.xmpp.org/ietf-logs/

I thought folks here might like to know.

A lot of W3C groups use IRC, and we've been thinking
about Jabber. The IETF seems to be ahead of the game
here.
