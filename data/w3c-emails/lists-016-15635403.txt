Just curious -

Has the W3C considered a policy of registering media types in the vnd. 
tree? E.g.,
   application/vnd.w3c.soap+xml

It seems to me that this may help avoid some of the delays and overhead 
with registration in the IETF tree*, and would encourage use of the 
vnd. and prs. trees by example, so that people wouldn't be prejudiced 
against them.

Just a thought,


* Although since my last post, I've had a report that vnd registration 
with IANA is also quite slow and unpredictable...
