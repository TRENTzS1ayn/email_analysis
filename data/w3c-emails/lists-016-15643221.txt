I personally hate the vnd and prs trees -- it promulgates the same 
failed
design as the x- prefixes.  A reversed dns prefix would at least have
made some sense.

As for the +xml types, a more effective mechanism would have been to
define a major type of xml under the namespace control of W3C, or
barring that an xml tree (application/xml.soap) which could either
be assigned to the W3C or at least incorporate the W3C process.
That would, of course, require an RFC to set up.  The +xml suffix
seems to beg for the most delays.

I haven't heard anything like that -- the Apache mime.types file is
growing at an alarming rate, mostly due to vnd types.
