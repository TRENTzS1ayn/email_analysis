Aha; interesting you mention that. I have an I-D written and ready to 
go for it, but have been holding off because of mixed private feedback. 
Do you *like* this approach, or just dislike it less than vnd/prs?

One suggestion I've heard is to have an xml media type registration 
that allows an attribute to describes either an opaque intent URI or 
the namespace URI of the top-level element; e.g.,
   application/nsxml;ns="http://www.w3.org/..."
(the alternative is to change application/xml itself, but that would be 
more difficult process-wise)

The problem that I see with this approach is that some (most?) MIME 
dispatchers can't do anything with parameters, as explained in the 
appendix of 3023. Still would be interesting to have the alternative, 
though.
