I'm not sure what Roy means by "namespace control of W3C" here, and
would appreciate clarification.

He may be suggesting that no MIME content types beyond application/xml
are needed for XML documents, as XML processors can use namespace
information to differentiate which application should get which chunk
of XML information, and additional information in the MIME content type
would be superfluous.

While I disagree with this view in the current circumstances, it is
certainly coherent - but under no one's control in particular.  I'm not
sure what the W3C would want to add to the current namespace process,
but suspect that "control" would go over badly with the many
organizations beyond the W3C which are in the business of creating XML
vocabularies for public use.

As for this:

It is my understanding that the W3C itself is unwilling to manage
directly any kind of kind of registration system, and that URIs are
supposed to resolve these kinds of problems without the need for
centralized control.

To me as well.
