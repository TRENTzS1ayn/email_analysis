I would offer that there is little technical difference between
   application/vnd.w3c.*+xml
and
   application/*.xml

However, there are major practical issues.  First, for there to be ANY value to the registration, there needs to be a registrar.  Otherwise, there is no likelihood of interoperation.

Second, since the registration would be in the vnd tree, it is up to the W3C to maintain, publish, and control the registry.  That is a problem (beyond the organizational problem of the W3C maintaining a registry) in that Joe Random programmer somehow needs to know to look someplace in the W3C for what registration to use or what a particular value means.

Third, one could easily envision someone in the IETF publishing application/mumble+xml and someone in the W3C publishing application/vnd.w3c.mumble+xml, where they have totally different semantics.  Yes, that is theoretically OK, because they are, by definition, different registrations.  However, most people expect a mumble to be a mumble...

Fourth, and conversely to the third, one could envision someone in the W3C publishing application/vnd.w3c.foo+xml.  Later on, it becomes of value to everyone, so it would make sense registering application/foo+xml in the IETF tree.  However, we then end up with two registrations for the same thing.

On a separate topic, I would strongly suggest AGAINST putting everything under application/xml.  One of the whole points of the MIME type system is that a user agent can make intelligent choices about objects WITHOUT examining the object itself.  If we went the application/xml route, user agents would have to parse the XML to figure out the namespaces, for example.  That can be an undue burden on applications.
