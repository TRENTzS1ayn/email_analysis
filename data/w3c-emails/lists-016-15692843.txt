Re the discussion on public-ietf-w3c on media type
registration 
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-ietf-w3c/2003Sep/0000.html
and following)

Please note that Ned Freed and John Klensin have authored
a proposed update to the MIME registration procedures:


http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-freed-mime-p4-02.txt

which is marked as "Publication Requested" in 
http://www.ietf.org/IESG/status.html, and that Ted Hardie
is area director with the "token".

If you comments on MIME registration procedures, it would
probably be most effective if you could review the proposed
changed procedures and see if they meet your objectives,
and, if not, to comment on the proposed process revision.
