Phil,

This are all good and I believe are the types of questions that Richard was looking to go into the guide lines.  I think we need to remember that we have two audiences we are addressing, 1) The person who just got told he is managing the international website, but the only foreign experience he has is going to the world showcase at Disney world. And 2) the person who has been doing this for a long time, but has come up against something he hasn't seen before.  Really two groups with different needs, but both come to the same site looking for solutions.

Any way enough said, we need to look at both. B^)

Greetings all,

In trying to come up with Q&A content, I was trying to think of how to appeal to a broader audience. In my opinion, the current questions were too advanced, and I fear that they might scare away those that are just starting to explore--or expand into--this area. After reading the previous emails, I see that others have already been thinking that way. These are all great questions! I think we could probably use a few even more elementary questions as well. Below are a few of what I was thinking. Any thoughts?


1. Why are the benefits of adding international-friendly code?

    - quick overview of benefits 
    - demographics of "who" is using the web
    - quick mention of the markup languages,
      and how they work together (Unicode, XML, XHTML, etc.)
    - quick mention of internationalization and localization
    - long-term business benefits


2. What are the first steps in migrating an existing HTML-based site to an international-friendly multilingual enabled XHTML site?

    - walk through a suggested process at a very basic level
      (including analyzing their business requirements and
      future business growth plans)
    - what skills and/or knowledge are needed 
      (refer to supplemental resources)
    - introduce some considerations to help decide 
      what's best for their site/product


3. What are the next steps...?

    - <this could be a "Part 2" to the above question>


4. Which web authoring applications can be used to create multilingual XHTML?

    - <This is often very useful, but do we 
      want to cover this topic?>


5. What design & editorial considerations are there for multilingual sites?

    - discuss and give examples of:
       - current language indicator (& change selector)
       - country indicator (& change selector)
       - font software requirements
       - font treatments across different cultures
    - quick overview of cultural differences in:
      - time/date formats
      - punctuation
      - etc...
    - refer to supplemental internationalization resources 
      which discuss cultural concerns dealing with color,
      religion, etc.


Thanks,

Phil Arko
