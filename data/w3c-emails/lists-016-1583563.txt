What are the pitfalls of using the HTTP Accept Language header to 
determine the locale of the user?

To what extent does my commerce web site need to handle foreign 
currencies?

Do I have to support other number formats?  How can I do this?

I don't want to offend people from country X.  Are there colors or 
images I should avoid in my web pages?

Do display capabilities of computers in foreign countries vary from 
those I'm used to?  Do I need to worry about screen size, number of 
colors, etc.?

By the way, I hereby claim these for my next 5 Q&A's!
