(I think we should go through the issues
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/
and see if we can resolve them.)

Re iadditional-00
As noted at the URI BOF and the discussion there, I have
moved my own position on this issue (iadditional-00) from
being somewhat agnostic to being firmly against adding
any characters in IRIs within the US-ASCII range that are
not allowed in URIs.  I also see no problem in allowing
characters outside of the US-ASCII range.

The issue is not "spaces are bad", the issue is 
"US-ASCII spaces should not be allowed". The fact that
there are other Unicode space characters may mean that
non-ASCII spaces are "allowed", but there should be
another category of "allowed but a really bad idea",
which might well include "Upper-case Greek Alpha otherwise
within a segment of US-ASCII letters".
