The conveying has been done.

I have read that in the TAG minutes here, a week ago, and before.
But I'm wondering how we are supposed to go to RFC if the TAG
hasn't made up its mind, and seems to make very slow progress,
if not going in circles.

Very good piece. While we are at it, two comments:
- Google wouldn't need the additional parameters in the search URI
   (&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). They could just do a check on byte patterns,
   and recognize the extremely specific UTF-8 byte pattern, and then
   assume UTF-8 as the default. If we assume that 'ie' stands for
   input encoding and 'oe' for output encoding, they could also
   at least assume that they are the same, and do the right thing
   if only 'ie' is present.

- I don't understand "This has the potential to play hell with caches
   and proxies and webcrawlers and XML namespaces, since you can have
   the same IRI ending up as a bunch of wildly different looking URIs."

   The only things that can end up differently is the case of the
   hex characters after the %. And caches and webcrawlers take that
   into account. As for XML namespaces, just don't change anything,
   and you are fine.

And the current position is to use A for resolution, and B for
identification (namespaces,...).

I don't understand that. It has always been the case that any URI
is an IRI. I don't see a need to change that.

Do you want to say that unnecessarily hexified IRIs should be
outlawed? I wouldn't mind to discourage unnecessary hexification,
but there is no reason to outlaw it. This is very parallel to URIs,
for example, http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/200%33/0%33/%331/IRI
(replacing every '3' by '%33') isn't a particularly good URI, but
it's not outlawed.

About 'when to hexify', the current draft is pretty clear:
"as late as possible, but not later" (in some more words).

About the mapping from IRIs to URIs: That's described in all
detail. Some changes are needed re. IDNs, but these are already
in the draft as an alternative. If you find any problem with
the description, please tell us.

First, this is not fundamentally about 7-bit systems vs. 8-bit systems.
There are some cases where URIs get transmitted over 7-bit channels
(e.g. in an email labeled as charset=US-ASCII), email these days
can handle 8-bit messages, and systems that really only handle 7 bits
are fortunately exceptions. Squeezing special information into the
8th bit is rarely done these days.

It is fundamentally a question of character repertoire (ASCII vs.
Unicode). And it is important to observe that the cases where
URIs are used as real *identifiers* (namespaces and RDF), thanks
to W3Cs work over the past close to 10 years, there is really no
problem with using Unicode as a repertoire. This is not true for
resolution, but then for resolution, more equivalences than
strict string equivalence have always been used, and we are
not proposing to change that.

Could you please provide this 'ample evidence that this is prone
and shakey to failure'?

There are very few restrictions because there are actually very few
restrictions on URI (and IRI) syntax. And there is also explicit
text that implementations should not check agressively. This is
one way to ensure extensibility and independence of different
components, and is in line with the principle that URIs
are opaque.

Why should IRIs have to fix what URIs didn't manage to keep?
