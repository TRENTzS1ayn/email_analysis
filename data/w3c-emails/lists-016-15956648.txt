This is listed as issue
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/Overview.html#legacyNFC-06

This is carefully based on the principle of early uniform normalization
as described in the W3C Character Model. The assumption is that
Unicode-based encodings are for the most part already in NFC
(and where they are not, this may be on purpose). However,
for non-Unicode encodings, normalization when converting is
sometimes necessary (the most obvious example is windows-1258,
for Vietnamese).

I hope this answers your questions.
