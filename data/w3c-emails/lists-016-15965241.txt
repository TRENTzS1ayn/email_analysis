This is listed as issue
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/Overview.html#bidiIDN-07.


The intend of section 4 was to closely match the design of IDN.
The prohibited bidi control characters are the same as those in
ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3454.txt, section 5.8.
The restrictions in section 4.2 are designed to be equivalent to
condition 2) and 3) in section 6 of
ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3454.txt. Anyway, with
respect to character restrictions, the restrictions on IDNs
are inherited by IRIs.

What may be missing, in IDN(A) rather than in IRI, is a
description of how a sequence of labels with different
character classes (e.g. latin.ARABIC.latin) is to be displayed,
in particular, what is the base directionality.
ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3490.txt lists [UAX9]
as an informative reference, but doesn't cite it.
But maybe I have missed something.
