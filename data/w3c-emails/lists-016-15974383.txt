It doesn't sound reasonable if you intend IRI comparison to be 
interoperable. If you don't intend IRI comparison to be 
interoperable, I still would pick one normalization for each of the 
three parts, and I would pick NFKC, but you don't have to be 
consistent if interoperability isn't important.

Am I the only person who worries about IRI comparison being interoperable?
