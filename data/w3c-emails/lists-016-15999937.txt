Only a little. It still makes me think that you are talking about an encoding.

Look at the paragraph that precedes this one:
     In cases and for pieces where an encoding other than UTF-8 is used,
     and for raw binary data encoded in URIs (see [RFC2397]), the octets
     have to be %-escaped.  In these situations, the ability of IRIs to
     directly represent a wide character repertoire cannot be used.
How do you know the encoding of the URI? How can you tell if it is 
UTF-8 (and therefore convertible to an IRI) or something else?

Asked another way, if I'm writing an IRI converter, how do I know 
that this is OK:
    http://www.example.org/r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.html
But this isn't:
    http://www.example.org/r%E9sum%E9.html
Is is simply because the second one fails a UTF8-decode test? What 
about characters from other encondings that have values that are the 
same as valid UTF8 values?
