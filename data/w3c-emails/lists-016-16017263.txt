A tangental observation on using different normalization strategies on
different parts of the URI:

If, say, a username (iuserinfo) within a IRI is normalized into
something different than, say, a security protocol such as SASL or
Kerberos (which uses different normalization strategies, both with
regards to each other and to the ones discussed here) would normalize
the username into, there are potential security consequences.

To examplify, consider if IRI adopted a nameprep style normalization
scheme that translates ? into ss, and either of SASL or Kerberos did
not but instead chosed to maintain the difference between ? and ss,
encoding a username containing ? into an IRI for use with SASL or
Kerberos would denote a different username.

I have not studied the IRI document closely, so this may have already
been solved in the proper way, if so I'm sorry to drag up these old
issues again.
