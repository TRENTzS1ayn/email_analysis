The W3C TAG has discussed URI equivalence for a long time.
See http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ilist#URIEquivalence-15 for more pointers.
The result of that discussion is being incorporated into the update of
RFC 2396, (see
http://www.apache.org/~fielding/uri/rev-2002/rfc2396bis.html#rfc.section.6)
and its consequences are considered for the IRI draft under
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit#iriequivalence-01.

The result of that discussion is that there are many different
conditions which require or use different kinds of equivalence.
These range from simple codepoint-by-codepoint equivalence
(used e.g. in XML namespaces) to highly sophisticated heuristics
used by spiders and robots.

The consequences, for URIs, are described in section 6 of
http://www.textuality.com/tag/uri-comp-4. Similar consequences
apply for IRIs.

Because we do not know how a particular field is treated with
respect to text normalization, it would be inappropriate to
allow third parties to normalize an IRI arbitrarily. This does
not contradict the recommendation that if you create a resource,
and an IRI for that resource, you try to be as normalized as
possible (i.e. NFKC if possible).

This is similar to the upper-case/lower-case problems in URIs.
Some parts of an URI are case-insensitive (domain name).
For others, it is unclear whether they are case-sensitive or
case-insensitive, or something in between (e.g. case-sensitive,
but if you use the wrong case, you get a result such as a
'Multiple choices' or so). The best recipe we have there is
that the generator uses a reasonable capitalization, and
when transfering the URI, you don't change capitalization.
