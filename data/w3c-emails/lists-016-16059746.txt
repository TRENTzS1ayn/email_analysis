Hello Simon,

IRIs in general require only NFC, or even less. So it should not
be the case that IRIs use stronger normalization than e.g.
SASL or Kerberos.

As far as I understand, security problems would arise if IRIs
use stronger normalization, but not the other way around. Is
this correct?

I have assigned
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit#NFCsecurity-09
to this issue.
