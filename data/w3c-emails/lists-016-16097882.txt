Hello Simon,

NFC is only required in the current draft when encoding something
from e.g. the side of a bus, or when transcoding it from a non-
Unicode encoding. This is only to provide a base level of
predictability. Still indeed this could lead to security
problems with the mechanisms you describe above, if there
are two users that have user names that only differ in
normalization. But it would seem to me that in this case,
the security issue comes from these mechanisms (or the
actual use with these specific user names) rather than
from IRIs.

Regards,    Martin.
