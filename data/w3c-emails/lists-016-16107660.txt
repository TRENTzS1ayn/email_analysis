Section 2.4 says "IRIs SHOULD be created using Normalization Form C
(NFC)."  I don't interprete that to only apply to the scenarios you
mention, rather it seem to imply that whenever a IRI is created, by
whatever process, NFC should be used.  Perhaps it can be clarified?

If this is so, I believe the IRI security considerations should
mention this so that people can be aware of it, and abstain from
deploying IRIs in systems that behave in this way, since doing so
would introduce problems.  Perhaps some properly worded text could
be derived from the following strawman?

   Whenever fields of an IRI are normalized, the octet representation
   is modified.  While this is unavoidable if ambiguities are to be
   resolved, it can raise security issues in some situations.  In
   particular, if a iuserinfo field is normalized, a security protocol
   expecting a certain byte sequence as a username may receive a
   different one.  This can lead to interoperability failures, but
   also more serious failures in systems, e.g. when the system
   performs authorization based on the username.

Thanks.
