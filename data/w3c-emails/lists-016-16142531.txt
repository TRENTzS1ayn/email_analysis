Issue http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit#idnuri-02 is about
whether to use %-escaping or punycode to map the domain name part
of an IRI to an URI. This was discussed at the IETF in San Francisco,
and the general tendency there seemed to be towards using punycode.

I have now attempted to change the draft to try to implement this.

I have done this by adding a new step 2) is section 3.1.
I have left a note that for backwards compatibility, implementations
may want to deal with IRIs that have their domain names %-escaped
based on earlier drafts. I also added an example.

Please check the new text at
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/draft-duerst-iri.html#mapping
(please make sure you have used reload in your browser).

The feasibility of this approach depends on the URI spec
simplifying the syntax of 'authority'. I'll have to cross-check
this (and update the syntax).


Regards,    Martin.
