This is listed as issue
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit#applicabilityUTF8-10

I have reworded the first sentence of 1.2 c) and in effect
rewritten the whole paragraph. I realized that the examples
that followed belonged just to point c), but looked like
they belonged to the whole section. But this is just about
applicability. So I left just a short paragraph for c),
with a pointer to a new section 5.4
(see http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/draft-duerst-iri.html#UTF8use).
I put it there because 5.3 already discusses details of
point b) of section 1.2.


Regards,    Martin.
