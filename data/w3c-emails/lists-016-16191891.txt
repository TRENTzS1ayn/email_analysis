I have changed variant B) in step 1) of section 3.1 from

    If the IRI is in some digital representation
    (e.g. an octet stream) in some non-Unicode encoding:
    Convert the IRI to a sequence of characters from the UCS
    normalized according to NFC.

to

    If the IRI is in some digital representation
    (e.g. an octet stream) in some *known* non-Unicode encoding:
    Convert the IRI to a sequence of characters from the UCS
    normalized according to NFC.

(emphasis only here).

Do you think that this helps, or do you think that other changes
are needed?

Regards,    Martin.
