I have started a new section 5, entitled "IRI Equivalence and Comparison".
The intro text currently reads:

@@@@ This section will be worked out to discuss IRI Equivalence and Comparison
similar to the section "URI Normalization and Comparison" in RFC2396bis, with
frequent references to that section, and pointing out differences between URIs
and IRIs and IRI-specific issues (text normalization, language-dependence of
casing operations, and so on.

I have moved sections 2.3 and 2.4 to that section to serve as
starting material. I'll have to work on it some more.

Regards,    Martin.
