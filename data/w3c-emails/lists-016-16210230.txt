Hello Paul,

This seems to have shifted to be much more about
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit#applicabilityUTF8-10 than
about http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit#e9notutf8-05. I have
therefore changed the subject line.

As I wrote yesterday, I have created the new section
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/draft-duerst-iri.html#UTF8use
(yesterday section 5.4, now section 6.4). This contains all the details.
However, it does not contain any MUST or SHOULD.
What you say above is not completely true; for example,
http://www.example.org/r%E9sum%E9.xml#r&#xe9;sum&#xe9; is quite an
okay URI (reference), although it is not perfect, because of the
r%E9sum%E9 part. So your wording of "all non-ASCII characters MUST
be encoded as percent-escaped UTF-8" would not be appropriate.

Can you please check whether you are okay with the new section at
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/draft-duerst-iri.html#UTF8use,
or whether you think that it needs some stronger normative wording?

Regards,    Martin.
