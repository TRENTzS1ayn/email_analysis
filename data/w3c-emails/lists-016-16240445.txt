Yep, that's much better.

One suggestion, though: the last sentence of the third paragraph of 
that section ends "...the escaped octets cannot be converted to 
actual characters in an IRI, because the escaping is based on 
iso-8859-1 rather than UTF-8." That is true, but it brings in an 
encoding issue that isn't necessary. I propose "...the escaped octets 
cannot be converted to actual characters in an IRI, because the 
escaping is not encoded as UTF-8."
