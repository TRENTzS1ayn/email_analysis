As we work on the DOM Level 3 specification, the DOM WG is struggling 
with a couple of issues, which are probably related, on which we would 
appreciate any insignts:

1.  How do we refer normatively to the IRI specification now, since we 
are producing documents which are progressing rapidly.

2.  How do we generically refer to "Resource Identifiers" so that when 
the Next Great Thing after URIs and IRIs comes along, after URIs and 
IRIs, users of the specification can just use them instead of waiting 
for the DOM specification to be updated to permit it.  I was going to 
just start calling them RIS's, Resource Identifier Strings, and then map 
that to present-day IRIs and URIs for the present, and anything in the 
future that may come along.

Thanks,

Ray Whitmer
DOM WG Chair
