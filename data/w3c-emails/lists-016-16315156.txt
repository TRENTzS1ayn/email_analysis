Hi,

Section 6.3:

  "Note: Some formats already accommodate IRIs, although they use
  different terminology. HTML 4.0 [HTML4] defines the conversion from
  IRIs to URIs as error-avoiding behavior."

HTML 4.0 does not accomodate IRIs, HTML 4.0 defines the value of the
href, src, etc. attributes as URI References as per RFC 2396, a document
using IRIs that are not legal URI References is thus invalid. HTML does
indeed recommend an error recovery behaivour, but nothing beyond that.

regards.
