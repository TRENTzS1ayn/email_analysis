Hello Bjoern,

Many thanks for this and other comments on the IRI spec.

I have noted this as issue http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit#htmlIRI-12

I think the term 'accommodate' is rather loose, and the text
points out that for HTML 4.0, this is just error behavior.
So I don't thing that there is anything wrong with the current
text.
If you think that the current text needs some changes, can you
please propose actual wording?

Also, please note that formally (in the DTD), all the relevant
fields are defined as CDATA. This means that validation doesn't
catch IRIs, and documents containing IRIs, while not conforming
to the HTML 4.0 spec, are therefore not invalid.


Regards,    Martin.
