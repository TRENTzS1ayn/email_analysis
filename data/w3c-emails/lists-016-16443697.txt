Ok, having read the references that Martin posted, in appears that
this is considered the correct rendering, even though the labels are
not presented in logical order.  I can see why this might feel natural
to users of right-to-left languages, I just wasn't expecting it...

And if displaying components of domain names and IRIs in logical order
is considered a non-issue, then it's clearly a non-issue for a local
part which is, by definition, opaque.
