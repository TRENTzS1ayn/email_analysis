Chaps,

Thanks for your additional questions.  I have added them to
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/upload/2003/questions/

(Please bear in mind that this can be a useful approach for developing
sections in the guidelines as well as Q&As - helps focus in on what
needs to be said.)

I have also linked to the page of questions from
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/ under "Miscellaneous working
documents:" on the right.

Best,
RI
