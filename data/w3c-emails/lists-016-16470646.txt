Well, the question is which order is the right one.
In an LTR context, BARA.BEW.com is obviously better.
In an RTL context, you are right that WEB.ARAB.com
is probably better. Now the problem of course is
that we can't have it both ways.

Now take another example, www.BARA.com. This again in
an LTR context looks better as www.BARA.com; in an RTL
context, it will look better as com.BARA.www.
To some extent, the more LTR pieces you have, the better
it looks in LTR context, and the more RTL pieces you have,
the better it will look in RTL context. But judgement is
difficult, and creating an algorithm that counts pieces,...
would be too complex. So we took LTR as a base, rather
than RTL.

If you know that periods are special, and read each label
independently, then you are right. But the feedback we got
is that people not familiar with domain names or URIs
won't necessarily know that. For people who don't know
that, they probably always read 'foo.com' LTR, and
'BARA.BEW' RTL.

There is no place here for "user's preferred writing direction".
If we put something on the side of a bus, or on a name card,
the user's preferred writing direction is lost.

I'm not sure it was discussed on the IDN list. The IDN list mainly
cared about getting a predictable display for single labels.
It was the solution originally proposed for IRIs.

That's a statement that makes sense to somebody understanding the
specs in detail. What we have to care about is the end users.
