It wasn't obviously better (to me).  It bothers me that it's
'middle-endian', with the least-significant component in the middle.

I was naively assuming that 

BEW.BARA.com and
com.BARA.BEW

were the only sensible ways of writing the domain.

I hadn't grasped the idea that most users of RTL languages will be
sufficiently used to LTR-in-RTL embeddings that they will find it
natural to read this construct in logical order.  (Even though this is
actually an RTL-in-LTR embedding, the principle is familliar enough
that users are happy with it, presumably?)

Which makes sense, particularly since all (present day) computer users
will be used to the fact that current identifiers are LTR.

Right.  It's a matter of assumptions, and mine were biased by looking
at the structure of the domain, rather than at the assumptions that a
user of an RTL lanuage would make.

You're right.  I misunderstood the original point about WEB.ARAB.COM
rendering as MOC.BARA.BEW rather than BEW.BARA.MOC (and thought this
was an option depending on bidi embedding level or something).

I'm sure someone proposed that labels should always be presented least
significant on the left to most significant on the right, and outlined
the algorithm for doing so.  I haven't followed any of the IRI
discussion (except where it was referenced on the IDN list) so I don't
think it's that I'm thinking of.

Possibly, but there is no spec for the structure of a local part.  So
saying 'just render it according to the bidi algorithm' (as you have
decided is also correct for IRIs -- which *are* structured) seems
natural.

What restrictions -- if any -- should be made on the content of a
local part is a somewhat separate issue (though it's what caused me to
start this thread).
