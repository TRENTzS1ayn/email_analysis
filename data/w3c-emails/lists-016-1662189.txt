Richard,

Since it was my question, I could draft an "article" for the E&O part. Is
there an existing format or set of guidelines to which this should conform?

Thanks,
Phil

We could add this to the Q&A - I'm not sure how long the answer ought to
be.  What might be an interesting approach is to write something up
under our Education & Outreach arm that could be summarised and pointed
to in a Q&A (or start with the Q&A then write something longer).  WAI
has also produced something along these lines for accessibility.

Any takers for the E&O part?

Yes - again just wondering about length, and whether we should use a
similar approach as for the previous question.

Hmm.  I can see how useful this would be.  I use Xmetal 3.0 and Notepad
on Windows XP, so I don't ask this question any more, but before I found
these I asked it all the time.  The key thing is to avoid the appearance
of deprecating or promoting any particular company's offering.  We would
have to be very objective and provide good coverage.  It would also be a
good idea to consult with the companies involved at some point.  Should
we add a note allowing other tools vendors to send in information about
their tools??? I'm worried that might get messy - too many small things.
Perhaps we should just choose the most widely used tools, and list the
good things they provide.

Hmm.  Interesting.  On the face of it, I'd say that this was what the
guidelines were all about.  But it might be useful to have something
that points up some examples of key areas where issues occur as a
persuader / counterpart to question 1.  This is a tricky topic for a Q&A
because it's difficult to say when you have provided a complete enough
answer.
