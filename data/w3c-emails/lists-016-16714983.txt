Martin,

Let me try and express my concerns in a rather more focussed and
condensed way.

Let us just consider a written URI such as:

http://www.example.org/D%C3%BCrst

This is a perfectly valid RFC2396 URI, and is also identifiable as
using one of the schemes defined in RFC 2616.
Neither of these RFCs tell me what decoding to apply to the two
escaped octets, as we have agreed.

Now suppose your IRI document has become an RFC, but nothing else has
changed.

I still don't know what processing, if any, to apply to the above
URI - it could have been written long before your document came into
force.

So let's suppose we define a new HTTP version, say HTTP/1.2, to cope
with this.

HTTP/1.2 cannot simply issue a decree that henceforth the above URI is
to be assumed to have been generated from an IRI, and that the reverse
processing of your section 3.2 should be applied. That would be
inappropriate processing to apply to pre-existing URIs.

So, I conclude that there *must* be some visible indication that the
sequence originated in an IRI, and therefore that the reverse
processing of 3.2 must be applied.

Here's my solution:

Introduce a pair of additional HTTP schemes 'httpi' (defaulting to
port 80) 'and httpis' (defaulting to port 443) in an update to HTTP -
say HTTP/1.2.

Now we write

httpi://www.example.org/D%C3%BCrst

and the new HTTP/1.2 tells us that the reverse processing of your 3.2
*must* be applied to this URI scheme.

Problem solved.

Of course, there could be be different syntactic arrangements serving
the same purpose, but, essentially, my belief is that, at least in in
the context of HTTP, there *must  be* some kind syntactic indication
that IRIs are involved.

There are some interesting details to define when considering what
goes 'down the wire' in HTTP messages, but that can be considered
later - the essential need can be made simply by considering the
printed URI.

My original eMail was really asking what the HTTP community's own
thinking is on this issue.

Maybe there are no such thoughts and this proposal will 'kick-start'
some action on the rapid take-up of IRIs in HTTP - which is what I
want to promote.


I'll be starting my 6-day vacation 8 hours from now, so any dialog
will be interrupted - sorry!

Chris
