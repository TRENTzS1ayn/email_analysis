For this case, it indicates to me:

1) there is nothing wrong with dates being in a format separate from the
document content.

2) using the browser accept-language first preference for date setting is
awkward.
My date preference is 8601. No language uses that. (Note that japanese date
shows jpn chars as separators.)
Even if some language did, I shouldn't have to make that language my first
preference to achieve a date format by distorting my content preference.

i.e. there should be a separate option for date format. whether this means a
date tag or another type of content negotiation is tbd.

good ex. Martin!
