I just made a question out of the list of sites to see
HTTP headers. Thanks to Andrew and Tex for their help.

This is for my next round, so we don't have to
discuss this on this Wednesday. Please see
http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-headers-charset.html


Olivier, I have copied you because this mentions the validator.

Richard, I'm not sure I got the
<div class="content"> markup right. It's not clear
what it is for, but it seems to affect styling in
somewhat strange ways. In general, to reduce overhead,
it is easiest to mark up all the other parts and leave
the unmarked parts as simple content, but maybe I got
something wrong.

Regards,     Martin.
