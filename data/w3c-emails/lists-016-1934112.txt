Building on an idea volunteered by Phil in a private note to me, I
believe we should not publish Phil's currently proposed Q&A because it
will require a good deal more work before it is ready and may still be
difficult to bring into focus clearly enough for a Q&A.  I think we
should use the material so far developed, with the additional comments
on the list such as Tex's helpful input, towards developing the
'article' we discussed during our last meeting that will be linked from
the site as part of our outreach work.

That leaves us with a gap for our weekly offering.  To get around this
problem (given that Martin doesn't want to publish his new Q&A just
yet), I wrote something today that may serve, will hopefully be not very
controversial, and will also draw attention to the newly published
Unicode in XML and other Markup Languages.  You can find it at:
http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-controls.html

If there are no strong objections to this course of action I propose the
following:
-that we send comments on my new Q&A to the list asap
-that we mop up remaining comments during tomorrow's meeting
-that I publish Wednesday evening (or early Thurs am my time)
-that we publish subsequent Q&A's on Wednesday evenings (since I
have been finalising edits at the beginning of the week lately, that
would be a good thing anyhow). 


The last point would produce a publication schedule as follows:
1announce new Q&A to the list Monday (latest, but as far in
advance as you like)
2comment on list
3discuss at Wednesday meeting
4contributor makes changes based on feedback by Friday
5RI and contributor consolidate changes and prepare on the site
Monday & Tuesday
6publish on Wednesday
