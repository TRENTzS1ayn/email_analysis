I think that's a good idea.

I didn't say that I don't want to publish that, I was just assuming
that we had enough other material.

I'll comment on it separately.

I think the more we spread out the schedule, the more difficult
it will get to stay on schedule. Having different questions
overlap will confuse things more and more.

Ideally, I would prefer:

- Send first draft to list by Monday at latest
- comments back mainly on Tuesday
- send a new version based on comments for discussion on Wednesday
- discussion on Wednesday (ideally, most issues should be resolved
   already, so that we don't spend too much time)
- Have Thursday/Friday for cleanup
- Publish for the new week

But of course, I'm less involved, and will defer to Richard, who
does the actual work.

Regards,  Martin.
