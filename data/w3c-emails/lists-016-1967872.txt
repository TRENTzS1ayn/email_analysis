Comments arising from or about my work on
http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-bidi-controls.html:

[1] 
the table in 3.3 lists only </xhtml:bdo> as alternative markup for PDF
and says "when used to terminate RLO or RLO only, otherwise ignore"

I believe you also have to use it to terminate RLE and LRE sequences
too, don't you?

[2]
The previous point may mean that I need to change my version of the
table.
I'm also thinking of adding the code points or at least putting them in
the same order as above.

[3]
Note, in passing, that the table in UXML uses <td><b>text</b></td> to
create table headers, rather than just <th>text</th> - probably ought to
be changed on the next iteration.

[4] 
Opera, of course, doesn't show the example of correct Hebrew correctly.
For the guidelines we agreed to provide pdfs to show that stuff
properly.  Perhaps we should do the same for Q&As that contain complex
scripts?

If there are no strong objections to this course of action I propose the
following:
-that we send comments on my new Q&A to the list asap
-that we mop up remaining comments during tomorrow's meeting
-that I publish Wednesday evening (or early Thurs am my time)
-that we publish subsequent Q&A's on Wednesday evenings (since I
have been finalising edits at the beginning of the week lately, that
would be a good thing anyhow). 


The last point would produce a publication schedule as follows:
1announce new Q&A to the list Monday (latest, but as far in
advance as you like)
2comment on list
3discuss at Wednesday meeting
4contributor makes changes based on feedback by Friday
5RI and contributor consolidate changes and prepare on the site
Monday & Tuesday
6publish on Wednesday
