Yes. I actually spent  a relative large amount of time trying to find a
good way to link to the background section that I had moved to the end
of the page, but didn't come up with anything I was happy with and gave
up for the time being.  I'll try again.  We could just stick some text
in there, but I'd rather find an aesthetically pleasing as well as
practical approach if I can.

The sentence immediately before it explains that though, doesn't it?
(btw, I considered adding "Incorrect: " before this example - need to
add some styling for that to distinguish from the example itself.)

Well that appears in the next example box, which is really a
continuation.  I thought about moving the correct version up.  Maybe I
should, and make it clearer that the two examples are related.

I thought the citations were pretty convincing actually.  Do you think
we need to spell it out more?  Or do you have other suggestoins?

Agreed.  See my other note.
