Hello Tex,

Many thanks for your comments.

Done. reinstated the parentheses around it.

Maybe we need a general policy here.

Fixed, according to Richard's proposal. Please check.

I added the following note:

Note: The charset parameter may not be present. This is okay if your 
document itself indicates its character encoding.

I don't want to go into too much details.
I hope this helps.

Please do so.

I think it does. There may be one or two exotic cases that are
not covered yet, and I don't know exactly what it does with
a BOM in UTF-8 (it should give a warning).

okay, changed to "visually check that the source is correctly interpreted",
removing UTF-8. Do you think that's enough?

I changed the last sentence to:

     This requires special care, because your browser, running e.g. on a
     Mac or on a Windows system, may indicate using a different character
     encoding than the encoding given to you by a Web-based service or the
     W3C Markup Validation Service (which are mostly based on UNIX systems).

I hope this helps. I don't want to go too much into details.

Regards,    Martin.
