I think you should take a different approach. Instead of explaining
one solution (the wrong one) in the background, explain the problem
(multiple nested (i.e. structured) pieces of rtl and ltr text) and
the abstract solution (identification of these pieces).
Use terms such as base directionality and embedding (and later
override) without actually mentioning the control characters.

Then the answer can directly explain the markup solution.

It only says "This is incorrect. The text "W3C" and the comma should
appear to the left of the Hebrew text." Why? Why don't you just
move them there? I think it should say what the text means
(maybe it's 'hello there, W3C', but maybe something different)
and why the comma and W3C are in the wrong position (only the
Hebrew words get identified as rtl, but the whole quote is
overall Hebrew and therefore should run rtl overall).

That's not my point. The correct *HTML* syntax is missing.
Something like

The title says <em dir='rtl'>"WERBEH WERBEH, W3C"</em> in Hebrew.

or so.

Say that embedding usually coincides with the structure of the
document anyway.
