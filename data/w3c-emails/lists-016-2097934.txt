Q&A Review
=========================

Phil's Q&A
----------------
Discussed Phil's contribution: 
-
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-geo/2003Jun/0036.html
-Would be a good idea for those who are interested to begin work
on an 'article' about this topic, in addition to a Q&A - Phil, Suzanne,
Tex
ACTION: Phil, spec out content and audience for an introductory outreach
article along the lines of "Why internationalise your site, and what it
involves?" - do it in stages, and look around for currently available
material
-it's tough to produce Q&A's like this - Phil's Q&A needs
tightening up and refocussing - Phil will work on it - no alternatives
available at the moment



Discussion - table about what browsers support what encodings
------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------
-the page at http://www.w3.org/International/O-charset-list.html
is way out of date
-not clear that this is useful information these days - people
should just use utf-8 !
-might be more useful to say what fonts support what unicode
ranges


Comments on section 2.2 of guidelines: "Specifying a page encoding"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------
-
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/#ri20030218.131104811
-various editorial suggestions
-we could point to information about how to set the content-type
header
-given 'where practical' - have some text that explains how that
may or may not be practical - point to the alternatives
ACTION: AC, write up some text about byte order marks that could be used
to develop section 2.2
ACTION: all, send in pointers to web sites or programs that can be used
to inspect http headers of web pages



Next meeting:
==========
Same time, same bridge, next week.
