I agree with Martin's comments.
Also:
1) In the background, is the font for the black text smaller or different? It
appears smaller to me and therefore harder to see the spaces. oh, ok I just
realized it is an image (I changed text size and it didn't change.) Please
make the image larger. (Maybe svg would make size user selectable?)

2) Along the lines Martin suggested, I would change:
Would produce a result that looks as follows, where the arrow indicates the
location of the missing space:

to:
Produces the following result. The arrow indicates the location of the missing
space.

3) In the technical detail section, the blue space migrates from behind to the
front of the "B". I found myself wondering if the B represented a RTL or LTR
character to convince myself that the space would shift as shown.
I think it makes a difference but I havent tried it yet.

4) The next question I think, is if you have unicode plain-text with bidi
controls, and you want to convert to html, what does this information imply
about the algorithm to do that? It seems to indicate where you might remove
controls and insert markup, and it might not be one for one, to accomodate the
space collapse issue.
