some clarification on CALD, as we discussed

from a private mail to me from Andrew, slightly edited by me.

its standard in this part of the world, replaces LOTE and NESB. 
Sometimes found as CLD instead of CALD.

  a good idea. Just of the top of my head:

>>
>>- a site  in more than one language intended for a local culturally and
>>linguistically diverse (CALD) community.
>>

http://www.finfo.dk/
http://www.multiculturalaustralia.com.au/  
illustrates a couple of features common to some of these types of sites, 
esp. the extended help information on viewing and typing in languages 
other then the national language.

>>- a site in (one) national language and containing resources in multiple
>>languages intended for mediated access by a local culturally and
>>linguistically diverse (CALD) community.
>>

Australian examples include:

http://www.healthtranslations.vic.gov.au/
http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/health-public-affairs/mhcs/
http://www.adec.org.au/BabelTree/
http://www.mmha.org.au/library/brochures/brochures.html

Current, VIctorian state government translation and interpreting policy 
tends towards a mediated access model rather than assisted or unassisted 
direct access models, as can be seen in the first link.
