 Are you falling behind?  Version 4.0 of the Unicode Standard is here!
 Software and Web applications can now support more languages with
 greater efficiency and lower cost.  Do you need to find out how? Do
 you need to be more competitive around the globe?  Is your software
 upward-compatible with version 4.0?  Does your staff need
 internationalization training?

 Learn about software and Web internationalization and the new Unicode
 Standard, including its latest features and requirements.  This is
 the only event endorsed by the Unicode Consortium.  The conference
 will be held September 3-5, 2003 in Atlanta, Georgia and is
 completely updated.

 KEYNOTES: Keynote speakers for IUC24 are well-known authors in the
 Internationalization and Localization industries:

 Donald De Palma, President, Common Sense Advisory, Inc., and author
 of "Business Without Borders: A Strategic Guide to Global Marketing",
 and Richard Gillam, author of "Unicode Demystified: A Practical
 Programmer's Guide to the Encoding Standard" and a former columnist
 for "C++ Report".

 TUTORIALS:  This redeveloped and enhanced Unicode 4.0 Tutorial is
 taught by Dr. Asmus Freytag, one of the major contributors to the
 standard, and extensively experienced in implementing real-world
 Unicode applications.  Structured into 3 independent modules, you
 can attend just the overview, or only the most advanced material.
 Tutorials in Web Internationalization, non-Latin scripts, and more,
 are offered in parallel and taught by recognized industry experts.

 CONFERENCE TRACKS:  Gain the competitive edge! Conference sessions
 provide the most up-to-date technical information on standards, best
 practices, and recent advances in the globalization of software and
 the Internet.  Panel discussions and the friendly atmosphere allow
 you to exchange ideas and ask questions of key players in the 
 internationalization industry.

 WHO SHOULD ATTEND?:  If you have a limited training budget, this is
 the one Internationalization conference you need.  Send staff that
 are involved in either Unicode-enabling software, or internationalization
 of software and the Internet, including: managers, software engineers,
 systems analysts, font designers, graphic designers, content developers,
 Web designers, Web administrators, technical writers, and product
 marketing personnel.

THE UNICODE CONSORTIUM

 The Unicode Consortium was founded as a non-profit organization in 1991.
 It is dedicated to the development, maintenance and promotion of The
 Unicode Standard, a worldwide character encoding. The Unicode Standard
 encodes the characters of the world's principal scripts and languages,
 and is code-for-code identical to the international standard ISO/IEC
 10646. In addition to cooperating with ISO on the future development of
 ISO/IEC 10646, the Consortium is responsible for providing character
 properties and algorithms for use in implementations. Today the
 membership base of the Unicode Consortium includes major computer
 corporations, software producers, database vendors, research
 institutions, international agencies and various user groups.

 For further information on the Unicode Standard, visit the Unicode Web
 site at http://www.unicode.org or e-mail <info@unicode.org>
