I wonder how realistic these scenarios are. The principal motivation for a
fine-grained language tagging of individual words or phrases appears to be
for text-to-speech, primarily for the blind. But the goal for
text-to-speech, except in very rare cases, will be to read the customary,
most-well-understood pronunciation of the phrase in the end-user's language.
Rarely will that precisely match the exact pronunciation of the word in the
foreign language. More typically it will be modified to fit within an
allowable sequence of phonemes in the user's language, and often it will be
given a "spelling pronunciation". In that, it is much more like an equally
obscure non-foreign word in the user's language. For example, an English
text-to-speech system should be more likely to find a relatively common
Yiddish term like "schlemiel" than to find an uncommon "native" word such as
"phthisic" in English.

If the goal is to provide special pronunciations for unusual phrases, or
phrases that are pronounced unusually in the given context, then it may be
appropriate to have annotations: but annotations of the common
pronunciation, not of the language. So for that reason, it may be reasonable
to have fine-grained annotations. But it would be most useful to explore
first (a) what the actual requirements for text-to-speech are, and (b)
whether people find it, in practice, relatively easy to work around the
restrictions of attributes or elements that don't allow substructure.

[That being said, I have always found the attributes that end up being
displayed to the user, such as alt and title, very confining. It would be
better to have elements that correspond to them, so that the text display
can be richer, such as italicising or bolding a word within them.]
