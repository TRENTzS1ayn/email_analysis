Good point, although you are safest in that case actually annotating with
the font, and not depending on the target system.

(Interestingly, a colleague pointed out that with TrueType, it is very easy
to do nasty spoofing. The hinting for each character is actually a little
program, and it can completely alter the shape of a character based on
environment. The same character in the same font may look like a "6" on a
Windows box, like a "X" on a Linux box, and like a 'peace sign' on a
Macintosh.)
