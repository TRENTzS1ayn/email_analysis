I'd like to change the minutes as follows:

After "Action: Tex and Martin decided to work together to resolve CSS
issues in item #5.2." in the section "Review of Richard's Content" end
that section.  Then start up a new section as follows:

============================================
[H2] Miscellaneous discussion points

[H3] Missing sections

Agreed: We should add a guidelines section about how to display
non-ASCII examples

Suggestion: Add section on how to handle printing issues.

[H3] Handling non-ASCII examples in the text

Agreed: We will provide upper and lower case Latin examples to show
Arabic and Hebrew directionality in addition to Arabic and/or Hebrew
examples.

Agreed: We will link to a .pdf version to show examples of non-ASCII for
those who have display problems.

[H3]  Editorial approach

Agreed: Content submitters should not expect what they submit to be
reproduced without change in the finished document.  Editors will take
the ideas from the submitted content and write the final text.
Submitters should send in ideas: principally, rules, points to go in the
descriptions, and resource pointers.  It is not necessary to use the
HTML template supplied earlier, but you can if you want to.

===============================================

This would replace the remainder of the section entitled "Review of
Richard's Content".

If I hear no objection from those present by Tuesday, I'll make the
change.

Cheers,
RI
