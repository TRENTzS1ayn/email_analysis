Note that using pointers that rely on the character position of a word
in a sentence means that localisation of the data potentially becomes a
nightmare.  As the text changes, every single pointer will need to be
changed for every single language involved - in a moderately to heavily
annotated site this could introduce a huge overhead in schedule and cost
that equates to a serious barrier to international deployment.
