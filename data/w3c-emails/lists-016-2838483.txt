Q&A Review
=========================

Building on the discussion from last week about suggested Q&A items in
Richard's email at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-geo/2003Apr/0020.html ,
and including the gist of Martin's comments at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-geo/2003Apr/0031.html,
we agreed that it would be better NOT to point directly to other
people's stuff (eg. As suggested by proposal no. 1 in Richard's email
0020.html).

This gets around some potential issues related to copyright, perceived
commercial bias, up to date material, consistent presentation of
material, etc.  

The upshot is that we should write our own answers - in which we can
always point to others' sites as alternative explanations / for greater
detail etc.  

In some cases, our text will simply be a 'wrapper', in the way
http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTTP-charset points to various places
for server-specific information.  This does, however, offer an
opportunity to summarise or synthesize stuff that might be difficult to
glean from other sources.

We also discussed the format - separate pages for each question or a
long page with many questions like a typical FAQ sheet.  We opted for
separate pages for now - we can always change our minds later.

It was felt that we should probably have a special section for pointing
to useful lookup tables (such as IANA or ISO 639) to allow people to
find these quickly.  This of course doesn't preclude adding such links
to pages that answer related questions.

 

Next meeting:
==========
Same time, same bridge, next week.
