Thinking around the question "Should we list Q&A answers on a single
page or on individual pages" it seems to me that there may be some
situations where we do one thing, and others where we do another.  

During the last meeting we agreed to have separate HTML pages for each
answer for now.

On the other hand, it's easy to think of a number of questions related
to, say, character encoding, that it would be useful to have grouped on
the same page from the user's perspective.  For instance:

- How do I specify the encoding of an HTML, XHTML, XML or CSS document?
- Which encoding declaration takes precedence for an HTML page, server
or client?
- Where can I find the charset names?
- How do I set up my server to serve the right encoding for a page?
- Can I encode XML and X/HTML in non-Unicode encodings, if the document
character set is Unicode?
- How much support exists today for HTML written in Unicode?
- If I use a Unicode encoding for a page, is UTF-8 or UTF-16 best?
- How do I handle characters that are not supported by the encoding used
by my page?

Further, it occurs to me that someone writing a question about encodings
could/should probably try to answer several if not all of these
questions at the same time.

Thoughts,
