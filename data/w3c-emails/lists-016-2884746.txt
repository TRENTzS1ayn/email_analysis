Martin,

Thanks for the input.  I like your addition of the value attribute.  As for the partial fragment what if it is changed to:

Although many programming languages have devices like drop-down boxes that have the capability of sorting a list of items before displaying them as part of their functionality, the HTML <select> function has no such capabilities.  It lists the <options> in the order received.  Thus one must manually pre-sort their translated options before presenting them to the client.

Hello Russ,

This is a good example, a bit too specific for the first question for my taste, but I think we should just go with it.
A few comments below:

Half a sentence. Needs completion.

The problem with this example is that the script that gets the input has to react to cat, kat, dog, hound,... and it's getting worse when more options are added. I strongly suggest we use the 'value'
attribute:


><form .....>

>       <option value='dog'> dog </option>

></form>
