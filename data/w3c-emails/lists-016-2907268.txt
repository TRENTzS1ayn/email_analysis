We should discuss this during today's telecon with a view to approving
it for publication.  

Phil is still working on the format for pages - if he has something
ready, we should publish on Friday.

> Question:

> As part of a form, I have a list of terms in a drop-down box. 
>  Why are they not correctly sorted when I translate the items 
> in the list?
> 
> 
> Answer:
> 
> Although many programming languages have devices like 
> drop-down boxes that have the capability of sorting a list of 
> items before displaying them as part of their functionality.  
> The HTML <select> function has no such capabilities.  It will 
> list the <options> in the order received.  Thus one must 
> manually pre-sort their translated options before presenting 
> them to the client.
> 
> For example, lets say we have a pull-down list for types of 
> pets.  In the list, we have the following in alphabetical order:
> 
> <form .....>
>    <select size="1" name="pet">
>       <option> cat </option>
>       <option> dog </option>
>       <option> mouse </option>
>    </select>
> ...
> ...
> </form>
> 
> When this is translated to Dutch, the list becomes 
> 
>    <form .....>
>    <select size="1" name="pet">
>       <option> kat </option>
>       <option> hond </option>
>       <option> muis </option>
>    </select>
> ...
> ...
> </form>
> 
> But for it to be in correct Dutch alphabetical order we will 
> need to re-arrange to list to:
> 
>    
>    <form .....>
>    <select size="1" name="pet">
>       <option> hond</option>
>       <option> kat </option>
>       <option> muis </option>
>    </select>
> ...
> ...
> </form>
> 
> This must be done for each language to be displayed.
