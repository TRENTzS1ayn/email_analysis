-added content to 2.2 Specifying a page encoding (using Steve's
text as a base but moving beyond it)
-improved the styling a little (including making it print smaller
- though more work is needed there)
-worked on the XSL so that resource info is pulled directly from
the repository (without duplication) (took a long time to figure that
out)
-changed the name of the repository file to say 'repository'

During next week's meeting we have a few questions to review, but if we
have time we could also go over section 2.2.

Happy reading,
RI
