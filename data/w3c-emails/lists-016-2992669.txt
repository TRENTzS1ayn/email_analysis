Today I developed the XSLT needed to generate two different views of the
guidelines data.  The first is an outline view, the second a view
including only resources (to accompany the former).  This at last builds
in some levelling of information.  I think it's a major step forward -
especially in terms of explaining the model to others.  

There's still much work to be done, but some basic but usable
functionality is there.  Go to
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/ , select a topic from the
toc, and play with the icons to the right of the titles on the various
pages that appear.

Now I need a rest...

Happy clicking !
