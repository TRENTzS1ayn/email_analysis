I don't think there's any official recommendation, but a useful way to 
deal with this situation is to base64-encode the whole string (e.g. the 
content of a specific element) that may contain controls.  Of course, 
the receiving application must know to decode the encoding to recover 
the intended content.

XML 1.1 allows them as &#xhhhh;, except for U+0000 NULL.  See 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xml11-20021015/#sec4.1.
