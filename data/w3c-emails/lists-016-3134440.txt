Bjoern, 

Thanks for this. I'll discuss with Martin. I believe it, but I don't see the
justification from the standard.

I created a test file and the W3C validator reports "reference to non-SGML
character" on C0 characters confirming what you say.

I am guessing the limitation derives from SGML rather than something explicit
in the html spec.
