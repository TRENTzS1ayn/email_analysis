Fran?ois,

thanks as always.
Mostly agreement here and some new understanding on my part. I numbered your
comments in the text and just reply here:

1) control code characters - I think of it as characters that represent
control codes, so don't really see a problem.
I'll look at this, after we deal with the more substantial comments. I do see
your point though in codes not being characters.

2) Originally, I really did just mean to discuss just c0... Actually c0
without null, since I didn't think there was an issue with null, but you
undermined all of this... ;-(  I'll come back to the scope after we review the
rest of your points.

3) NULL- ok, what to say about it? I don't want to doc browsers' random
behavior. It would be nice to say its illegal and be done with it.

4) I do know that IE maps the c1 range into 1252 values. It encourages people
to presume that those values represent legit characters rather than forcing
them to use correct NCRs. On the other hand, I am sure it is a compatibility
issue for many many pages. If we discuss c1, I can add this as a caution.

5) C0 in html- the spec says yes. I agree there are no glyphs, when I tried
it, although &#2; was a different box than &#x3;-&#x8; for some reason.
However, the validator rejects these characters. I want to get Martin's
comment on why dtd makes it unused.

6) c1 is allowed in XML. Yes I agree. That is why I restricted myself to c0. I
didn't see an issue. Since it is supported, legacy apps don't have a problem
migrating to *ML and using it. However, I now understand it is restricted in
1.1, so needs to be covered.

7) character entity references. Maybe this is a terminology problem on my
part.
The title of http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xml11-20021015/#sec4.1 is character
and entity references.
I presumed the former was ncr and the latter was CER. It is possible to give a
name to a character in xml.
Is that not called a CER? I guess HTML uses CER for the predefined ones. I
realize XML doesn't have these definitions predefined.
Shall I just call it an entity reference?

8) NCR doesn't work for null. ok, I'll doc this.

9) AHA! ok. I see the production changed in
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-xml11-20021015/#sec2.2
so that 7f-9f except 85 is excluded. Seems to me an odd thing to do, although
I appreciate there is a lot of ambiguity around controls.


ok, thanks very much for your careful review! 

What I thought was going to be a cheap, easy one paragraph Q&A has become a
much larger effort... oh well. Too bad it is in such a marginal area, although
I know a couple programmers that were having trouble with this...
