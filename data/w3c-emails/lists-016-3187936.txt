Fran?ois,
great stuff.

4) could it be font on your end? I didn't try xhtml, but for an html example,
I see several of the characters in the 0x80-90 range in both IE and NS7.
Perhaps the stricter parsing corrects the other characters, but it is odd the
euro shows thru then.

5) Unicode 3, section 13.1 says more or less it is up to the application but
falls back to 6429. The chart shows the control names.
My simplistic interpretation is both standards (Unicode, 10646) are saying it
is up to the application to define their use, and html defines them as not to
be used.

3) Nulls- ok!

7) CER- ok. I did mean to say that you can name an entity, but I wrote
character...

9) OK. What seemed odd to me was recognizing the controls were needed enough
to add NCRs to support them and then ruling out the c1 range.
And why allow them as ncr's but not as encoded values?


thanks Fran?ois. I really appreciate your taking the time to dig thru this. I
think we have way too much detail for the Q&A so, I'll have to figure out how
to handle it.
Great stuff, and much appreciated.
