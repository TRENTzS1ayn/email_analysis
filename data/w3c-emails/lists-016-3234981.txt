Reading the notes from the meeting, I found the Q&As of the week to be VERY
useful, particularly the Arabic question. Although I'm not going to be much
use in contributing to the finer points of Unicode, I was wondering if we
could sprinkle in some less-technical questions. If you all are up for it,
here are some thoughts I had:

Q: What corporate Web sites currently use Unicode?
There aren't many, but I think it might be useful to highlight a few to show
how Unicode is taking hold. I can put a list together of between five to 10
sites.

Q: We just added a link to our Korean Web site (in Korean) on our English
home page, but the text isn't displaying correctly? What's wrong?
- I fielded a question just like this recently from someone who wasn't aware
of the one 'charset' per Web page limitation and was using 8859-1. I could
include a before and after screen shot to illustrate the problem.

Q: What's the problem with this global gateway? (a screen shot of a "select
language" pick list in which none of the language names are in their native
languages - a common mistake.
- I could then include an "after" screen shot to show how to improve the
pick list.

Let me know what you all think.

Thanks.
