Hello Richard, Lloyd, others,

A few comments below. Overall, quite good!

Do we want to say 'date formatting', which implies an active
process, or could we ask 'how to format dates', which is
more about the end result?

I'm not completely sure this would be an ideal solution. I have a
Japanese system with lots of English applications. I would hate
to see an English date format in a Japanese Web page, and I would
hate to see a Japanese date format in an English Web page.

I would reduce the 'may potentially' to 'will'. Web pages are looked
at by people from all over the world.

Better to change 'how will they react' to something more specific.

I think at this point, the reader needs to be told that 2003-04-02
is ISO 8601.

Why not just write "April 2nd, 2003"? That's much more readable. Also,
assuming it is an US site, it is easiest to parse for US readers,
who are probably the main target, while still unambiguous for others.

Maybe we have to distinguish between dates in text and dates in
tables (for the later, space considerations may be important).
But then again, there are many cases in between.

The HTTP header is "Accept-Language". "HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE" is the
variable name that is used in CGI scripts to reflect that header.


>to control which date format is used.

This may be read as saying that if you get Accept-Language: en-us,
then using 04/02/03 is okay. I would have to disagree with this;
I think building in a bit of redundancy is important because too
many things can go wrong (browser settings, fallbacks,...).
We should make clear that redundancy is always desirable.

Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for. But the ghist of it
should be mentioned a bit earlier.
