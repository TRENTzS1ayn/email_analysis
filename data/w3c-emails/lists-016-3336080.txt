Hi Phil,

I have a comment on Helios TextPad. If relevant to this FAQ, I would inform
the reader about the fact that the Unicode support is minimal and restricted
to Latin-1 Supplement characters in TextPad.

> BACKGROUND
> 
> Content on the web can be authored using a variety of 
> software applications. Even within a single site, the content 
> may have been created using multiple authoring tools. For 
> example, a website that was created using Macromedia 
> Dreamweaver might also include a page created using Microsoft 
> Access' data access page feature, as well as a dynamic Flash 
> movie that allows for language selection. In order for all of 
> these files to properly serve the correct text, they need to 
> be properly encoded.
> 
> This article is not meant to be a tutorial on defining and 
> using character encoding within the web authoring 
> applications, but rather to identify where some of the key 
> functionality exists. This is not a complete listing of 
> software, but rather a collection of some of the more popular 
> web authoring applications in use
> 
> As software evolves, it is possible that the location of the 
> functionality may change. In addition, specific options of 
> character encodings may vary depending on the user's 
> installation version and location, and so these are not 
> discussed in detail for each application. For more detailed 
> information, refer to the specific application's help content 
> or user manuals. Common keywords for searches include 
> Character Encoding, Internationalization, Multilingual, 
> Unicode, and UTF.
> 
> There are two main points to remember when creating properly 
> encoded files:
> 
>      1. the markup within the document must properly 
> designate the encoding (such as charset=iso-8859-1 in an 
> XHTML/HTML meta tag, or encoding="UTF-8" in an XML 
> declaration statement).
> 
>      2. the file, itself, must be saved in the proper 
> encoding format (such as UTF-8).
> 
> Most of these applications will save the file in the proper 
> format, but may not input the proper markup within the document.
> 
> Another key element in the markup is the language indicator. 
> Many of the applications listed here combine the encoding and 
> language in the user-selectable options. If the language is 
> not included by the application, it is good practice to also 
> include that in the markup manually. Some applications may 
> acquire the regional settings of your operating system to 
> create a locale tag.
