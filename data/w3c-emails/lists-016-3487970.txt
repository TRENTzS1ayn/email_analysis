Hi Jungshik,

1) yes, utf-16 is pairs of bytes, utf-32 is quadruplets.
2) yes, the characters will display differently, depending on encoding and font
of the editor.
Maybe we should use a graphic to show the mistreatment(s).
Also, they are being mistreated as characters, but we should refer to them as
bytes since they are not representing characters.

3) For the faq we shouldn't use scripts that look "something like..." or have
too many version dependencies. So we can't use the sed script.
Also, thanks for pointing out the problem with the perl script in your other
mail.
If it is not safe and reliable we shouldn't put it in the faq at all.
