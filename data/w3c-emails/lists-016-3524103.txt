 Yeah, it may be a good idea to give a couple (or a few) images with
misidentified encodings.

 I should have given a complete version, but I guess not many people
would be interested in it. So, let's forget about it as you suggested.

  With Perl 5.8 already widely deployed, the following
is  safe and reliable. I wrote about Perl 5.6 (or earlier) just for the
sake of completeness.

  perl -p -i.bak -e '(1 == $.) && s/^\x{FEFF}//' filename

With '-i.bak' instead of '-i', the original will be backed up
as filename.bak (Martin used '-i~'.)
