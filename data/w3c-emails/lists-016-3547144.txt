Chaps,

While everyone was sending in comments I was creating an HTML version of
Deborah's FAQ and adding a few edits of my own.  I anticipated some of
your suggestions, but we should run through them this evening to find
any stragglers.

Go to : http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-utf8-bom.html

Deborah, I removed the change marks, but added one more change based on
Tex's (very good!) comment.
