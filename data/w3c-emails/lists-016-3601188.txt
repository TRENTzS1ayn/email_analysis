Tex,

You were right that the term signature is not used in the CharMod. I
was wrong about that.  But then 'byte order mark' and 'BOM' don't appear
there either, as far as I can tell.

But look at section 2.11 of the Unicode Standard v4 (pp47-48) and you
will see a distinction drawn between the terms Byte Order Mark and
Unicode Signature.  In section 15.9, it refers to 'Unicode Encoding Form
Signatures'.
