I upgraded to the new version

1) supports unicode utf-8 but doesn't seem to support more than latin-1
characters.
However, my language is set to english I'll try loading some other languages to
see if that adds other hcaracter support.

2) Default is to not write a bom.

3) there is a config option to write a bom with unicode.
4) there is a config option to default to writing unicode vs. ansi et al.
