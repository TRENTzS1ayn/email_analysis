I have NTFS but Notepad is only able to detect that a file is UTF-8
before opening with the Open dialog box if the signature is present.
Remove the signature and it no longer knows.  So it seems to me that
NTFS doesn't remember the encoding.  Same happens for html files with
encoding declaration.

Note that Notepad seems to apply some heuristics to the file when you
right click.  It always opens correctly as utf-8.

That sounds fair enough.
