possibly. We were speculating it also depended on how the file was created.
But as you say it was also doing some detecting based on heuristics, it is
going to depend on the data in the file.
Which means our studies with a handful of files are not conclusive.
Apparently it also depends on how you open the file since you say above the box
looks for the signature, but below for right click its always correct. Odd they
don't use the same detection for both.

At least we are together on the conclusion! ;-)
