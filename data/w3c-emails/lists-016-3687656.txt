Thanks Chris,

I'll change "The presence of the BOM can create problems in older
browsers" to "The presence of the BOM for UTF-8 encoded pages can create
problems in older browsers"

> An entry for XML Spy would be good, as would some entries for SVG
creation tools.

If you can provide some info for us, I'll add it.

Cheers,
RI

PS: Can I copy this to the GEO group?

Someone reading that might think 'so, remove it to avoid problems in
older browsers'. Not good if the document is UTF-16.

An entry for XML Spy would be good, as would some entries for SVG
creation tools.
