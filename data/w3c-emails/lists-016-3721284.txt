Yes, I think a screenshot or two would be good.

I agree that version dependencies are a bad idea, but we should
try our best to make sure we have a script. A lot of people copy/paste
and use scripts, but they won't write a script by themselves.

On more comment (for the original FAQ): I think the background section
should be shorter, or be moved to after the answer. People want to
see the answer to their question quickly.
