Hi Jungshik,

Mozilla/Netscape:  When I researched this, the application was branded as
Netscape Composer (on the Netscape site). I tried to find this application
at the Mozilla site, but there was no mention of it. Do you have a URL for a
promotion page of the version you're talking about?

Notepad: As I noted early in the article, the actual encoding options are
often different between releases for various reasons, and so it's sometimes
difficult to find two installations with exactly the same choices. So, I
considered this out of scope for this FAQ because much of it would be
misleading or confusing (it's only mentioned in a few places for specific
reasons). Instead, this is really just meant to tell people where to look to
find the options.

Thanks for your feedback!

Phil

  I thought I asked 'Mozilla/Netscape composer' to be added when I gave
my feedback. I wonder why Mozilla was dropped in the released version.
(apparently there's a PR issue with Mozilla)
Please, use this line (there's a typo - Linix instead of Linux - as
well.) instead.

Mozilla/Netscape Composer (Windows, Mac OS, Unix/Linux, OS/2, VMS, BeOS)

-----------
Netscape Composer (Windows, Mac, Unix/Linix)

   Character  encoding  for  a document can be set here: View > Character
   Coding  menu. A file can be saved using a different character encoding
   here: File > Save As Charset.

In Notepad/Wordpad section, it might as well be noted that Notepad
on Win2k offers only four choices, 'ANSI' (the codepage corresponding
to the default system locale), 'Unicode' (meaning UTF-16LE on ix86),
'Unicode Big endian', and UTF-8. I added several codepages to be supported
in Intl/Regional setting control panel, but Notepad's offering didn't
change.

In Vim section, platforms supported are missing. It's ported to
many OS' (http://www.vim.org/download.php) : Windows, Mac OS,
Unix/Linux, Amiga, MS-DOS, OS/2 etc. BTW, there's a brand-new HTML
filetype plugin that can automate charset/lang setting in the future
(http://www.infynity.spodzone.com/vim/HTML/). It doesn't do that yet
(so it's not for FAQ), but I wrote to the author of the plugin that the
feature would be very handy.
