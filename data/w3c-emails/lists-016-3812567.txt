Thanks for your excellent FAQ. Below are a couple of comments.

  Actually, what Netpia have done is rather hackish. It requires a
plugin that works only with MS IE on Windows and your name server has
to be modified to support it. Besides, it's not domain names per se
but 'keyword' service.

  I'm afraid this is a bit misleading. It's true that only a subset of
ASCII chars can be used, but that has already been worked around with
a specially-devised encoding scheme (to wrap up Unicode characters
in that subset of ASCII) as you probably know.

 A few months ago the KR domain registrar began to accept
_genuine_ internationalized domain registration in Korean for .kr
domain. IDN works NOW with Mozilla and Opera. MS IE and Konqueror/Safari
don't yet support it though. Try 'http://%ec%a0%95%ed%86%b5%eb%b6%80.kr' for instance.
I guess the same is true of other national domains.

  Could you please mention Mozilla whenever you mention Netscape?
As I wrote earlier in another thread, Netscape is a Netscape-branded
browser based on Mozilla and with the shutdown of Netscape division of
Time-Warner, there is likely to be any new version of Netscape. However,
Mozilla will continue to be developed.

  It'd be frustrating if you're an American at a net-cafe in one of
non-English speaking countries and you don't know how to set up your
language preference.

  Would it be a good idea to include a link to the Apache reference
document on language setting of documents served and document on other
web servers?  In the default Apache installation, it's very easy to
offer multiple versions of _static_ documents. Just use language codes
as suffices (e.g. index.ja.html or index.html.ja for Japanese). Apache
will pick up and serve index.fr.html   if the language preference of a
client is French.

  BTW to BTW, :-)  to Korean localizeers, please use '?????????' (Han-guk-o)
instead of '??????'(Hangul). The former is the name of the language and
the latter is the name of the script. You wouldn't use 'Cyrillic alphabet'
for Russian, would you?
