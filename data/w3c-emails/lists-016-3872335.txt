Since I think you intend this to incorporate language sites too, perhaps
'country-specific' -> local or localized
Or even: how do I ensure that visitors to our global home page find the
local sites my company has developed?

Very good point !

For example URIs we should say 'www.example.fr' etc.

This is now out of date.  The IETF approved IDN in March this year.  It
is defined in RFCs 3490, 3491, 3492 and 3454, and already works on
Mozilla 1.4 / Netscape 7.1 and Opera 7.2.  The domain name is actually
still registered using a subset of ASCII characters, called Punycode,
but browsers above can convert native script URIs to this form.  For an
excellent overview of this see Internationalized Domain Names, K. Momoi
http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2003/idn .  .jp and .cn already
support IDN (In Beijing this week I spoke with the head of the .cn
domain name org.)  Note also that all other approaches to this are now
disallowed in IDN.

This is of course too much detail for the FAQ.  We should probably say
here that domain names in local script are supported in many domains,
eg. .jp and .cn, and give an example - I have one in Chinese.  I don't
know whether it's worth mentioning in this FAQ that it makes sense to
register an alternative ASCII version of the domain name too, for those
who can't, eg, type in Chinese characters.

I'm not sure that this is correct.  When I was in Budapest I got Google
automatically displaying in Hungarian, and on my home computer Google
comes up in Spanish.  I have neither of these languages in my list of
preferred languages.  I think it may use IP addresses.

There are additional downsides, some of which are described in a
previous FAQ [ ].  In my presentation in Beijing I said:
-the user may have never checked the Accept-Language setting
-user agent may send a request that specifies only a language and
not a region 
(a particular issue if trying to establish locale for information like
date formats)
-people borrow machines from friends, they use them in internet
cafes - in these cases the inferred locale may be inappropriate
-always allow the user to select the appropriate language (and
locale) from whatever page they are looking at !

I think we should make the last point clearly. 

The example I used was http://www.w3.org//Press/1998/CSS2-REC

There are a number of things we could say about splash gateways in a
longer format, but I think we should at least say here that the splash
page should be language agnostic, and that the names of all countries /
languages should be in the language and script of that country.

At this point, I still don't a clear picture in my mind of what we're
talking about here.  Would it be better to call this 'In-page links' ?

Depends to an extent on the space available and type of site.  Maybe we
should be less firm about the number, and just say, 'if space allows'.

Be very careful here.  Pull down menus are notoriously bad for support
of multiple scripts and languages.  It may also be equally valid to link
to another page - especially where there are a large number of
alternatives, or where regional groupings are used that can most easily
be indicated by a map.  Some sites use dynamic HTML (see eg the former
eTranslate).  I would suggest we replace 'use a pull-down menu' with
'expose a selection list or page'.

And script!  Don't use 'nihongo', use the japanese characters.  This is
where difficulties arise, because you can't expect everyone to have the
required fonts to show all options in a list.  I think there is a good
case for using graphics rather than text for these items - since they
never need translation that's ok.  The problem with graphics, of course,
is that they are not supported in pull-down lists yet (watch out for
XHTML2).  

Good as this FAQ is, thinking about these things makes me suspect that
it might be good to work on the guidelines re navigation a bit more, so
that we can work through some of the questions a little more in a
coordinated fashion, then use this FAQ to summarise and point to the
detail.

I just remembered I wrote a paper on this topic for a Unicode conference

for what it's worth.
