Hello John, others,

I think this is great material. My main concern would be
to try to split the material up into more than one FAQ.
For example, we could start with an FAQ on one of the ways
to use, then add more, or we could start with an 'overview'
FAQ giving the various options and the message to use them
together, and then add others for details for each of the
methods.

This is a very good question, but maybe we should also
make sure that we give some good reasons why making sure
visitors to a global page find country/language-specific
sites. I can imagine that many companies don't get that.
Once they get it, they already are moving in the right
direction.

How about the order?

I think there is an excellent chance for an IDN FAQ, so we should
keep this short.

I agree with Richard. Better not mention google, you're never
sure what they're going to do next :-).

There is a page at http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTTP-prefs.html
with details on many more browsers. Maybe better just refer to it.
What we would need is explanations of how to configure the server,
because that's what this FAQ is about.

I'm sorry, but I clearly disagree here. Graphics are not accessible.
And it's true that you can't expect everybody to have all fonts, but
you can expect e.g. the people interested in the Chinese version to
have Chinese fonts, and so on. So there is no need for graphics.

Even better, should read 'except for sites specific to a particular
country'. [there may be country-specific sites along with language-
or region-specific ones.]

Many regions (but of course not all) have flags. So
there may be a need for some reworking.
