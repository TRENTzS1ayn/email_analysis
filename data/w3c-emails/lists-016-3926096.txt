Thanks Deborah !

I have updated the FAQ online with the suggested changes.  I think this
is quite a lot better.  I haven't added the background stuff yet though.
There are three main reasons: a. it seems rather long, b. I'm not sure
whether such detail is appropriate in *this* FAQ, c. I haven't had the
opportunity to read it in detail yet.  Anyone else reading this, please
send in your thoughts!

I left in change marks so people can see what's different.

Wrt "which browsers display the extra line when encountering the UTF-8
BOM" try Netscape 4.8.
