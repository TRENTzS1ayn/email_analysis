Hello Richard, Deborah,

Very good work. Some comments below.

I would like to change the question from:
"When I'm using a UTF-8 encoding, why does an extra line appear at the top 
of my web page, and how do I remove it?"
to
"When I'm using a UTF-8 encoding, why may an extra line appear at the top 
of my web page, and how do I remove it?"

(i.e. change from 'does' to 'may')

I think it's important we don't give, in one way or another,
the impression that there is something wrong with UTF-8.

Answer, second paragraph: It's not clear to me whether 'interpreting
UTF-8 correctly' refers to "interpreting the file as being encoded
in UTF-8", or "interpreting the BOM correctly (i.e. not showing it)".

"Latin 1 ISO 8859-1 character encoding": use clearer terminology

"hexadecimal byte values" -> "byte values in hexadecimal notation"

"remove the extraneous characters, which represent the UTF-8 signature"
-> "remove the extraneous bytes, which represent the UTF-8 signature"

Background: the first paragraph says the BOM is a sequence of bytes.
the second paragraph says it's a character.

"In UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings": If the reader hasn't got the message
that we are speaking about encodings, we probably need do fix something
earlier on. Please change to "UTF-16 and UTF-32" (several similar cases).

"Each character in the file is composed of 2 to 4 bytes of data":
probably better to replace 'composed of' with 'represented by'.

"You will find that Windows Notepad  and Helios Textpad will":
Are there others? Do we know that there are no others? Word as
"some text editors such as ...".

"Cutting and pasting UTF-8 text between different applications can have
unexpected results, even if both applications are nominally UTF-8 aware."
Can we be more specific here? Otherwise, that is more confusing than helpful.

Regards,    Martin.
