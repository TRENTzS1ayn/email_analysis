There is a default sort order for Unicode, but it is not something that all
users understand or expect.
In short there is no one sort order that works universally.

Selecting a point on a world map is a possible alternative but requires mapping
all locations to language which is not possible
(although you could map locations to short lists of languages which might be
reasonable).

Writing the name of the language in the language is visually very identifiable
and stands out
to readers of the language, so works well.

I'd be interested to see what others think a good solution is.
