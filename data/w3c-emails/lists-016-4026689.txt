In a way the problem is made worse by our providing a list of languages that
the user must select from.

It would be much easier if the user simply typed the language name (in unicode)
since we can easily match that or provide something close to any candidate
names they might type.

That changes the problem to one of how do you ask the question "what is your
language? Please type it here".

For this we need an international standard, either a graphic image of someone
speaking, or the modern equivalent of
asking someone in radio communications "What's your 10-20?" (Where are you
located?).

The number scheme works around the world....10-4, 10-20, etc.

It might do to show lots of language names and a graphic and a field where
people can type in their language...
Maybe have some auto complete to reduce the typing.

We make everything mousable and sometimes it ends up being harder than if the
user were to just type in the info.
For example selecting state in the USA from a list of 50 just to get a 2 letter
code (which is redundant with the postal code anway!!!)
