Matching could be done, but would require quite some experience
with what people might type.

It doesn't. I have no clue what these mean, for example.
And getting such things established is very difficult and would
require a lot of work.

The chance is that people look at it and say 'my language isn't here'
and give up.

In that case, the user knows the code, it's a short code, and
the user knows that his/her code will be okay. For languages,
the chance is that there would be a lot of sites where people
would try a language, and find out that their language isn't
supported. That would then quickly discourage them from trying.
So a list or a popup provides very important additional information:
what languages are actually available.
