Hmmm, that label reflects the registration of the site and perhaps nothing
about the nature of the site or the interests of the user.

Consider all the .com sites for example, many of which are not based in the US
or english speaking countries.
Also, now that we have international IDN names, is it better to use the script
of the name, or the locale of the registration.
For example www.example.ru might also be written in Chinese (just to contrive
something).
Or to be more clear- www.<example-ideograph>.ru
Where <example-ideograph> is the Chinese ideograph(s) for "example".

Some sites look at the location associated with the user's ip address. That is
problematic as well.
