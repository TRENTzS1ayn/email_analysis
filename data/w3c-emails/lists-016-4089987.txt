Chaps,

After discussion with Deborah I have uploaded another version of
http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-utf8-bom.html that includes
Martin's comments.  

Let's try to publish this on Thursday.  Please send in any other
comments asap, then we'll have a final discussion during the meeting
tomorrow.

Cheers,
RI
