Just a few more comments:

In the question: "a UTF-8 encoding": How many UTF-8 encodings are there?

"You should check thoroughly the result of removing the signature"...:
This seems to be a general issue about checking whether UTF-8 is really
UTF-8, not really related to the BOM. Better say so.

"If there is no evidence of a UTF-8 signature at the beginning of the file, 
then your problem lies elsewhere.": Is that something that appears frequently?
If not, maybe leave this out. If yes, better give some other possible
causes. I guess we could leave this out.

The background mentions things such as 'BOM'. This is okay. But I'm
affraid there are quite a few readers who know this thing as 'BOM',
so it would help to add "('BOM')" after "UTF-8 signature" in the
first paragraph of the answer.

"Each character in the file is represented by 2 to 4 bytes of data":
changing '2 to 4' to '2 or 4' will be more precise. 3 bytes isn't an
option of UTF-16 or UTF-32.

I think we were talking about taking Helios Textpad out (because it's
UTF-8/i18n support is currently marginal). Or was this in another context?

"Microsoft documentation about the Byte Order" ->
"Microsoft documentation about the Byte Order Mark"

Why is there a link to Apache Content Negotiation?
