Hi Jungshik,

I think you're forgetting what happens to a JSP page. You can't just have
the JSP container omit to mention the charset in the HTTP header because the
encoding is important in the lifecycle of a JSP page: JSP pages are compiled
into servlets. That is, they are turned into a small Java program that
generates the HTML. The HTML content in a JSP page just becomes a series of
Java String objects inside the servlet. The Strings must be converted back
to bytes using some encoding (since Strings are UTF-16 based Java objects).
You set the encoding used for this conversion with the page contentType
directive.

So you see: if you don't tell JSP container's servlet generate what encoding
you want, it has to make some assumption.

There is another part to this process as well: you have to generate the
servlet (i.e. those String objects) to begin with. Parsing the HTML to look
for a META tag is not a really reliable solution. So unless the file is
entirely ASCII to begin with, you have to tell the JSP container how to read
the bytes in the file to generate the servlet. This is what the pageEncoding
directive does.

One could argue with the choice of Latin-1 as the JSP default, but any other
encoding, including UTF-8, wouldn't really solve the problem: people want to
use legacy encodings from time to time as well. Setting the page encoding
and content type should just be automatically part of what a JSP developer
does in every page.

Best Regards,

Addison
