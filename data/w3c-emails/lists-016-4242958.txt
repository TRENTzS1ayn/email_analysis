Do you want to say 'send data encoded in the encoding of accept-charset',
or what?

This is what the URI spec requires.

>(so much for send back what you receive.)

As I argued on another list, people don't really override, unless
they have a strong reason to (avoid garbage on the screen), in
which case the browser is actually sending back what it received,
just not what it was told it was receiving.

I'm not sure. On www-international, we had reports that for
some browsers, it can increase the likelyhood of getting the
right thing back. That would mean:

- Use accept-charset to protect against the user changing
   the page encoding (on some browsers)
- Only use an accept-charset with the same encoding as that
   of the page, don't try to ask browsers to send data back
   in another encoding.

Only if that's a scenario you have to protect against,
which I think isn't a realistic scenario.


Regards,    Martin.
