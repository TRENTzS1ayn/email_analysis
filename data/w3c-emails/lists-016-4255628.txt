I just posted an updated version of the Ruby FAQ containing edits
suggested during last week's telecon.
http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-ruby.html

I also posted a new version of the Authoring Guidelines.
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/
-Added Martin's comments on status and abstract, and a lot more
stuff to Status preparation for publication.
-New spruced up version of section 3.2 - Specifying a page
encoding
-went through all info about UA applicability
-various other odds and ends

We should review both of these tonight.


Andrew, how are things coming with your FAQ.  Will you be able to post
anything before the meeting?
