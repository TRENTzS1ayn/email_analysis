No sign of Andrew this evening - I hope he's ok.

I knocked up a new FAQ in an hour or so this evening from some stuff
Martin has in Hints & Tips section.  If its not too controversial, maybe
we can handle comments via email and post it on Friday.

See http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-doc-charset.html

Comments please.
