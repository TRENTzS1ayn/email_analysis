Richard,

In the first sentence:

    The document character set or base character set of HTML (from version 4.0) 
    and XML is ISO/IEC 10646 (also known as Unicode).  

I think we need to make sure that ISO 10646 and Unicode not be mentioned as the "Same" thing.  This also needs to be fixed in the "By the way" section.

Spelling:

    internationalisation -> internationalization
    practise -> practice

Regards, Russ

No sign of Andrew this evening - I hope he's ok.

I knocked up a new FAQ in an hour or so this evening from some stuff Martin has in Hints & Tips section.  If its not too controversial, maybe we can handle comments via email and post it on Friday.

See http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-doc-charset.html

Comments please.
