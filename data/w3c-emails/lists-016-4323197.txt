Hi, Sorry I missed the meeting.

Re the Faq:

1) I don't think we should say the "most important consequence" is the impact
on escape sequences.
It is a consequence, but the most important value is that all character
behavior is defined (in logical terms).
Perhaps give some other examples- eg bidi...

2) It might be good to mention that the xml character set is restricted and not
all of Unicode, since the annotations for html are given.
