For this one, we could move the link to
http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTML-charset.html under the Historical
Documents heading in
http://www.w3.org/International/resources.html#hints and add the
following to the page: "For an updated version of this page, see
http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-doc-charset.html" in bold
characters.

A redirect sounds somewhat cleaner, though. I'm trying to decide whether
there's a downside to that - ie. People being confused or disappointed
not to find the original page. I don't think there's any impact to other
links.

Can you point me to an example of how to do redirects in the .htaccess
file?
