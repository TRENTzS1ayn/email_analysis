First working draft of  Authoring Techniques for XHTML & HTML
Internationalization 1.0 to be released tomorrow.
http://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-html-tech/

New repository created: CSS Internationalization Techniques Repository
1.0 http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/css-tech.html

Decision taken that we cannot decide yet whether to hold a meeting
during the Technical Plenary in March, although some interest in
attending. 
ACTION: RI, to respond

Agreement that the group needs to now begin focussing again on the
Guidelines development, while maintaining the FAQs.  Suggested that we
make assignements to specific people with deadlines for producing
material about a section that is of value / interest for them to work on
(much like the FAQs).  Note that we are not asking people to write
sections: we are asking that they produce some one liner techniques
(do's and don'ts), then make notes on points that need to be made in the
descriptions.

Discussed an FAQ written by Richard for publication this week:
http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-doc-charset.html as a
subsititute for Andrew's piece.

Discussion of various BBC World Service concerns and interests.
