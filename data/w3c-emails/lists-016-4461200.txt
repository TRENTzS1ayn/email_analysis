Hi,

I have trouble with the term "localized font name" because for many of the
asian fonts I know, they had native names for years and the ascii name, coming
later, is the localized version, localized for the US... ;-)

But you have a good point and font naming is a very big problem area. I know
Richard was trying to develop a list of fonts to use for the languages around
the world earlier in the year.

Your comment on font names could make a good FAQ. Jungshik, would you like to
create one?

I am not sure though that the behavior is the same for all operating systems
and/or browsers.
I am familiar with Microsoft and it is right from the underlying architecture
perspective. We would need to confirm the behavior for several user agents on
several systems with several languages, as you indicate by examples.
