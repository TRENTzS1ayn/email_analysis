Dear GEO Task Force,

I put together an FAQ for this week, based on some question that I
received in private a few weeks ago about character encodings and
the validator. Please have a look at it at
http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-validator-charset-check.html
and send in comments before the teleconf on Wednesday.

The last section (useful links) is still incomplete. Any suggestions
welcome.

Regards,    Martin.
