I have begun a new test page to check browser capabilities relating to
text-transform.  It is not complete.  If anyone wants to help develop it
further I'd welcome your help.

See http://www.w3.org/International/tests/test-text-transform.html

I notice so far that IE and Opera strangely fail to transform particular
characters, whereas Firebird 0.6.1 does.  No browser seems to deal
properly with Turkish I's or (perhaps not surprisingly) with German
esszets.
