Dictionary lookup wouldn't be good enough, because there are
words that are otherwise spelled the same (if you think about
it, that better had be the case, or it wouldn't make sense to
have a separate letter in the first place :-).

Well, not exactly. If you have the original in mixed case,
then lowercasing works quite well, because there are no words
that start with an (uppercase) sz. (again, that makes sense,
because otherwise, there would be an uppercase sz)

There is another issue, however, that can cause problems:
To shorten text while being politically correct, there is
the convention to use upper case in the middle of a word,
i.e. "Studenten and Studentinnen" (students (male) and
students (female)) is shortened to "StudentINNen". The
stylistic uppercasing of this is "STUDENTinnEN", and
I guess the stylistic lowercasing would be "studentINNen".
This probably could be taken care of by some context analysis,
it wouldn't need a dictionary.

Regards,     Martin.
