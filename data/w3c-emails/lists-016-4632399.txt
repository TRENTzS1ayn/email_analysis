GUIDELINES REVIEW

http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/#ri20030218.131104811
****Section 2.3 Should we recommend declaring charset in HTTP header
as first priority?  Should we recommend it at all?


-Richard's bidi backgrounder
http://people.w3.org/rishida/scripts/bidi/


-Andrew's proposal for addition to guidelines 2.2
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-geo/2003Jul/0060.html





DISCUSSION

-is there an issue with Mac browsers and utf-8?
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-geo/2003Jul/0002.html

-should we limit ourselves to xhtml served as text/html for the
guidelines?

****what should we do wrt distinguishing behaviour for 
XHTML served as text/html or app/xml or app/xhtml+xml?

****should we limit our scope to html (which includes xhtml served
as text/html), 
or extend it to cover xhtml served as xml?

-should we assume the use of xml declaration for xhtml 1, or
factor in that many won't use it?
eg.
