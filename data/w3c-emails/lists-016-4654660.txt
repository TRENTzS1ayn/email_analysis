Here is an example of transcoding on the server:

The following page
     http://w3.hotbox.ru/XML/1999/XML-in-10-points/
is served as windows-1251 to Windows boxes, but as
koi8-r to Unix boxes (such as the validator, see
http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fw3.hotbox.ru%2FXML%2F1999%2FX 
ML-in-10-points%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&verbose=1)
This also shows that the document is (most probably)
originally in windows-1251.

Regards,     Martin.
