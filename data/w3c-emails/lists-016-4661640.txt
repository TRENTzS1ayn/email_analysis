Here is my text about character encoding settings in Amaya:

To save an HTML/XHTML document in a particular characterencoding,
use the 'save as' dialog from the 'file' menu. The encodings
supported are us-ascii, utf-8, and iso-8859-1. Amaya
will make sure that the encoding is correct in the
xml declaration (for XHTML) and the <meta> statement.
Amaya also uses the appropriate encoding ('charset') in
the HTTP headers when it saves a document remotely using PUT.
Amaya also understands several other encodings when loading
a document, but is not able so save in any of these.

This needs some links, but I'm confident that Richard can
add these in the final edit phase.


Regards,    Martin.
