Info Share
Tex: The next call for participation in the Internationalizatoin &
Unicode Conference is out - please send in proposals


Martin's FAQ
We made some comments on Martin's draft
http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-validator-charset-check.htm
l - we'll publish tomorrow morning
ACTION: RI, develop a style guide for FAQs and augment stylesheet (esp.
use nowrap for keywords)



Future FAQs
Richard will create an FAQ from the Hints & Tips section fo the website
for next week.
2 weeks from now PHIL will publish an FAQ with the approximate title of
"How do I configure my editing tool to use a particular encoding ?"
People will contribute information as follows:
Dreamweaver: Phil
Adobe GoLive: Phil
Frontpage: Russ
IBM HomeSite: Deborah
Notepad: 
Amaya: MD
Xmetal: RI
3 weeks from now DEBORAH and TEX will publish an FAQ about the UTF-8
signature (what it is, problems it can cause, how to get rid of it,
etc.)
A possible future FAQ could treat why certain encodings should be
avoided, and what the difference between ISO and Windows encodings



FAQs and RSS
The FAQs are now available as an RSS feed
http://www.w3.org/International/questions.rss  We should try to identify
people who are interested in picking up this feed and alert them to it.



Guidelines Comments
We have  a number of comments after the 1st WD was released - we need to
ensure that everyone sees those comments, since some went to the
www-i18n-comments@w3.org list (the archive is publicly visible at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-i18n-comments/)


Charset Declaration
We discussed the first technique in section 3.2
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/#ri20030218.131104811
which involved a discussion about transcoding by servers.
We agreed in principle that we should recommend that people should NOT
declare the encoding using the HTTP header, but rely instead on
declarations inside the document.  This is because of the difficultly
the average content developer has in managing the server information and
because it carries a stronger likelihood of being correct if the
encoding is changed from time to time.  However, where a document is
transcoded the server should send the charset info in the HTTP header -
this will override the in-document declaration.  There may be
exceptional cases, such as Tim Bray's site, where he only uses server
settings because he has complete control over his pages and environment.
We need to get more feedback on the list and from other people about how
prevalent transcoding is these days, and who does it.
ACTION: Tex, look at Google's cache to see how that works vis a vis
transcoding



Use of Mailing Lists
www-international@w3.org
We should all use this as much as possible for any technical discussions
that are not member confidential, rather than hold the discussion on
public-i18n-geo list.  This is beneficial because (a) it opens up
opportunities for additional contributions (there are nearly 400 people
on the list), and (b) it provides an outreach and education opportunity
for others on that list.

public-i18n-geo@w3.org
This should be used for GEO admin (such as this note).  It can also be
used for group-restricted review of FAQs, guidelines submissions, etc.
if the person submitting the information prefers.  It should NOT be used
for discussions that are not related to GEO deliverables (FAQs,
guidelines, articles, etc.).  General technical discussions should use
www-international.

w3c-i18n-ig@w3.org
The possibility exists to use this for member confidential discussions -
eg. discussions about specification details that are not yet in the
public domain.  Not everyone is currently subscribed to this list, but
some may not want to be subscribed since the list carries a lot of
non-GEO related information.  We will defer a decision about how to deal
with member confidential information until such time as it becomes
necessary.
