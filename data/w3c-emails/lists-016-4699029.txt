Hello Richard,

Just some comments, no on the accuracy of the minutes,
but continuing the discussion.

I'm really not sure about this. There is nothing bad at all with
having the right HTTP header. Recommending that people do NOT
use it clearly sends the wrong message.

I think that talking about the 'average content developer'
is potentially dangerous. Most of us like to think that we and
the people around us are 'average'. Yet the Web is extremely
diverse. There are large companies that translate manuals
into dozens of languages, and on the other side, there are
many personal Web sites where nobody ever thinks about
translation. And there are many other examples.

Well, I agree in certain scenarios. But in others (as an example
when editing in a plain text editor), the information in a file
is probably not very reliable, either.
There are also other scenarios, for example a company with
clearly established policies (all content in languages a, b, c
in encoding foo,...) that are implemented through the use
of appropriate tools,...

Well, yes, but usually, these transcoders don't look inside the
document to find the encoding in the first place.

This case is exceptional, but in some ways, it's the way of the future
(everything in UTF-8). And in some ways, every Web site is an exception.
