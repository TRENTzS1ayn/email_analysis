  I feel the same way as Martin. The technique in question seems to be
reasonable as it is in the editor's copy.  It also has to be noted that
a lot of dynamic contents are generated with charset emitted in http
header.

  In case of Apache,  as is well known, unless the system admin blocks
users from configuring http header for their documents, individual users
(non-admin) do have a complete control over their documents served by
Apache. I realize it's not the case with other servers (especially with
IIS), but my point is that Tim Bray is not the only one with a complete
control.

  To my surprise, google's cache doesn't transcode. Instead, it serves
cached documents in their *original* encoding with  html meta tag with
C-T charset prepended. (I made sure that google does that even when
the original documents don't have html meta tag.)  Actually, the way
google serves cached pages is not standard-compliant because it
blindly emits 'meta information' (with actual html tags like table)
before <html> as shown below (so that thosed cached pages wouldn't get
validated).
