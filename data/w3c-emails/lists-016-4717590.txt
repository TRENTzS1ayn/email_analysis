  That's great. I only wish others in news media did the same :-)
(OT : It'd be even nicer of you (or others at BBC) to participate in
W3C accessibility working group (http://www.w3.org/WAI) as well. if you

  I'd argue that the change would be transparent to most audiences right
now, but I'd not insist that you have to change it right away partly
because I believe it's not just audience-side but also 'supplier side'
(that is, BBC and its reporters and other staffs) that has to be taken
into account.
