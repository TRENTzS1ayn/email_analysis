 You're right that I should have used ASCII names and non-ASCII ('native')
names, instead.

  Mozilla has such a list (although not very extensive) per
script('langGroup')  and platform.  As you may know, CSS2 (or CSS1) spec
has a similar list, but I'm afraid some of them need to be changed. For
example, my feedback (and my brother's) on Korean fonts (the one
given as sans-serif is actually 'serif-like' while the one listed as
serif is sans-serif) hasn't been acted on. Perhaps, we can make a more
comprehensive list by merging Richard's (that probably includes that
of CSS1), Mozilla's and other source (I'm familar with what fonts are
shipped by various linux distributions).

 Thanks for the suggestion. Not right now, but I'll keep that in mind.

  I can test various agents on Windows 2k and Windows ME and Linux, but
I need help from Mac users. BTW, most foundries don't seem to bother to
fill out family name fields (of truetype/opentype fonts) for languages
other than English (you can list the family name of a truetype font in
tens of different languages). All (truetype/opentype) fonts that I've
seen have non-ASCII names are CJK fonts. As for other font formats (type1,
X11 BDF), non-ascii names are not even allowed.
