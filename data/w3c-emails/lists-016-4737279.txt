Regarding accessibility, BBC is currently engaged in improving online
standards, where W3C WAI is a valuable resource. Jonathan Hassell is BBC
Editor, Guidelines & Standards (New Media) coordinating pan-organization
working groups.

  That's great. I only wish others in news media did the same :-)
(OT : It'd be even nicer of you (or others at BBC) to participate in
W3C accessibility working group (http://www.w3.org/WAI) as well. if you
don't at the moment.)

  I'd argue that the change would be transparent to most audiences right
now, but I'd not insist that you have to change it right away partly
because I believe it's not just audience-side but also 'supplier side'
(that is, BBC and its reporters and other staffs) that has to be taken
into account.

  No problem. I'm glad you're gonna implement it across the site soon.
