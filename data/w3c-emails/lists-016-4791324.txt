Tex/Junshik - Can we make sure that we can add this to the CSS 2.1
review? There are also mistakes in the Japanese examples, the
font "Kyokasho ICA" (or anything being named "Kyokasho"), although
having serifs, isn't suitable as a generic serif font because it's
a special style used for schoolbooks, which would look strange
on other material.

Actually, it looks from http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/fonts.html
that all this is info is gone. Is that what we want?

Regards,    Martin.
