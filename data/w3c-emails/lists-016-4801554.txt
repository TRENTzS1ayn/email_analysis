Hello Phil,

Very good job! Extremely thorough and helpful.
Some comments below.

This talks about pages from different tools in the same Web site.
That's not really what the author in an authoring tool needs to know,
even when the whole site is done by the same tool, there may be
different encodings,...
And I don't think we should mention that many products that early,
and we should concentrate on Web pages (HTML), and leave Flash out.

It's a FAQ, so this sentence should not be necessary. Say what
you do, not what you don't. No need for excuses.

Good point. But maybe better turn it around by saying
"not everything covered ... if you know how to do this in a tool
not listed here, tell us..."

I'm not sure about 'location'. What do you mean? I think overall,
this paragraph can be shortened. E.g. something like:

Functionality may change with version. We indicate the applicable
version below.

That text could go into 'by the way' or 'background' or so.

We should say what each application does. I tried to do this
for Amaya.

This may go into the 'by the way', and is a good start for another FAQ.




>ANSWER

Richard, can you make sure there is a list of products as
internal links here (or even higher up) so that people can
find their product very quickly?


>[??? Adobe Acrobat ???]
>[??? can't find anything specific yet ???]

Does this produce HTML? If not, I guess we should leave it out.
Postscript/PDF has very different encoding problems from HTML
anyway.

'go to' seems to imply a menu selection. Maybe we should
be explicit that this is a menu.


>Edit > Preferences >
>Encodings category.

Does this include info in page or not?
I guess we can contact somebody from Adobe if we can't
figure this info out on our own.

'input the encoding' sounds a bit colloquial. I'm not sure
yet exactly what expression I would use, but I would use
the word 'label'.


>Files

This assumes that the author wants to save as UTF-8. This may
not be the case.

Does this create flash or html? If the former, leave it out.

What about labeling the encoding? And why is there a separate
setting needed for encoding and for viewing?


>Macromedia Flash MX (Mac & Windows)

As said above, I think we shouldn't deal with flash for the moment.

Does this have to be done in this order?

What does 'check your code' mean? Is this something like validation?
That wouldn't be part of this FAQ.

How good is the HTML that these tools generate these days?

Why is this under the font tab? Are there other choices for encodings?
I had a look at Frontpage 2002, and under the Tools >
Page Options > Default Font tab there was such an option, but
my impression was that this was to set the default font for UTF-8
pages, not to set the page to UTF-8.

This is the BOM issue. We have a FAQ planed on this, so we can
just have a pointer.

We are talking about the author, so I'm not sure we need this.
If the encoding is labeled properly, the end user should have
no reason at all to mess around with it. Maybe what we can
point to is that depending on the server setup, the server
will add encoding ('charset') info, which in the case of
a bad setup may conflict.

This is about IRIs; I propose to leave this out and treat it
separately.

You can also point to some of the FAQs about how to test the encoding.
