  I stand corrected. This particular error was corrected in CSS2
erranta :
  http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/fonts.html#generic-font-families

  There's still a problem, though.  The transliteration used for
Korean font name '??????' 'Phatang' is different from the English font
name used in all instances of that font style 'Batang'.  That is,
the following wouldn't work as intended.

  <span style="font-family: phatang, serif">.....</span>


Perhaps, it'd be better to list native font family names along with
English names in such a document.

  Indeed, they're gone.  What do you think we should do,  ask them to
add them back to CSS 2.1 or just roll out an FAQ for I18N GEO?
