  Notepad on Win2k SP4 (it could have been different before SP4) offers
me 4 choices, 'ANSI'(the codepage of the default system locale), Unicode
(meaning UTF-16LE), Unicode Big Endian, and UTF-8. It might list more
encodings if I add support for other code pages. (I've just tested it
on Win2k with the minimal installation.)
