All,

Just as a point of clarification, since I've received condolences from
two people in the group already :-) ...

When I took the job of WG Chair it was always in the expectation that a
member would take over at some point. I passed on the chair of the
*Working Group* to Addison, but I remain chair of the GEO TF.  (I will
now become 'staff contact' for the WG as a whole.)  

All this means that there will be no diminuation whatsoever to my
involvement with the GEO group and hopefully a bit more involvement
(which I hope is a good thing ;-).

Having said that... Just so you know, I'll be on vacation for the rest
of this week, then back for a week, then off to China and Japan for a
period of two weeks - but that has nothing to do with chair roles.

Cheers, and speak to you on Wednesday (one hour earlier, remember).
RI
