(Btw, I added the ig list to this thread.)

Yes, css21 doesn't have the examples of i18n fonts anymore.

1) Where is Richard's i18n font list posted?

2) Where is the Mozilla list?

3) Jungshik- Do you want to take a stab at merging the lists and posting it
here so we can discuss?
I think having a list of names by font type (serif, sans-serif, etc.) and by
language/script, with english and native names correctly spelled would be
useful to web authors as well as w3c spec writers.

If we have the list, then it makes sense to ask css and other wg to reference
i18n fonts in examples. Given the number of errors in the css2 list, it doesn't
make sense to ask them to reinstall the references in css21 now (in my
opinion).
Once we have some reviewed recommendations, I think we should ask them.

4) Martin mentioned today in the core group that we should suggest how SVG can
be used with respect to solving font problems. I am afraid my notes aren't good
on this. Martin, can you clarify what we should look at?
