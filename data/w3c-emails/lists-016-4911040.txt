They're scattered in several platform-dependent pref. files:

Windows :
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/modules/libpref/src/win/winpref.js
Mac OS:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/modules/libpref/src/mac/macprefs.js
Unix:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/modules/libpref/src/unix/unix.js
AIX :
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/modules/libpref/src/unix/aix.js
BeOS:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/modules/libpref/beos/beos.js
OS2:
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/modules/libpref/os2/os2pref.js

(there is the pref. file for QNX as well, but I don't think there's
anything interesting there).

Note that Unix/AIX list have XLFD(X11 Logical Font Description) entries
instead of just family names. winpref.js has both English names and CJK
names for CJK fonts.  As I wrote before, I have yet to see non-CJK
truetype fonts with non-English name fields filled in. Besides, Win32
APIs don't return them even if they're present as far as I can tell.
(hmm, I can experiment ....)

  I'll do once I get Richard's list. I'll also see what gnome/kde use
for the default fonts for various scripts/languages.

  This sounds like a reasonable course of actions.
