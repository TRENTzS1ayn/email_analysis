It's well done. A wee bit one sided, it should include some of the drawbacks of
moving to xhtml.
For me losing target="_blank" is significant.

They should include lang with xml:lang and the issue of serving the doc.
But nicely done. We should mention more of the benefits of using features and
opportunities that are opened up as well.
(Like using xslt etc.)
