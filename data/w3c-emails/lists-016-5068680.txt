I just posted Tex's FAQ, but despite Tex having prepared it in HTML it
was rather painful to convert it to XHTML for publication.  Could I ask
that in future if you submit an FAQ in HTML you prepare it in XHTML from
the start and ensure that it validates.

(And I know I need to develop a style guide.) 

Cheers,
RI
