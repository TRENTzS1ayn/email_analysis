Sorry for any work I caused you. I had started from a template from one of the
other published questions, which also didn't validate. You had indicated you
didn't want the style changed significantly so I thought I was kind of stuck
using it. (That was before I switched to the multi-question format.)

However, I just valdiated the page I submitted and I am surprised at the
duplicate ids in there. Usually I catch and fix that kind of stuff.

Anyway, if we have a validating template to fill in, it shouldn't be a problem
to keep it clean.
Sorry about the extra work. Thanks for posting it.

Have a good weekend!
