-should we limit ourselves to xhtml served as text/html for the
guidelines?

-should we be concerned with distinguishing behaviour for 
DOCTYPE related 'standards mode', 'almost standards mode' and
'quirks mode'

-what should we do wrt distinguishing behaviour for 
XHTML served as text/html or app/xml or app/xhtml+xml?

-should we assume the use of xml declaration for xhtml 1, or
factor in that many won't use it?
