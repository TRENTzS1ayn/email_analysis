Here is my (updated, after discussions last week) proposal
for some of the items in section 2.2:

second point: change to

    Where practical, use the XML declaration to declare the character encoding
    of XHTML documents.

third point: change to

    Use the meta element to explicitly declare the document's character 
encoding
    for HTML documents and XHTML documents served as text/html.


new point:

    For XHMTL document served as text/html, do not use the XML declaration
    if you need the document to be processed in 'standards' mode.


new point:

    Never use the presence of an XML declaration as the means to trigger
    'quirks mode' on browsers with backwards-compatibility features.


The reason for structuring the points this way is that this will
allow us to remove the later points once we do no longer consider
IE 5/6 widespread, and we can also concentrate the explanations
about this issue.

If this is okay for you as a general direction, I'll work on
some more details.


Regards,     Martin.
