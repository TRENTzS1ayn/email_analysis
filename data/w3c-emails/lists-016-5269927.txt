Okay, let me explain in a bit more detail.
Ideally, I would like the answer (very simplified) to be:
- If you have enough documents in this language (I think registration
   required 50 or so), request a new ISO code.
- If there are not enough documents, request a IANA registration.

While I very much hope that the current fee discussion will end up
the right way, I just don't think it is at all a good time just now
to ask people to register more codes with ISO. On the other hand,
I don't want to suggest anything else, because I very much hope
that the situation will turn to the better.

Regards,    Martin.
