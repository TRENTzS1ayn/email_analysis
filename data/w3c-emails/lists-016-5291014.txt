Hello Richard,

Overall, I like your approach more because it gives less
special treatment to the IE case. Some more comments below.

Yes, I think text/xml is clearly a bad idea, and application/xml
doesn't make much of a difference for charset detection.

There are already sites that serve the same file with a different
content type based on user agent.

This is mostly correct, but leaves out some important cases
where you need the XML declaration to correctly define the
character encoding. Leaving out the XML declaration may in
some cases be a choice independent of i18n issues, but in
others, it clearly isn't.

This includes cases where people want to serve one and the same
file as text/html and as application/xhtml+xml.
