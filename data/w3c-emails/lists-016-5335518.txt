ok.

My current guess (I might be wrong) is that these issues only
affect a small subset of our techniques, in particular section 2.
For the rest of the document, things should pretty much be the
same for HTML and XHTML (both served as text/html and served as
xml).

There are people who do negotiation, i.e. the same file is sent as
text/html to some browsers, and application/xhtml+xml to others.

To the largest extent, we are in this case talking about XHTML.
Also, if we want to see XHTML as an upgrade path for the future,
I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to consider XHTML served as xml,
because that makes sure that we recommend something that will
continue to work.

For some items. For others, there should be no difference at all.

Overall, i think we should consider XHTML served as xml.
