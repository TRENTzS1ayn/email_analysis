Russ,

Looks good!

A couple suggestions:

1) Maybe in the background add a note that it won't really be left to chance,
since there are rules that determine the encoding if it isn't specified in the
sheet.

2) Instead of quoting the spec, perhaps restate it in your own words.
a) I think people look to faqs because they dont understand spec-speak.
b) Your version will be more clear. (I am sure!)

c) The spec uses that hateful 2 steps of indirection to references, and you can
link [charsets] directly from your text, which is more useful if not usable.
Otherwise people have to figure out that the quote of "[charsets]" is the same
as the link you provide further on.

Anyone want to create a separate faq on where non-ascii characters can be used
in a stylesheet?
Maybe we should add one sentence in this faq saying where non-ascii might be
used? Otherwise people might wonder why bother with an encoding declaration?

This way it is not left to chance on how the style sheet's encoding will be interpreted.

After "@charset", authors specify the name of a character encoding. The name must be a charset name as described in the IANA registry (See [IANA]. Also, see [CHARSETS] for a complete list of charsets)."
