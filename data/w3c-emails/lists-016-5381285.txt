I have put up an HTML version of Russ's FAQ on CSS charset declarations
(exact wording of his mailnote):
http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-css-charset.html

I have also put up a FAQ on ruby that I wrote this morning:
http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-ruby.html

(Martin, in the end I started from scratch rather than copying from the
hints & tips page.)

Please review both.

Cheers,
RI
