Agreed to above suggestions.  So it should now read as:


To set the character encoding you may use the "at-rule" @charset.  Its syntax is:

@CHARSET "<IANA DEFINED CHARSET NAME>";

@charset rules are not needed and must not be used for style declarations embedded in a document. They are for use in linked style sheets.

Only one @charset rule may appear in an external style sheet and it must appear at the very start of the document and must not preceded by any characters, not even comments. The name must be a charset name as described in the [IANA registry]<http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/refs.html#ref-IANA> (See [CHARSETS]<http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/refs.html#ref-CHARSETS> for a complete list of charsets).

Thus an example of labeling your CSS file as UTF-8 encoded would be:

      @charset "UTF-8";

Agreed:

How about a "by the way" section that read as:

Even though the CSS specification says that it is possible to specify the encoding of a CSS file by the server sending the information in the HTTP header (See CSS 2.1 Specification, section 4.4 CSS document representation<http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#x60>), you should also explicitly declare the character encoding for a separate external style sheet file (in the same way as you should for an HTML file). This way it is not left to chance as to how the style sheet's encoding will be interpreted.
