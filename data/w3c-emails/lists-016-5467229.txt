Hi,

I tested MS IE 6.02800 with a page of meta charset= 

1) windows-1252 and 
2) utf-8
3) user-override

and a form with accept-charset=utf-8.
I tried both GET and POST of the form.

I found that:

A) Under no circumstances does IE send the accept-charset or a content-type
with charset=.

B) That IE converts text data as a string of bytes, and values above 127 are
sent with
%hh encoding.

If the page had charset of 1252, it sent text as 1252 bytes.
If the page had charset of utf-8, IE sent text as utf-8 bytes.
If the page was overriden with a new charset, it used the new charset!
(so much for send back what you receive.)

The accept-charset in the form did nothing.
GET and POST behaved the same way with respect to text encoding.

So, at least for IE, it always sends back the text of the form
in the current encoding being viewed by the user (whether it was set by http,
meta, or user override).

I don't intend to test other browsers.

I think the recommendation is to not use accept-charset in forms, as it just
adds confusion.

I think it becomes important to embed a value that can be used to check if the
user changed the expected encoding.

comments?
