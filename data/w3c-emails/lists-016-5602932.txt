Hello Jungshik,

Many thanks for these comments. Here is my summary of the discussions we had

Thanks for bringing this point up.  We will add some information to the
guidelines at the appropriate point.

We felt that YYYY-MM-DD format has a fairly technical bias, and is not
always the preferred form for a particular locale, although it could be
useful in some circumstances.  We also note that pages are in a given
language most of the time, and one might generally expect month names to be
recognised in most situations, though that might not hold for certain
special types of reference page aimed at a reader who doesn't need to
understand the language text. So we think the guidelines should say
something like: consider YYYY-MM-DD, especially when dealing with an
international audience, or use the month name if a local format is more
appropriate.  (Of course, this doesn't apply in quite the same way for CJK,
since the month name is a number plus character. That should be explained.) 

Thanks again for taking the time to comment.
