As one of the originators and/or pushers for having a named month,
I have to apologize to Jungshik and others for not having thought about
the CJK case. I think the solution proposed by Richard ('month name', with
an explanation for the CJK case) is a step in the right direction.
But maybe we should word this more neutrally, e.g.

    Indicate the month in a way that clearly identifies it as a month.
      - In languages where month names are customarily used, use month names.
      - In other languages (e.g. Chinese/Japanese/Korean), use the month
        number with the character for 'month'.

Does this cover all languages, as far as we know, or are there
languages that don't fit in this pattern?
Please note that I wrote "month names are customarily used" rather
than "month names exist", because e.g. Japanese has traditional
words for months, but they are no longer in daily use.


Regards,    Martin.
