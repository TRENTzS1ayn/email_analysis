With respect to date format and month names:
http://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-html-tech/#ri20030510.103018444

We should not publish strategies which aren't either established i18n practices
or derived from standards, at least not without a clear warning. Are there any
references for the month name approach?

I agree with Jungshik and prefer the ISO 8601 approach with all numbers and
haven't run into a situation where it was considered ambiguous with a 4 digit
year. If there is ambiguity, provide an indicator (such as "yyyy-mm-dd") or a
footnote on the page.

Using month names increases the localization effort and therefore runs against
internationalization.

ISO 8601 is also recommended in the W3C date time note
http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime
and many other places, and is not mentioned in the guidelines (yet).

I would prefer we endorsed 8601 as the first choice, and offered textual
alternatives as a last resort (or not at all).

My 2 yen.
