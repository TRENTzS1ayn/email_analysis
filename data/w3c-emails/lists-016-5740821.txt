1) We decided at the last meeting not to have a telecon this week, since
Richard was out.

2) We should update this FAQ now that XML 1.1 is a rec and not a candidate rec.

3) The question that Martin was asked, is a little broader than control codes.
It might be good to have an additional FAQ that addresses the gamut of
disallowed chars. (non-NFC, PUA, chars not recommended for names (XML 1.1
Appendix I), unassigned chars, chars not in Unicode, etc)... Or maybe they
should be several FAQs.
