Dear Richard,

I've tried to translate http://www.w3.org/International/Overview.html, 
and started with an automatic translation as a draft (by www.ajeeb.com)  
to finalize it then. I discovered that months were not correctly 
translated. Indeed, they are writen

Apr for April
Mar for Mar
...

Some time also, we find it writen "mar", "apr" all lowercase and without 
a dot mark at the end.

I think that it must be stated somewhere that in date format, it is a 
good thing  to avoid month abreviations and to write  explicitely 
(January, February ...). At least for automatic translator, which now 
are used very often on the Web.

By the way, in 
http://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-html-tech/#ri20030510.103018444, it is said:

"The date
02/03/04
may be March 4th, 2002 (in Japan,...), 2nd of March, 2004 (in Europe) 
and February 3rd, 2004 (in the USA). It would be better to write this as 
something like
02 mar 2004"

I suggest to say: "... It would be better to write this as something 
like 02 mar 2004 or, preferably, 02 March 2004"
or something like that.

Regards,

Najib
