Folks,

A first heads-up that I'd like to publish the three techniques drafts we have before the next AC meeting, ie. before the moratorium on 11 may.

Let me know if you have any concerns.  I also need to formally ask the group whether they agree to that.  If you can't make it for Wednesday's call, please send mail.

Note that we are not talking about publishing a finished document (of course).  Just an interim version, so people can see what we're doing.
