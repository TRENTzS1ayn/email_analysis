Hiya Shawn,

For what it's worth, I spruced up our site some on Friday (after having felt embarrassed while presenting to the UK Usability Professionals organisation in London the previous night).  

I (hopefully) improved the usability of the topic index [http://www.w3.org/International/resource-index.html] and improved and standardised the linking at the top of pages such as http://www.w3.org/International/questions.html

Some cleaning up to the front page http://www.w3.org/International/ and changes to what's now called the "Additional resources" page (a kind of overflow)  http://www.w3.org/International/resources.html

Cheers,
RI
