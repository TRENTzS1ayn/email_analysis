I have mentioned this at
http://www.w3.org/International/Activity#role:
The W3C Web site is slowly transitioning to use UTF-8 in place of the 
traditional ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1). In particular, new documents under
/2004 and /TR/2004 are published as UTF-8, and many forms are converted
to use UTF-8 for better internationalization.

I think that with 4 months already gone since we made this change,
there is not that much newsworthy anymore. I propose that this
action item be closed.


Regards,    Martin.
