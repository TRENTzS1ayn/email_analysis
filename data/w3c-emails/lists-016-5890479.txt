Chaps,

This is a draft proposed response to Liam's comments on the first WD of
Authoring Techniques. Please check before I send. If I hear nothing in a few
days, I'll just send to Liam.

Hello Liam,

Thankyou for your comments on the first WD of  Authoring Techniques for
XHTML & HTML Internationalization.  Please find responses below.

Note also that we intend to release new working drafts before the AC
meeting.  We have, in the meantime, split the original document up into 3
topic-focussed documents.  We aim to produce more such documents as we
develop the material.  The in-edit versions of the new documents are:
Characters and Encodings 1.0 

http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/tech-character.html
Specifying the language of content 1.0 
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/tech-lang.html
Handling Bidirectional Text 1.0 
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/tech-bidi.html

There is also a new outline overview document at
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/outline/html-authoring-outline
.html

The latest versions of these documents (see above) and their accompanying
outline work differently, so this is not an issue.  Currently there is only
an icon to take you back to the toc in the outline, and I have ensured that
the title and alt information is available for that.

That is indeed what we were trying to say.  The new version no longer
contains this sentence.

True.  But we see this as a fringe case these days, and we hope that people
will choose other encodings than ebcdic in the future.  Those using ebcdic
should certainly use the HTTP header to declare the encoding, even though IE
(I'm not sure how many others) can detect and handle ebcdic currently.  We
will add a note to this effect.

That has already been addressed in the latest version of the outline.  We
will also change in the three WDs before publication.

See above.

I'm not sure we can argue for better internationalization by recommending
the use of ASCII.  Note that we are talking specifically about HTML/XHTML
pages here.  Do you have some specific examples you could share with us?

Well probably not necessary in this particular document, since it is largely
concerned with the HTML vocabulary and we don't expect the majority of our
audience to be creating new tags.  Worth mentioning elsewhere though.

We disagree and wonder whether you are thinking about the RLE and LRE (with
PDF) characters.  We agree that the latter shouldn't be used for the reason
you mention. Perhaps we should make the distinction clearer and point to
http://www.w3.org/TR/unicode-xml/#Bidi .  In fact, we could even add a
technique saying 'don't use RLE/RLO/etc'.

For information about RTL and LTR see
http://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/#where (you
might want to read the whole article).

The first two examples are of code, so are in a code element.  The third
shows what appears on the UI, so it is just normal text.  It's not clear to
me why there would be 3 different appearances.  Do you still see it in
section 8 of http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/tech-bidi.html ?

The new approach removes this issue.  We don't repeat the detail text any
more, though we may point to it from various places in the overview
document.

Many thanks for taking the time to review it!
Best regards,
