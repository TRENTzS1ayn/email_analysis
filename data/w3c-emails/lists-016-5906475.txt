Chaps,

This is a draft proposed response to Fran??ois' comments on the first WD of Authoring Techniques. Please check before I send. If I hear nothing in a few days, I'll just send to Liam.

Hello Fran??ois,

Thankyou for your comments on the first WD of  Authoring Techniques for XHTML & HTML Internationalization.  Please find responses below.

Note also that we intend to release new working drafts before the AC meeting.  We have, in the meantime, split the original document up into 3 topic-focussed documents.  We aim to produce more such documents as we develop the material.  The in-edit versions of the new documents are:
Characters and Encodings 1.0 
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/tech-character.html
Specifying the language of content 1.0 
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/tech-lang.html
Handling Bidirectional Text 1.0 
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/tech-bidi.html

There is also a new outline overview document at http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/outline/html-authoring-outline.html

Yes, we discussed this.  The consensus was to leave as is, but provide pros and cons in the explanation which made these points.  See http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/tech-character.html#IDARUJO
