Chaps,

This is a draft proposed response to Bert's comments on the first WD of
Authoring Techniques. Please check before I send. If I hear nothing in a few
days, I'll just send to Bert.

Hello Bert,

Thankyou for your comments on the first WD of  Authoring Techniques for
XHTML & HTML Internationalization.  Please find responses below.

Note also that we intend to release new working drafts before the AC
meeting.  We have, in the meantime, split the original document up into 3
topic-focussed documents.  We aim to produce more such documents as we
develop the material.  The in-edit versions of the new documents are:
Characters and Encodings 1.0 

http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/tech-character.html
Specifying the language of content 1.0 
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/tech-lang.html
Handling Bidirectional Text 1.0 
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/tech-bidi.html

There is also a new outline overview document at
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/outline/html-authoring-outline
.html

Thanks !

Thanks again ! :-)

Noted.  We'll try to remember to fix that in the next version.

We have substantially changed this text.  Please see
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/tech-character.html#ri20040310
.054442951 for the latest, where we try to get people to make an intelligent
choice based on the pros and cons.  We do see a need to currently include
the declaration in the document for cases where the document is to be saved
or read without the involvement of a server.  (Note that this document is
highly focussed on giving practical advice for people currently implementing
X/HTML.)

Noted.  We will mention that.

Thanks for these pointers.  We have removed the recommendation to avoid left
and right in CSS (though not in HTML), and will consider these topics in
detail.

Hex escapes work fine in recent browsers in X/HTML, though they were a
problem in Netscape 4.  We will add a comment to this effect.

We wanted people to find all the information relevant to a particular task
in one place, without searching around, so duplicated the information.  The
new approach, with the separate documents containing detail, removes this
repetition at the detailed level.  Any repetition will be only in the
outline document, which now points to the relevant techniques on a technique
by technique basis.


Thanks for your comments !
