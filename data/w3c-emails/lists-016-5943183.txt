FYI 

This morning I began adding some actual text to the techniques doc  Authoring Techniques for XHTML & HTML Internationalization: Specifying the language of content 1.0 prior to publishing as a 1st WD.

http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/tech-lang.html

This was based largely on the material in the language tutorial. I will add a little more when I can. Suggestions welcome, though time is short before publication and this is only a regular update publication, so I'm not expecting perfection by then.

Cheers,
RI
