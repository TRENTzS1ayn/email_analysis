Folks (and especially Leslie and Phil),

In the fall of 2003, the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and the American Institutes for Research (AIR) conducted a series of usability tests of the WAI Web site: http://www.w3c.org/wai/.  

The AIR report is available [1] and the "Key Findings." [2] make for very interesting reading.

WAI's E&O group is currently looking at ways of improving the WAI site, and may make recommendations for other sites at the W3C. I am watching their progress.

On a quick scan of the findings, I thought that the i18n and GEO pages and material, though far from perfect, were not too bad. Which was encouraging.  We can probably still learn from this, though.
