Folks,

I have put up a very rough first draft of a new tutorial (still drawn from the Beijing slides [1]) entitled Language markup in XHTML and CSS

http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-lang.html

Comments welcome, but bear in mind that this is a first stab, so conceptual comments will be more useful that editorial in the main - I still need to look at the stuff from an editorial point of view.

This, of course, will eventually yield the information we need, when repurposed, for the Techniques doc, so bear that in mind too.
