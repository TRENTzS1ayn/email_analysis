Question: Do display capabilities of computers in other countries vary? 
  Do I need to worry about screen sizes, number of colors, etc.?

  Background: In the past (until the 90's) customers outside the United 
States and Europe often had less capable computer systems than those in 
the U.S.  It was common for other countries to lag two to three years 
behind in getting the latest in personal computer technology.  This gap 
has more or less disappeared in recent years.

Similarly, in older text mod operating systems it was common for the 
number of lines of text on the screen to vary.  For instance while most 
U.S. and European systems allowed 25 lines of text on the screen, some 
Japanese systems had fewer, because the display height of Japanese 
characters is greater (to allow better diffferentiation given the size 
of the character set and the complexity of the characters) and some 
systems reserved one or two lines for a "Front End Processor" (the 
equivalent of today's Input Method Editor.  Variations also existed 
between various vendors' hardware in Japan until a standard system 
emerged.

Answer:  Today there is no need to make special allowances for hardware 
limitations in other countries - BUT many similar considerations SHOULD 
be kept in mind for the following reasons:
i) Accessibility.  For instance, the fact that virtually every monitor 
sold today can support millions of colors doesn't make it possible for 
color blind users to distinguish all colors.  For more guidance in this 
area, check out the W3C Web Accessibiity Inititive.
ii) Display capabilities vary a lot these days because different people
    have computers with different-sized screens, but also because there
    are a lot of other devices (PDAs, cellphones,...). Although not all
    Web pages may need to work on cellphones, try to design with as few
    limitations as possible.

So, even though hardware variations across locales are not much of an 
issue now, the same sort of measures are still needed, though for 
different reasons.
