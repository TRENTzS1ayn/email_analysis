I think we probably should have a meeting.
I'm interested in observing XSLT, CSS, WAI.

Importance: High


Folks,

There is a room available on the Monday of the Tech Plenary that we
could use for a face-to-face discussion (though it could not be an
official meeting, since we haven't given 8 weeks notice).

We need to decide if we want the room by Wednesday evening.

Please send email saying whether you would like to take up this offer,
and we'll take a decision at the meeting on Wednesday.

Please also send mail to say what other groups you would like to
observe.

Thanks.
RI


PS: I hope you have all registered by now. (Note that the detail on the
registration forms can be updated as plans change.)
