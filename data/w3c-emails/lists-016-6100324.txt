If you have to type text using Arabic, Thai or IPA characters, and you're not familiar with those scripts, you may find the following useful. It is not an I18N WG output - just some personal stuff.

    Pickers allow you to quickly create phrases in a script by clicking on Unicode characters that are arranged in a way that aids their identification. The phrase appears at the bottom of the screen and you can easily cut and paste the result into your own document. They're written in XHTML with a small amount of JavaScript.

    Pickers are likely to be most useful if you don't know a script well enough to use the native keyboard. The arrangement of characters also makes it much more useable than a regular character map utility, and they may include characters from more than one block. Available pickers include (in French and English):

        * Arabic  UPDATED Feb '04! 
        * IPA  UPDATED Feb '04! 
        * Thai  NEW Feb '04! 

Thanks to Patrick Andries for the French translations.  I'll be developing more soon - Devanagari and Tamil in the pipeline.
