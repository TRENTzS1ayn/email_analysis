Suggestions to improve this FAQ, especially its bittiness, most welcome.
The main part of the FAQ was intended to be 'why'.

Thanks

Question

What are 'lang' attributes and why do I need them?


Answer

The 'lang' attribute contains information about the language(s) used in
the HTML page.

According to HTML 4.01 Specification W3C Recommendation 24 December 1999
(http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#h-8.1.3), this
information is used for:

- Assisting search engines 
- Assisting speech synthesizers and Braille translators
- Helping a user agent select glyph variants for high quality typography

- Helping a user agent choose a set of quotation marks 
- Helping a user agent make decisions about hyphenation, ligatures, and
spacing 
- Assisting spell checkers and grammar checkers 

Also:
- The lang tag is required by the Web Accessibility Initiative and some
governmental policies in some countries.
- The 'xml:lang' attribute is the standard way to identify language
information in XML.

The 'html' element should contain a lang attribute with the predominant
language of the page. 
For example, <html lang="pt">. The value of the lang attribute is
usually a two-letter country code. (FAQ: Two-letter or three-letter
language codes)

Where the language changes, that change should be clearly identified.
For example, <p lang="en">He viewed Deidre's predicament with a certain
amount of <span lang="de">Schadenfreude</span>.</p>

HTML and XML have different syntax. When serving XHTML as text/html, you
should use both the lang attribute and the xml:lang attribute in the
html element.
(http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-lang.html)

eg: HTML: <html lang="fr-CA">
       XHTML 1.0 served as text/html: <html lang="zh-CN"
xml:lang="zh-CN" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
       
For more information on language tagging mark-up, see
(http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTML-tags.html).

CSS2 uses the 'lang' attribute powerfully as a pseudo class.
(http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-css-lang.html).

Which tags? The attribute can be applied to any element except applet,
base, basefont, br, frame, frameset, iframe, param, or script.

A common use for meta is to specify keywords that a search engine may
use to improve the quality of search results. When several meta elements
provide language-dependent information about a document, search engines
may filter on the xml:lang attribute to display search results using the
language preferences of the user.
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-xhtml2-20020805/mod-meta.html)

For example, 

<-- For speakers of US English -->
<meta name="keywords" lang="en-us" 
         content="vacation, Greece, sunshine"/>
<-- For speakers of British English -->
<meta name="keywords" lang="en" 
         content="holiday, Greece, sunshine"/>
<-- For speakers of French -->
<meta name="keywords" lang="fr" 
         content="vacances, Gr&egrave;ce, soleil"/>
         
The lang attribute should be specified for alt-attributes and
longdesc-attributes.
