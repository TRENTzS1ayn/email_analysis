I would use an example that includes a definitely foreign word.  Borrowed
terms are rather controversial - when are they part of the language and when
not?  (WAI is struggling with this at the moment.)  A useful example is "The
French word for 'cat' is 'chat'." because the french bit is ambiguous (could
sound like English).

Maybe have some subheadings.  Eg.
What is it?
Why is it needed?
How do you use it? (which is what now follows)

Be careful with the Chinese example here.  Maybe better use another, since
zh-Hans now would be more appropriate.  (I know I used that in my tutorial,
but I correct it later - maybe I should change it too.)

Well, 'can use it' - unfortunately it doesn't work in IE yet.  But the
concept of language specific styling is a very powerful one, which could
maybe be brought out by some examples.

Ie. You can use it for img and object tags etc.! ;)

Perhaps what we've started into here is another subsection that could be
called something like "Examples of uses for the lang tag"
