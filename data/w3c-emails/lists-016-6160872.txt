I just released a new version of the tutorial, baking in, I hope, the gist of our discussion on Wednesday. I rearranged and rewrote things a considerable amount, and I'm hoping we have things pretty well as they should be now for the sections:

http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc.html#serving , and

http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc.html#declaring

So please give these another read, and we'll field any, hopefully, final comments on Wednesday.

Cheers,
RI
