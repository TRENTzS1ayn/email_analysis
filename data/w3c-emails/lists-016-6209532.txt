Subject: [TP2004] Royal Hotel Casino fare is reduced




Dear Chairs, dear all

I am pleased to let you know that I was successful today in renegotiating 
the prices of the hotel of the TP2004 (a few people brought to my 
attention that the current rates seemed high).

The initial discount rates are now again available and will apply until 
February 20 2004.
   Single room: EUR 161
   Double room: EUR 190

(instead of EUR 192 and EUR 221)

The meeting overview page [1] was updated.

I just contacted all the registrants (45 people) who answered "no" to the 
hotel question, to let them know that we would like to encourage any 
attendees who would like to switch to the meeting hotel to do so now, by 
means of the hotel form [2] that can be faxed or e-mailed.

Registration [3] is open until February 20 2004 ; I would be grateful if 
you could contact your groups and let them know of the discount rates 
availibility.

Let them know to not hesitate to contact w3t-tpregister@w3.org should they 
require further help.

Best regards,

Coralie
