After a long day's slog yesterday, I have uploaded a new editorial version of  Authoring Techniques for XHTML & HTML Internationalization and the accompanying outline doc.

http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/html-tech/outline/html-authoring-outline.html

I have rewritten 3.2 Specifying a page encoding, taking material and ideas from the tutorial we have been discussing recently.

I have also made a change behind the scenes that won't be immediately apparent when following the links above, but took a lot of work and will probably require a change to the Framework document. 

I originally set up the content in a repository as a loose bag of techniques; a view document then included the relevant techniques in the appropriate place.  I have found no practical benefit from this approach so far, but rather found that it just makes it harder to edit the techniques document, so I have now bypassed the repository, including all the content directly in the page linked to above by the first link.  We still create another view (eg the second link above) and can still copy technique units to other locations and documents.

I'd also like to propose that we remove headings from the document unless there is associated content.  I suggest that we keep the full list of potential headings in a separate document.

Some of these changes are made in the realisation that we will soon be rechartering, and it would be good to move the techniques document along, and publish another version quite soon.
