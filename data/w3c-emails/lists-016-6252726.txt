Folks, 

I'd like to make this tutorial available to the public, and I'd like to use the information in the section Entities and Numeric Character References (NCRs) to create a new section in the techniques doc about character escaping.

Please have a look at the document.  

*** We have discussed the following sections at length and I am not looking to rehash that discussion or do unimportant editing***:
Serving HTML &amp; XHTML
http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc.html#serving
Declaring the document encoding
http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc.html#declaring



However, please do look at the remaining parts of the document, and in particular (and if nothing else) the section:
Entities and Numeric Character References (NCRs)
http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc.html#entities


Cheers,
RI
