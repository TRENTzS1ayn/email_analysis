Fran??ois Yergeau has contributed a (very nice) FAQ.  Due to travel he will not be available next week, so I have invited him to the telecon this week so we can discuss the FAQ.  (Deborah could probably do with a little extra time for hers, and Martin has been very busy with reviews this week, so I think it fits nicely.)

Please read and comment by email.

Cheers,

PS: Note that Francois is planning to provide a French translation too, so that we can demonstrate language negotiation. Nice! (it's not there yet).
