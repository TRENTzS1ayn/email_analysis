Chaps,

We needed some styling to support articles such as my bidi one, and while I was at it I applied the design to an FAQ.  I still need to go through the CSS with a fine toothcomb, but take a look at 

http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-when-lang-neg.en.html

I suggest we use this as the template for future faqs and articles, and when time allows retrofit it to older ones.  I am also working on the long needed style guide that documents how to create these things.
