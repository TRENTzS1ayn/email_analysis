Yes, I am still around (just a few minutes before the conference starts tomorrow).

Any way I like the small casing.  I allows me look at these items as secondary as opposed to the question in bolded black just below as the primary focus getter.

Style is a good thing, but all lower case doesn't strike me as a good style. It reduces readability...

I may have other comments later, but the big item for me is the color of the text. I find the soft gray on white a strain to read and would prefer higher contrast. If not black, at least crank it up a couple notches.
(Or soften the white background...)

So as not to be entirely negative, I like the deep blue of the logo!
