About all lower case: I don't think it looks good to have some headings
in lower case, and others not. Also, it may confuse readers who's native
language is not English.

I like the colors better than the current ones, less dirty.
But we shouldn't have more and more color schemes at W3C.

The stuff at the top (right) is too dark. And I don't think
we should give up the globe standing for I18N just like that.

Also, the light blue background on the currently lowercased
titles forces these titles to be further right than the rest
of the text, which is confusing.

Regards,   Martin.
