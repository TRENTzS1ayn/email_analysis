Hello Bjoern,

Many thanks for this idea. I have copied Olivier, because he
knows more about the validator than I do. I think that such a
service might definitely help people, but it might also
confuse some people if not designed carefully. Would you be
able and willing to help with programming?

This one sounds scary. But I assume you haven't just made it up.
Can you tell us more, e.g. with examples? We are still thinking
about what exactly to do with the BOM in various cases, and so
input in this area is quite appreciated.

Regards,   Martin.
