Sure, just have a look at

? http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xhtml-modularization-20040218/schema_module_defs.html#a_module_XHTML_Common_Attribute_Definitions

The source of the document contains

[...]
  <pre class="dtd">
  &#239;&#187;&#191;&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
  &lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
             targetNamespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
             xmlns:xml="http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace"
             xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
[...]

&#239;&#187;&#191; is a UTF-8 encoded BOM when interpreted as ISO-8859-1
and then escaped. A slightly different case is reported as bug in the
CSS Validator,

? http://www.w3.org/mid/5.2.0.9.0.20040220172527.00b23f28@mail.btinternet.com

A simplified (and stable) test case is at

? http://www.websitedev.de/markup/validator/tests/double-utf-8-bom.html

The document starts with the octet sequence EF BB BF EF BB BF which are
two UTF-8 encoded U+FEFFs. This is likely the result of file inclusion.
For example, there might be a header.inc like

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
   "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
  <html lang="EN" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <head>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"
        content="text/html;charset=UTF-8" />
  
and a document.php like

  <?php include "header.inc" ;?>
  <title>...</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <p>...</p>
  </body>
  </html>

If now both header.inc and document.php start with a BOM you are in
trouble, the include() function operates at the binary level, it makes
no attempt to determine the encoding of the document or any effort of
transcoding, it just copies the octets 1:1 into the ouput, hence the EF
BB BF EF BB BF sequence.

This ended up as bug report for the CSS Validator because the MarkUp
Validator

? http://www.websitedev.de/markup/validator/tests/double-utf-8-bom.html,validate

seems to happily ignore it and considers my test document Valid XHTML
1.0 Strict... I am not sure how common this might be, but there were at
least two similar bug reports for the CSS Validator last year...
