Chaps,

The tech plen registration has now closed. I looked at the results and found the following registration information.

GEO meeting attendees are currently only:
Deborah, Martin, Addison, and Richard

If Lloyd and Tex you want to attend GEO meeting, please contact me ASAP, since room assignments are being finalised based on group size, plus we need to know who will be there to plan the agenda so we can publish in advance.

If anyone is definitely planning to observe another meeting on Monday, please let me know also.

We will have no telephone line available.

We have observer requests for the GEO meeting from Ann Bassetti (Boeing), Ivan Herman (W3C Head of Offices)(probably won't show due to a clash), Nicolas Duboc (ILOG).

Thanks,
RI
