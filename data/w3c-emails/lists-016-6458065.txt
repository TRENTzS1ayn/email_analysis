Could we consider I18N glossary/terminology part to GEO? It's harder to ask questions/discuss problems without the right terminology.

Here is a rough agenda.  We will plan timings on the day, but the order is probably right.  Please send in additonal items you'd like to cover/address.


[1] Directions

Please provide other questions/topics for discussion by email:
Have we made good progress? Review current deliverables status.
How can we make better progress, especially on Techniques?
Establish targets for Techniques before end of charter.
Recharter is close - what deliverables should we sign up for?
Other topics related to rechartering.
If GEO becomes a separate working group, how to work with rest of i18n? What are the issues? How to address them?
What should we do about outreach activities? We had some suggestions in a recent telecon http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-geo/2003Nov/0003.html : should we make plans to do these?  Are there more things to do?
Richard was looking at sites like http://www.boxesandarrows.com/ recently.  This is very clearly a an attractive place to visit regularly for information.  Note also that they accept articles from others (http://www.boxesandarrows.com/about/writeforus.php).  Should we be trying to emulate this, and raise the visibility and appeal of the site more?  Should this be in conjunction with others at W3C - eg QA?



[2] (Brief) review of Framework topics

Recent changes made to layering by RI.
Should we add information about FAQs, etc. to the Framework doc?
Approve (small) changes to the framework doc to be introduced by RI, with a view to possible republication.
Should we remove titles from Authoring Techniques where there is no content?



[3] Tutorial review

Review tutorial material with an eye to:
1.      publish the tutorials
2.      incorporate information in tutorials into the Authoring techniques
