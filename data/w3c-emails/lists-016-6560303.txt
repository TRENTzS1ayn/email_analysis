> Background: In the past (until the 90's) customers outside the United 
> States often had less
> capable computer systems than those in the U.S.  It was common for 
> other countries to lag
> two to three years behind in getting the latest in personal computer 
> technology.  This gap
> has disappeared in recent years.

> Similarly, in older text mod operating systems it was common for the 
> number of lines of text
> on the screen varied.  For instance while most U.S. systems allowed 25 
> lines of available
> text on the screen, some Japanese systems had fewer, because the 
> height of Japanese characters

> Question: To what extent does my commerce web site need to handle 
> foreign currencies?
>
> Answer: Though there are always exceptions most sites don't require 
> any special effort to deal
> with foreign currencies.  Dealing with multiple currencies raises a 
> number of interesting
> problems that may not be worth solving.
>
> Formatting numbers to match the currency formats used in various 
> locales is fairly easy, but
> flucuation in exchange rates causes problems that are not easily 
> solved.  As an extreme example
> imagine an auction site that allows each user to view prices in their 
> own currency.  A user in
> the U.S. lists an item for sale on Monday and asks that the bidding 
> start at $10.00.  Later that
> day a user in the U.K. views the item and is informed that the bidding 
> starts at 5 pounds 62 pence.
> (using that morning's exchange rate of 1.78).  Thinking its a 
> reasonable price, she bids 6 pounds.
> Later that day an user in German see the current high bid is 9.16 
> Euros and raises the bid to
> 10 Euros.  The next day the first user returns and decides the price 
> is too high, so she finds
> another similar item to purchase instead.  Wednesday the Pound surges 
> against the Euro and as the
> auction comes to a close th first bidder gets an email informing her 
> that her bid of 6 pounds
> has won and she should send her payment!
>
> Most web sites are owned by a company and that company generally does 
> business in a single currency.
> Its generally safer to stick to that currency for all transactions.  
> EBay does allow auctions in
> other currencies - but the all bids and prices for that item are in a 
> SINGLE currency.
>
> If you decide to deal with multiple currencies you still need to 
> decide how often to update your exchange rates
> and who to rely on to supply them.  If you've ever walked down the 
> streets of a forign city
> and seen the variation in exchange rates from one vendor to the next 
> you'll realize there is no
> single source for these rates.
>
> So we recommend that you just deal with a single currency.  If you 
> want to display the value in
> the user's currency, then at least display both currecies and make it 
> clear that the price is based
> on the primary currency and that the value in their currency is
