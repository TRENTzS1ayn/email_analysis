THE UNICODE CONSORTIUM

The Unicode Consortium was founded as a non-profit organization in 1991.
It is dedicated to the development, maintenance and promotion of The
Unicode Standard, a worldwide character encoding. The Unicode Standard
encodes the characters of the world's principal scripts and languages,
and is code-for-code identical to the international standard ISO/IEC
10646. In addition to cooperating with ISO on the future development of
ISO/IEC 10646, the Consortium is responsible for providing character
properties and algorithms for use in implementations. Today the
membership base of the Unicode Consortium includes major computer
corporations, software producers, database vendors, research
institutions, international agencies and various user groups.

For further information on the Unicode Standard, visit the Unicode Web
site at http://www.unicode.org
