Hello Lloyd,

Thanks for forwarding these to the list. Great material!

The two main points I would add:
- display capabilities vary a lot these days because different people
   have computers with different-sized screens, but also because there
   are a lot of other devices (PDAs, cellphones,...). Although not all
   Web pages may need to work on cellphones, try to design with as few
   limitations as possible.
- There may not be that much of a difference between e.g. the US, Europe,
   and Japan, but e.g. in India or Africa, the situation may still be
   a bit different.

This is a very good example. Probably best to add a table, with columns
for each day, and lines for the bids, the conversion rates, and the conversion
results. This will make it easier to understand. Also, make the units on
the conversion rates explicit, e.g. "(using that morning's exchange rate
of 1.78 US$/British Pound)".

Much too general. Many web sites are owned privately. Many companies
do business in several countries. I think I know what you want to say,
but there are several ways your text can be misunderstood.


>>Its generally safer to stick to that currency for all transactions.
>>EBay does allow auctions in

"the all bids and prices for that item" ->
"all the bids and prices for a single item"

and back the up!


Regrads,    Martin.
