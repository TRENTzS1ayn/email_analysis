Changed.

Changed.  It's a little long now, but avoids assumptions about understanding
'language negotiation' and adds reference to multiviews.  

Had I made the call, the odd one-sidedness was one of the key things I
wanted to discuss - I think it works much better now.

Various changes made to the text to accommodate the focus on multiviews
only.

It isn't.  It says 'in some cases'.

Done, in the background.

Done.

Split using ;

Removed.

See below.

Referred to later.  Want to keep this simple.

See below.

Done.  The references hadn't been developped yet.

I hadn't worked out all the links yet.  I added some.

It is optional.  See below.

It's just an example.  But typically English is a good choice for a lingua
franca.

Done.  Both are needed.

I'm trying not to make this the length of a chapter in a book.  I added text
to say follow the links for the detail.

Done.

Done.

Changed.

He didn't need to.  I have one, but hadn't yet used it.  Btw, there was ONLY
those two errors, and the spell-checker doesn't pick up on the second! ;)

It needed replacing anyway.

No.

Subdirectories are affected.

Thankyou.
