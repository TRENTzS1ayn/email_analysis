Hi Martin, Tex,

Thanks for your input and sorry for being so late in answering. I will try
in this email to take into consideration your suggestions as well as Tex
ones. 
So, I would like to reduce the scope of the FAQ and rephrase it as: 
"Is it a good idea to put translatable text in Cascading Style sheet (CSS)?"

So that the scope is minimum at the beginning, other l10n topics (font,
color,  ...) are excluded and only CSS techniques to handle text are looked
into... 

If the FAQ answer can apply to more topics and is not specific to
translatable text, then we could extend it to more l10n topics. To address
Tex's point, although this suggestion is about going the other way round,
starting from very specific (text), going to larger scope if possible.
