Hi,

Here is a draft of the FAQ. 
Rephrasing is going to be a necessity; Thanks for helping!



Question: 
"Is it a good idea to put translatable text in Cascading Style sheet (CSS)?"


Background:
CSS was designed to maintain the rendering information of a document and to
separate it from the document content.

Answer:
Under the condition that the translatable text has the following
characteristics: 
- Linguistic independence: It is a full phrase, independent from the
main document content. In particular no concatenation or embedding is used.
- Meaningfulness
- Repetitiveness

then storing translatable text in a CSS:
- Improves consistency.
- Enables reuse.
- makes maintenance efficient.


For translatable text in CSS , the Translation and Localisation process
needs to:
- Make sure the T&L tools used do support CSS
- Translate/localise first the CSS (looking for 'content' property
used in ':before' and ':after' pseudo-elements)
