Attendees: Martin, Lloyd, Andrew, Richard, Deborah

Meetings:
Technical Plenary in Cannes in first week of March 2004: Seems as if there will be a fair number of attendees from GEO.  We should decide whether we want to meet as a group, and also what other groups discussions we want to attend.

FAQ REVIEW
Editorial proposals were made on Lloyd's FAQs [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-geo/2004Jan/0002.html].  ACTION: Lloyd to write new version. 

Comments included (not exhaustive): 
-device independence I should be borne in mind
-non-Latin scripts impact line height, resolution requirements, and inter-line spacing
-maybe add 'exchange rates for foreign currencies' to question text
-need to clarify that this concerns products sold in a single location/currency - ie. Not amazon.co.uk, etc.
