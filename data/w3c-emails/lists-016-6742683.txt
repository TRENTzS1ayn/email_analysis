Folks,

http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc.html is the write up of the first part of my tutorial at Beijing in November last.  The slides, if you are interested, can be found at http://www.w3.org/2003/Talks/1013-ishida/tutorial.pdf

As we begin addressing people's comments on the first WD of the techniques doc we will bump into comments about declaration of character encodings that arise out of the fact that the techniques doc is slightly behind current thinking on that topic.

This tutorial reflects, as I see it, the latest thinking of the group on that topic, so I've tried to complete a first pass on it sooner rather than later.  I'll then try to update the techniques doc.

I'd ask you to read through it both to provide helpful comments, but also to prepare for discussions related to the techniques doc.  This is still very much a first draft, and the final section (treating Unicode and markup and normalization) is still missing completely.

Cheers,
RI
