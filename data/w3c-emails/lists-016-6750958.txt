Although I read the reasons for having text in the CSS file, I am having a hard time coming up with an example that fits the reasons.  It might be good to give an example of when to use text in the CSS file.

Hi,

Here is a draft of the FAQ. 
Rephrasing is going to be a necessity; Thanks for helping!



Question: 
"Is it a good idea to put translatable text in Cascading Style sheet (CSS)?"


Background:
CSS was designed to maintain the rendering information of a document and to separate it from the document content.

Answer:
Under the condition that the translatable text has the following
characteristics: 
- Linguistic independence: It is a full phrase, independent from the main document content. In particular no concatenation or embedding is used.
- Meaningfulness
- Repetitiveness

then storing translatable text in a CSS:
- Improves consistency.
- Enables reuse.
- makes maintenance efficient.


For translatable text in CSS , the Translation and Localisation process needs to:
- Make sure the T&L tools used do support CSS
- Translate/localise first the CSS (looking for 'content' property used in ':before' and ':after' pseudo-elements)
