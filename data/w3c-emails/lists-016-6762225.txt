Folks,

If you have not already done so, please register as soon as possible if you are planning to attend the Technical Plenary in Mandelieu, France at the beginning of March [http://www.w3.org/2003/08/allgroupoverview.html].

The form is at http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/35125/tp2004/

Please let me know when you register.

Note also that you will need to book hotels asap.

Cheers,
RI
