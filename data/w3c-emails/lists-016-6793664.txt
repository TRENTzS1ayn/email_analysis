Regrets: Lloyd, Deborah

INFO SHARE:
The W3C website has switched to utf-8 for default encoding in /2004 and /TR/2004 directories. 
TT we should promote that somewhere - on i18n page. We should also capture lessons learned.
Action: MD, write short para for news item about w3c switching to utf-8.

Russ also provided information about the Microsoft Global Development & Deployment Conference, in February.


FAQ REVIEW
Martin's FAQ was not yet ready.



GUIDELINES REVIEWER'S COMMENTS

Jungshik Shin http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-geo/2003Oct/0020.html
Font naming: Good point, add to guidelines.  Action: RR, check with Microsoft how non-ASCII font names are handled on XP.
Date & time: The key point we should make is that ambiguity should be avoided. Which format is chosen to achieve that may depend on the circumstances.  ISO format may be useful in some cases, but in others a culturally adapted format might be better. In the latter case it is important to clearly establish which is month and year.

[0] Thanks !
[1] Thanks again!
[2] We will change it for next release.
[4] We discussed whether it was appropriate to cover XHTML 1.1 in this document. Decided we should. We will add a note about no lang attribute in XHTML1.1.
[5] First para: Thankyou for the correction.
General discussion followed about when to use before/after and start/end rather than left/right and top/bottom. We will need to understand the usage better in order to write the guidelines. There was some acceptance of the idea that localizers should expect to have to change stylesheets as part of the translation process. More discussion needed.
