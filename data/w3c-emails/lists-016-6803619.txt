More pertinent to this virus, should the Unicode Consortium issue a statement
or have a web page pointing out that Unicode does not need to be put in a
binary attachment, when mailed?

A short explanation would be helfpul to people with respect to recognizing the
virus.
It would be educational for the techies that could know more about Unicode then
they do. 
It would help suppress the creation of myths around e-mailing Unicode.

I think some mags would pick it up.
And it would be nice if the end of the short faq said, and you can learn more
at the next Unicode Conference.

It would be, dare I say, viral marketing! ;-)

The short paragraph or two could also link off to a faq on how to set your
mailer to use unicode, for the most common mailers, and the benefits thereof.

Probably a web page on the virus and denying its premise would get lots of hits
and attention as people scurry around to learn how to remove it...
