Yes, that was an issue a year or two ago. It would have made a good
FAQ, because it's indeed Web-related. It's probably a bit too late now.

It is true that mail can't transmit 16-bit unicode. But the spam in some
cases explicitly menioned UTF-8, and in others 7-bit. And that is indeed
an issue, although the solution to it is content transfer encoding rather
than zip.

Yes. But we should cover things that are really related to the Web,
not just everything related to Unicode.
