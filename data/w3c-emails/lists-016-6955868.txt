I see a contradiction in this expression. For me, "primary" means first 
of all or first choice. So there couldn't be more than one.  I suggest 
to define the term "primary language", e.g.   the choice of one (main) 
language among  what might be called (candidate languages).  Assuming 
that the uniqueness of THE language of a page has a meaning.

It is not true. But this might seem to contradict the 2 points above 
"declare the language in the tags that define those blocks".

What is (will be) the status of meta tags? Are they used like a comment?

"see" you on IRC.
