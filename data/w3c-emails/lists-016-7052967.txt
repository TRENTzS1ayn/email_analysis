Folks,

At the Tech Plen we decided to split off a standalone version of the info in the character encoding tutorial about serving xhtml, standards vs quirks, etc.

I've been working on that today, and ended up improving (I hope) the content a good deal in the process.

See http://www.w3.org/International/articles/serving-xhtml/

Please send any comments.
