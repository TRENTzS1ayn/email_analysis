Guess who! ;-) Why do you favor it?
It seems very reasonable to me, if you have defined words that are acceptable
in the Americas and not perhaps in Europe, to have a label to distinguish it
from other versions (such as an es-mx if it exists) and not have it confused
with an es, for which it may not be appropriate.

From a w3c perspective, it would be nice for a user to specify to their UA that
they would like to accept language such as es-americas, without having to list
every latin american country and give it greater priority than es, or es-es,
etc.

Perhaps we should ask on the ig list, if there are latin-american users that
have an opinion.

(Just to collect data, not to argue the point.)
