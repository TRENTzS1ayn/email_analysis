Here are my comments:

- I think it's great to have this material about non-standard/
   browser-specific stuff separated out.

- I think it should be said much clearer, right at the start,
   that this is non-standard/browser-specific stuff.

- At the start of many sections, a short sentence or two to
   give some usual background info is missing.

- As often, there should be many more links in the text.
   For example, a link to the FAQ about how to look at
   headers/charset.

- "encoding declarations are declared": strange repetition

- "screen grabs": somewhat slangy

- "With Internet Explorer": This should have a version number.

- <p> starting with "The XHTML specification also warns that
   "processing instructions are rendered on some user agents."":
   We should know a few more details about this. My guess is that
   this is mostly about long obsolete UAs. We shouldn't ask the
   user for testing from zero.

- "if you decide to omit the XML declaration you should choose
    a Unicode encoding for the page.": Actually, that would be
   UTF-8 or UTF-16. Better say so directly.


Regards,    Martin.
