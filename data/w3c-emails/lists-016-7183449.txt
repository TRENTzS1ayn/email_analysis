I went through the character encoding tutorial [1] and pulled out the following terms we could link to a glossary:

User agent
Unicode
Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP)
Supplementary characters
Character set
Character encoding
Coded character set
Code points
Character escape
Document character set
MIME type
Standards mode
Quirks mode
XML declaration
HTTP header
Charset
ASCII
ANSI
BOM
NCR
Character entity
Compatability character
Bidi
Bidirectional text


There are some explanations of these terms in the tutorial.  We should also harmonise with other definitions, esp. CharMod and Unicode Standard. We should also point to stuff we have that defines in more detail, eg. Document character set FAQ.

I'll send out more such lists when I get a chance to go through the lang tutorial and the techniques doc.

Over to Tex and Andrew for now to take these to the next stage.

Cheers,
RI
