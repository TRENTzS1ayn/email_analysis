Folks,

I'd like to encourage the use of IRC during our teleconferences.

Why: it provides a secondary communication channel that can be useful, and is particularly useful for sharing URIs.  It is also useful for managing the call (who's on, dropping people with problems, muting, etc.)

You'll need to have an IRC client on your PC.  Examples for Windows include:
mIRChttp://www.mirc.com/get.html
Trillian  http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/downloads/
Martin, you had one I can't remember the name of.

The IRC channel we'll use is: #i18n on irc.w3.org:6665

If you have questions, please write to the list. Let's discuss briefly next Wednesday.

Cheers,
RI
