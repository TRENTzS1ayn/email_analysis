Dear all,

I was asked to find out how IE handles non-Latin font names.  

For example

Will IE running on an English version of XP correctly realize that the font name in the below HTML code

   <font face="MS P????????????">?????????</font>  

Should resolve to "MS PGothic"?

Answer:
-------

Windows 2000 and later processes the Asian (non-Latin) native font names the same way as the Latin font name. It is just a function of the OS and not a function of IE. Of course this means that it does not work on Win9x.

Let me know if you have any questions.
