It is even my only chanel to join you for the moment.  Yesterday I tried 
#I18N and #GEO (it exists?) but didn't meet anybody. I've seen Martin 
was on #I18N, but I disconnected rapidly.  Untill now, wednesday was not 
possible for me at 19 PM UK. But from now on, it will be OK.

Looking forward to joinning you next Wednesday.

Regards, Najib
