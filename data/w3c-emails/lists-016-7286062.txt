Jungshik,

If it does work on Win9x/ME, then call that a bonus, because it was not a supported feature.

  Did you actually test that on Win 9x/ME? I also thought it wouldn't work on Win 9x/ME, but it might just work because some 'W' APIs on Win 9x/ME are 'natively' supported (although font-enum APIs are not likely to be among those).  See <http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231426>
for a mozilla bug on the issue.

  BTW, it'd better to say 'non-ASCII' (instead of non-Latin) because the only ASCII part is common in all Windows code pages.

 Anyway, it's not a good idea to list only native font names in CSS because some OS'/browsers  cannot recognize native font names. They always have to be followed by the corresponding ASCII-only names.
