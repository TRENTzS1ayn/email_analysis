I like the new tips that started to appear when I use the w3c validator. In
particular today I noticed some on URIs. I think the suggestions are good,
although I think we might improve the references to languages and how to create
good uri names.

Maybe something worth discussing and giving feedback as well as perhaps
referencing from GEO's faq index.
