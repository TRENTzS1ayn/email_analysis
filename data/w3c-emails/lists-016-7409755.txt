I added Richard's list of terms to the glossary, although I haven't added
definitions.

http://www.i18nguy.com/markup/i18n-glossary.html

I am not sure about terms like "quirks mode".
Also, if define terms like HTTP Header and XML declaration, we will be defining
lots of terms from many many specs.

We need a criteria for what is included or not.
I wonder if we need a search index rather than a glossary, so people can easily
find where things are defined or discussed rather than a glossary for some of
the items.

lets discuss.
