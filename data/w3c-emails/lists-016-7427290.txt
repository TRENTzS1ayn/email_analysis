For some reason this email appears to have not made it into the list, although its 8 hours since I sent it.  I'm resending.

Subject: Index improvements



I spent a day talking with Shawn Henry (team member working on the WAI Education & Outreach activity) a week last Monday.  I shared our stuff with her, and heard from her what her group is working on. (This included some really interesting videos of usability assessments of the W3C and WAI site by members of the public.)

As a result of accessibility comments made by Shawn about our resource index at http://www.w3.org/International/resource-index.html I've been thinking about how to improve it.  I came up with an approach you can see partially implemented at http://www.w3.org/International/resource-index.html#charset

Shawn's comment was that many disabled people would prefer the links to have more meaningful text.  Initially, I was worried that the extra text would make it more difficult to find stuff, but having done a section, I think it's actually easier to see the wood for the trees now in terms of both finding information and assessing whether to follow a link. 

Any comments before I propagate it to the rest of the page?

PS: Note that I also improved the visibility of the link to the index on http://www.w3.org/International/
