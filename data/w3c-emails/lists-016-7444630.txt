Richard,

It is too wordy for me. The repetitiveness and wordiness makes it difficult to
find what you are looking for, assuming you don't want to be reading and
studying what should be an index page.

I would use an icon for tutorial, article, FAQ, so they do not need to be read
over and over.
I am not convinced they should be intermixed or that all 3 are appropriate to
answer some of these questions. (Tutorial is too broad as a response to
specific questions, faqs are too narrow for general questions. 

I would organize differently.
Grabbing the first few topics I resequenced them.

Here is what I grabbed:

How do I choose an encoding for my document? 
Tutorial: Character sets & encodings in XHTML, HTML and CSS 
How do I specify the encoding of an HTML, XHTML, XML or CSS document? 
Tutorial: Character sets & encodings in XHTML, HTML and CSS 
Techniques: Specifying a page encoding 
Article: Character encodings 
Article: Serving XHTML 1.0 
Where can I find the charset names? 
URI: IANA charset registry 
How do I set up my server to serve the right encoding for a page? 
Article: The HTTP charset parameter 
How do I set character encoding in my web authoring applications? 
FAQ: Setting encoding in web authoring applications 
Can I encode XML and X/HTML in non-Unicode encodings, if the document character
set is Unicode? 
FAQ: Document character set 
How much support exists today for HTML written in Unicode? 
FAQ: Who uses Unicode? 


I would organize as follows and then fill in with the materials :

(Major heading) Character Sets, Character Encodings, Charset
1) What are they?

2) What are their names?

3) Which one should I use?

4) When is Unicode appropriate?

5) How do I specify character encodings:
5a) in documents
5b) in HTTP
5c) in Web authoring tools
5d) in Web Servers

I shared our stuff with her, and heard from her what her group is working on. (This included some really interesting videos of usability assessments of the W3C and WAI site by members of the public.)

I came up with an approach you can see partially implemented at http://www.w3.org/International/resource-index.html#charset

Initially, I was worried that the extra text would make it more difficult to find stuff, but having done a section, I think it's actually easier to see the wood for the trees now in terms of both finding information and assessing whether to follow a link.
