Could terms like BDO, LRE, PDF, LRM, ZWNJ also be there? May lead to a 
lot of terms...

A criteria could only be subjective. One criteria might be: terms that 
are directly related to I18N and that a "Western" Web expert/developper 
is normally not supposed to know. As a consequence, HTTP Header and such 
things don't fit into this criteria.

In the glossary,  XML is spelled eXtended Markup Language. It is not 
Extended Markup Language?
