First thoughts on some of the easier things to comment on...

I thought about this too.  I'm expecting most people most of the time to
search the page for items of interest, rather than read.  The questions
serve to help the user see what's at the other end of the link without
having to go there and return.  Might be good to have short subheadings
though every so often.

This is an index to locate information on the site, so I disagree and
believe that it must point to multiple locations where appropriate.

If you follow the links to the tutorials, you'll see that I link *into* the
tutorial at the most appropriate place when this is a fairly specific
question.

I was certainly thinking that this section was beginning to reach a size
that merited subdivision and better organization.  Phil and Leslie, we
should probably also do some card sorting type exercise on this.
