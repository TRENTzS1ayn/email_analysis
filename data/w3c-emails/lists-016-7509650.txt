Folks,

I have uploaded a version of the language tag related tutorial to http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-lang/ (including pdf and svg slides), though it isn't yet linked to from the site.

I've incorporated the comments received so far.

I consider this version ready to publish as a 'public draft'.  

Please take a look and let me know if you see any showstoppers that would prevent us releasing it.

Cheers,
RI
