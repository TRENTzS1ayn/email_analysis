I just uploaded new versions of the 3 techniques docs we have:

http://localhost/International/geo/html-tech/tech-character.html
http://localhost/International/geo/html-tech/tech-lang.html
http://localhost/International/geo/html-tech/tech-bidi.html

Much of the work was on the front matter in preparation for publication, but I also added content and functionality to increase the number of Uas for which we indicate applicability.
