The publication process requires me to demonstrate that the group supports the imminent, interim publication of the following documents:

http://localhost/International/geo/html-tech/tech-character.html
http://localhost/International/geo/html-tech/tech-lang.html
http://localhost/International/geo/html-tech/tech-bidi.html

For clarity I will summarise here in one place the voice of the group as far as I am aware.
I have received the following responses in favour:
-Martin: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-geo/2004Apr/0025.html
-Deborah: in private mail
-Andrew: in teleconference http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-geo/2004Apr/0029.html
-Myself: of course

I believe I have also received responses in the affirmative from Tex and Russ, but can't find the evidence.  Tex and Russ, please send a mailnote, if you would. Thanks.

I have received no objections.

Thanks.
RI
