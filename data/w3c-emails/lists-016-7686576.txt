I have uploaded new versions of the three techniques docs we just published to the edit space (see http://www.w3.org/International/geo/#work for links).  

They are based on the published versions, but after some work yesterday on the XSLT the resources are no longer gathered at the end of a section, but appear after every technique.  I think this is an improvement for the user, but also helps us focus on providing more links for the techniques.

Please look at these docs and suggest areas we need to refine.  I am already planning to add techniques specific to declaring character encodings in CSS style sheets.

Cheers,
RI
