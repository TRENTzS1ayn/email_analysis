Info Share

From Russ: on Monday Microsoft announced Application Translator. 
Using common strings will insert translations at run time
Tool also allows addition of translations for your specific needs or languages that are not offered by MS
There is some contextual awareness to help with homonyms
Looking for orgs to participate in beta test - need to register to use
Looking for small to medium companies that can't afford proper translation but would like to provide 'gist' translations
creates an XML file for text it doesn't recognise
RI: could be useful for pseudo localization tests
