REMINDER: the new scheduled teleconference for the WSTF begins tomorrow. If you have not used the W3C teleconference bridge previously, please review the links above for instructions (it's very easy).

I have reserved 9 total slots on the bridge. If we have more or fewer attendees, I will adjust the number. If you cannot attend this first meeting and intend to participate in future ones, please let me know so I keep the number of slots we
will actually need.
