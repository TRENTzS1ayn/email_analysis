All:

Below my signature is my draft of our proposed response to XMLP Issue 263 (that's the one with xml:lang). Please forward any comments back to this list BEFORE Wednesday, 11 December 2002 (Pacific Standard Time). Lack of response is considered to be acceptance of this draft as-is. Our intention is to forward this (or a suitably modified response) by next Thursday.

Thanks!

Addison

=========
Dear XMLP WG:

I appologize for the delay in responding to this issue: the I18N-WG (Web Services Task Force) [WSTF], which has recently reviewed your proposed solution to Issue 263, has only recently been organized and we reviewed your group's responses at our first meeting with an eye towards getting you feedback as quickly as possible.

We are concerned that your proposed solution to Issue 263 is incomplete or inadequate and so we are sending some additional comments. To help illustrate our comments, we have included several scenarios in our Usage Scenarios document, which you can find here: http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/

The scenarios that apply to this issue are 2.3 through 2.9.

Basically our concerns are:

1. Most operating environments do not provide a mechanism that will enable Web service providers to enumerate and generate all of the available languages, except by looping over the complete possible list of languages. 
   a. Expanding the SOAP definition to allow an arbitrary number of natural language messages will result in very poor performance. 
   b. On some platforms, it is not possible to loop over the install locales because the list of locales cannot be obtained.

2. Sending back all or many of the available languages will result in very large or greatly expanded documents that provide limited or no additional utility.

3. Most operating environments do provide a mechanism for finding the best matching localized messages for a given (specified) language preference.

4. Of the major transports available for Web services, only HTTP offers any form of language negotiation (via the Accept-Language header). Since the transport is independent of the SOAP document itself and this header is generated by the specific system creating the connection, there are several chained, connectionless and multipoint WS scenarios in which an intermediary system may interrupt the flow of language preference from the requestor to the provider and back.

In other words, although the proposed revision allows multiple languages, implementers will not be able to use this feature to solve the problem or will only be able to use it in a limited way.

As a result we feel that, at a minimum, SOAP should either provide a mechanism for specifying the "international context" for a Web services interaction or this section should be modified to more emphatically state the need for such a mechanism. Such mechanisms might include:

- A general recommendation that each Web service provide a language negotiation mechanism and that this mechanism be used in providing human readable natural language text, such as SOAPFault reasontext attributes.
- A specific "Accept-Language" SOAP header along the lines of RFC3066 (which defines the HTTP Accept-Language header)
- An "International Context" SOAP header that provides extensible support for other i18n-related information

At issue is whether XMLP/SOAP should define this mechanism directly in SOAP 1.2 or whether XMLP/SOAP or I18N WSTF should work on defining this mechanism separately (and it be incorporated by reference into future Web services recommendations). We welcome your feedback on how to proceed with this issue.

We also have the following comments:

1. Specifically state that the first env:Text entry should be considered the "default" text, to be used when no match is obtained by the requestor with languages in the list. This ensures that the human reader always has some text available.

2. We note that the various drafts at http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/, including the editor's copy (http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/2/06/LC/soap12-part1.html) do not seem to contain the proposed changes. We would like to opportunity to review and comment on these changes. The text in your proposed resolution appears to address our other concerns except for the issues noted above.

Regards, etc....;

Subject: Fwd: XMLP Issue 263 Resolution


Dear WS I18N Task Force Members,

This is the first of a series of responses to last call
comments on the SOAP 1.2 specification that I sent in to
the XML Protocol WG on behalf of the old I18N WG a whil ago.

At the meeting today, the WS I18N task force went through
these responses to decide whether they should be accepted
or not, and coming up with some comments.

A list of the issues can be found starting at
http://w3c3.inria.fr/2000/xp/Group/xmlp-lc-issues.html#x256.

The way we want to proceed is that I forward the responses from
the XML Protocol WG to the public-i18n-ws@w3.org list, then
we will follow up with some proposed answers, and if we don't
get any comments on the list, we'll forward these back to
the XML Protocol list.

For this first message, I'm copying the I18N IG list, to make
sure that people on the Core Task Force (officially responsible
for reviews) can join the public-i18n-ws@w3.org list or ca
look at the archive to follow up on this discussion.

Regards,     Martin.
