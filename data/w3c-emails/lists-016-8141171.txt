Hello Kentaro,

Many thanks for all your work. I saw that you worked quite a bit
on the 'Status of this Document' section. The main piece that
we still need there is the invitation for sending in use cases.
(more or less the same thing that we will say in the announcement
that we plan to send to various lists).

Addison, I think you said that you would work on that. Do you
have a draft that we could include?

Regards,    Martin.
