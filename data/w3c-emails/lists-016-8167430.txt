Hello Addison, 

>I saw that you worked quite a bit on the 'Status of this Document' 
section.

I added the "Status of this document" in the style of other W3C documents. 
I would like to replace the draft of "Status of this document" with the 
new version you have drafted. Please post your draft.

Thanks, 
Kentaroh

Hello Kentaro,

Many thanks for all your work. I saw that you worked quite a bit
on the 'Status of this Document' section. The main piece that
we still need there is the invitation for sending in use cases.
(more or less the same thing that we will say in the announcement
that we plan to send to various lists).

Addison, I think you said that you would work on that. Do you
have a draft that we could include?

Regards,    Martin.
