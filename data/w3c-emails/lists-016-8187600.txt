REMINDER: the next scheduled teleconference for the WSTF is tomorrow. If you have not used the W3C teleconference bridge previously, please review the links above for instructions (it's very easy).

SUMMARY: This should be a fairly short, but important, meeting. We have two main activities this time. First, we need to approve the introductory text and prepare for a call for participation in gathering use cases. Second, we need to review XMLP's responses on Issues 263 and 270 and decide on a course of action.

I have reserved 9 total slots on the bridge. If we do not pick up any attendees this time, I will adjust the number downward slightly. If you cannot attend this second meeting and intend to participate in future ones, please let me know so I keep the number of slots we will actually need.
