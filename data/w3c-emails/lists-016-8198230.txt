Here are comments, mostly typos on the version of the doc available last
night.

section 2.1.2.2 description
second paragraph, second sentence- change "The senders" to singular "The
sender".
next para: change "middlewares" to "middleware". the plural and singular
are the same.

sec. 2.2.1.2 desc.
search for "HTTP biding, how" replace with "HTTP binding, how can"  (fix
spelling of binding and add "can").

sec 2.3.1.2 desc.
sentence beginning with "Date varied by time-zone" should be "Date
varies by time-zone,"
(comma added and varied->varies)

next sentence change "distinct" to "distinguish"

sec 2.3.2.2 desc.
in the examples change getAvailableFrightResponse to
getAvailableFlightResponse 
(several places)

sec 2.3.3.1 scenario def.
first use of currency should be made plural- currencies.
second use is misspelled. cunrrecy -> currency

(I am not sure I agree with the ed. note that this is a legacy issue.
mismatched currency is bound to be a problem between systems.
But no change required for this version)

The paragraph after the first example beginning "The most of regional
services" should be changed to:
"Most regional services use the default region's currency,..."
or
"Most regional services use a default currency,..."


next to last para:
change "effect" to "affect".

sec. 2.3.4.2 desc.
reference to appendix C should be prefixed with "see appendix" so it
reads:
(H means Heisei era. See appendix C Heisei)

first para after the example:
add "with" after handshake:
"... a receiver can handshake with each..."

sec 2.5.2.2 desc.
global search and replace "custermiz" with "customiz"
(at least 3 places)

sec 2.7.1 Oursorcing-   typo- change to Outsourcing.

sec 2.7.2.2
last para: change Salability to Scalability
