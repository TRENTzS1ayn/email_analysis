Yes, I agree, I didn't think it belonged in the spec, but felt at this
point it didnt matter if it was included.
Thanks for suggesting/offering to remove it.

The material would make a good web page though. I might use it for my
web site if you dont mind.
It might be good to have it on the w3c i18n site along with some other
date formats.
