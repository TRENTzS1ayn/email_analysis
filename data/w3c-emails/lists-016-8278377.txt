Hello Addison,

Many thanks for your work. I used your material to put some
text in the 'Status of this document' section. What I currently
have is:

 >>>>
We invite contributions of additional Usage Scenarios and Use Cases to 
document aspects of Web Services internationalization that are not covered 
yet in this document. To contribute, please use a format similar to the one 
used in this document, and send your contribution to the 
www-i18n-comments@w3.org mailing list (public archive). Please use [Web 
Services] or [WSUS] in the subject.
 >>>>

This is on purpose a bit more personal than your text below. We still
can tune some details tomorrow, but it's good enough now to request
Tim's okay.

I'll send more comments on your proposal tomorrow.

Regards,    Martin.
