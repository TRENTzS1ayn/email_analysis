Martin, thank you for all updates. I didn't update the document today, 
because I think it looks nice. If you have what you haven't done yet 
today(12/19), please let me know. I can work for it during your night. 

Thanks, 
Kentaroh

That looks great. For my part I purposely made the text LESS personal
