Hello, 

I agree with Tex's comments: it may be more effective to be more concise 
and direct. I think it is good idea to add a paragraph for participation, 
too.

When the text is sent to other mailing lists, I think that it can notify 
that discussion of WSTF takes place on the public mailing list 
public-i18n-ws@w3.org together with the call for participation.

Thanks, 
Kentaroh
