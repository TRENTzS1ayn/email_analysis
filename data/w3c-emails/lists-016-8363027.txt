Folks:

I have incorporated a few more comments, plus a couple of edits of my own, into Tex's last version. Please send any additional comments today, as I will send this out tomorrow (Saturday, Pacific time).

Thanks, everyone, for your help in getting this first draft posted, especially Martin for shepherding the draft through the process.

The Web Services Task Force of the W3C Internationalization Working Group is pleased to announce the publication of the first "Web Services Internationalization Usage Scenarios" Working Draft at http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-i18n-scenarios.

The goal of this document is to gather together scenarios for using Web services standards and technologies in ways that require attention to language, culture, and internationalization.

This will help us to:

   o create "best practices" and tutorial information for Web service implementers and technology providers

   o propose standards for Web services and related technologies to support international operation

   o demonstrate international issues in existing Web services technologies and standards to the groups responsible for their development and maintenance

We invite you to contribute additional Usage Scenarios that document aspects of Web Services internationalization that are not yet covered by this document or that extend the examples given. To contribute, please use a format similar to the one used in this document, and send your contribution to the www-i18n-comments@w3.org mailing list (publicly archived). Please use [Web Services] or [WSUS] in the subject.

Please do not send proprietary material or information.

We also invite you to join this Task Force. Members of the Task Force will have the opportunity to influence the internationalization of Web services standards as they evolve. You may also wish to join our public mailing list (public-i18n-ws@w3.org). Instructions on joining the Task Force and mailing list are located on our home page, located here: http://www.w3.org/International/ws.

Best Regards,

Addison

Internationalization is an architecture.
It is not a feature.
