Maybe better to (also) give the exact address:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-ws-i18n-scenarios-20021220/

'gather together' sounds like double duty. just 'gather' should be
enough. Apart from that, I think all the details are perfect in
this sentence, but when I read it, I got stuck, it seems to be
too long. After reading a few times, I think the main problem
is that 'for using' and 'in ways that' are too far apart.

What about:

The goal of this document is to gather scenarios for Web services standards 
and technologies when used in ways that require attention to language, 
culture, and internationalization.

could be a good idea to give the address of the public archive:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-i18n-comments/
