Hi Martin,

Thanks for the comments. I'll include the link into the final version I send
out tomorrow.

I think that the sentence you point out is too long, as you say. However, I
think that the English doesn't read naturally (to me) in your version. How
about this:

>The goal of this document is to gather scenarios for using Web services in
ways that require attention to language, culture, and internationalization.

thanks,

Addison
