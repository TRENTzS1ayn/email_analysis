All:

I have posted the skeleton of a document for classifying our Usage Scenarios, as we discussed in the last teleconference. In this version I have included four broad categories that I was able to identify. Additional categorization is inevitable. Our plan, as you probably recall, is to discuss specific activities for the TF to undertake based on the scenarios we have in hand. In particular, we will want to look at the language/locale/preferences related issues.

The document is located here: http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/scenarios-classification.html

Note that this document is very very rough in form. I'll be cleaning it up over the holiday break. The word "moo" is a placeholder, for example, not a comment. ;-).

As always, comments and suggestions are welcome.

Best Regards,

Addison
