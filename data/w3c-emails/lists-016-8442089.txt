Hello Addison, Martin, 

This classification is nice reference for WSTF future activities. You 
mentioned it was rough draft, but let me incorporate your document into 
the editor's copy so that reader can reach each section by clicking 
section numbers easily. For the present, I added the classification into 
the "A Deliverables Classification (Non-Normative)" of the latest editor's 
copy.

Thanks, 
Kentaroh
