Dear Listmates:

My apologies on the delay in forwarding the below "Last Call" on the WSDL
requirements.

I urge each of you to review this document and supply whatever feedback you
feel is germane on your own (or your company's) behalf directly to this WG.

However, this is an opportunity to provide early, consistent feedback from
this Task Force as well. I would like to encourage each of you to send your
feedback to this list for discussion and consolidation into a coherent
position by the I18N Work Group. As such your comments may enjoy greater
impact or attention than individual contributions might, and it will give
this community an opportunity to get involved with setting the tone for
internationalization in Web services (as opposed to trying to provide
comments "after the fact").

Best Regards,

Addison

Internationalization is an architecture.
It is not a feature.
