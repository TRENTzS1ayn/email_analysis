Team:

Yesterday the Web Services Architecture Group released two new documents that fall into our area of interest. These are:

The Web Services Architecture Working Draft:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-ws-arch-20021114/

The Web Services Requirements Update:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-wsa-reqs-20021114

A cursory look at these document reveals no mention of any of our favorite keywords (Unicode, UTF-8, character encoding, locale, internationalization, i18n, etc. etc.). During the upcoming Face-to-Face we should include discussion of what-if-any architectural approaches need to be made.

Please send your comments on these documents to this list or bring them to the FTF next week.

Best Regards,

Addison
