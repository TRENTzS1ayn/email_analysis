The following items may require internationalization viewpoints. 

> R026 The description language MUST provide human-readable comment 
capabilities.

Human-readable comment should have a multiple languages' capability. UDDI 
V2 allows five descriptions of services to support multiple language 
descriptions. WSDL should consider the similar capability of UDDI. 


> R044 The description language SHOULD allow describing both application 
data and context data of a Service.

I can guess application data is based on integer and float etc which is 
defined by XML Schema or something else. But, I cannot guess the meaning 
of context data of a Service.  If it means semantics of exchangeable data 
or environment of services, I think internationalization may be required.  



> R060 The description language MUST allow specifying an association 
between an Interface and one or more concrete protocols and/or data 
formats. 

I'm wondering that the data format imply locale sensitive data format such 
as date and numeric format.  We should clarify what data format is. 

In summary, WSDL can have an internationalization section in order to make 
the internationalization requirements clear.

 e.g. 
 R### Internationalization requirements 

 The following requirements SHOULD have an internationalization 
capability.

 R026: description
 R044: description 
 R060: description
 ....

After clarifications, I think we may be able to make several use 
cases/requirements by cross referencing. 

Thanks,

Dear Listmates:

My apologies on the delay in forwarding the below "Last Call" on the WSDL
requirements.

I urge each of you to review this document and supply whatever feedback 
you
feel is germane on your own (or your company's) behalf directly to this 
WG.

However, this is an opportunity to provide early, consistent feedback from
this Task Force as well. I would like to encourage each of you to send 
your
feedback to this list for discussion and consolidation into a coherent
position by the I18N Work Group. As such your comments may enjoy greater
impact or attention than individual contributions might, and it will give
this community an opportunity to get involved with setting the tone for
internationalization in Web services (as opposed to trying to provide
comments "after the fact").

Best Regards,

Addison
