All:

Kentaroh Noji has kindly contributed a first draft of the Use Case document, complete with several usage scenarios. This document is now posted on the website at:

http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/

We will be discussing, expanding, and extending this document at the FTF meeting later this week. If you are not attending the meeting (or even if you are), please send your comments back to this list for discussion. We, of course, also welcome additional material.

Feel free, also, to invite additional contributions by those not on the list, but who are interested in this topic.

Best Regards,

Addison
