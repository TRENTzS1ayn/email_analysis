I think things such as the Common XML Locale format will stay in
the back of our mind in some way or another.

But we are just at the stage of use cases, where we should look
at what we want/need to do, not exactly how to do it.

It would be good to have use cases covering these cases, and explaining
why and in what cases this has to be done (and maybe also use cases for
the 'wrong' way of doing it, and explanations on when that's appropriate.

In general I agree with you. Can you help us formulate that in
clear use cases?
