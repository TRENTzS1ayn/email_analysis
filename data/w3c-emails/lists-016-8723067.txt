We hope to commence regular teleconferences for the W3C I18N Web Services Task Force on a bi-weekly basis. We have tentatively selected Tuesdays for one hour, starting at the following time:

15:00 Pacific
08:00 Tokyo
18:00 Boston
23:00 UTC

Does anyone have any objection to this time and schedule? If no objections are received we will begin booking the teleconference bridge and set a schedule, with the first meeting beginning approximately two weeks from now.

Best Regards,

Addison
