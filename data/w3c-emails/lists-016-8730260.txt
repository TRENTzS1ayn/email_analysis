All:

We are just wrapping up for dinner after a fruitful first day. The changes to the Use Case document have been posted on-line (we are editing the document live). We welcome comments "live" for the continuation of the Face-to-Face meeting tomorrow. (Understandably, tomorrow is Saturday everywhere, so you might not have time to comment while we're "live"---please forward your comments to the list later if you cannot make them while we are "live").

The document is located at:

http://www.w3.org/International/ws/ws-i18n-scenarios-edit/Overview.html

For reference, we decided to focus the use case document on specific scenarios, leaving the design and discussion of solutions until we have a "more complete picture".

If anyone reading the list wants to dial into the meeting tomorrow, please email me back at mailto:aphillips@webmethods.com to let me know the time(s) we should activate the bridge.

Dial in information is at:

Best Regards,

Addison
