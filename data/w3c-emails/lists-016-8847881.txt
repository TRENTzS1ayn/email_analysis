Dear David and Hugo:

Recently the W3C Internationalization Activity (W3C-I18N-WG) completed its rechartering effort. As you probably know, this working group supports the various W3C activities to make it possible to use Internet technologies worldwide.

As part of the rechartering, the I18N-WG has added two additional task forces concentrating on specific areas of immediate interest to the internationalization community. One of these is the Web Services I18N Task Force. I'm writing to you as the chair of this group to solicit your support and let you know about our activities.

For detailed information, you can view our public site here http://www.w3.org/International/ws. There is also a more detailed explanation of the task force in our new charter [1].

We are currently engaged in a Call for Participation. I would like to forward this call to the various WS-WG public lists in hopes of recruiting more members to support our activities. Our initial meetings include a Face-to-Face meeting in the Boston area November 22-23 and we'd like to have as many people on board by then as possible.

The Task Force has two main goals. 

Our short term goal is to produce a set of use cases that describe internationalization issues in web services. These documents will help identify i18n issues in Web services and also to provide templates for implementers to address these issues.

Our second goal is to produce feedback (in the form of requirements) to the WS work groups to address any areas of concern that are identified. In this way we hope to support the actual WS working groups with the feedback and information they need to produce standards that will best serve international users.

Of course we must closely coordinate our activities with those of the various working groups. As "the other WS group", we want to augment rather than detract from the efforts of the main WGs and by working closely together W3C-I18N and WS-CG can assure that this is the case.

I'd like to suggest that we arrange a time to talk in the near future so that I can coordinate our calendar and activities with the various WG milestones and activities.

I look forward to working closely with you in the future.

Best Regards,

Addison
