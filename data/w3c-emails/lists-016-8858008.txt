Gentlemen,

Thank you again for the opportunity to address your group directly. I look forward to working with each of you and the various Web services work groups in the future.

Since our time was limited, I want to reiterate the main points so that there is no misunderstanding of our purposes:

1. The I18N WS TF was started because of the level of interest in Web services from within the internationalization community in general. It is not, to my knowledge, anyone's opinion that "you did something wrong" or were singled out for our attention. It is merely that many of us are working on Web services and i18n at the same time and have an interest in promoting your activities and developing support for globalization capabilities in Web services.

2. Our primary activity will be to develop use cases and requirements that demonstrate how Web services can be effectively used in an "internationalized way" and possibly to demonstrate where specific areas of improvement might be considered.

3. We will also take an active role in reviewing standards as they are developed, in coordination with the I18N Core TF. By being more focused we feel we can improve the quality and timeliness of the i18n comments and feedback.

As we discussed, it is possible (even probable) that many of the "i18n issues" with Web services are actually more general issues with the base standards (like XML Schema, for example) that you rely on. In these instances, the WS TF will work towards promoting changes or additions to these standards to assist you in your goals.

Because our TF has yet to finish formalizing our structure, the specific "hows" and "whats" of our activity have yet to be fleshed out. Based on your recommendations, I will be contacting each of the WS working groups to solicit feedback on schedules, cooperation, and how we can best integrate our activities with those of the groups actively working on Web services.

Thanks again for the opportunity to meet with you. I recognize that your time is valuable. I look forward to sharing our activities with you in the future as best fits our two organizations.

Best Regards,

Addison
