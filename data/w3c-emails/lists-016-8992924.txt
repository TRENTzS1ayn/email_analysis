Team:

Our last teleconference marked the second in a row with only three participants (Deb, Martin, myself). We continue to fall further behind on our goal of producing a review of the WS-Architecture document. We also have a hard time forming enough consensus to complete other interesting activities. For example, I wanted to suggest that we put a presentation together for IUC24...

As a result, we have scheduled another meeting this coming Tuesday, 30 April, for the usual time (15:00 Pacific, 18:00 Eastern). Please make every effort to attend this meeting. It is important that you make at least this small amount of time available to ensure our progress.

Notes:

1. Deb suggested several other technologies we need to scope out. He has subsequently sent a list of links to the mail list for review.

2. In particular he suggested looking at the OASIS effort "WS Remote Portlet", which is using xml:lang (RFC3066) for locale negotiation [as a model of both good and bad assumptions].

3. We had a good discussion of language negotiation and preference exchange in light of off-line conversations with Mark Davis in Prague, subsequent activity on the ietf-languages list, and our own personal point of view. This discussion has a couple of action items associated with it, notably:

  a) I need to get my OMI/WFML (aggregation pattern) usage case document on the website.
  b) We need to consider assembling and publishing a Best Practices paper based on our existing usage scenarios.

4. We also discussed liasing with other groups, notably WS-Architecture and WS-I.

5. We need to get a new editor.

6. We scheduled a "make-up" meeting due to poor attendence the last two sessions. We also discussed the possibility of doing an F2F meeting, since those seem to be particularly useful.

Please make every effort to attend the next meeting on Tuesday.
