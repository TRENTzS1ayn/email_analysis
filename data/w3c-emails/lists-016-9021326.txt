> 1. Action Item Review
>    - Tex: WSDL review

Tex: looking at WSDL. It Mentions URIs: need to understand if there is an IRI implication. Also need to think about aliasing of descriptive text or possibly service names for the purposes of searching. Tex will put some comments together by next meeting.

>    - Deb: WS-Choroegraphy review

in progress. next week: rough form of document. In particular he's looking at compensating transactions, where he thinks most of the issues will be application specific, rather than generic.

Mike would like some assignments. Deb/Mike arranged to call each other offline to discuss in depth cooperation on this topic.

>    - Addison: Post aggregation document

in progress. move up to website this week.
> 
> 2. Discuss I18N-WG coordination comments

AP:   I'm concerned that we've fallen off schedule and had a period of low participation and lack of delivery. Solicits comments...
Tex:  Hit a period of lower participation due to very busy period. Interest remains high (general consensus)
Tex:  looking at spec size: plenty of work to do. Outside involvement might be too daunting to take on. We should persevere as a group and invite participation on an as-needed basis only.
AP:   Should we consolidate our observations into best practices or more easily digested format? What goal do we wish to pursue?
(General discussion): Want to publish something relevant based on Usage Scenarios and other work. Where should we try to publish this? Probably not worthwhile to go back to the IUC. Need to deliver documents that are relevant and well-constructed and we have a forum for that already. Good documents will drive interaction with other teams. Will also allow individuals to present materials and positions as they see fit.
MD:   WWW-conference in < month, 1 session on WS. MD to speak and needs something to say...
Tex:  Do a presentation to clarify the significant scenarios. Here are some Scenarios. Here are a few issues within them of particular interest. Here are a few solutions or suggestions. Look for the compelling items.
(Discussion)

Decision: We need to edit and reorganize the Usage Scenarios document, creating summary blocks for the general types of issue or approach that we feel is significant. For example, the SOAPFault problem. The best way to do this is to edit the Usage scenarios document, adding any material we can gather quickly, and "slide-ize" the biggest (most interesting) items.

Plan: Hold a mini-WSTF-FTF in the Boston area. We will try for 12/13 May. Addison, Tex, Martin. 

Addison will try to get webMethods office again. Otherwise we'll meet at someone's house. 

MD: Please contribute additional material.
