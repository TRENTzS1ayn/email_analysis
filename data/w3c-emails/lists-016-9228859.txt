Here's a couple of fun examples from the web:

http://www.tondering.dk/claus/calendar.html

    This is a calendar FAQ. Its purpose is to give an overview of the
    Christian, Hebrew, Persian, and Islamic calendars in common use. It
    will provide a historical background for the Christian calendar,
    plus an overview of the French Revolutionary calendar, the Maya
    calendar, and the Chinese calendar.
    (excellent resource!  Especially interesting is the catalog of dates
    when various countries adopted the Gregorian Calendar)

http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html

    An interesting link about time and timnezones.

    (a problem with passports ...)
    According to the Gazeteer of Chaling Country, Tan Yun-shan was born
    at the Shen hour (1500-1700 hours) on the 5th of the 9th moon of the
    Wuxu year of Emperor Guangxu's Era of the Manchu Dynasty, i.e. 1898.
    Tan Yun-shan was a man who was keen to embrace modern trends. He
    recorded the birth of all his children according to the solar
    calendar. This created problems for his second son, Tan Zheng, when
    he applied for passport to come to India in the 1970s. The Hunan
    passport office refused to believe that his date of birth was
    recorded in the solar calendar, as he was born in 1932. It promptly
    converted his solar birthday into another solar birthday. Few modern
    Chinese could imagine that Tan Yun-shan did this in the early
    decades of the century to his own birthday. One year, this 5th of
    the 9th moon coincided with the 10th of October which was the
    national day of the Republic of China. This gave him an occasion to
    switch calendar. Henceforth, everyone easily remembered that he was
    born on the "Double 10th Festival", forgetting the original date
    recorded in the lunar calendar.

    *Kate Festival *

    This is the largest and the most joyful festival in Ninh Thuan and
    Binh Thuan provinces, where live many Cham people. The ceremony
    takes place at Poklong Giarai Tower, Po Rome Tower, Po Nagar Tower
    Temple, from Sept.25th to Oct. 10th (on the 1st of July according to
    the Cham calendar - corresponding to August or September by the
    Lunar calendar).  ....
