Hi Tex,

Thanks for the comments. Some comments below. I'll post the new draft when I
get into the office in a bit.

This isn't under my control: it's the stylesheet. The original document is
the XML flavored thing.

Good idea.

I agree. Will do.

Absolutely, although the definition is cribbed (quoted verbatim from the WSA
document). That doesn't mean that we shouldn't add our own tilt to it
though.

The full name is a bit chewy, which is why I didn't use it originally in
what is already an overly long sentence. I'll break the sentence up and add
WSTF to the name.

Agreed.

I took your suggestions as a baseline and wordsmithed slightly. Check out
the new version when I get it posted later today.

That's the right way to do it, although I followed the pattern of the XML
and SOAP requirements documents (which just made bald faced statements).

I'll add some text here.

Done.

Ick. Done.

Done.
