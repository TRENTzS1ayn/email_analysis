This made me think of an interesting application. Astronomers and
Geologists, etc. might have reason to believe some event has occurred
historically and would like to confirm it thru historical reports. They
would need dates in the local calendar of the time.

For example, predicting a comet appeared n years ago, (or some seismic
or other event, for example a flood) scientists might want to check for
reports of a bright star etc. and need the dates as used at the time in
countries around the world....

What was the calendar used in gonawandaland (or pangea) 65M years ago
when dinosaurs were wiped out by the asteroid hit? ;-)

I can write up the age one, if people want.

I think it might be good to have something that is not just date
conversions (although under the covers age also is calendar conversion
too.)

let me know.
