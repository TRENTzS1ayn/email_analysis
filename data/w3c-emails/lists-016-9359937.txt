65M years ago the day was only 18 hours long and there were over 400 days in the year. The month was also somewhat shorter. Tidal losses. Talk about your leap seconds. Maybe the dinosaurs all got giddy or their tiny little brains were overloaded by the need for calendar reform......

Ack. I think the idiocy infecting various lists (not this one) is getting to me. Please write as many different scenarios as you can. We need the material. :-)
