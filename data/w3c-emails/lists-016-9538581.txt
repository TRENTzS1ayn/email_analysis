I still don't see the need for the charset; and it adds more opportunity for
things to go wrong. In any even, if your POSIX implementation receives a
locale tag without a charset, it must have backup; the same happens if it
receives a locale tag with an unsupported combination, like en_US@SJIS.
Moreover, since the IANA charset name is non unambiguous, as we all know,
you have the issue of a locale id might be misidentified.

The charset is really an orthogonal attribute, with nothing to do with
cultural conventions.
