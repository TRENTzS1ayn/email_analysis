Well, there are two issues here: terminology and contents.

Terminology

As far as terminology goes, I believe it is very dangerous to use the
'naked' term "locale", since the usage varies so widely. Even in your own
messages sometimes you appear to mean tags, sometimes data, sometimes
conventions. And the meaning of a given message can vary widely depending on
which interpretation the reader gives to it. This will only give rise to
misunderstandings on a very core issue.

For clarity, certainly in the working group discussion, we should always
have fully-qualified names, and say "locale data", or "locale settings",
etc. Otherwise we don't really know what we are agreeing or disagreeing on.

Contents.

I have a certain amount of sympathy for the open-ended approach to locale
tags. Having such a structure would allow people to interchange more
information that is relevant to cultural expectations.

As in the example given earlier, I would like to be able to communicate the
settings that use en-US conventions typically, but then have a date format
of "yyyy.MM.dd".

But such an open stucture still needs careful definition or else it is
useless (or worse) across different systems. This is tricky when faced with
the variation among different OSes and other systems. Take the subtag for
collation, for example. What are the values, and how is the standard
determined? Even for *binary* unicode comparison there are two choices in
use: UTF-16 order and UTF-8 (= UTF-32) order. And when we get into
language-sensitive collation, which one is meant? Java's? Window's?
Solaris's? Which version of that system?

Or is it always a "best effort", and thus not consistent across platforms
(or versions of the same platform)?

I do see some relationship with what we are doing in terms of locale data
for the OpenI18n locale repository (currently hosted on the ICU site, but to
move soon), since it faces the same kinds of issues.

> There are fundamental problems in getting agreement on what a locale
actually is.
>
> Personally, I fall most closely into camp #1 on your list. Although I
acknowledge the other items there are completely valid, I think there is
some value for this group in taking a narrow view of what a locale is. My
version of #1 is:
>
> "A locale is a collection of settings related to regional or cultural
preferences. As a collection, it is an abstraction of a specific "cultural
preferences" or "regional settings" for use by computer systems, not meant
as a perfect model of an individual's preferences. Locales provide software
developers with the means of writing software that expresses itself in the
most appropriate way for a given set of users."
>
> Thus my preference for talking about "locale tags" or "i18n context
identifiers" instead of "locales". Once we start down the path of closely
defining a locale, we end up having to deal with the different locale models
extant, the differing implementation details, dissatisfaction with the
assumptions behind locales such as their lack of personalization, etc. Is
this necessary to create internationalized Web services? I don't believe it
is.
>
> In fact, it might be counter-productive.
>
> Among the models for Web services platforms is the "pure WS environment",
in which developers directly author Web services for the purpose of being a
Web service. It might be possible create and describe an "Internet locale
model" that takes the full range of issues into account in this case.
>
> Another model is the "wrapper" model, in which Web service provider
products wrap existing business logic in Web services. In this case I think
it would be best that they way you author a "Web service" be analogous if
not identical to how you write "regular" logic. Or, another way: your
regular logic will work as designed when you turn it into a WS.
>
> Thus, by ignoring what the "locale container" actually "contains", I think
we could create platform neutral "locale and i18n preferences" to enable
multi-locale support. More importantly, I think we could sell the result to
WS standardizers and implementers who don't care what a locale is (or isn't)
and have a vested interest in their existing systems (and locales).
