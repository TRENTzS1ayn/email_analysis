I agree that charset has no place in a locale. I think we're beating the
proverbial dead horse here.

There may be a place for charset for interoperability purposes. The question
is whether we can make a sensible compromise (something that meets some kind
of need) or if charset negotiation is beyond the scope of our current
efforts. I merely proposed it as "one of the things we might need to
exchange". We should decide how to deal with it.

It may be that "charset considered harmful" would be a better focus for our
efforts here. Another possibility would be to make a more definitive
statement about the use of Unicode in Web services. If Web services are to
insulate their callers from the implementation details of the back-end,
there should probably be a more definitive statement about how to do that.
Sort of a "best practices when dealing with charsets".

If we did it that way, the problems cited elsewhere would still exist, but
the solution would be implementation defined in a way that hides the details
from "public view".

In any event, we need a) some usage scenarios to show what the problems
might be and b) some proposed requirements for dealing with it/them. If
contributors (including myself) can be found, then we can make progress on
this issue. Otherwise it is a random aside... but I suspect that this issue
will have to be dealt with at some point. Better for us to be prepared for
it.

thanks,

Addison
