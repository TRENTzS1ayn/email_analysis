I promised to send this list out as a reference for talking about web service patterns of usage. These are common "patterns" (in the technical/programming sense of "pattern", as well as the time-honored sense):

1. Propagation (change in "A" also changes "B")
2. Synchronization (change in either "A" or "B" changes the other also, as with "single-view-of-customer")
3. Aggregation (changes in both/either "A" and "B" are reflected in "C")
4. Sequential process (simple, step-by-step process, such as quote-to-order)
5. Managed or transaction process(transactional process, with features like rollback)
6. Invocation (RPC-like, also called Direct API Integration)
7. Document exchange (B2B or EDI, for example)
8. Shared process (two of #4 that talk to one-another)
9. Federated query or notification ("A", "B", or "C" can query "D")

Note that most Web services talk (and most of our discussions) hava centered on #6, but the most interesting problems are in the other patterns. Of course, there is no solution for i18n of #6 either ;-).

I think if we were to document the patterns a little better we could write usage scenarios for each that would be more useful.
