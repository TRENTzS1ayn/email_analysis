> -Addison to send link to Requrirements template again {ap->group}

> -Deb to write initial requirements for next meeting.

> -WS-Choreography: we need to create usage scenarios for this.
> -Mike: talked about complex transaction processing. He will work 
> on some scenarios with Deb. "What do we think the protocol should be?"
> -Tex: to look at WSDL for further usage scenarios
> -AP: will add link to membership on main page
> -KN: will just add usage scenarios on suggestion from the list
> -KN: (action) will number the scenarios separate from the 
> automagic index number so that we can track them with a stable identifier.
> -AP: will schedule next bridge dates (Mar/Apr).
