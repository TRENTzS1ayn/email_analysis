Could you point out where you found the description. I couldn't. The
section says "A special attribute named xml:lang may be inserted in
documents to specify the language used in the contents and attribute
values of any element in an XML document."

To my knowledge, xml:lang doesn't regulate XML processor's
behavior. And I believe that a XML processor must process (and report
to the user) all elements and attributes in the document regardless
the locale it's running in.
