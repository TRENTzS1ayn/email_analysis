Hi Addison, et al,

I've just dug out from a consulting gig and the holidays ...

I really like the simplicity and completeness of the the usage scenario classifications, however, I have a minor comment to the wording for Best Practices.

For "Best Practices", I would change:

     "End users" means people who are creating Web services. That is, these are guidelines for making an internationalized Web service using existing standards.

to:

     "End users" means people who are creating, offering, or integrating Web services. That is, these are guidelines for making or using an internationalized Web service using existing standards.

Cheers,

    Mike___

In this version I have included four broad categories that I was able to identify. Additional categorization is inevitable. Our plan, as you probably recall, is to discuss specific activities for the TF to undertake based on the scenarios we have in hand. In particular, we will want to look at the language/locale/preferences related issues.
