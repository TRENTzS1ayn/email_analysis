Hello Addison, 

Thank you very much for quick meeting minutes.  I have comments. 

>2. Team: write up and send to list a "position" 
>on the locale problem (See notes below for what 
>that means). Due prior to next meeting.

My understanding is that the list should describe 1)What is the problem, 
2) the possible solutions, 3) and the corresponded usage scenario, 
correct? 

>3. Discuss if we should we merge language and 
>locale negotiation categories in triage table. 
>General agreement that this should be done.

I merged them in the editor's draft. 

>4a. Discussed the categories themselves... 

On second thought, I think it is natural that current categories are 
something insufficient because best practices and guidelines are a kind of 
the finishing touches that require something that is not born yet. So, I 
leave categories appendix as it is in the editors draft. Just I added an 
editor's note of a teleconference comment. 


Addison, I think we can already make a priority for our activities for the 
present. Personally, the following is my understanding about priority. If 
it is incorrect, please fix it. 

1. Isolate problems and find possible solutions for language/locale/i18n-context negotiation based on the existent WSUS
2. Continue to collect usage scenarios
3. Generate requirements 
4. Flesh out the existent WSUS


Thanks, 
Kentaroh
