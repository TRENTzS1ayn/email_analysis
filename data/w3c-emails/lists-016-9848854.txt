Thank you for comments. I would like to change the current WD 2.1.1.2 and 
2.1.2.2 descriptions into the following descriptions. 

begin>>
2.1.1.2
SOAP is used for XML messages exchanging data among service nodes. Because 
all XML [XML] processors must be able to read entities in both the UTF-8 
[RFC2279] and UTF-16 [RFC2781] encodings, SOAP bindings and interfaces 
must handle both UTF-8 and UTF-16 unicode encodings. In order to use 
interoperable encoding among service nodes, UTF-8 or UTF-16 are used for 
SOAP message. The Character Model for the World Wide Web [CHARMOD] 
document describes Unicode usage guidelines and considerations on the Web. 


2.1.2.2
XML Japanese profile document [XML-JP] describes considerations about an 
ambiguities in code conversion between Unicode and non-Unicode encodings. 
<<end

If there are no comments to change the phrases, I will update the editor's 
copy. 

Thanks, 
Kentaroh
