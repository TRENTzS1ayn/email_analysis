Hi Kentaroh,

Thanks for your note. Some minor commentary below.

I agree.

Actually, I think we should leave the existing triage alone until we 
have something better. As I've noted, though, the categories I chose 
were very rough distinctions and based on past discussions.

That's better, I think.

Just so, although #1 includes aspects of both #2 and #3 in the specific 
area of interest. I think what we're saying is that, while we won't 
ignore other usage scenarios, we won't be actively working on them at 
the moment (unless there is a compelling reason to do so).

As an aside, perhaps we should make a list of W3C WS recommendations in 
progress and each of us take one or two and review them quickly for i18n 
issues. So we don't have more surprises like SOAP 1.2...?

Just a thought.
