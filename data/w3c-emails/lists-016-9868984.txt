Kentaroh-san,
Thank you for considering my comments.

[XML-JP] is an excellent summary of problems we face today but it does not suggest
a solution to them.  Perhaps we should suggest something better beyond pointing
to this document (if we can come up with somethinig better:-)

I would like to share my recent "discovery".  Our field peple told me that
there are PDA-type or embeded device SOAP clients in Japan that only support 
Shift_JIS !
This is obviously violation of XML spec, but the reality is such
devices exist.  The manufactures probably chose to violate the spec because
of the resource constraints.  Should we mention such situation?
