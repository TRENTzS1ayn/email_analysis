My understanding is that 'use utf-8' is a solution. I think
we are already proposing that. The other solution that XML-JP
is proposing is to register separate 'charset' labels for
each of the variants. I think there was an attempt for actual
registration, but it hasn't been followed through. Do you think
that would be a solution? Another solution would be to get the
various system vendors to adjust their conversion tables.

Can you tell us any examples? If you don't want to tell everybody,
can you tell me personally? I would like to contact the manufacturers
and talk with them.

I think mentioning is okay, but we have to be careful how we do it.
