Martin,

> My understanding is that 'use utf-8' is a solution. 

I would be a solution in the future where all the data are created
in Unicode to begin with.  Currently, most users would create
their flat text in Shift_JIS or EUC-JP, and there will be conversion
involved somewhere if we recommend UTF-8.
When the source document is a legacy encoding, transmitting
it in its encoding decreases data loss IMHO.

Let me find out and I'll get back to  you.
