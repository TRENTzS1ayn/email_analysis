I think that the WSUS focuses on making scenarios rather than suggesting 
solutions. Some possible solutions may be described in the requirement 
document. Could you please post your solution to the mailing list?

My understanding is as well. So far, using utf-8 is a realistic solution 
for encoding interoperability in the Web Services.

If the WSUS describes a deviation scenario from existent specifications, I 
don't think that we can describe the problems and their solutions. If the 
point on your opinion is about resource constraints of PDA style devices, 
please post your scenarios about PDA-type or embedded device SOAP clients.
