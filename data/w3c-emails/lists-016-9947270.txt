Dear Taks Force,

I'll be attending the WSDL and WS Architecture WG meetings next
week in Scottsdale, AZ. The main purpose of my attendance is to
create contacts with the Web Services community and to help them
understand our work. I'll give a short intro to our work in the
joint session on Wednesday morning.

If you have any specific points you want me to make, any
specific people you think I should talk to, and so on,
I would apreciate your input.

Regards,     Martin.
