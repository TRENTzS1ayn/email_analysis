Hello Bjoern,

I decided to create an issue for this, even though it may
not require any changes.

mostly agreed.

why should it say so? In that case, you should not really use
%-escaping in an IRI, you should use real characters.

(B, I prefer to make them unconvertable.

Exactly. There are definitely URIs that have escape sequences that
don't match UTF-8. There are examples in the latest version of the
draft. It can be pretty frequent that e.g. some part is UTF-8 based,
but another is not (e.g. the path is not, but the query part is, or
the other way round) In order to be able to use IRIs as a replacement
for URIs, we cannot have URIs that cannot be expressed as IRIs.

As for raw data, any actual examples I know support your oppinion
(e.g. the data: URI), but still people are bringing this case up
too often to just ignore it.

IRIs are a sequence of characters, correct. The same way that URIs
are a sequence of characters. A %-escape sequence is three characters,
both for IRIs and for URIs. This was discussed (for the URI side)
at length on www-tag. I don't know of any part of the draft where
IRIs are defined as "sequence of characters, intermixed with abitrary
octets after unescaping %-escapes". There is only one place where
such a construct is used, in the mapping from URIs to IRIs, in
an intermediate stage.

Do you think there is a need for any clarifications to the draft?
If yes, where?


Regards,    Martin.
