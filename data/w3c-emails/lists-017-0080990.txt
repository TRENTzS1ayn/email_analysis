Hello Paul,

Sorry for the delay, I was traveling.

I have removed the reference to iso-8859-1, although I have
left the text as "escaping is not based on UTF-8" rather than
"escaping is not encoded as UTF-8".

I hope this is okay with you, and I'm closing the issue.
Please tell me if you don't like it, and want the issue kept open.


Regards,    Martin.
