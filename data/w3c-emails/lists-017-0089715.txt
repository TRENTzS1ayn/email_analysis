This serves to close

I had put this issue on the issues list because in examples
7-9 of the BidiExamples page
(http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/BidiExamples),
I saw Arabic-Indic digits in the Arabic examples rather
than the European digits that I was expecting.

Further examination has shown that this is a browser issue.
Netscape 7 (/Mozilla) is the only browser that I have found
that converts digit shapes when displaying them. Tango,
IE6, Safari, and Opera don't change digit shapes.

Section 13.3 (http://www.unicode.org/book/ch13.pdf, p. 320)
of Unicode 3.0 is clear that nominal behavior (not changing
the glyphs used to display the digits) is correct, and
using national digit shaping would only be acceptable if
using the deprecated and strongly discouraged numeric
shape selectors (which I have of course not used).
So Netscape/Mozilla is wrong here, and should be fixed.
I have told somebody in the i18n team at Netscape.

I have added a note at the top of the BidiExamples page
saying that a browser doing digit shaping correctly should
be used. I have closed this issue.

Regards,    Martin.
