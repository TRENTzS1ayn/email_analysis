Hello Rasha,

Many thanks for your comments.

I have a Japanese system, and don't remember having made such
a system setting. And you seem to imply that if such a system
setting is present, all the digits would appear as Arabic
digits. Fortunately for me, that's not the case. Even on the page
in question (http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/BidiExamples),
only digits in vicinity of Arabic characters change shape.
I'm not sure what the rule/algorithm is that Netscape uses for this.
I don't like undefined (and therefore unpredictable and varying)
behavior.

Who made up this rule? Unicode clearly states otherwise, as I already
have explained (see below). And HTML and XML are based on Unicode.

In my case, IE doesn't, as I have explained before (see below).

I haven't said anything that would deprecate Arabic(-Indic) digits.
Unicode has them, and anybody who wants to use them can use them.
However, I wanted the digits in my page, which are European digits,
to be displayed as European digits, and I think any browser (or other
application, for that matter) that tries to change this behind my
back is doing something wrong.

Regards,    Martin.
