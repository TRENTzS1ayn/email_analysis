Mati,

Thanks for your comments. My comments below.

My experiments on Windows XP-en shows that when the locale is set to 
Arabic/Egypt, IE6 and NN7.02 behave exactly the same as far as 
contextual numeral changes are concerned, i.e. they both perform numeral 
changes.

But when the locale is something other than a bidi one, NN7.02 still 
performs contextual numeral changes while IE6 does not. This seems to be 
what Martin noticed on his Japanese locale Windows.

If the parity with IE6 is what we want, we might change this behavior so 
that the pref item, bidi.numeral, will have a value of  "1" (i.e. 
numeral change occurs) only if the user locale is a bidi one.
