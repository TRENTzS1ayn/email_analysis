Hello Simon,

Sorry for the delay in moving this issue forward.

I see what you mean. It definitely should be qualified. The intent
is NOT to use NFC in all cases. That's why the SHOULD is there.
If there is some underlying data that is not in NFC, then
normalizing to NFC when creating the IRI is a bad idea.
I haven't yet worded this out, but I think that's what the
document should say. Would that remove your concerns?

I think it's not a problem of systems, but a problem of
the individual IRIs. I.e. if there are two user names that
only differ by normalization, then there is no reason not
to use IRIs for all the other users.

I'm currently not convinced we need this text (assuming the
clarifications I outlined at the start of this mail).
IRIs are not normalized at will. If they are normalized
when transcoding from legacy encodings, then the problem
is in the legacy encoding, because the legacy encoding isn't
able to distinguish e.g. the two user names.
In addition, as I have said, creating two user names that
differ only by normalization is a security issue for whoever
created these user names, not an issue for IRIs.
Also, a system that performs authorization based on
user name (alone) is a serious security issue, again not
the fault of IRIs.


Regards,    Martin.
