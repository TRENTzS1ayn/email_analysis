I think so, yes.

If I were to design the system, and knew IRIs couldn't distinguish
between two international words that may be used in customers deployed
systems, I'd be cautious about using IRIs at all.  I'm mostly only
familiar with NFKC and it would generate these hassles, and perhaps
NFC avoids them.

Given clarifications, it would have to be modified, and if the
specification defined the exact situations where normalization is used
more clearly, it could probably be dropped alltogether.

I'm not convinced by this.  Existing deployed solutions, like SASL,
supports all valid UTF-8 strings as user names.  There has been no
warnings presented that administrators should not pick user names that
only differ by normalization.  So if IRIs may arbitrary NFC strings,
it is IRIs that introduce a security problem that wasn't there before.
People would have a problem to start using IRIs without redesigning
their existing systems.

I assumed users are authenticated before the authorization process
starts, which is the case in the systems I'm familiar with.
