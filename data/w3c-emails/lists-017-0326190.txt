I have made the following updates to the IRI draft
and submitted as draft-duerst-iri-05.txt. See
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit for
the newest version, or
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-duerst-iri-05.txt
for the actual publication. This is what I have done:

Changes based on input from Michel Suignard:
- Added a definition for 'running text'
- Removed definition (and a couple usages) of code point/codepoint
- Added explanation for <hh> octet notation used in 3.2.1
   to 1.4 Notation.
- Removed "Note:" from "Note: To reduce variability,
   the hexadecimal notation SHOULD use upper case letters."
- Fixed alignement problem for IRI syntax rule.
- Reorganized some of the text in 3.1 to avoid making
   normative statements in notes, and to have the normative
   statements first. Also, removed reference to previous
   drafts (without changing substance).
- Fixed example "&#x10300;&#x10301;&#x10301;" to
   "&#x10300;&#x10301;&#x10302;"
- Changed production name 'isegment' to 'ipath-segment'
   to make clearer that it is a path segment.
- tweaked language on using NFKC, by replacing
   "Using NFKC will avoid even more problems." with
   "Using NFKC may avoid even more problems,
    for example by choosing half-width Latin letters instead of full-width,
    and full-width Katakana instead of half-width."
- Reworded the paragarph starting "Because we do not know..." that
   explains the overall normalization strategy. Made it less personal,
   and made it a note.
- Uppercased 'SHOULD NOT' in "It SHOULD NOT be applied between
   components that are known to be able to handle IRIs."
- Rewrote "On the other hand, the HTTP URL scheme does not specify
   how to encode original characters, and therefore IRIs only can be
   used for some HTTP URLs." to
- Clarified paragaraph that was saying:
   "As an example of variant settings, input method editors for East
    Asian Languages usually allow the input of Latin letters and related
    characters in full-width or half-width versions. For IRI input, the
    input method editor should be set to half-width input, in order
    to produce US-ASCII characters where possible."
   to make clear to use half-width for Latin, and full-width for Katakana:
   "As an example of variant settings, input method editors for East
    Asian Languages usually allow the input of Latin letters and related
    characters in full-width or half-width versions. For IRI input, the
    input method editor should be set so that it produces half-width
    Latin letters, and full-width Katakana."
- In the next paragraph, changed 'should' to 'may'.
- Removed "Display software should be upgraded only after upgraded
   entry software has been widely deployed to the population that
   will see the displayed result." because it's unclear, and it seems
   the opposite is actually happening.
- Moved a paragraph in the security section.


Other things done:
- Added a reference to http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/ModelConsequences
   to explain why conversion from Unicode to punycode is only applied
   in the position just after //.
- Added a new example 10 in the bidi section based on input from
   Roy Badami (and put him in the acks).
- Updated some references.
- Added something about query parts at the end of 6.4


Regards,   Martin.
