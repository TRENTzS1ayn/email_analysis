I have closed issue URIsyntax-11 at
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit#URIsyntax-11.
I have adapted the syntax to
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-fielding-uri-rfc2396bis-05.txt
and because Roy has said that this is done, I have closed this
issue. Of course, I will reopen it if there are any new changes.
[I have also checked the ABNF with Harald Alvestand's ABNF checker,
and fixed a bug or two.]

Regards,    Martin.
