Yahoo is doing somewhat better, with a hit at #34.

Thanks for considering this. I expect that you are wrong about
searchability improving. That would require the acronym to become
unambiguous or more popular than the other expansions. Other 
people will not rename their institutes or companies because of 
someone else's standard, so the conflicts will remain. And internet
standards have not been the most important documents on the web
for several years.

Expecting searchers to type "internationalized" is unreasonable,
especially considering that a lot of experts have given up on that
and use "i18n" for "internationalization".

I recommend buying ads if you want this term to be found.
