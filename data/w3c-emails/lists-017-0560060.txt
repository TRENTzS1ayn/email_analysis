The new section 5 has been completed for quite a while,
but I didn't get around to close this issue.

You can find the new section 5 at
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/draft-duerst-iri.html#equivalence.
It is closely modeled on section 6 of the new (RFC2396bis) URI draft, which
has been authored by the W3C TAG. It is in the same document (as Paul
wanted it), it is not in an Appendix, which addresses Ted's concerns.


The section about normalization is at:
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/draft-duerst-iri.html#normalization
The text that Paul explicitly asked to be included at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-iri/2003Apr/0026.html
is a note in that section.

Regards,    Martin.
