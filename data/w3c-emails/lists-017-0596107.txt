As a result of discussions in the Unicode technical committee about
tweaks to the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (see issue 13 at
http://www.unicode.org/review/ and the actual draft at
http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/tr9-12.html), Michel Suignard
has suggested making clear in the IRI spec that the provision
for higher-level protocols to be able to change the bidi algorithm
should not be misused to change the display behavior of IRIs.

I have added the following text to the first paragraph in the
section "Logical Storage and Visual Presentation":

 >>>>>>>>
The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (<xref target="UNI9"/>,
Section 4.3) permits higher-level protocols to influence bidirectional
rendering. Such changes by higher-level protocols MUST NOT be used
if they change the rendering of IRIs.
 >>>>>>>>

Please check this in the draft version linked from
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/.

Michel, others, any comments?


Regards,   Martin.
