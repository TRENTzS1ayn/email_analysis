The rest of your mail didn't show up on my (Japanese) mailer.
I went to the archive at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-iri/2004Feb/0002.html
to look at it.

Using the usual 'upper-case for RTL' notation, what I saw was
(in a very crude transliteration):

LI.LSMM.DZVA/MISM://PTTH

I can only identify the first and the last component, which
I think got placed right. The rest got messed up in my opinion.
Following the IRI spec, it should look like:

     MISM/LI.LSMM.DZVA//:PTTH

This is based on the assumption that '/', '.', and ':' are all
weak, and that even the overall LTR direction required for IRIs
doesn't affect the total reordering if everything is RTL.

Could you please clarify how you input this example, and how
it shows up at your end, or how you think it should show up?

The above example of course is currently not allowed, and
would have to be rewritten to show up as:

    http://MISM/LI.LSMM.DZVA


Regards,   Martin.
