I just submitted draft-duerst-iri-06.txt to the Internet-Drafts editor.
You can find it at
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/draft-duerst-iri-06.txt.
I upgraded the syntax to take into account the recent changes to
the URI syntax (RFC2396bis). This has resulted in a reversal of
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/#idnuri-02 (still needs
to be documented), with quite some related edits. Please check.


Regards,    Martin.
