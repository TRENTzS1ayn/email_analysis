Sorry, I said that wrong.  It violates RFC-2616 (HTTP), specifically the
parts of RFC-2616 that are incorporated by reference from RFC-2396.

RFC-2616:

  3.2.1 General Syntax

    For definitive information on URL syntax and semantics, see "Uniform
    Resource Identifiers (URI):  Generic Syntax and Semantics,"
    RFC 2396...  This specification adopts the definitions of ...
    "host", ... from that specification.

  3.2.2 http URL

    http_URL = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]]

RFC-2396:

  A. Collected BNF for URI

    host          = hostname | IPv4address
    hostname      = *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]
    domainlabel   = alphanum | alphanum *( alphanum | "-" ) alphanum
    toplabel      = alpha | alpha *( alphanum | "-" ) alphanum
    IPv4address   = 1*digit "." 1*digit "." 1*digit "." 1*digit

http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes

Each scheme is defined in its own document, except for the ones that
haven't been updated since RFC-1738.
