Hmm. And given that /source/ now points at the wrong branch we should
probably try to document the CVS branch practice.

FYI Ger, CVS HEAD is now "unstable" and stabilization towards a release
goes onto a branch. Currently we're at "validator-0_6_0-branch", with 0.6.1
(CVS Tag "validator-0_6_1-release) just out the door and, it looks like, a
0.6.2 release soon to follow.
