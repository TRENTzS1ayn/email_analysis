Terje just pointed this one at me.  I just looked at it.

Bj?rn reports an alleged bug.  I'm not convinced, and commented:


  The bug report seems to me to be in error.  Or, more specifically, it
  hinges  on whether unescaped ? is allowed in a QUERY_STRING.  It may be
  unsafe(?), but is AFAICS nevertheless legal, so ISTM SP is working
  correctly, and the bug is in the serverside script.

  Lynx agrees:

  [nick@jarl nick]$ lynx -dump -source 
  http://www.bjoernsworld.de/cgi-bin/dtd.pl?bj%f6rn
  <!ELEMENT foo (bar)>
  <!---->
  [nick@jarl nick]$ lynx -dump -source 
  http://www.bjoernsworld.de/cgi-bin/dtd.pl?bj%c3%b6rn
  <!ELEMENT foo (bar)>
  <!ELEMENT bar EMPTY>

  If someone can convince me otherwise, I could patch it fairly easily to
  escape 8-bit URIs, but I fear that could introduce serious bugs when
  working with a 16-bit charset.  So at the very least I'd have to ask on
  openjade-devel.

Bj?rn is basically saying that OpenSP should have escaped the first URL
to the second.  AFAICS it would not be wrong to do so, but neither is
it required.  Who is right?
