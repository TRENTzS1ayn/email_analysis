There is a U+00F6 (LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS), URIS most not
contain non-ASCII characters, see e.g. section 2.4 of RFC 2396.

Well, it's a normative requirement of XML 1.0, and actually using UTF-8
for disallowed characters in URIs *is* commonsense, you'll find a
similar section in HTML 4.01 (appendix B.2.1), take a look at 

  http://www.w3.org/International/O-URL-and-ident.html

The requirement in XML 1.0 is however only for the system identifier and
there are XML processors that implement it the way the recommendation
wants it, e.g.
