As you may have noticed, I fixed an old bug in checklink today, which
caused it to recurse *everywhere* if the submitted URI didn't have a
slash after the hostname, eg. <http://validator.w3.org>.  I also tested
it by running against v.w.o and fixed some broken links while at it.

Since checklink is distributed with validator, I'd like to see 0.6.2
soon, as well as live on v.w.o.

All changes to checklink are at the moment in the 0_6_0 branch of
validator, HEAD is outdated.  There's no "experimental" version of
checklink ATM, so I prefer to keep the newest version in a branch that
is closest to the running production release.  Checklink needs some
refactoring, though, the code is actually pretty hairy; that will most
likely happen in HEAD (or wherever the dev branch is) sometime.

As discussed before, this is not a "must have", we can generate apt
indexes offsite, they're transferable.

I'm fine with this.

Oh, and a cleanup suggestion: could the following files be 'cvs rm'd
from dev.w3.org; they're outdated and add unnecessary confusion in the
validator tarballs.  Remember, "cvs rm" doesn't *delete* the files,
they're still accessible in CVS' Attic dirs, and can be easily restored
if need be.
