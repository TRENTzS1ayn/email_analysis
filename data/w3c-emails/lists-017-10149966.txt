That wouldn't be too hard.  It's a pretty standard Perl technique.

The first of those is straightforward, though I'd prefer something
like "80 instances of 3 errors".  The second would require us to devise
some appropriate abbreviation for every each error message, and is
likely to lead to (at best) confusing reports, so I wouldn't recommend
trying it.
