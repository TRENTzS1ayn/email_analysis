I'm about to tag Beta 3 in CVS. Below are proposed release notes.


The big issue that needs discussion is the XML Output. Stay or go?

I have an updated version
<URL:http://mail.tj.unn.no/check?uri=www.vir.si;output=xml> that includes a
Document Type Declaration and an XSLT Stylesheet (thanks to Nick). I'm more
comfortable comitting to supporting this version -- allthough it's most
definitely labelled "Beta"! -- considering it won't likely be very
interesting to most people if I get the SOAP interface in in 0.7.0.

But my "liability" on this thing is zero so y'all W3Cers are invited to
"veto" it's release if you feel it necessary. I'm still somewhat ambivalent
about it. The XML output has sorta just grown happenstance instead of being
"designed" as such, so while I'm reasonably comfortable with it's current
state, experience suggests there are pitfalls lurking in there too.

Unless some discussion happens, it will be released by default!


Pre-Release Notes -- still in need of some grammar and spelling love:

-- cut here
The following changes and new features:

* The error message when the configuration file is not found is now
  much clearer.
* The XML Output is now much improved, and nominally at Beta status.
* Many spelling, captialization, and grammar fixes.
* The DOCTYPE override will now replace the orginal DOCTYPE instead
  of always inserting it at the beginning fo the file.
* Sample code in output and documentation has been updated.
* More error messages now take into account whether file upload or
  normal processing was done.
* Output layout has changed to adress usability concerns.
* Many POST requests are now redirected to a GETable URL when possible.
* Perl version 5.6.0 is now the minimum required version.
* The jump links in output are now context sensitive.
* We're now excrisiatingly up fromt about SP's limitations with XML.
* More links to external resources (thanks to Liam Quinn and the WDG).
* We now allow the pedantically correct /referrer as well as /referer. :-)
* Many output-escaping fixes and entity reference related fixes.
