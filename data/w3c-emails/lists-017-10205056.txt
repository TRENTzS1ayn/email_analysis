Damn, I just had an idea :)

The logvalidator is (unfortunately, libwww is a pain sometimes...) not 
so easy to install, and since I believe it's a cool service, I'd be 
tempted to create an online version : people would upload a log file 
(could be big, though...), fill in a few necessary fields, and voila!

(or maybe I should package libwww and all necessary libs with the 
logvalidator library...)

Besides, that'd be a replacement for a recursive validator, which we're 
not likely to provide soon.

Thoughts? Worth working on?
