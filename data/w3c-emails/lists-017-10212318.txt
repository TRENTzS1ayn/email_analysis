Nick,

I think this is a good question, and I believe this is an important 
problem that I (or Dom), as "staff contact" for the qa dev projects, 
should handle.

I Need, however, to know more about the situation before going forward.

I believe we run a CVS server for sgml-lib, at least, on dev.w3.org
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/validator/htdocs/sgml-lib/

Are we talking about the same thing, and are you suggesting we move 
this to qa-dev?
If "yes", then I think it should remain on dev, see below.

If we want the WGs to contribute (which I think is a good idea, BTW), 
then we should use dev, where all the staff contacts for WGs have write 
access.

Staff contacts and chairs should probably be our primary target if we 
are to ask WG to cooperate (more) closely with us about DTD and schemas 
releases.
