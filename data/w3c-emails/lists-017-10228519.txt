I think Olivier means that LogValidator isn't too easy to install; it has
some dependancies and it's partially implemented as a module and not a
"script". LWP is merely "moderately hard" to install. :-)

I agree. This is more a tool for use behind a firewall and on the internet
then on the Internet or provided by the W3C. Even though I'm sure there
would be interest for it, it encourages unsafe practices and careless
treatement of sensitive data.

Always worth working on if you can spare the time; especially if a localy
installable version could be produced. But for a recursive Validator, I
think the time would be better spent on actually producing a recursive
Validator. :-)

And it isn't necessarily that far off. Depending on when we decide to
feature freeze 0.7.0 it could go in as early as that or in the next version
after 0.7.0 (1.0?). Of course, it may also not make it in this side of the
heat death of the universe... :-)
