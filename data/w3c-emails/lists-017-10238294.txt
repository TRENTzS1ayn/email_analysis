Yep, but libwww was explicitly mentioned to be "a pain sometimes"...

Anyway, IMO it's the configuration of the LogValidator that is a bit
painful; installation is just the usual "perl Makefile.PL && make
install".

Perhaps the LogValidator (and Validator, checklink etc) could be
distributed via CPAN so eg. CPAN.pm and friends could take care of the
dependencies?
