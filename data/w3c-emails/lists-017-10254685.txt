We have discussed this on IRC, but for the record, I'd want at least 
the EARL and n3 (and of course HTTP) to stay. And I think it's OK to 
keep the XML output, even if this means we have to keep it as a beta 
feature in a stable product.

I'm quite disappointed by the relative lack of feedback on these 
various outputs, but I think we should proceed.

ex-what? My dear friend dict -v doesn't know this either, it seems :)
and s/fromt/front/ I assume.

Very good work done with this beta so far, I'm proud of being part of 
this.
