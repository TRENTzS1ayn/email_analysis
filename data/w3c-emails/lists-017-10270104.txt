Interesting. Being a "download, make, make install" person, I confess 
my ignorance about CPAN semi-automated mechanisms. Really interesting, 
I should look at this and update the doc.

I also plan to make it CPAN package (I believe it's CPAN compliant, or 
almost, already), especially if it helps installation.

Yes, I understand this. I've been thinking about it, and even though 
there would be a few "tricks" to make it look safe (upload via https, 
clear statement of our policy, etc), it doesn't look *quite* right.

I meant "make available in the same repository", not in the same 
package :)
But that may be pointless anyway.

Given the answers (thanks!), I probably should rather work on the 
install documentation and help on a recursive validator.

Thanks.
