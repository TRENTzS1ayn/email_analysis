Outstanding, thanks Olivier!

BTW, could we quickly get some sort of consensus on what policy to have for
this; in re who gets to have accounts and what "products" are hosted there
(cf. Bj?rn's message)?

I'd say "Public" means _Public_ and we should let everyone at it to file
bugs; if we run into trouble with people spamming it or closing open issues
etc. that's soon enough to start looking at locking it down a bit.

And hosting the CSS Validator bug database there seems the natural fit to
me (regardless of whether this is "QA Run" or "W3C Run", the CSS Validator
falls into both categories). This would also mean we could have MarkUp
Validator bugs depend on CSS Validator fixes (*chough*DOCTYPEs*chough*) and
vice versa.

The sooner that gets set up the better IMO, and the sooner Bugzilla's
existance is announced to www-validator likewise!
