This has now been updated:
  - fixed bug in mod_xml's Xalan-1.4 bindings that was causing
    larger reports in HTML and EARL formats to break down.
  - Added web browser based validator.

If noone on qa-dev is interested in this, I'd now be comfortable
announcing it to a wider audience on www-validator.  Is there
an official policy concerning where I can/can't announce
something like this?
