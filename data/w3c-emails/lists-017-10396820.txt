IF QA doesn't want to take over the responsibility for a separate DTD
collection, lets, for 0.7.0 onward, move the sgml-lib/ out of htdocs/ and
up to the top-level $CVSROOT/validator/share/dtds/ or somesuch.

Good idea; lets do that...   ...he said, knowing full well the "Build
Tarball" Bug is assigned to him in Bugzilla. :-)

Cool. As soon as you close or reschedule the two bugs (#70 and #72, IIRC)
I'll tag the release in CVS and build tarballs so you can get started on
the RPMs. BTW, weren't you supposed to check in the spec file? Or do we
wait for 0.7.0 and the CVS reorg to do that?
