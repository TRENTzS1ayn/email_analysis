Ok.

Will take a look right now.

The spec file will have to wait.  First, I need to see the tarballs
before creating the RPMs (chicken-egg-chicken...), and second, we
require (?) OpenSP 1.5 which will need some spanking to get RPM'd (it's
bundled with OpenJade currently on RH8 so both of them need to be
repackaged and watched closely in order to not break anything).

This doesn't mean that there wouldn't be RPMs of 0.6.0, I do intend to
roll 'em a bit later.

Terje, I'll ping you when I'm finished with my open bugz.
