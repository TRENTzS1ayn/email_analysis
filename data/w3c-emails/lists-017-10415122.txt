I do realise the pace has accellerated somewhat and that there simply may
not have been time for the relevant feedback to appear yet. But I also
think we're overall in sufficiently good shape to release and am planning
for an interrim release (0.6.1) to deal with anything that got left out.

If anyone thinks I'm pushing it by going to release now, you'd better start
screaming very loudly right about now! :-)
