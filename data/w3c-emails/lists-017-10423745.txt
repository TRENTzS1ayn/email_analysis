Ok. As you've seen from your CCs; since the OpenJade project doesn't have a
packager for RPM I've sort of nominated you for the task. Given you were
doing RPMs anyways and the differences are pretty much zero AFAICT, I hoped
you wouldn't mind?

Tim Waugh used to do Red Hat RPMs of OpenJade/OpenSP, but I suspect it'll
be a while before they move to OpenSP 1.5 and OpenJade 1.3.2 so...
