I'd like to see an explicit Request for Comments on XML/N3/EARL output
(with some introduction, an example, pointer at documentation). I think
many people just overlooked it. Maybe a general Last Call for Comments
(including the above) would be fair, with a deadline 2002/12/01 for
example, just like LC WDs do.
