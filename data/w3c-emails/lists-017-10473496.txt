Ok, I've tagged validator-0_6_0-release in CVS and built tarballs from it.
Tarballs are at <URL:http://validator.w3.org/validator-0_6_0.tar.gz> and
<URL:http://validator.w3.org/sgml-lib-0_6_0.tar.gz>.

"validator-0_6_0-release" will track the release and must be moved up if
any last minute changes are made.

There is also a "validator-0_6_0-branch" where maintenance on the 0.6.0
release is done (moving towards 0.6.1, say).


Nominally this also means that the trunk is open for new development in the
direction of 0.7.0 (IOW, your new config parser can go in whenever you feel
like it Ville). :-)

Expect the trunk to become periodically broken from now on.

society as the fundamental right to make smart-ass remarks.   -- Katie @ AtAT
