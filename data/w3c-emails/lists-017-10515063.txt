Here is a first draft (basically, the announcement is a re-write of the
beta announcement, and the relnotes come from the "what's new" page on
:8001 ) Comments much welcome, but rapidly, we're going to move forward
real soon (I'm talking hours here...).

  better internationalization support, and much more...

** R E L E A S E   N O T E S **

Changes for this version include: 


- Improved design of layout, including for Validation results. 
Output has also been reworked to be easier to understand.

- New feature : Tip-of-the-Day.

- Many accessibility fixes, both to the web site and the Result page.

- Major internal restructuring. The code has undergone significant
  refactoring with many benefits. It is more readable and easier to
  understand, much more robust, much improved security, more modular,
  and performance should be significantly better. There is tentative
  support for running under mod_perl (leading to even greater
  performance enhancements) and memory consumption should be much
  improved.

- Many new document types are supported and support for some existing
  document types has been improved. 
  Notable changes and additions include:

    * Support for MathML is back in good shape.
    * Support for application/xhtml+xml.
    * Support for XHTML+MathML and XHTML+MathML+SVG.
    * Support for SVG and image/svg+xml.
    * Support for XHTML 1.0 Second Edition and XHTML 1.1.
