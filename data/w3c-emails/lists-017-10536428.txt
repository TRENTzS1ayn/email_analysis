Eek, the new checklink doc page is broken at
<http://validator.w3.org/docs/checklink.html>, it's not using SSI at all
:(

Could someone make it executable (I guess XBitHack is in use at v.w.o?)

And someone with shell access to the server could perhaps change its
permissions in the repo as well to prevent this from happening again...

Thanks,
