Hi,

Following Terje's request, I've investigated a bit why our public
Bugzilla wasn't sending emails, and still following Terje's lucid
advices, I changed the configuration of the email queue handling.

Indeed, http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84876 seems to imply
that Bugzilla doesn't go well with Postfix when email queuing is set.

I simply unset it and it seems to work. One of the drawback is that it
can slow down bugzilla, according to the configuration documentation.
Would our bugzilla set up be too slow, we should try to remember this :)
