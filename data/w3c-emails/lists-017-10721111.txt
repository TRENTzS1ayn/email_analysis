Hello Ville,

Just to make sure that I understand what's going on:

my original version was:
    return $encodingA && $encodingB && $encodingA ne $encodingB;
your first version was:
    return $encodingA && $encodingB and $encodingA ne $encodingB;
your current version is:
    return (($encodingA && $encodingB) and ($encodingA ne $encodingB));

I think that my original version was correct, yes?
I don't understand why you want to make a difference between
the first logical 'and' and the second logical 'and', both
are equivalent.

I would therefore prefer to either return to the original version,
or to write it as:
    return ($encodingA and $encodingB and $encodingA ne $encodingB);
or maybe
    return ($encodingA and $encodingB and ($encodingA ne $encodingB));
or
    return $encodingA && $encodingB && ($encodingA ne $encodingB);
to make the structure clearer.

Please change it to your preferred version.

Please note that I may change this again; I'm thinking about
distinguishing 'undef' and empty string, to catch cases such
as <?xml version='1.0' encoding=''?>

Regards,    Martin.
