Hi,

Reading the thread(s) about the latest cvs commits, I was thinking it 
would be much better if people answering cvs commit messages on this 
list could amend the subject to say what actually the message is about 
(or we could have made the validator-cvs list archived and not created 
this list...)

On a general basis I'd also suggest that we tag messages specific to 
one of the tools in the subject, e.g
[HTMLvalidator] Why did you split this subroutine?

I don't really care whether the tags are consistent (to me, [HTML] and 
[check] and [HTMLvalidator] would mean the same thing), I just would 
like to make archives readable and easy to search...

Thanks.
