Make sure that you're running Liam Quinn's lq-nsgmls (from
<http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/src/lq-sp-1.3.4.9.tar.gz>),
it's required nowadays for some additional security fixes, I guess.

Alternatively, you can use the normal nsgmls, just remove '-R' from its
options (look for @xmlflags) in the validator source.

Hmm, perhaps the possible "-R" should be part of the "SGML Parser"
config var in validator.conf instead of being hardcoded in the script...
