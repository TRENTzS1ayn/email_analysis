I just found that http://validator.w3.org:8188/docs/errors.html#bad-char
is totally outdated. Anybody wants to fix it?

 x non SGML character number ### x 

     You've used an illegal character in your text. HTML uses the standard 
ISO8859-1 character encoding, and ISO8859-1 leaves undefined 65 character 
codes (0 to 31 inclusive and 127 to 159 inclusive); the validator has found 
one of these undefined characters in your document. The character may 
appear on your browser as a curly quote, or a trademark symbol, or some 
other fancy glyph; on a different computer, however, it will likely appear 
as a completely different character, or nothing at all.

     Your best bet is to replace the character with the nearest equivalent 
ASCII character, or to use an appropriate character entity. For more 
information on ISO8859-1, see Alan Flavell's excellent ISO8859-1/HTML 
reference.

     This error can also be triggered by formatting characters embedded in 
documents by some word processors. If you use a word processor to edit your 
HTML documents, be sure to use the "Save as ASCII" or similar command to 
save the document without formatting information.
 x `####' is not a valid character number x 

     You'll get several occurrences of this error if you use the Cougar 
DTD. Cougar uses the 16-bit UCS-4 (a.k.a. "Unicode") character set instead 
of the 8-bit ISO8859-1 character set used by HTML 2.0 and HTML 3.2. It also 
defines mnemonic entities for various Unicode characters; for instance, the 
entity &trade; is defined as the character entity &#8482;, which is the 
Unicode trademark character. Unfortunately, the nsgmls executable used by 
the validator does not appear to have 16-bit character support compiled in, 
and so it chokes on these 16-bit character entities.

     These errors are not produced by anything in your document and should 
not otherwise affect the validation of your document, so you can pretty 
much ignore them.
