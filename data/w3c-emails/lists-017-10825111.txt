Woops! My bad.

There is a reason why Perl has two logical AND operators with different
precendence; one of them being exactly to cut down on paranthesis. And my
personal Perl Style Guide demands "and" over "&&" where possible to enable
the code to read more like a English sentence (without going to extremes;
I'm not a candyfloss-language fan!), to cut down on the amount of
punctuation, and to use the loosest binding (lowest precendence) operator
that will do the job.
