Nope, not at all. :-)

My comments about spelling changes was related to capitalization of terms.
e.g. I tend to capitalize "Validate" and "Validator" to stress the fact
that these are terms with special meaning outside of their normal English
meaning. I'm ready to be convinced this is a Bloody Stupid[tm] thing to do,
but I'd prefer if y'all didn't define them as simple typos and "fix" them
willy-nilly. Convince me it's stupid (so I stop putting them in) and lets
fix _all_ of them in one go if we're to change them at all. Consistency and
all that... :-)
