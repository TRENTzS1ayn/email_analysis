I don't really see what the "public-" bit is for; have you, or do you
intend to, set up a _private_-qa-dev? I've always been vaguely annoyed by
the "www-foo" names, but at least "www" is easy to type...

Oooh. Let me guess. The "public-" bit is so that Members[tm] recall that
what they say is actually going to be read by The Community[tm] (aka. "The
Unwashed Masses")? :-)
