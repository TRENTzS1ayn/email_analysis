So was I, actually. I have a little more time to deal with validator 
work in the weeks to come, so if I'm needed I should be more responsive.

However, since I'm not (yet) involved in the coding, I shouldn't be a 
showstopper for, at least, proceeding to beta test status.

I don't have a very clear vision of all the issues (the ones I can 
think of are character entities, missing DTDs, logos?... and those may 
have been fixed already, I have some mail backlog to finish). As a 
sidenote, during the QA Team face-to-face I received the AI to work on 
completing and (semi)-automating the "test" suite for the validator. 
(will talk about this in another mail, later)

Agreed.

I wonder if it will benefit from an "official" voice (e.g calls for 
reviews sent with a W3 address) and if it needs any "coverage", i.e if 
we should ask the comm to talk about it. I'm tempted to think the 
answer to the former might be "yes", whereas comm coverage can wait for 
the "real update". I'm wishing to hear other opinions, though.

I like the date. We'll have a W3C members meeting around mid-nov, and 
there is at least one big web conf around these dates, a a new release 
would be a perfect time to try and push for more use of the validator.

I like the ideas. templating the messages is a good move, It may 
attract people wishing to improve the "user experience" with translated 
messages (in en_newbie or other languages). "modularizing" a bit seems 
like a reasonable move too.

I'm totally in favour to these ideas, provided that (as you mentioned) 
we branch the code in order to allow bug fixes of the prod version a 
little more often than real "releases".
