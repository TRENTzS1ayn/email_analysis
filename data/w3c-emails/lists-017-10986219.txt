I have several reservations about using XSLT. Apart from a general dislike
for that way of doing things, my experience is that the current crop of
tools aren't up to the task.

IOW, a lot of people will have to talk very fast to convince me to use
anything but HTML::Template (or the equivalent). :-)


At least for the first cut I think HTML::Template is necessary if for no
other reason then because I'm familiar with it and I'm definitely not
familiar with XSLT. IOW, using XSLT would carry significant overhead while
I familiarized myself with it and slow development down.
