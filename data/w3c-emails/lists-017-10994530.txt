D'oh, there were some key words missing from my post.  The SSI mechanism
should work just fine when proxied, but I have a hunch that the relative
links contained in them, eg. in header.html won't, unless practically
everything in v.w3.org is proxied.  Haven't really thought about this
too much, but redirection seems more hassle-free to me.

Sounds good to me.  Maybe a good start would be to add the checklink doc
page into docs/checklink.html (maybe it's better under docs/), and
adding an entry into docs/index.html.

I don't currently have a publicly accessible site available for
protoing; the new dev box would be very much welcome...
