It seems like a pretty big change to the IRI concept to have
IRI -> URI transformations use scheme-specific knowledge.
Formerly, IRI -> URI transformation was specified as scheme
independent.

I understand that this seems necessary because of IDN, but
it's a big concern.

And to use "SHOULD" would leave us subject to
the indeterminate knowledge of which method is going to
be used.

If you believe that IRI->URI needs to be scheme specific,
then is it really tractable to define IRI as a generic concept?
Do we need a separate spec for "http:", "mailto:", "ftp:" IRIs,
where each specifies the punycode vs. hex-encoding of the
various parts? For example, a 'data' IRI might need a separate
specification for the default MIME type (since text/plain
defaults US-ASCII). And an IRI URN might also have a
different mapping, etc.
