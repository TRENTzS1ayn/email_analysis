As said on IRC, after discussion with Martin on the  i18n code, "go 
ahead".
Let's give ourselves 24 hours for details (e.g announcement, choosing 
targets etc) and do it.

I think I'd also post a note (maybe not the full announcement, but a 
link to it) to the EO list (public-evangelist), plus (obviously) the 
W3C team.

I don't want to carry the message that the validator is not reliable.

I'd rather avoid the word "design". Discussing the UI will be 
interesting, but I don't really want people to argue to death about 
colour, shapes, style etc.
