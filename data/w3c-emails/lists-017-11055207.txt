First, thanks Terje for coming up with the initial text.

Here are the changes I'm planning to make

I'm not a fan of legalese verbiage, but I think the following would be 
more appropriate for an official announcement:

This is a public beta test of the new version before it is released in 
production. This implies that the code is _not_ ready for use in a 
production environment. If you are making a "Mission Critical" use of 
the validator you should not rely on this beta version. On a more 
general note, please remember that the Markup validator software and 
service are provided as is and with no warranty.


>     * The new design for the web interface and the website.

becomes :
  * The new web site and user interface.

I will use this version (unless someone strongly objects) for the 
announcements to w-v and www-html, then will drop a note to other w3c 
lists, and will contact a few people (including the WASP).

Terje, can I ask you to take care of the people/lists you know 
personnally? I can post to newsgroups, but will have to set up a news 
client first (as I said, been a while...).

Now may or may not be an appropriate moment for that, but I sincerely 
thank everyone for their work, making this long-awaited move possible...

Thanks.
