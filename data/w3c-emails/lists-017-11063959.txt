Yup; as I mentioned, the ones in the last group I intend to notify
personally. I just mentioned them "FYI" so y'all know where the
announcement goes.

I'm going to assume Nick will pick up on the announcement when you send it
to w-v and send it (adapted if/as necessary) to ciwah and whatever other
newsgroups seems appropriate. Perhaps the uk.* web groups?

Hmmm. How about the HWG? Since Gerald volunteers(-ed?) as a listadmin+ over
there, he could perhaps suggest and/or post to whatever lists are
appropriate there?

thanks Olivier!
