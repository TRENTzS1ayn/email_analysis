I think we'll have to verify and check the test.

A test can be an invalid HTML file or a valid HTML file. So we'll 
have correct and incorrect file so this is the association of URIs + 
Result which will be meaningful.

1=ValidY= Success
0=InvalidN= Failed
validityValidatorPassed
---------------------------------------------------
  uri10  0Y
  uri2   1  1Y
  uri301N
  uri410N

This Test suite is crucial for the reliability of the HTML validator 
for different reasons:
People who own website
TR/ space at W3C, the HTML validator is one of his main tool.

I think a mention, when the validator is released, must be made about 
the fact that it has been verified against the Test Suite xxx.

A mini process for TS should be done too. Something light but that 
will help to maintain the test files.
