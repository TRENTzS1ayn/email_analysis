Hi.

As suggested by Karl, I tried to add a [beta] flag to the title/banner 
of the beta service.

Unfortunately I'm yet to be familiar with CVS tagging, and I think I 
commited only to the HEAD, but not to the 0.6.0-beta.
I, therefore, didn't update the files on :8001.

If someone can fix my mistake, thanks in advance :)
