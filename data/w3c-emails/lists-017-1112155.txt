Hello Roy, others,

As proposed, I have added an additional example (example 10) in
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/draft-duerst-iri-06.txt
(and also in http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/BidiExamples).

I'm herewith closing this issue
(http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/#bidiDigits-18).
Please tell me if you think that's not enough
(and in that case, if possible, what else is needed).

Regards,   Martin.
