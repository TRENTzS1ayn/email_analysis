Hi,

Is it possible to fill a page with each time a bug has been filed by 
someone on the list.

Number: ex: 2002-10-21-01
Name of the Bug Submitter
Link the mail in the archives
Title: abstract of the prob.
Resolution: to fill later, link to the mail which explains the resolutions.

Maybe it's already in place but it could help to avoid to have to 
explain a multiple time the same things.

What do you think? too complex?
