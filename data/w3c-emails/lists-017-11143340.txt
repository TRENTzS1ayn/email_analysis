Possible? Yes. But...

If we're to have this -- and I do think it would be a very very good idea
-- the two options I see are:

    1) a W3C general but public Bugzilla, or...
    b) a Validator-specific Bugzilla.

You could of course use some other bug tracking tool, but Bugzilla seems
suitable. The main point is that we need some real bug/issue tracking
system. Not some manually updated web page or our own cobbled together CGI
scripts.

If push comes to shove, I can probably find a box and set it up here. But I
don't know that I can committ to hosting "The W3C Validator Bug Tracker" on
a permanent basis.
