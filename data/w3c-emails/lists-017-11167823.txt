Well, it's unlikely to be ready in time to be any use in this beta test,
but otherwise it's a good idea.

Changes are fine so long as they are "conservative". :8001 is subscribed to
validator-0_6_0-beta so changes on HEAD won't affect it until we move that
tag up with "cvs tag -F validator-0_6_0-beta".

This one takes some thinking I, uhm, "think" because it messes with the
somwhat hairy code that generates the table in the output, but if you think
it'll be low or zero-impact go ahead and commit a fix,

And lands smack dab in the middle of the frightening mess that is
"serialize_table" and friends. :-(

Knock yourself out.

I have lobbied for the update and improvement of SGML. I've done it for years.
I consider it the jewel for which XML is a setting.  It does deserve a bit or
polishing now and then.                                        -- Len Bullard
