I think perhaps restructuring CVS may be a good idea in any case. The
current CVS reflects a "dump" of a server layout that hasn't been relevant
for some time now (in particular, the httpd.conf is way out of sync with
reality), and I know Ville has some good ideas in this area.

It's not really necessary of course; there is no reason why we couldn't
just keep going in current CVS on a branch.
