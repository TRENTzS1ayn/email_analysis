Ok. There's a Bugzilla up and running on http://bugs.tj.unn.no/. Go ahead
and make accounts and register bugs. Go easy on test bugs as it's a real
PITA to delete them (for obvious reasons). Also the box hasn't been locked
down __at_all__ so please don't advertize it outside of this place. Quite
apart from the issue of whether to allow J. Random User to open bugs on the
permenent Bugzilla, I don't want to have to deal with the issues that
raises on this quickly thrown together installation.

Any new accounts created will probably not have access to do all you need
to do. Try using it and drop me a note when you get a "permission denied"
or some field isn't editable (well, or any other problem I suppose) and
I'll try to fix it ASAP.

I'm going to try to start assigning beta bugs from what's reported on the
lists. Currently I'm thinking I'll reply to the reporter with the Bugzilla
Bug number, and reference that number in release notes for betas, so
reporters can check that they're bugs are fixed. If we decide to let
everyone access a permanent Bugzilla we can start referencing the URL.
