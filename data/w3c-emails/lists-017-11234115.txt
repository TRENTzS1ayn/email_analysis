Sorry about that. I'd set Bugzilla to send email immediately instead of
queuing it and then forgot to start sendmail on the box. IOW the mail tried
to relay through localhost, which didn't have a MTA running, and so
bounced. I've submitted a "forgot password" request for both you and Ville
(who'd also set up an account, dunno if he was bit by this) so you should
recieve the email now.
