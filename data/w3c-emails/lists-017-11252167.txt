Ok. For concience's sake I'll note a certain reservation on principle as
regards the Confidentiality clause[0], but, yes:

  "I, THE UNDERSIGNED, HERETOFORE KNOWN AS  ``TERJE BLESS??,  HEREAFTER
   KNOWN AS ``GAGMEWITHASPOON??  DOES DECLARE  THAT HE,  BEING OF SOUND
   MIND AND POSESSING WHAT LITTLE FACULTY HE MAY,  HE,  GAGMEWITHASPOON,
   HAS, TO WIT, READ THE ABOVE REFERENCED LEGAL MUMBO JUMBO AND THAT HE,
   GAGMEWITHASPOON,   HAS,   INSOFAR  AS  POSSIBLE  FOR  A  LAY  PERSON,
   UNDERSTOOD   THE   PREVIOUSLY   SPECIFIED   AND   REFERENCED   VOODO."

Now aren't you glad you asked? :-)


(
  Ok, yes, I've read sections 1 through 5 of the Collaborators Agreement
  as well as the Software Contribution "Patch" Agreement, understand the
  requirements they impose, and agree to abide by them.
)


Both of which documents, BTW, I offered to sign and send by snailmail to
Gerald when I first started throwing patches at him so I suppose in the
legal sense I've been bound by those terms all along.
