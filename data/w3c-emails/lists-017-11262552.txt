I'll note again that SSH Protocol Version 1 has known weaknesses --
practical attacks as well as theoretical, IIRC -- and should be avoided
where possible. Since SSH Protocol Version 2.0 clients are available for
all relevant platforms, it should IMO be the default unless some particular
reason (such as developers with legacy hardware/OS) exists for also
supporting the older version.

  And if Cisco supports SSH v2 in IOS 12.3 I claim credit for it as
  I've been nagging on them about this for ages too! :-)
