Do we need access to Member-space? I wouldn't think so -- not that I'm not
curious as to the contents of the xml-sig mailinglist archives :-) -- given
the whole point here is stuff like write acccess to CVS and login accounts
on a more or less completely standalone box (and protecting W3C from legal
liability as regards the code we contribute, of course ;D).

Access to Member space also makes practical (as opposed to theoretical) the
issue of watching what you can and can't say in public -- because then you
are suddenly privvy to Member Confidential information -- and, frankly, I'd
just as soon avoid being in that situation.

Well, you've got me there.   I have no idea what any of those have to do with
SGML. Next you'll be claiming that running NSGMLS constitutes an unauthorized
public performance of SGML.                                  -- Richard Tobin
