Hi,

what's the policy on use of JavaScript in validator or checklink?
Is it a no-no or can it be used to enhance the UI?

There are some useful little things like focusing a default form element
when a page is loaded and preventing form submission if the URL field is
empty etc, for which IMHO JavaScript could be used.

Just a notice in advance, I think "application/x-javascript" should be
used for the content type for javascript, instead of "text/javascript"
(*not* registered), even though using the former makes MSIE 6 to ignore
the scripts most of the time...
