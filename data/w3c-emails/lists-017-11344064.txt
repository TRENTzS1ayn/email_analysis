I have created accounts, with the "usual" login name, for : Dom, Karl, 
Martin, Nick, Terje, Ville (and me).

Accounts should work (except Nick's, we still need to work the ssh key 
out), if they don't, drop me a line.

No need to be lenghty about the usual "be careful, no abuse, etc", I 
assume. If you want to install something, just go ahead if it's a small 
tool, lib, etc. Just try to document what you've done here, so that we 
don't step on each others' toes. For bigger things, we have this lists.

Drop me a line if you need (to know) something.
