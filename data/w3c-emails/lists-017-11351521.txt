Like Nick, adding suitable little bits if JavaScript has been on my TODO
for ages (and I've been bugging Jim Ley about adding some ;D). It obviously
needs to be super-carefull not to make any stupid mistakes that might
legitimize stuff like browser-sniffers to Joe R. Wubduhsigner, but even
more, it would be nice to be able to act as a showcase for JavaScript
__done_right__!

IOW, Accessible and inclusionary JavaScript would be a big plus as far as
I'm concerned...
