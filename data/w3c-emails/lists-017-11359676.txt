Speaking of the CVS server, now that we have the current maintainer of
FreeBSD-cvsweb on board, any chance of looking at updating the cvsweb
installation on dev? My biggest gripe is the fubar line spacing in Annotate

I /think/ the old URLs should still work (unlike with ViewCVS) and worst
case the two could coexist in paralell.
