Ville raised an issue recently...

We're aiming to provide both tarballs and RPMs of the Validator and OpenSP
(the latter to ensure a compatible version is avilable regardless of what
the OpenSP developers decide to do). Initially, my thought was that we
would only support Red Hat (8.0) with the RPMs (the tarball is of course
more or less platform independant). But that might be construed as the W3C
endorsing a particular vendor...

My feeling is that we're supporting Red Hat with a binary installation only
because that is what we are able to support -- implying among other things
that if a Debian or *BSD packager should volunteer they'd be gratefully
accepted, of course -- and that this will not be a problem in practice.

But perhaps the resident W3Cers have guidelines and such they have to
follow? Opinions on the matter?

Since Ville is the one who will actually do (is allready doing, for that
matter) the RPM packaging, he'll have to speak to how Red Hat and version
specific the RPMs will be (cf. other RPM based ditros).

Well, you've got me there.   I have no idea what any of those have to do with
SGML. Next you'll be claiming that running NSGMLS constitutes an unauthorized
public performance of SGML.                                  -- Richard Tobin
