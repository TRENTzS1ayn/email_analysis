Yes, they'd be very much welcome at this point, before too much sweat
has been put into packaging.

I haven't really tested my RPMs on anything but RH 7.3 and more
recently, RH 8.0; but even if the validator is platform independent,
there are substantial differences eg. in the Apache (config/webroot)
layout between distributions.  A validator RPM that runs out of the box
on whatever-you-install-it-to isn't very likely to happen, and I have
some doubts about providing such a spec file or source RPM too (though
there wouldn't be that many things one would have to change).

Distributing OpenSP can be even harder, it's platform-dependent and most
OS vendors already have an older version of it, usually bundled in a
"openjade" package or something.  But then again, we can always install
it to a "private" location, so it wouldn't interfere with the vendor's
packages.

I'm fine with providing an unofficial RPM of validator and it's
requirements for RH8 elsewhere, but would prefer if it could be
distributed on the validator website (with an "unofficial" label if need
be).
