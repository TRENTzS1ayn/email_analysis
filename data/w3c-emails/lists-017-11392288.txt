A quick answer, I can investigate further if needed.

First, I think providing packaged versions of our software is a good 
thing. It does not mean we have to spend a lot of work packaging the 
validator for each architecture and each packaging system.

What we can do and this seems to be the current practice at W3C:

- we provide the tarballs as the "official" released package,
- depending on availability in-house, we can also provide a few 
packages. We used to have a redhat fan at W3C (Daniel Veillard, 
rpmfind's father), so for a long time we had rpm packages (etc.).
- we welcome packages created by external contributors, and we either 
link to them or host them, with proper credit and warning.

I understand some people may think so, but I wouldn't pay it much 
attention : most people would be happy to have rpm, and enemies of rpms 
cannot complain very long if we tell them we would be glad if they 
create their own package.

Exactly.
