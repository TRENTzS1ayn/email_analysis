Hmm, yes, a read-only bugzilla may certainly be less useful, but at 
least it would be better than nothing at all. However, I believe 
bugzilla is flexible enough, and we could give "visitors" the proper 
rights while avoiding abuses. ...Or maybe not, at least the group 
editor does not seem flexible enough.

My plan would be to use it for public bug tracking of public QA 
software dev.
If other things don't fit, then they look for another bugzilla. Simple 
:)
