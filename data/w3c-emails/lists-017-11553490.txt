As you may or may not have noticed, there is now a validator-0_6_5-beta1 tag
in CVS and v.w3.org:8001 is updated. The general announcement of the beta will
go out as soon as I get around to writing it up and sending it (probably a
little later today). I'm going over some final issue ATM so there may yet be a
holdup, but it is mostly done. If you need me to delay then yell, now.

Not that it is a major crisis if you need something in as I think we can allow
ourselves to keep the code on :8001 somewhat floating this round (i.e. update
to interrim code without going through the rigmarole of a ??Release??).

BTW, the new output is looking pretty spiffy if I do say so myself. Y'all
should make a point of checking it out if you haven't allready seen it. :-)
