If you've read the CVS logs and/or the w-v list in the past few days you
will have noticed that I have been enthusiastic about buidling a (good)
guide to install the validator.

Our failure to do so in the past may have been a big strategic
mistake... Having Joe Homepage and Bill Webdesigner happily using the
validator(s) and checking their small-medium content is a good thing,
but not necessarily very relevant compared to the millions of corporate
Web pages either on the Web or on intranets.

I'm not rejecting the grassroot Web community, obviously, only pointing
out that if we manage to make (more) big companies and Web agencies
happy users of the package [check, checklink and the logval] - which
share a large common infrastructure - we may have a much bigger impact
than we do now.

The draft is up on the beta validator site:
http://validator.w3.org:8001/docs/devel

I would appreciate any comment you would have to make this better. Best
would be if someone could follow it step by step and see how it works.
Karl, I know you're good at this, can I count on you?

No need to announce it (+QA News?), I can take care of that when I come
back from vacation next week.
