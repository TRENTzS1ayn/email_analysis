+1 in fact three pages.
An intro doc with:
You are a developper
You want to install the validator.


- We should try to find three people who have the competences to create 
clickorama installer. I have recently installed Bloxsom (Perl) on my 
macintosh. You download a package, you double click and it's working... 
it's very very elegant. If we can do that for the validator, it will 
help a lot.

- Have you thought already about localization of install docs and to 
maintain the different versions?


Good work.
