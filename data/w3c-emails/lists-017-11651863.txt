Thanks all (sorry for the bulk reply) for your suggestions to the new
install guide. I basically implemented most if not all of them, with 
one minor point of disagreement and a few open questions.

You are of course welcome to follow-up...

Yes, I gave it a try and that's indeed better.

Done automagically by following Ville's suggestion and linking to
/source instead of the prerequisites part of /docs/devel.

Will take care of that when polishing the text, i.e. when I'm happy with
the bulk.

In the version I have now, there are only two small notes about CVS,
which should not be too misleading for people installing for the
tarballs. I don't really want to "copy" the whole guide for developers
using CVS and this seems like a decent compromise (reserving my right to
change my mind without justification later... ;)

yes

There are two config files that will always be modified when installing.
One is the validator'S config, which we copy to /etc/w3c/, and the other
is the Web server's, which I suggest to copy to another location too.
This makes upgrading and error recovery safer.

Should I explain this in the guide?

Um did someone fix these spelling errors or did I do it in my sleep?
Thanks anyway!

Well, the intro doc is more or less what the /docs/ index page is
supposed to do, but I guess it may be improved, too...

Yes, clickorama installers are a good help. That may not be very easy in 
our case because of the fact that :
- this is server software, so we should not expect people to have a
  GUI... even less a consistent cross-platform one (though I suppose a
gnome installer would be cool, but a luxury given our resources)
- dependencies and prerequisites are what make the installation
  difficult.
- we do have something close to "clickorama" with the deb and rpms done
  by Ville and Frederic.

Ideas:
- a small shell/perl script copying files where needed (and asking
  questions along the way) and pre-editing the conf files.
- a dummy CPAN module taking care of the dependencies. We can't bundle
  the validator in a CPAN module (or can we? Ville, you're our local
expert, do you have any idea?) but we can pretend...

Localization should not be too much of a problem. For the versions, I
believe we just need to have the documentation fit the latest tarball
version. Or am I missing the point?

Indeed. I moved the reference to prerequisites to this place. I'm
considering simply removing the prereq part of the devel documentation
when I work on it (i.e probably tomorrow)



Thanks again, looking at the result I think your suggestions are
starting to make the guide shine!
