I think the CPAN dependencies-only approach works better for the
validator and checklink due to configuration issues and the need for
external binaries which obviously cannot be handled by CPAN.  More info
about Bundle modules is at
http://www.cpan.org/misc/cpan-faq.html#How_make_bundle

I rolled experimental, untested Bundles for both the validator and the
link checker, they're available at http://koti.welho.com/vskytta/

If you wish, I can upload these to CPAN for testing.  If you think it'd
be better to use Olivier's CPAN account for all validator related perl
modules there (ie. currently the same location as the LogValidator
modules), that's very much fine with me too.  Let me know what you
think.
