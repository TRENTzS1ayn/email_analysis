If this is really necessary, it can be implemented (please add a RFE to
Bugzilla if so).  But the current behaviour is that unless configured
otherwise, the authentication will be sent to the hostname that
requested it.  I imagine this will satisfy common use cases.

Regarding whether the authentication should be sent to a hostname or
domain if nothing was configured or given in the command line, I went
for the hostname.  As Olivier said, it's the safe side, not to mention
it was easier for me to implement it :)
