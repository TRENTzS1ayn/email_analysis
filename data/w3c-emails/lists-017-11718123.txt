Hi all,

Please welcome Pierre Candela on the list.
Pierre will be specifically working on the W3C Glossary project, the 
latest addition to the "QA development" projects.

Pierre, a few pointers sent by Charles yesterday to a WAI list, which 
may be of some interest as they are "similar work":

[[
Wordnet is a project to produce a dictionary in RDF [2], which allows 
words
to be classified in terms of relations to other words - for example an 
eagle
is a type of raptor, a type of bird, etc, and cat has two senses - in 
one it
is a type of mammal and in the other it is a type of whip.

The SWAD-Europe project also has some work one thesaurus development [3]
which builds on (and points to) work already done in the area.

Thanks.
