Here's a couple of things that should be updated (I've had the intention
to do it but have failed so far):

source/index.html should mention the CVS branches, ie. the difference
between HEAD and validator-0_6_0-branch.

The version number of the validator should be somewhere in the UI. 
Maybe a <meta name="generator" content="W3C Markup Validator 0.6.2" />
would be enough.

By the way, is it "MarkUp" or "Markup"?
