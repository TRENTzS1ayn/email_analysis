Current CVS does. It also contains a link to http://validator.w3.org/dist/;
a directory that is not version controlled and where packages (tarballs,
RPMs, and Debs) can be placed. The "Source Code" link in the navigation
menu now also always points to http://validator.w3.org/source/ instead of
to the local installation.

That leaves just links to your main repositories for RPMs and Debs and some
explanations for users of same. Could you (Ville, Frederic) send me
"patches" for whatever you need to make the binary dists work to your
satisfaction?

The output contains the CVS revision number of the "check" CGI script (as
well as the version number of the HTML Template). Do you think we need the
"human readable" version number also?


>By the way, is it "MarkUp" or "Markup"?

It's "MarkUp" just because I happened to like StuddlyCaps there that day
since that's how w3.org tends to spell it. If it irks you, feel free to do
a global search and replace on it. :-)



That leaves some documentation work from Olivier, and some collaboration on
the Release Notes (since I've lost track of what's happened since 0.6.1).
Y'all seem to have fixed all the bugs that cropped up (at least, there's
nothing in Bugzilla indicating any outstanding issues).


Anyone have anything left to deal with?

I'm going to do a scan through the ~275 unread messages in my www-validator
mailbox as time allows, but modulo that I'm not aware of any outstanding
issues.


PS. Frederic, I haven't heard from you in a while; ping the list with
current status of Debian packages if you have the time?
