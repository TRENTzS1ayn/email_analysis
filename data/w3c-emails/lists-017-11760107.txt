Ah, I wasn't aware of that.  Sounds good.

My RPM doesn't have a clean patch at the moment, but a hunk of perl code
that does some in-place edits to check.cfg and the httpd.conf snippet. 
It's a perl hunk instead of a patch because it uses stuff provided by
RPM, basically some directory locations which is better from a RPM point
of view than a patch with "hardcoded" paths.  And it avoids the need for
a separate patch file.  You can see the hunk in the spec file in CVS,
look for "# Localize config files".  Yell if you need clarification on
that.

Yes, I do, as long as we have the "human readable" ones in Bugzilla and
refer to them in public elsewhere.  Of course, that causes some extra
things for the "release manager", but there are other places where this
is needed anyway.  So it's just one addition to the list.

The reason why I asked is because I have a feeling that w3.org does
*not* tend to spell it in camelcase :).  See eg.
<http://www.google.com/custom?q=markup&sitesearch=w3.org&domains=w3.org>...

I can do the search and replace, but would like a confirmation which way
is "correct" from a W3C rep.

    cvs log -NS -rvalidator-0_6_0-release::validator-0_6_1-release

...is your friend (change the release numbers as appropriate).  I think

    cvs log -NS -rvalidator-0_6_1-release::

...should work too, but I get a "Terminated with fatal signal 11" when
trying it.

Apart from a couple of trivial documentation updates (checklink needs
Config::General), nothing here that should absolutely go into 0.6.2. 
There are some checklink bug reports that I'll be working on soon(tm),
but nothing critical that would prevent this release.
