Hmmm. I'm not really sure we can avoid that since RPM wants tokens -- e.g.
%{_sysconfdir} -- in there and we want real paths. I'm not sure there is
any problem with v.w3.org not using the config file from CVS, but it should
be usable for CVS/tarball users without pre-processing with RPM.

The DEBUG option has been disabled in CVS, but other then that I can't
really see any way to eliminate that perl chunk in the spec file.

Ok, header.html now includes it in the initial <h1> on every page
(including Validator output).

Sure, it may even be helpfull in tightening up the release process.

Well, Checklink can be more easily updated independantly of the Validator
so I suppose that's ok. In general I'm really hoping this will be the last
release of 0.6.x before focusing on 0.7.0. At which point, BTW, I would
like to see Checklink and the Validator get better integrated from the POV
of the user visiting http://validator.w3.org/.
