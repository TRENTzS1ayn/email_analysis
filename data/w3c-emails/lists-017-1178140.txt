So... what other IRI, distinct from http://www.example.org/ros&eacute;
yields URI http://www.example.org/ros%C3%A9.

Oh... yes I see, the IRI http://www.example.org/ros%C3%A9 (because in your
view URI are IRI) maps to the URI http://www.example.org/ros%C3%A9.
aaaaggghhhh.

This gets us back to the question of whether IRI are intended 1) as a
replacement for URI as 'the' identifier for the Web, or 2) as a distinct set
of a internationalised identifiers (distinct value space, overlapping
lexical space wrt URI) which are mapped to URI for use in protocol elements
that require URI - URI then remain 'the' identifier on the Web and IRI serve
as an internationalisation friendly form for inclusion in documents and UI
artifacts (from which URI are generated when necessary).

View 2 treats URI and IRI as different types even though there lexical forms
overlap. In this view I'm not sure quite how the IRI
http://www.example.org/ros%C3%A9 would arise.

I accept that simply looking at the lexical form leaves an ambiguity about
whether one is looking at a URI or an IRI.

ie. you do character-by-character comparison of two IRI.

But you are demonstrating a situation where for two IRI x and y:

(not(x == y)) && (iriToUri(x) == iriToUri(y))

operationally this is also confusing.
