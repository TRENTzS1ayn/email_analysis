I'm actually pretty sure that we shouldn't even try to avoid that
stuff.  I'm perfectly fine with it, but hey, you asked to see the
patches :)

Agreed, but there's simply no way to make it so that it pleases everyone

Thanks for the heads up, that makes the perl hunk one line smaller :)

Oops, I was wrong about that, I already documented it some time ago. 
The only thing left on my list is to update misc/w3c-validator.spec with
some educated guesses about the tarball locations and stuff.  I'm also
going to rename the package to w3c-markup-validator for consistency with
the product name and Frederic's .debs.
