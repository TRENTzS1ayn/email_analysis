Dom,
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "creating an RF Schema for the 
glossary created in ...".
I used your pointers "how should an entry in an RDF glossary" and inserted it 
in my previous draft of the glossary.
Attached to this mail is the result. (Fusion.rdf). Tell me if it's accurate.
