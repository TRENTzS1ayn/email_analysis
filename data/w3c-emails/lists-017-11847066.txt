I've made the /source/ page point at a /dist/ directory on v.w3.org with
the intention that this directory will not exist in CVS. This is where I
intended that anything downloadable should reside.

Whether or not to host the binary packages and the dependencies there
depend entirely on what you and Ville think is best. If it is practical for
you and for users to host it there I think that makes sense (IIRC Olivier
also thinks this would be ok, right?).

It probably makes sense to keep development/interrim versions on your own
web sites, but I see now reason why they couldn't also be on v.w3.org if
you would prefer. The big hurdle is probably that it's a PITA to get things
uploaded there ATM as Olivier and the other W3Cers are the only ones with
sufficient privileges to put stuff in place ATM (though that can probably
be fixed if we need to).

Can this reasonably be integrated into the v.w3.org version so you won't
have to maintain this diff?

I'll see what I can do to make this work better for Debian. It would help
if you could describe the directory structure and relevant filenames for
me.

Ville: Can we use the vendor sgml-lib on Red Hat? Integrate with it?

In the 0.7.0 timeframe we should be able to provide a suffieciently clean
sgml-lib package -- possibly the proposed separate DTD registry/collection
project -- that we could propose Red Hat use that instead/in addition to
what they ship now.

If it should become practical/necessary I'm sure we can arrange CVS write
access for you somehow. I dunno how fine-grained the "ACL" is for
dev.w3.org, but there are other ways to arrange it if that should prove
impractical.

Ville maintains the spec file (more or less?) in CVS, but I dunno whether
that would make sense for you and the Debian package.

I think I have this in my TODO somewhere too. Ping me about it if it hasn't
been fixed when I tag 0.6.2 in CVS will you?
