I've let this drift for some time (as is my bad habit:-), but I'd like
to introduce the XML validator into W3C CVS.  Olivier organised my CVS
access, and that appears to work fine.

Since the XML validator is entirely separate from "the" validator,
I think xml-val should be created as a new top-level project.
Any problems with that?
