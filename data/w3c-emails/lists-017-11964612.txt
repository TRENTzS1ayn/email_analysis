OK, I've imported it into dev.w3.org:/sources/public/2003/xml-val
I'm perpetually struggling with CVS, so I hope it's imported OK.

This is currently a pretty minimal import, but it's what's running
at qa-dev.w3.org:8888 and now also at valet.webthing.com/xml-val/

At valet, I have an XML catalogue I constructed myself.  For W3,
I want to investigate the XML components of our SGMLIB package,
and feed it to the validator.  This remains subject to round tuits,
and if anyone's actually installed something on qa-dev, it'll save
a lot of work if you let me know so I can just configure xml-val
to use it.
