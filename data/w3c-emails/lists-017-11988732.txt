Watch this space.  And hassle me if I go quiet on it.

I certainly have issues with it.  One is to improve the output:
for that I need to hack in to Xerces itself to extract the info
I'm looking for (unless someone has a better idea).  Another
is setting up the XML catalogue and lib - and that's something
I'd really like help with (I could just copy stuff from Valet,
but I *know* that's a homebrew and has gaps in it).

Apart from that, I'd really like to see it tested properly -
Eg for those of you in .jp, does it cope with CJK?  And do we
have a test corpus anywhere?   Bjoern has been my best critic,
but neither he nor I can expect to see everything.
