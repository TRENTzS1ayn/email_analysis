Hello Stuart,

Many thanks for forwarding this discussion to public-iri. I have listed
this as an issue at
http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/Overview.html#IRIURIcharequiv-20.

My answer here is:
- both, depending on the situation
- this might look bothering, but it really isn't much of an issue

Once most of what the users will see are IRIs, I'm not sure
it's appropriate to call them 'UI artifacts'. Users will
just see them, and probably talk about them as URLs, not even
URIs, because they haven't yet learned that the 'politically
correct' name is now URI.

Hopefully not too often. But somebody can just write it down,
as it is written down in this email. You are right that it should
be very rare, but from a spec point of view, the question is how
to disallow it. We can't disallow percent-escaping because that
would disallow http://www.example.org/ros%E9, which has to be
legal for backwards compatibility purposes (and is different
from the above).

Yes, of course. And often (e.g. on a napkin or a business card),
that's the only thing you have.

Yes.

Looks like it may create problems. But up to now, I haven't heard
about any. This situation is very similar to a situation purely
on URIs. It is very easy to construct two URIs that are guaranteed
to always resolve to the same thing but that don't compare
character-by-character equivalent.

For example http://www.example.org/ (1) and http://www.example.org (2).
The URI spec says that these are equivalent, but they identify
two different namespaces, and they identify two different nodes
in an RDF graph. So we could indeed create two different types,
let's call them aURI (the ones that are only equivalent if they
are character-by-character equivalent) and bURI (they are
equivalent in some more cases, as far as the URI spec allows).
(1) and (2) are the same bURI, but a different aURI. And you
can't even know whether they are aURIs or bURIs by just looking
at them. So which ones are 'the' identifier for the Web?
aURIs or bURIs?


So in summary:
- This issue is not a problem because very similar issues also
   exist with URIs themselves.
- Given that IRIs allow (many) more characters than URIs, but we
   want IRIs that are also URIs (or if you prefer: that also look
   like URIs) to map to themselves, it is impossible to preserve
   the same equivalence classes for character-by-character on IRIs
   and on URIs. So there does not seem to be a solution
   (if you know about one, please tell us).
- There is already a clear warning in the draft about this, which
   seems to have been clear enough to catch your attention.

I therefore am tentatively closing this issue with 'no action needed'.
If you think that some change to the document is needed, please say
so (ideally with some actual proposed text).


Regards,     Martin.
