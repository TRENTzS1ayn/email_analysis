Hostname is the safe side. As a user, I'd be happy if it were the 
domain, but... On the other hand, a few agents I know try what they 
have in their keychain for the domain when prompted for auth. This is a 
point worth discussing on w-v, maybe.

Sounds good.

[disclaimer - never used the cmdline version] is there an option for 
"cron'd" mode? I assume some people want the script to run totally 
not-interactively, so there should be an option for this, other than 
giving a trusted domain.

Agreed.
