What branch do you plan to work in?  Methinks it's about time to get
HEAD rolling again after The Next Release is out, and use the
0_6_0-branch only for critical bugfixes...

Thanks.  By the way, is Frederic subscribed to public-qa-dev?

Some status on the RPMs: I've updated the specfile in 0_6_0-branch so
that apart from the version numbers, it should be ready to roll. 

Specifically, the Version:, Release: (reset to 1w3c if the next version
is > 0.6.2), Source0: and Source1: tags should be updated to match the
version number.  And a %changelog entry would be nice :)  Feel free to
update it when you feel it's time for a new release if I'm unresponsive.

OpenSP 1.5 continues to be a slight PITA on Red Hat.  I won't go into
details; just a note that their Rawhide (WIP area) contains
openjade-1.3.2 which includes OpenSP 1.5.  OpenSP 1.5 is not available
for RH 9 (current release) and earlier versions from RH.

In general, I think that RH release dates should not affect validator's
release dates at all.

I would like to get the local/private IP "disclosure" [1] dealt with
fixed in both validator and checklink in the next release.  This will
need 1 config variable for each, and will most likely introduce a
dependency on Net::IP [2].
