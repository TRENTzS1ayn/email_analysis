Well, as mentioned, for various bonehead reasons I can't do this cleanly. HEAD
is borken and will take ages to get into releaseable state. IOW, anything
released soon(ish) will have to come off the validator-0_6_0-branch. But since
we've allready added stuff that is inappropriate for a minor revision (doctype
fallbacks etc.), we do need to bump the version number a bit more.

How about this...

We leave 0.6.1 as the last 0.6.x release for now, and then branch off to
validator-0_7-branch from the validator-0_6_0-branch (instead of branching
from HEAD) and make a 0.7.0 release from there.

validator-0_7-branch then becomes the stable/critical-bugfix-only branch (with
checkin dicipline in effect[0]) and immediately transition to adding new stuff
on HEAD. If HEAD is too borken to easily add a given random minor
feature/change, then that is just a great incentive to _un_break HEAD.

If nobody hollers I'll proceede after that plan (probably beginning tonight).


Oh, and "checkin dicipline"; how about summat like:

  1. Any checkin needs to reference a Bugzilla Bug #.
  2. Any checkin needs to be applied also to HEAD.

(excepting trivial/typo-style stuff onbviously)

Mainly just to remind folks[0] to put stuff where it belongs (i.e. I don't
really want to end up with a real Mozilla.org-style burocracy with Drivers,
Review, and Super-Review etc.).

He was, but he may have unsubscribed, been bounced, or not currently have time
to follow the list. This message CCed in the hopes of getting current status.
Frederic...?

I assume this is changelog for the _RPM_ and not in general?

I've asked them to split the packages but twaugh seems disinclined to do so
for whatever reason (it took the -R security issue to get them to upgrade it
at all). I think we need to get upstream to forcibly split the packages before
Red Hat will follow suit. Note that a new OpenSP release (1.5.1) appears to be
in the offing, so that may happen eventually).

Well, we're not jumping through hoops for them, but if we can teak scheduling
slightly in order to take advantage of new release attention I think that
would be advantageous. e.g. to announce Red Hat 9.1 packages immediately after
they start sending press releases ought to get us a little bit of free
attention.
