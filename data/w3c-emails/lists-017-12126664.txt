No objections here.

Yes.

Those are probably the very same issues that I've found, it'll be
necessary to rebuild a biggish bunch of other, dependent packages too if
one wants to cleanly repackage SP and Jade separately :/  And even if
that can be done, it may get hairy to support smooth upgrades from
previous versions.

Yep.  Because of the SP/Jade issues above, I think it would make sense
to make the RPM 9.1 (or whatever it'll be called) only when it's out,
instead of providing a package that isn't really out of the box workable
anywhere.
