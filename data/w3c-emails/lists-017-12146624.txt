Why not release what we've been beta testing as 0.6.2 and then proceed? 
What's benn tagged as 0.6.2 is not perfect, agreed, but some people are 
waiting for it, and I believe we'd do the community a favor by 
releasing it instead if waiting for the big bulk of stuff we have in 
the pipe to be ready...
