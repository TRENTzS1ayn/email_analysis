I am indeed subscribed -- sorry for not answering earlier. I read all the
messages, but wanted to take some time to prepare an comprehensive
answer before answering. Oh well, let's go for the partial answer...

From the Debian point of view, there is no release planned in the next
couple of months (there has been no freeze on the 'testing' distribution,
so a release is very unlikely before next year), so there is no need to 
have something released in the very near future in order to have it included
into Debian Sarge (the next release). In addition, the current Debian package
is in pretty good shape (and the Debian packaging of OpenSP doesn't cause any
problem AFAIK), I've only received minor bug reports that I forwarded to
Ville. The only thing I would absolutely need for the release is a better
way of configuring the validator so that it can use the catalog and DTDs
that are provided by the distribution. I've promised Terje a summary of the
situation a long time ago, and I should do that ASAP. But this doesn't have
to be linked to a new release of the validator -- if (and when) we agree on
a fix, I can backport it to the current version in Debian.

I won't say much about the next release in general -- I was personaly
hoping for a 0.6.2 'bug-fix' release in the near future because I understood
it was needed (even though I haven't been personaly bitten by any bug in the 
current release), but I haven't followed the details of the changes. Whatever
the new version, it would be nice to have something out in the not-so-far
future. Once a decision has be made, I'll create a new (unofficial) Debian
package with the pre-(0.6.2|0.6.5) version of the validator so that it can be
easily tested by people using Debian.

Frederic
