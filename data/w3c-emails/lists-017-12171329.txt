Go right ahead. If anything breaks or I don't like it, I'll cheerfully and
shamelessly revert it or change it. Unless a commit involves non-trivial
changes to Perl code or the config files, I see no reason to be so
conservative in commits. Easy change management is the reason to use CVS. :-)

That said, I'll probably tweak that bit some more. I'm not really happy with
the way it turned out (the Submit button in particular) so some more tweaking
is due before release.

enough rope to hang themselves,  but a boobytrapped thermonuclear weapon
