Hi.

just a few notes before I go to bed...

- after some discussion on the w-v-css list, it seems nobody awfully 
disliked the "new" validator style, and so it seems like the css 
validator's homepage will be using the same style and layout as the 
validator, which I believe is a very nice step towards a good usability 
of our services. (Hi! Philippe, Sijtsche!)

- One comment we're very likeky to have is that (even in non-verbose 
mode maybe, but even more then) the "this page is not valid FOO" block 
is too low. At my resolution I have to scroll down one to two pages. I 
believe it was higher before, was there a specific reason to move it 
below the warning boxes?

Cheers,
