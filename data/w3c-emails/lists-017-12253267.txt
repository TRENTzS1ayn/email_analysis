Well, I must admit I'm somewhat ambivalent on this issue. As you demonstrated
there is quite a bit of overhead associated with the current implementation,
but the question is whether it is significant in the context (e.g. "check" is
pretty resource intensive as it is).

Adding Storable would add complexity and an additional point of failure that
needs to be traded off against the performance gain. I'm not certain which way
the needle should/would tip in this case (meaning that anyone with strong
opinions in either direction are invited to make that decision!).


But implementing this as a new feature for Config:General instead of as a
local modification does make sense if upstream will take such a patch.

signs of pranksters coming forward with a gleeful smile to announce that
