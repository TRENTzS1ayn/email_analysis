The short answer is yes... I agree.

I chewed on this of quite a time. Even came with and idea to address your
challenge (which I'll mention below) but I think it amounts the same thing
as the MUST NOT in section 5.1:

   As an example,
   http://example.org/~user, http://example.org/%7euser, and
   http://example.org/%7Euser are not equivalent under this definition.
   In such a case, the comparison function MUST NOT map IRIs to URIs,
   because such a mapping would create additional spurious equivalences.

It was the "spurious equivalences" phrase that triggered my concern.

My idea to address your challenge, which I'm not overly committed to... and
I think amounts the the same as the MUST NOT above is this:

Regard the lexical spaces of URI and IRI as disjoint ie. if the identifier
string is valid under the URI grammar... it's a URI and *not* an IRI. IRI
are then the remaining strings that match the IRI grammar. Effectively this
forces IRI to be only those identifier strings that actually contain
characters that are not 'legal' in URI. Character by character IRI/IRI and
URI/URI comparision work as normal. Character-by-character IRI/URI
comparison always yield not-equal (because URI and IRI are disjoint). 

Thanks,

Stuart
