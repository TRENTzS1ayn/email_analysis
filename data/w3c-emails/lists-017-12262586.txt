Yep, but adding roughly 0.3-0.4 seconds CPU time to each request can't

Will probably see later.  Config::General::ParseConfig already takes a
-Tie argument; but I'm not familiar enough with tie() stuff to even tell
whether that could be applicable or useful here.

Will there be another live beta release?  Could estimate the cost there.
