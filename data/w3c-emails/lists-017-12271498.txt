So we're talking about between 1.0 and 1.75 wallclock seconds for the
processing alone; making your numbers something like 30-50% increase.


>Will there be another live beta release?  Could estimate the cost there.

I'm aiming to do a new beta as soon as I make a final call on some WS code I'm
working on (haven't quite decided on Go/No Go yet) && Olivier is happy with
docs and style tweaks && I hear back from Jim about some JavaScript stuff[0].

Lets make a point to profile this stuff in a more reliable manner then. Well,
or you could just go ahead immediately in a separate server on v.w3.org.



[0] - I've "voluntered" Jim Ley to do some JavaScript for the Results page to
      show Error Explanations on demand; but he's pretty busy so I don't know
      how long until he has time for this. If it's soon I want to hold off on
      beta until we can add the JS to maximized the amount of testing it gets.
