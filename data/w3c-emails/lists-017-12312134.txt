Hmmm. There seems to be two obvious solutions to this; enforce Validation in
either Web Commander[0] or the remote server at PUT time.

I'm not sufficiently familiar with the setup at either end here to evaluate
the feasability of the two. Initially I'd say that since this is an
enforcement of a publishing policy it belongs in the server and not the client
(i.e. the "authoring" end), but that may run into practical problems with e.g.
the round-robin setup or similar?

Otherwise the obvious way to go about it would be a server plugin
(module/filter for Apache) that enforces Valid content in PUT.

If that is deemed infeasible, perhaps we could prevail on Henrik to add a POST
to validator.w3.org to Web Commander.
