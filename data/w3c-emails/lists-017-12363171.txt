Well, we certainly need better messages; but I really don't want to use a
patched version of OpenSP for the Validator if at all possible. My current
plan (for 0.7) is to get the message numbers out of onsgmls and keep a
completely separate catalog; either to replace its messages or to supplement
them. Possibly also context sensitive so that references to specific elements
will trigger appropriate explanations.
