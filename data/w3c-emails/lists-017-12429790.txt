I believe the vendor libs are currently only a small subset of what we
want to be able to validate against.  They seem to be adding more
though, rawhide has xhtml1-dtds for example.

Yes, the catalogs can be integrated with the system, using
install-catalog(8) and/or xmlcatalog(1).  I'll have a look at doing this
in the spec file, probably already for 0.6.2.

Yes, my +[as many as I have] for it.  And by no means it should be
limited to Red Hat; there are multiple OS's and the like that would
benefit greatly from this.  I'm interested in contributing some work to
make this happen.
