As some of you know, I've been working on validation as an Apache
module.  This gives us major performance benefits when running online,
and I've taken the opportunity to make further improvements.

This will go public as Page Valet 4.0 as soon as I feel sufficiently
confident in it.  But it appears to be working well, and I've now
put up a preview at <URL:http://valet.webthing.com/page/index4.html>.
Comments and criticisms invited!

Might W3C be interested in using this?
