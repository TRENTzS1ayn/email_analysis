I thought I'd fix the bad error explanation as pointed out by Jukka in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2003Nov/0012.html but
did not find that in CVS.

v.w.o:8001 seems to have a verbosemsg.cfg which is not in CVS nor is the
corresponding verbosemsg.rc that would produce it.  I didn't find the
*.rc on v.w.o either.  Terje, is it possible that you've forgot to
commit something? :)
