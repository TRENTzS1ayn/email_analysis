Saqib Ali - who posted to www-validator a couple of months ago -
has made his PHP-based validator available at Sourceforge and
announced it on ciwah.  This looks like a serious alternative to
the Usual Suspects, and set me thinking ...

v.w.o already links to other online services (wdg and valet).
But should the Source page also link to other open-source
validator programs?  Something along the lines of:

===================================================
Other HTML Validators:

There are several alternative webserver-based validators available
for free download:

  * The [WDG Validator] is another Perl validator broadly
    comparable to this one.
  * [mod_validator] is a C++ validator that links directly in to
    the [Apache webserver].
  * The [LDP Validator] is a PHP-based validator.

Another option is a desktop validator:
  * [Validator-Lite] is a C++ desktop validator with GTK frontend.

Another tool that may be of interest is [CatalogueManager], that
serves to keep your DTDs and Entity collection up to date.
