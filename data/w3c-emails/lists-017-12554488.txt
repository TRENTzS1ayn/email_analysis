Yes, I got that from your announcement.

Page Valet/mod_validator already validates external entities, but
suppresses messages coming from them (to avoid unduly confusing the
issue for the majority Web-ish users).  All you need is the option
to uncheck this suppression in the Advanced Form.

I think the same is in principle true of the onsgmls-based validators,
with the provisos that you have the extra job of parsing output, and
that its XML support is less complete.
