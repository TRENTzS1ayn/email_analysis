Hi all.

For a couple hours the validators (:80 and 8001... not :8000 but it's 
not using onsgmls, and nobody cares about it anyway) were hosed. I 
immediatly knew there was something fishy with openSP, but couldn't 
really find what (broken debian upgrade?) until I killed this little 
bugger process on v.w.o:

nobody   15504 56.6  0.7  6168 3868 ?        R    00:10 114:20 
/usr/bin/onsgmls -n -c /home/link/validator/htdocs/sgml-lib/xml.soc -R 
-wvalid -wnon-sgml-char-ref -wno-duplicate -wxml -E0

which had been running for a very long time.

Why *this* process apparently caused all onsgmls processes to fail 
baffles me, but at least it seems we're back in business.

*phew*
