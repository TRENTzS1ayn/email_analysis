Recent versions of rpm complain if you haven't imported the keys that
the to-be-installed packages are signed with.  The keys:

bcd241cb: My key.
897da07a: The old Red Hat Rawhide key.
e418e3aa: The new (2003) Red Hat Rawhide key.

See http://cachalot.mine.nu/9/#key for more info.

These, on the other hand look like packaging bugs in the Rawhide (or
RHL9) docbook-dtds package.  I haven't rebuilt them at all, just
downloaded from Rawhide to my repository (as witnessed by the RH
signature).  This is part of the pain of getting a sane OpenSP 1.5 (or
openjade 1.3.2 in RH's case) installed on RHL 9.
