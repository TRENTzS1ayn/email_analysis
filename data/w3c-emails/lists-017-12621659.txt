Just for the information of those who may have been working on the 
qa-dev server lately.

In spite of using raid and a journaled fs, a hard drive crash on the 
machine apparently caused some havoc yesterday, and according to the 
Daigo who worked on salvaging the machine, there *might* have been some 
data lost. Bad luck.

Just thought you might want to know that, just in case.
