Hi all,

A few proposed tips have gone through the 2 weeks period review on
www-qa, and so have I pushed them on the production service:
http://www.w3.org/2003/07/30-color
  If You Pick One Color, Pick Them All
http://www.w3.org/2003/07/30-font-size
  Care With Font Size
http://www.w3.org/2001/06tips/use-links
 Use <link>s in your document

See:
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/validator/htdocs/config/tips.cfg
(I have put them in both the prod branch, and the current HEAD).

Olivier, I have not put there "Create legible Web pages" as I was not
sure if you still wanted it as a tip or if you thought it was to be
superseded by Susan's tips.
I think it doesn't hurt to have redundancy on those topics, but let me
know what you think.

DOm
