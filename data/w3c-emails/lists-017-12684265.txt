do you mean EARL for the report of passing the Test Suite?
or to describe the test?

We will have to consider something where the success of passing the 
test suite is not the fact of being valid.

Test A -> Has to be always invalid -> Success if invalid
   -> Failed  if valid
Test B -> Has to be always valid   -> Success if invalid
   -> Failed  if invalid

So I guess something like

=============================


I put together some examples. It doesn't mean it has to be like that.

:validatorResult points to an URI
valid
invalid
nocharset

Which is the expected result of the validator. So if the test says that 
the result should be "nocharset" and the validator validates the file 
without complaining about the charset. The test didn't pass.

Are the information about the test itself should be inside the test 
itself? At first we could say yes thinking in terms of HTML, but it 
will mean we will have to define of describing metadata for each kind 
of markup. It might be easier to put this information in the n3 file.

reference could be one or more reference to understand the context of 
the test itself. People who have submitted, references in the specs, 
discussions about the tests.


There is quite a huge number of tests in the HTML 4.01 Test Suite as 
well.
