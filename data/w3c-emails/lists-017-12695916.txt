I meant to describe the test.
Using as a basis for a Test Description Language, though obviously not 
its primary purpose, has some appeal, because most if not all of the 
needed concepts are there already.

There is actually one more dimension, which is the "regular" result 
given by the current validator. I suppose we could keep those apart as 
a list of assertions with the assertor being 
<http://validator.w3.org/check> a earl:Tool.

nocharset is included in invalid ;)
I'd rather have the result be either valid or invalid, and add a result 
property stating why it wasinvalid (charset, doctype, etc.)

I think so too. Besides for some tests we may want to have no test or 
comment whatsoever inside, to test a specific case.

Then I would distinguish reference as in "Reference specification(s)" 
(may be multiple in case of mixed namespaces) and reference as in "see 
also".

Right. We're definitely not lacking test documents, but we're seriously 
lacking some organization for them :)

Thanks a lot, your examples and suggestions help me a lot.
