Ville, (and everyone),

Can you give this a look and help me improve this release text by tomorrow? 
It is loosely based on the text that was sent at the time of the beta
test, back at the end of february.

[P.S : accents not working well on this machine, I'll add them for the
proper announcement]

Thank you.
