Looks good to me as is, thanks!  I trust you or someone with appropriate
rights will update the production version to 3.9.2 tomorrow before
sending the announcement?

3.9.2 has entered CPAN a few minutes ago, for now it's visible at
https://pause.perl.org/pub/PAUSE/authors/id/S/SC/SCOP/.  I believe
http://search.cpan.org/dist/W3C-LinkChecker/ will start working as
expected soonish.
