Hi all.

First, warm congratulations to Ville for leading the work through this  
release.
We are yet to receive feedback, but this packaging of checklink will be  
a great benefit for many.

I have announced the release to the www-validator as well as the  
education list of W3C/QA, and posted announcements on the QA homepage  
and the Open Source software page. Another announcement has also been  
posted on the W3C homepage, which is excellent news.

Installation on v.w.o went well. I downloaded and installed the package  
as anyone would be, and replaced the old checklink with a link to the  
new one.

The only minor issue was with checklink.html (etc.). There is already a  
redirect from the old checklink page at  
http://www.w3.org/2000/07/checklink to  
http://validator.w3.org/docs/checklink, and even though I could have  
redirected them both to  
dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/perl/modules/W3C/LinkChecker/docs/ 
checklink.html?content-type=text/html;%20charset=utf-8 apparently  
apache does not like these characters in a redirect and I preferred,  
for the moment, to update directly the files in /docs/. The issue there  
was that there are checklink.html and checklink.css... Bad idea,  
triggers content negotiation on non equivalent resources. I renamed the  
CSS and all went well.

One thing I wondered when installing was whether checklink's config  
needed to be tweaked through a .conf or not. Tell me if that needs to  
be done.

Now I think we can wait for feedback, and start thinking/working on  
ripping it apart (ha!).
I'm personnally very interested by a modular approach, since an API  
would make it easy to make a checklink plugin for the Log Validator.

Cheers!
