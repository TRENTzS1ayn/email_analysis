Yep, nice!

I was thinking about this a bit as well.  There might be a better
location than the cvsweb one to redirect to, for example
http://search.cpan.org/dist/W3C-LinkChecker/docs/checklink.html

Anyway, I will change the documentation link to point to
http://www.w3.org/2000/07/checklink again now that it points to an up to
date version of the doc.

Regarding renaming the CSS, do you think it should be done in the
distribution too, and what should it be renamed to?  Something that does
not conflict with the validator's files, obviously.

For the general purpose public version, no .conf is needed.  On the
other hand, if there are some W3C users who wish to have the basic
authentication forwarded to all of w3.org instead of the host of the
first document to be checked only, that would need a version which sets
the "Trusted" regexp in checklink.conf, and probably a W3C-only instance
of the checker.  I will clarify the docs on this, BTW.

My current plan is to make one more release without any drastic
structural changes, incorporating various smaller bits I have on my TODO
list.  And then, start modularizing and adding "new cool stuff".

I have not thought about the public API yet at all, but done some work
on internal handlers and plug-ins.  Do you have ideas what kind of link
checker API you would like for the log validator?  SAX-like event-based,
something else?
