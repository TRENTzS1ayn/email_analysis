Hello,

Reminder: We're having our regular IRC meeting tomorrow.

Venue: #validator on freenode
Time: 17:00 CET (18:00 EET)
http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html? 
year=2004&month=4&day=6&hour=15&min=0&sec=0

Agenda:
I haven't seen news from Dodji yet, so I assume he did not have time to  
implement what we discussed last meeting. I'm therefore tempted by the  
following agenda:

* Checklink:
  - lessons learned from release
  - making checklink (tool) and checklink (service on w3.org) behave  
nicely
  - what next

* Markup Validator:
  - Scheduling beta + release - now?
  - the cataloguing issue
  - what's next

OK for 1h30, everyone? or do you think we'll need 2h? Also, please  
suggest agenda items if you think I missed anything.
