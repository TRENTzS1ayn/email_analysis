Hey,

Sorry for my silence.

I went forward in the plan we defined.
Now, libcroco provides parsing location (line/col/byte offset) for all
the CSS language constructions available at the SAC level.
I haven't started to work on the structured error reporting 
architecture yet.

You still can start testing the library.

I use GNU ARCH as source control management in development mode.
The GNOME CVS is just a stable repository where a merge code from the 
GNU arch
repository from time to time.

To know how to access the public GNU ARCH source archive of libcroco 
you can
read 
http://mail.gnome.org/archives/libcroco-list/2004-March/msg00011.html .

Cheers,

Dodji.
