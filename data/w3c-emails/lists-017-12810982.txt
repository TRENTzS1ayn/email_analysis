Upon recommendation from Bjoern, I installed cvs-syncmail instead of 
the crude mechanism that was sending info to www-validator-cvs. I also 
configured it for the CSS Validator, Link Checker (new repository) and 
Log Validator.

I am not a regular user of syncmail, so if you have any preference for 
its options, tell me.
