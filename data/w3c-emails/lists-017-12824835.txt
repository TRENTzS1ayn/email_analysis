as Ville wrote to me, this is not clear, if not completely wrong. I am  
admittedly lost in timezones and summer time shift...

So to be clear, this will be
16:00 UK,
17:00 France / Norway,
18:00 Finland,
24:00 Japan.

I should indeed give a reference time in UTC next time.

Hope to talk to all of you then.
