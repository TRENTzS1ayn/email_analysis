  Bjoern yesterday helped me find the reason for that...

It seems that perl -T does not like our usage of IPC::Open3 in the :80 
instance.

Apparently -T has become even more paranoid with version 5.8 and we're 
not the only ones to have had such an issue.

=> We'll probably have to wait until the upcoming release (which seems 
to work fine even with -T) before we "migrate" w.v.o to this new box.

Thoughts, or further analysis, welcome, off-list if necessary.
