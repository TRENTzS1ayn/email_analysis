This does not seem to be the case at least for check v1.305.2.84 on
Win32 / ActiveState Perl v5.8.2. Hmm, check v1.305.2.12 (that should
be :80...) appears to have no problem with -T except that I would get

  open3: IO::Pipe: Can't spawn-NOWAIT: Bad file descriptor at check ...

there too. Hmm, in v1.305.2.84 we have

  # Launder data for Perl 5.8+ taint mode, trusting the config...
  $v =~ /^(.*)$/;
  $cfg{$k} = $1;

Hmm, of course, now I am unable to reproduce prior Insecure dependency
fatal errors with v1.305.2.84... though I still get 

  open3: IO::Pipe: Can't spawn-NOWAIT: Bad file descriptor at check ...

Interesting. So it appears that copy & paste read_cfg() from v1.305.2.85
(latest) to v1.305.2.12 (:80) would fix the problem on non-Win32...
