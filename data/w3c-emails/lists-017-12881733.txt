Hm, possibly a stupid question, but do you know why is any "cmd.exe"
needed in the first place?  I thought that when doing a system(),
exec(), open3() and friends with the arguments properly split and passed
in as a list would avoid the need for a shell/command interpreter.  Or
is this different in Windows?

If the ":80 version" already has the IPC::Run stuff in place, could you
try with that instead of IPC::Open3, and see if it works better?  It'll
need commenting out a mod_perl check near the first occurrence of
$HAVE_IPC_RUN, and of course installing it :)
