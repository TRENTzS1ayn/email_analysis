Due to a thinko in link checker version 3.9.2, the default configuration
options are not set if there's no configuration file.  This has been
fixed in CVS, and the workaround for the current version should be a
matter of this on v.w.o (as root, and the file must have size > 0):

  # echo '#' > /etc/w3c/checklink.conf

Could someone take care of this?  TIA!
