Hi,

I have gone through CVS logs since 0.6.5 beta 1 and usedd that to 
create an entry for whatsnew.html in preparation for a beta2 this 
friday... If all goes well and if you agree that we can go ahead.

I have tagged everything as 0_6_5-beta2.

My question(s) (especially for Ville and Terje, who made most of the 
modifications since beta1)... Do you think we can go forward? Did I 
forget anything in the "small" changelog (in whatsnew)? Any last minute 
modification you want to do before we move on with this beta?
