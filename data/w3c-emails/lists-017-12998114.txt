I believe it's soon time to release Link Checker 3.9.3.  The only
showstopper (unless I've missed something) is the presentation of the
"forbidden by robots.txt" cases, which are now treated as 403's, with
screaming red background.

So apart from that, for all your urgent link checking needs, this one
could use some testing: http://qa-dev.w3.org/wlc/checklink :)
