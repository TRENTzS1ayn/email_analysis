Hello Michel,

Regarding the SHOULD vs. MAY for the use of punycode in the conversion
from IRIs to URIs, I have created an issue (punycodeSHOULD-23), and
based on the discussion, in particular also Larry's comment, I have
chosen to make a compromize. The text now says 'MAY' in the general
case, but then says "This conversion SHOULD be used when the goal is to
maximize interoperability with legacy URI resolvers."
(where the second part of this sentence is from Roy's draft).

Please tell me if that's acceptable for you.

Regards,    Martin.
