Hi,

  The layout of e.g.

? http://qa-dev.w3.org/wmvs/0.6/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com&verbose=0

still suffers from <http://www.google.com/search?q=guillotine+bug> in
Internet Explorer/Windows. Elements jump around when hovering links and
it causes the scrollbar to flicker. Terje said some time ago the latest
fixes weren't in CVS, is this still the case? Or were there any new
"fixes"?

regards.
