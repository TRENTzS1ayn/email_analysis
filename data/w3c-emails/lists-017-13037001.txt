Hmm, I heard of it but since my windows machine won't work any more, I 
can't really test and fix.

Given that 0-6-5b2 is mostly about presentation, layout and 
documentation, I am going forward with it today, the beta test period 
will be used for fixing CSS bugs with a larger pool of 
browsers/platform that we had when coding the CSS changes.

And AFAIK, http://qa-dev.w3.org/wmvs/0.6/ (and CVS) has all the latest 
CSS code. Terje commited his a short while ago.
