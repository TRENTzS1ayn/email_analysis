I asked myself similar questions when working on the beta2 recently. I 
think the current (annoying, perhaps) display of "can you find a better 
explanation" could be made less visible when we move to release. In the 
meantime, if seeing it motivates people to contribute more explanation 
messages, good for us and them.

As for the format, I (as main editor of the messages, at least 
recently) would also be happier with a simpler design for the file.

I wish I had more ideas for the "help wanted". The list isn't such a 
bad thing for that purpose, especially given how few we receive.

Ideas welcome, I may tweak the code, though certainly not today...
