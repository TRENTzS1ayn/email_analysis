The current "Help Wanted" blurb was always intended to only be there for the
Beta. For production the intent was to either remove it completely or tone it
down to one short sentence/link.

The format of the file is what Config::General uses, and is supposed to be
reminiscent of Apache config file syntax. Using a homebrew config parser is
not an option as far as I'm concerned (BTDT), and since we need
Config::General for the other config files it makes little sense to have a
custom parser for just the verbose messages resource file.

However, the Config::General syntax is very flexible so it may well be that we
can do what you want even within those confines.
