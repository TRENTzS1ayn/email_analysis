I have just installed LWP 5.79 on qa-dev. Maybe we can check for a day 
or two whether that causes no problem with either the validator or 
checklink, and proceed with a beta (with 5.79 installed on w.v.o) 
within a couple days?

I just tested the new feature (and style for the robots exclusion) and 
it seems to work fine, great job.

I still find it frustrating that the link checker HAS to follow 
robots.txt and telling users to check links manually, even in non 
recursive mode, but I reckon I am against the majority here, and I 
should probably just accept I am wrong and shut up ;)
