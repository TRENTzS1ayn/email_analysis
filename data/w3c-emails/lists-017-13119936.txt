Given the answers I received, we should try and have a meeting 
today/tomorrow (April 20th), half an hour after last time's schedule, 
which should be, if I am not mistaken:

16:30 UK,
17:30 France / Germany / Norway,
18:30 Finland,
24:30 Japan.

Venue as usual : #validator on irc.freenode.net

Apologies for the late confirmation... I am not sure everyone will see 
this message in time and/or will be able to join, so we will have an 
ad-hoc agenda.

Hope you can make it.
