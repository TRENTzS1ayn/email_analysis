If you are referring to the SECURITY_HOLE_PASS_AUTHORIZATION #define,
I'm pretty sure that distributors like Red Hat do not build their Apache
with it set...

I thought that the mod_rewrite hack deployed on v.w.o (and now at
qa-dev) should work everywhere.  It does here, anyway; and without the
hack, $ENV{HTTP_AUTHORIZATION} is never populated.

Yep, eg. under mod_perl one can do $r->header_in('Authorization').  This
is already done in checklink but it won't obviously work when it is run
as a ordinary CGI script.
