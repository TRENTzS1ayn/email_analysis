Hi Yves, Philippe.

A while ago I remember discussing the installation of an instance of 
the CSS validator on the qa-dev.w3.org test server. I wonder what the 
progress is on that.

Currently, the server has auto-cvs-updated instances of both the Markup 
Validator and Link Checker, which I find very handy to see and show 
modifications made in CVS.

As you may have heard, the Spanish W3C office is willing to take care 
of the translation of the interfaces of our validators, and asked 
whether there was such a test instance for them to check their work. I 
believe an instance on qa-dev.w3.org would do that job.

If you still agree it's a good idea, please tell me how I can help you 
with this.
