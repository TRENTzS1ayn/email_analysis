I've added

  a { position: relative }

to (my local copy of) base.css and removed

  fieldset { margin-bottom: 3em }

from it. This seems to fix these layout issues. Instead we could have a
<br /> after the fieldsets in question, for example. Otherwise, removing
all :hover { background-color } rules should fix it, too.
