Folks,

Our next meeting should be, if we stick to the biweekly schedule, next 
tuesday. However, that day being a holiday in Japan, I do not know yet 
whether I will be available for a meeting. I also remember Terje saying 
he'd be busy at that time too.

Maybe we could postpone to may 11th? I'll be in a f2f meeting in 
Montreal but shoud be able to take a couple of hours of reasonable 
attention to an IRC meeting. Or we could stick with our schedule and 
see how things evolve.

Thoughts welcome.
