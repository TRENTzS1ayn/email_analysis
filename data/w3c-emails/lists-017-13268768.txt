Hi.

We're scheduled for a beta3 of the Markup Validator this friday.

I believe, but would like to have your confirmation, that since 
Bjoern's patch seems to have fixed the display bug and since Terje 
solved the righthand navbar issue, we are happy to move forward.

I have already tagged all the files for the beta release. should you 
make any modification before friday, and you want them to appear in the 
beta, don't forget to 'cvs tag -F validator-0_6_5-beta3'
