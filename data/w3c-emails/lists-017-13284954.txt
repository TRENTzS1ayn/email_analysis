In the beta version, the version number is already given in the header. You've
added it to the footer of the beta version. IOW, the version in the footer is
redundant.

I'd also say that adding it to current production is pointless provided we
make our release target of next Thursday; since current beta -- which has the
version number -- then becomes current prod.
