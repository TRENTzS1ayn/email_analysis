The header has some wonkyness with the height of the background image vs. the
height of the W3C and QA logos. The top border of the horizontal navbar needs
to overlap the black bottom (non-CSS) border of the W3C logo. The header
should probably have a top border overlapping the W3C logo's top (non-CSS)
border.

The Error Listing and the Source Display sections -- that I've checked -- on
the results page needs a small left/right margin. The footer needs to have a
top-margin to avoid it smushing whatever is at the bottom of the page (e.g. on
the results page). The left text in the footer needs a small margin to be
legible.

And if we can find a way to do it without reintroducing the Guillotine
trouble, we should push some whitespave in between the two fieldsets on the
front page.
