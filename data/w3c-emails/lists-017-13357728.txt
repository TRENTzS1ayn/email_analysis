I wish the W3C logo had no border at all. I fixed some of the issues by 
putting the bottom border for the banner div rather than the h1.

Source display: indeed. I gave it a bit of air by removing the "auto" 
margins (hope they were not set to avoid a bug with some kind of 
source, though my short tests did not show anything special). For the 
error listing, looks OK

Done and done.
The margin and padding for the footer had been redefined and set to 0, 
I cleaned that part of the CSS a bit.

I was finding it a bit big, and Bjoern seems to dislike it too.
I tried to see if we could tone it down a bit (and while doing so got 
semantically pedantic and removed the version info out of the h1 - 
though I'm having doubts now). I have removed the version info from the 
footer, for now at least.
