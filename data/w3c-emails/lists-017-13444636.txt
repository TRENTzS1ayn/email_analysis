Given the few answers I got, The following seems like a good schedule 
to try at least once.

irc://freenode#validator
tuesday, Feb. 3rd 17:00 CET (18:00 EET, 11:00 Boston/Montreal)
for two hours (or till I fall asleep)

Agenda ideas:
  - recent progress /work
  - Bjoern's CSS schema
  - validators' test suites

agenda additions welcome if you think that won't be enough.
