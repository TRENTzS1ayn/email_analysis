  -> new dependency on the Net::IP CPAN module
- Markup improvements
- Documentation improvements (command line options, embedded man page)
- Various other small bug fixes

> Future work: tearing apart / modularizing.

I have started some initial work on this, implementing some per-document
type (ie. MIME type) based handlers, akin to HTML::LinkExtor, using a
factory pattern.  Currently first cut implementations exist for generic
XML documents (XML Base, XLink, XInclude) and CSS (using CSS::SAC which
is currently broken for url(...) property values -> only @import's
work).

Only the handlers are implemented currently, checklink does not even use
them yet.  Will continue that development and post betas for discussion
after the next "production" checklink is out and modularization
officially starts.
