Do you mean a test case for HTML 4.01 is only an HTML 4.01 document, 
like a Web page.

So here come the mess, when you have to test things like conflicting 
encoding or conflicting mime-type.
An utf-8 document served as iso-8859-1
An XHTML 1.1 document served as text/html

These two cases can't be treated only as one document. It can be a 
combination of two documents.
- .htaccess
- test-case-encoding-xhgn001.html

A way to have a trace somewhere that there's an additional information 
for this test case is important.
