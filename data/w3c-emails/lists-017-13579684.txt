Well, I had the impression that the packaging separation would happen
after this release, but now I am comfortably leaning towards making it
happen already for this version :)

So, a TODO list follows:

CPAN distribution name:  Currently the perl packages inside the script
are W3C::UserAgent and W3C::CheckLink::*, but I think W3C-LinkChecker
would be good so it is similar to W3C::Validator (which doesn't exist
yet :) and W3C::LogValidator.  checklink is IMO fine as the script name,
but perhaps change to W3C::LinkChecker::* hierarchy when modularizing
(for the link checker specific parts).

CPAN distribution dir:  I am fine with using my CPAN dir (account SCOP)
or something else.

When agreed on the CPAN distribution name and location, CPAN namespace
registration.  If you agree on W3C-LinkChecker and my account, just let
me know and I can take care of the "paper"work.

CVS organization:  a CPAN-like distribution layout would be good. 
Should there be a new top-level directory on dev.w3.org, or a subdir
under eg perl/modules/W3C/LinkChecker/ for consistency with
LogValidator? 

Other stuff which I'll take care of: $VERSION when/if moving the script
to a new location under CVS, documentation updates.
