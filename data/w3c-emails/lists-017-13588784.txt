Agreed. W3C::LinkChecker is good.

CPAN dir can change as needed (e.g. Perl itself follows the current Pumpking);
using your dir makes sense since you're the one maintaining it.

I'm loath to implement too deep directory structures, but in this case I think
it makes sense to keep it under $CVSROOT/perl/modules/W3C/LinkChecker/. Not
the least reason for which is that I foresee the modularized Markup Validator
keeping its modules there while the Markup Validator itself (i.e. check, the
config files, etc.) live on in the ??validator?? module; at least until the
modularized code is stable, but possibly indefinitely.

We'd best define a CVS module for ??LinkChecker?? though, so we don't force
people to pull from seven subdirectories deep.
