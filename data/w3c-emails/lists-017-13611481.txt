...and the first test version of checklink as a CPAN distribution is
available for testing at http://koti.welho.com/vskytta/W3C-LinkChecker/

Known issues:
- Some broken links :)
- Documentation needs to be improved

Regarding the release, I will be away from computers (vacation) for two
weeks starting next Saturday (28 Feb).  I would like to proceed with the
following plan: fix the reported issues when I'm back, finish the
packaging and CVS reorganization, and arrange a quick new testing
session for a couple of days using the packaged version running at
:8001.
