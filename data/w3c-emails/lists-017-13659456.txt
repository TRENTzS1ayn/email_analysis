I remembered having a look at bundles a while ago but did not remember
in details, thanks a lot for the pointer to the documentation.

Excellent!

No clear preference. I created that CPAN account for qa-dev stuff
(maybe, on second thought, I should have created it under a generic
name, not mine) so this would be a good candidate, but I definitely
don't mind if you think it's more convenient for you to upload them with
your account.
