Sure, I agree with all of the above.

Indeed. Which does not preclude us from updating the credits in the HTML
documentation.

While we're at it... You wrote in another thread :

I think I misunderstood it at first, but my understanding of it, now, is
that unlike the validator (with its dependencies) checklink could be
distributed as a CPAN module and not just a bundle to take care of
dependencies, right? (though I reckon that the config file might be an
issue).

Won't be a problem.

I must confess partial ignorance of this trusted domain. I know from the
code that this trusted domain will be passed authentication information,
but I am still fuzzy on the details. The current prod version does seem
to forward authentication to my private domain even though it is not at
w3.org, so maybe I am missing the point.

I remember a thread back in early 2003 about this parameter, and as far
as I know there was no clear outcome.
[searching archives]

There was no answer to my (probably clueless) suggestion at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qa-dev/2003Jan/0018.html
so I gather it is not possible to set a trusted domain in the query
string (makes sense)... In such a case, I need to understand the details
of how having a trusted domain is a problem for other domains, and how
not having one would be an issue for W3C internal use before having a
clear opinion... I think it would be possible, though perhaps sensitive,
to have a specific instance for internal (comma tool) use, though.

Anytime... Though, if there are a lot of new things, I'd like
to publicize the test and subsequent release a bit.
