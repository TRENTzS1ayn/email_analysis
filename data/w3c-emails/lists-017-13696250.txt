Which is why I'm inclined to ditch this behaviour alltogether, in favour of
requiring Apache+mod_perl for the CGI version. Then again, I don't make use of
the auth-proxy feature so I'm kinda ignoring the issue for now.

A requirement for a recompiled (with insecure settings no less) Apache is not
acceptable; except this is for an add-on feature and not basic functionality.


I know Gerald wanted it to behave this way ?????I asked once earlier about
ditching this ??? but I think the main issue is satisfying the underlying needs
(i.e. easy auth for w3.org protected pages) so an alternate approach would
probably do.

Since this is a common need for both the Validator and the Link Checker, and a
well contained piece of code, this might be a perfect opportunity to begin the
modularization and sharing code between the two. W3C::MarkUp::Util::AuthProxy?


Opinions?

enough rope to hang themselves,  but a boobytrapped thermonuclear weapon
running on a rand(time) countdown... Is that really wise? - Me to MS rep.
