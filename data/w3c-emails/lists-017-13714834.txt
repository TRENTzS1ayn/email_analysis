Right. And I'm not writing any code these days so I'm not proposing this for
immediate implementation unless someone else wants to take it on. But this
looked like a good place to start when we eventually get to that point, and it
wouldn't hurt to keep that in mind while doing other stuff in the code.

It's just been a while since I looked at that code ??? as I mentioned, it was
while Gerald was still actively involved ??? so I'm not sure my asessment of the
feasability is correct.
