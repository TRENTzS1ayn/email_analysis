Good.
Reading my IRC backlog I noticed that it wasn't best for nighttime 
folks... True. I suggested, however, early afternoon (and not morning) 
europe time for that purpose, though not too late so that it wouldn't

talk, though :)

Yes, was on my list, along with "current progress" and modularization, 
although I think at least the latter can be discussed on the list for a 
while since there is no urgency - and other more urgent things.

Karl has on his someday pile to look at all the cases in the HTML spec 
that are not covered by DTD validation, so that's indeed a topic worth 
discussing - extending "fussy" parsing.
