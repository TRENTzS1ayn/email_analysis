FYI: /home/link/validator/htdocs/detailed-form.html was not executable,
that's why.  To avoid this in the future, maybe:

Someone with shell access to the CVS repository, do a "chmod +x
detailed-form.html,v".

or IMHO maybe slightly better:

Get rid of the somewhat fragile XBitHack configuration altogether, do an
"AddHandler server-parsed .html" instead for the validator configs, see
httpd/conf/httpd.conf in CVS for an example.
