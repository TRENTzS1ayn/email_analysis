The 2.6 kernel was successfully installed on qa-dev by our local Server 
guru, Daigo Matsubara (Thanks a lot!).

Also, regarding the debian distribution on this machine, I remember 
thinking during the meeting that the distribution was actually, or had 
been, "testing". I was wrong, it is (and probably has been for quite a 
while) "unstable", which should work fine for experiment purposes.

Please contact me if you need anything else.
