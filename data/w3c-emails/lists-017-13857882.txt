Hello everyone,

We'll be having a qa-dev IRC meeting next tuesday.

Notes from last time are at:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qa-dev/2004Jan/0013.html

Ville told me that (even though in general mail worked best for him) 
the only possible times would be 18-24 EET, that is 17-23CET if I'm not 
mistaken. I guess that may also be best for the night folks among us.

Would it thus be possible to hold a quick poll for tuesday's meeting?
Please send me a mail stating your preference:
- 14:00 CET (15:00 EET, 08:00 Boston/Montreal)
- 17:00 CET (18:00 EET, 11:00 Boston/Montreal)

thanks
