Some feedback, I sometimes get

  System Messages
  Error 70007 in connect 
  Error accessing http://bjoern.hoehrmann.de - aborting. 

and if that works it complains

  E: Line 2, char 50, cannot find "html/valet.dtd"; tried . 

This seems to be a problem with -R (or it's C-equivalent). Hmm,

? http://qa-dev.w3.org:8888/validator/validate.v?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbjoern.hoehrmann.de&parser=Xerces&parseMode=web&resultsMode=noerrors

calls me "Bjrn Hhrmann" several times... I am also not too fond of
refusing to process text/html documents with Xerces if that is what
I request... hmm, e.g.

? http://qa-dev.w3.org:8888/validator/validate.v?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2FStyle%2FCSS%2FTest%2FCSS3%2FSelectors%2F20040510%2Fxhtml%2Ftests%2Fcss3-modsel-134.xml&parser=Xerces&parseMode=web&resultsMode=noerrors

it removes the namespace declarations, is this intentional? I am also
not sure whether stating

  Content type suggests XML, but the document doesn't look like XML

there is such a good idea...

It says

  Parse Options Force=NO, Schema=NO, Namespace=NO 

and then

  Result Not well-formed 
  ...
? 1. fatal: Line 21, char 65, The prefix 'a' has not been mapped to any URI. 
? 2. fatal: Line 22, char 62, The prefix 'a' has not been mapped to any URI. 
? 3. fatal: Line 23, char 62, The prefix 'b' has not been mapped to any URI. 
? 4. fatal: Line 24, char 59, The prefix 'b' has not been mapped to any URI. 

which are namespace errors, the document *is* well-formed without
namespace processing!?
