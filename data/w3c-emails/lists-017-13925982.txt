To: QA Dev<public-qa-dev@w3.org>


I have committed the stuff I had on my mind for link checker 3.9.3. 
http://qa-dev.w3.org/wlc/checklink is up to date.

Regarding the beta announcement, I would like to request feedback in
particular of the following (feel free to rephrase, comment, and add
items):

- Robots exclusion standard support in the link checker.  Good or bad?

- Should the "Check linked documents recursively" checkbox be removed?
  Recursion is implicit if there's anything in the "depth" field, so
  the checkbox is sort of redundant.

Changelog since 3.9.2 is attached.  The corresponding in-a-nutshell, or
NEWS-like list (excluding command line only changes) would be something
like:

- Support for the robots exclusion standard has been added.
- Sleep 1 second between requests to servers.
- Cookie handling logic is now more robust and predictable.
- Harmonized layout with the Markup Validator.
- Do not send an Accept-Language header at all if the client did not
  send us one.  Previously, "Accept-Language: *" was sent by default.
- Miscellaneous markup, layout, and documentation improvements, minor
  bug fixes and warning cleanups.

front page.  This should make the effect of the cookie more
predictable.

depth.

such a URI" message.

2004-05-14  ot

* docs/checklink.html, docs/linkchecker.css: quick attempt at

service, an idea would be to keep some of its inline style + a link
to the stylesheet in the repository.

2004-05-10  ville

implementations without String.search().

http://validator.w3.org/checklink in command line HTML mode.
Thanks to James Gallagher for the report.

2004-04-20  ville

instructions how to allow us in /robots.txt, and include a link to
it in the results.

2004-04-19  ville

* bin/checklink: Implement "better" (yet somewhat hacky) handling
of non-HTTP error codes, currently used for "forbidden by
robots.txt" and "bad hostname" messages from LWP.  While at it,
display "forbidden by robots.txt" with a light gray background (CVS
class "dubious") instead of screaming-red-403.

2004-04-17  ville

* t/00compile.t: Add a _very_ basic "test suite".

2004-04-12  ville

receive a reason phrase in the response status line.

2004-04-11  ville

* docs/checklink.html: Redirect loops are no longer a problem with
the link checker and libwww-perl 5.76 (but redirects to file: URLs
still are).

2004-04-11  ville

* bin/checklink, bin/checklink.pod, docs/checklink.html: Make sleep
time between requests to each server configurable in command line
use (-S/--sleep, defaults to 1 second), remove old "sleep 3 seconds
between documents" feature, and show used settings in the results.

2004-04-11  ville

* bin/checklink: Fix typo in results CSS.

2004-04-11  ville

* bin/checklink: Reimplement/replace internal redirect tracking

(HTTP::Response->previous()).  Should be more robust and
RobotUA-friendly now.

2004-04-10  ville

* bin/checklink: Code cleanups.

2004-04-10  ville

* bin/checklink: Eliminate a couple of recently introduced printf()
warnings.

also when there is no configuration file.  D'oh!  Thanks to Rafael
Gieschke for the report.

2004-04-07  ville

* bin/checklink, docs/checklink.html: Initial (partial)
implementation for support for robots exclusion standard.  The UI
still needs some work: the results view should be fixed and some
new configuration options (admin address, minimum delay) should be
added.As a side effect, we now require libwww-perl >= 5.60.

2004-04-04  ville

* bin/checklink, bin/checklink.pod: Do not send any Accept-Language
header by default in command line mode, and don't default to "*" in
CGI mode either (but still use the client-supplied value if
present).  In command line mode, -L auto now autodetects a value
from the environment, and the -n/--noacclanguage option is
deprecated and does nothing.

improvements to argument and configuration option checking and
error reporting.
