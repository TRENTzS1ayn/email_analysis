Thanks for doing all that. I'm in the process of setting it up on 
vwo:8001

I've used the opportunity for a minimal cleanup of the file structure. 
Many checklink files still had to be within the validator tree, even 
though they're not in CVS ther eany more.

What I have done:

* http://validator.w3.org:8001/checklink is now aliased as follows:
   ScriptAlias /checklink 
/usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/LinkChecker/bin/checklink

* Whereas http://validator.w3.org/checklink points to:
   ScriptAlias /checklink        /usr/local/bin/checklink

* removed symlinks and stale copies in httpd/cgi-bin/

* on both :80 and :8001 htdocs/docs/checklink.html and linkchecker.css 
are symlinked to the docs in 
/usr/local/perl/modules/W3C/LinkChecker/docs/


This should allow us to "make install" when we want to update :80 and 
cvs-up when dealing with :8001. This seems reasonable, although there 
might be @INC issues when we modularize. We may want to think of this 
in advance.

I just noticed a small issue with the relative URIs for the images. 
checklink.html tries to access images in ".". Maybe we could replicate 
the directory structure of the validator and put images in images/, 
docs in docs/ and have the docs refer to "../images/foo" ?
