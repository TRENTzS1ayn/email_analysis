The feeback request (with the clarifications in your other mail), along 
with the changelog, should be perfect to create the announcement. given 
it's a beta and we mainly want feedback, there does not seem to be no 
need for specific formality in the announcement.

depending on my time this afternoon I may send you a draft 
announcement, but if I don't have the time, I'll take the material we 
have already, with minor rewording maybe, tomorrow morning (my time).
