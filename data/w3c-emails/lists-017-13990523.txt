A well-chosen "SetEnv PERL5LIB" in httpd.conf should work.  OTOH it
needs to be checked whether that works with taint mode.

Maybe, but that would mean a bit of extra work for folks installing the
link checker (docs) locally, and the doc couldn't any more be installed
to /checklink.html (theoretically /../images might not "work").  Not big
issues, but before changing, we should be really sure that the new setup
is "correct" and that we don't have to change soon again.
