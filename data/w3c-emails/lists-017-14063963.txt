Interesting, though tricky, topic. We're just discussing about it on 
the IRC channel now, and unless you work on a given panel of pages, 
it's difficult to achieve.

True, when I first made the page I first listed the people who had 
accounts on the qa-dev test server, then added other significant 
contributors. Merged now as people's contribution normally tends to 
fluctuate anyway, any attempt at a classification is silly.

Not sure there is an equitable way anyway, but you had a point.
