Here are notes from our meeting last week. Sorry for the delay in 
sending these. I am also attaching the log of the IRC discussion, for 
reference.

* Participants : Bjoern, Nick, Terje, Dodji (guest / libcroco), Yves, 
olivier

* Action Items review
 From http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qa-dev/2004Feb/0002.html
Remaining AIs:
AI (cont): Nick - investigate Apache2+modperl, play with :8001;
AI (new): Nick - demo test harness

* Agenda: CSS parser / LibCroco

Dodji, maintainer of libcroco (CSS parser) joined the meeting for a 
chat on what kind of features a CSS parser would need to suit our needs 
for a next-generation CSS validator. Bjoern and Nick listed their 
desiderata, including, mostly, robust parsing, error recovery, precise 
errors (file, line, col, type). Dodji will start implementing this, and 
joins the qa-dev mailing-list for further discussion.

* Agenda: Test

Short report from olivier on the state of requirements list. We need to 
discuss this a bit further. Wiki not very popular among participants, 
we will continue the discussion on the mailing-list, instead. Nick 
thinks catalogmanager could be useful, may send his ideas to the list.
