+1.  Then there's the issue how to mark docs that produce
errors/warnings in fussy mode.  If I've understood correctly, some
documents may be currently marked "not valid" even though technically
they are valid, and the reported issues are due to fussiness only.  If
this is correct, perhaps add an explanation and never say "not valid" in
fussy mode?  Apologies if this is already taken care of, I haven't
checked for a while.
