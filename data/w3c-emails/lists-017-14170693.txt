http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/ resolved everything in this
regard, as far as I am concerned. Long before this "fussy" thingy has
been added to the W3C MarkUp Validator, actually. -wfully-tagged is not
of any use for the community as long as it complains about all <table>
elements without a <tbody> inside. -wmin-tag should certainly be the
default and rewrite its errors to warnings, see the WDG Validator.

I do not care much what happens on a port != 80, but I would like to
point out that I consider the beta highlighting behavior unusable, see
<http://validator.w3.org:8001/check?uri=http://msdn.microsoft.com> vs.
<http://validator.w3.org:80/check?uri=http://msdn.microsoft.com>.
