Hello Chris,

I have added a new paragraph to section 7.8 of the IRI spec, reading
as follows:

 >>>>>>>>
It is often possible to reduce the effort and dependencies for upgrading
to IRIs by using UTF-8 rather than another encoding where there is a free
choice of encodings. For example, when setting up a new file-based Web
server, using UTF-8 as the encoding of the file names will make the
transition to IRIs easier. Likewise, when setting up a new Web form
using UTF-8 as the encoding of the form page, the returned query
URIs will use UTF-8 as an encoding and will therefore be compatible
with IRIs.
 >>>>>>>>

This is to cover the issue queryclarify-16, and it also gives
some more information with regards to UTF-8. When this section
was originally written (which was one of the very early drafts,
if I remember correctly), browsers and other clients that
understood UTF-8 were not very widely available, so this advice
was not appropriate, but this has clearly changed in the meantime.

I have marked this issue as tentatively closed.

Regards,    Martin.
