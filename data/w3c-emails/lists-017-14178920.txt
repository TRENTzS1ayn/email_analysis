"Parsing [url] in [****] mode"
"Result: [pass|fail] (approx. n messages)"
IF mode has extra warnings:
"Note: parsing in [mode] mode generates additional warnings
over and above technical validation errors."

If we term it pass/fail, we avoid that problem by not applying the
word valid or invalid to a document.  Problem solved.

But I still think we need a sensible warnings mode.
onsgmls -wmin-tag (as used in Valet Web mode and htmlhelp "warnings")
is IMNSHO the most useful for most of our users (except Jukka).
