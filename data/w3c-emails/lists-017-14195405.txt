Regarding http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=297


The main problem, it seems is that sgml-lib and packages such as 
sgml-data have different directory structures (the latter separates 
sgml and xml), and a different catalog (as Ville was noting earlier).

Am I being naive in thinking that Nick's catalogue manager would solve 
at least part of this issue?

http://valet.webthing.com/catalogue/

I remember that some people in the W3C team did not like the idea, 
because ideally (if I remember correctly) this kind of catalogue should 
not exist, and we should be using URIs. That seems to be the exact 
opposite idea than the one behind the -R switch in onsgmls.

I'll try to bring people here to discuss this topic, which I admit I do 
not master.
