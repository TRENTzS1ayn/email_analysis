Ah, must be that time of the release cycle when the Debian stable loses
its "b". I note that wasabi, where my test instance resides, has been
running 5.76-2 for a while without trouble.

Do you think it is dangerous to just install the deb testing package and
that we should carefully test on :8001 first?
