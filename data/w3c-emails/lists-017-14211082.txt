This is excellent. I tried to "foolproof" it by impersonating a 
first-time user (and impatient). giving each document only a few 
seconds to convince. The "I want to install and use the commandline 
version" and "I want that in my CGIs" scenarios worked well (Thanks to 
the fact that most of the info is both in the README and html 
documentation). So the packaging is solid.

I tried the commandline version for the first time (I should really 
have done that better) and was a bit confused at first (still 
impersonating - easy this time - the impatient newbie...). (no 
readline?)

'/usr/bin/checklink' and '/usr/bin/checklink -h' gave me respectively 
nothing and a chunk of HTML (not a full page). I know, this is not 
something anyone will do after reading the doc, but improving this 
could be a wishlist item for a future version.

No blocker, though, and I think we're good for a first release. OK with 
early next week?

Definitely fine with me too.
