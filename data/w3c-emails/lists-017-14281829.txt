Looks good. I was planning to release and announce on thursday, but 
somehow the idea of announcing a release on an April 1st makes me 
uncomfortable ;).

OK with friday?

I'm thinking of announcing it to QA lists, QA site, W3C Open Source 
site. Will ping people again for a homepage item on w3.org. Also 
thinking of a couple webdesign lists/groups such as wasp/evolt. 
Anything else? CIWAH?

I'll draft an announcement based on the Beta text today.
