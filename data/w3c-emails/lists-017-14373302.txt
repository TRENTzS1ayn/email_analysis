http://koti.welho.com/vskytta/Bundle-W3C-Validator-0.6.5.tar.gz

I have a CPAN bundle ready and namespace registered for
Bundle::W3C::Validator.  It's very close to the one I submitted some
months ago for demoing purposes, changes since that are cleanups only.

Unless there are objections, I'm ready to upload it to CPAN and commit
the stuff somewhere on dev.w3.org.  I'm currently planning to put it to
validator/misc/bundle (on 0_6_0-branch).  Let me know what you think.
