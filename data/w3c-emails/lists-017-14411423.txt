Tomorrow sounds even better now, since the CSS validator has (somehow 
by mistake, I had forgotten to tell Yves I was working on the hTML 
files) been updated and now sports the new style/interface. Will be 
nice to update both services around the same time.

I am still struggling with last-minute issues and decisions... Bjoern 
pointed out that changes I had made today was breaking a well-known 
behaviour (clicking on a label should usually select the button, not go 
to another page), so I reverted that.

I also changed the default to non-verbose on the homepage interface, 
though I think it's OK to leave it preselected for the advanced 
interface and revalidate box. Your opinions welcome by tomorrow, and in 
any case, none of all this is cast in stone.

Below is my - proposed - compiled changelog for the announcement. 
Opinions on this much welcome.

General
- new style, new (simpler) navigation mechanism [ shared with CSS 
validator ]
- Bug tracking system now officially supported 
<http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/>
- updating and expanding catalog of supported character encoding and 
document types

Features / Bug fixes
- additional explanations for error messages in "verbose" mode - 
contributed by the www-validator community -.
- new fallback mechanism when doctype or charset is missing
- fixed broken markup output bugs
- internationalization improvements, other small fixes

Documentation
  - FAQ (NEW, added to the help page) lists a lot of the usual 
validation problems
  - installation documentation (NEW) makes it much easier to install the 
markup validator locally
  - user and developer's documentation (UPDATED)
