(It also breaks keyboard navigation to some extend as you would
select the checkbox, then the label, then the link, etc.)

It would somehow suggest that the results you got in the first place
already *are* verbose and there is no point in re-validating it. I
had similar issues with, AFAIR, the show source checkbox, as it was
unchecked and yet it showed the source.

I think we should not announced that this is "shared" with the CSS
Validator. I for example get the german version of the CSS Validator
by default which is not updated and it's currently a bit unfinished...

We should probably also point out that this is more a maintenance
release than The Next Generation.
