Indeed, forcing source display is yet another "love it or hate it" 
discussion. I wrote (in w-v@, I think, that I did not think the reason 
why it was done in the first place made sense any more since snippets 
of code are given with the errors. So I removed the override. I'll 
note, as David said on w-v today, that all this would indeed be easier 
if we could record users' preferences.
