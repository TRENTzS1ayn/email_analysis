To: QA Dev<public-qa-dev@w3.org>

I finished the release for check v0.6.5 this morning. Apparently 
everything went well, and we're being put on the W3C Homepage as I 
write this. So kudos and thanks for the great work, I am incredibly 
pleased with our progress.

Just after that I discussed with Systeam and we finally decided to 
proceed with the hardware switch for validator.w3.org.

There again, all seems well, but should anything horrible (or just 
annoying) happen while I'm away (I'll be traveling in the next few 
days), please contact either Dom or sysreq@ so that they can fix, or 
revert to the old server.

Thanks
