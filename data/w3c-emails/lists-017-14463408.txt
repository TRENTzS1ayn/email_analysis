*applause*

But could we please use misc/mkrelease.sh for creating the release
tarballs?

It cleans up extra files, fixes permissions and modes inside the
tarballs, and creates the (versioned) directory structure that most of
the world uses, and which the RPM spec file expects (--> the RPM build
is broken at the moment).

Usage:

  $ mkdir foo
  $ cd foo
  $ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public export -r validator-0_6_5 validator
  $ cd validator
  $ misc/mkrelease.sh 0.6.5
  $ ls *.tar.gz
  sgml-lib-0_6_5.tar.gz  validator-0_6_5.tar.gz

I would appreciate it if the release tarballs currently at v.w.o would
be replaced with ones created by this script.
