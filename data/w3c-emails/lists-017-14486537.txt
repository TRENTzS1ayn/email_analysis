All,

a reminder that our next meeting is tomorrow. Following a suggestion 
from Bjoern, we now have a drafty wiki page for QA-dev, where we'll be 
able to all read/edit agenda, action items, etc.

http://esw.w3.org/topic/QaDev

For the reference, tomorrow's meeting will be held
- 16:30 UK,
- 17:30 France / Germany / Norway,
- 18:30 Finland,
- 11:30 Montreal (I'm in Montreal/Boston this week)
