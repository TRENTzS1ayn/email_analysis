I don't know, maybe it's an oversight.  It was introduced in 0.6.5b1:

Ahh... Encode::Guess!  I have been looking for something like this,
thanks for the pointer!  Dunno if it's the right thing to do here
though, we still have the "strong default" of HTTP, ISO-8859-1, for
cases where no encoding is explicitly set.

I think this is just a bug introduced somewhere near the final 0.6.5
release as I don't remember seeing it earlier.

Anyway, there should be an option to override the encoding, cases like
this are annoying:

Ok.

+1
