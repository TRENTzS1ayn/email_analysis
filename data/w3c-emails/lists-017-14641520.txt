I disagree, but I seem to be in the minority so I'll shut up after
this.  If "friendliness" and the core task (or reason for existence, if
you prefer) of the Validator conflict, to me the solution is clear: be
honest, sacrifice friendliness, not validation, to the extent
necessary.  And advertising should not get into the way of fixing known
major bugs or backing out (if that's the best we can do) new known buggy
features.
