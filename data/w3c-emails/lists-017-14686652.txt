+1.  While at it, how about revising the headline a bit more; now it
says "This page", which sounds like it's referring to the validation
results page, not the one checked?  Dunno about the use of the word
"page" either.  But I'm having a hard time coming up with a good and
short enough replacement for the headline that would satisfy all of the
above "requirements".  Perhaps just:

  Validation results ($doctype): pass|fail|tentative

Agreed, but I think this is an improvement worth applying anyway (+ not
only the headline, but also the paragraph below it (c|sh)ould be
rephrased).
