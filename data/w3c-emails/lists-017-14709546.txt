I like the principle and I certainly can see usage scenarios where this 
would be useful. An alternate take un the principle would be a tabbed 
interface (also as hinted on IRC).

I guess the interest of a "vertical" expand-collapse (as opposed to 
tabbed interface) is that we could implement a user-based preference (I 
suppose cookies+scripting would do the trick) and keep some sections 
collapsed and some expanded when validating another page.


Would like to hear others' ideas on this.
