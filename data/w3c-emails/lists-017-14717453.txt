Lets Not Go There??! :-)

Supporting an actual user preference system ??? especially one based on cookies
instead of HTTP Auth + user database ??? is far too much pain compared to the
benefits.

At most I'd consider having UI gizmos for toggling various things that try to
set a cookie and automagically recalls it on later visits[0]. e.g. so that if
you visit a postulated tabbed interface and press the ???Switch to linear
version??? gizmo, a cookie gets set so you get the linear version by default on
next visit.

If you want to get any more fancy than that, we should set up an actual user
registration system ??? with HTTP auth instead of stupid user/pass web forms and
cookie session-ids ??? and go all out with periodic revalidation of pages and a
reminder function ("warn if this page fails to validate three months from
now"), site crawler system, LogValidator run on uploaded logs, etc.




[0] - And if that's all you mean by "Preference" system then I dispute
      the accuracy of your choice of terminology! :-)
