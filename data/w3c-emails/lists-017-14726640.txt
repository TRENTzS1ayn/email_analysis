Yes, and it will quite significantly fuck with core logic in a way that I'm
extremely hesitant to do to the 0.6.6 code. I suggest we get 0.6.6 out the
door first and then issue these changes (including any wording changes on
result pages or the front page blurb) in a 0.6.7 update shortly afterwards.

Hey, lets see if we can get in 3 new Validator versions during WWW2004? :-)
