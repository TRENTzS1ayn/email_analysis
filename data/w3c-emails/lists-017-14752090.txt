sounds good.

Since we're going for at least two other maintenance releases, I'd like 
confirmation of my understanding of our CVS state...

- HEAD is 0.6.5 plus templates code
- 0_6-branch is 0.6.5 plus fixes

If so, I suppose we are going to merge again after 0.6.6 and work on 
0.6.7 in the branch, etc. Would that mean by any chance that we're 
already in a scheme similar to the one explained in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qa-dev/2004Apr/0030.html
?
(Bjoern, have you sent your comments on this?)
