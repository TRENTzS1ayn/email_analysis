Correct; that's what I'm thinking.

Yes. With a couple of caveats...

The merge to HEAD is not complete. While all the code has been brought over
from the validator-0_6_0-branch, not all the resulting breakage has been fixed
yet. And I don't expect anyone has been testing this code much yet (at least,
nobody has sent me notes about the things I know of that are broken).

Also, I'm not entirely certain whether we should immediately
branch+feature-freeze HEAD->0.7 yet; or whether squeezing in a few more
features on HEAD first would be a good idea. I'm still too focussed on 0.6.x
for this to have really gelled in my mind yet. Opinions?

Bah! Spoilsport! How about two then? 0.6.6 ASAP, and 0.6.7 on the 22nd? :-)
