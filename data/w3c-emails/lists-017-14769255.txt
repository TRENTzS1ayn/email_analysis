I suppose it depends on which features you'd be planning on adding. We
have decided to try and release often, and not creep in too many
features for each release. That said, we seem to be embarking in a
rythm where we do several small, low profile maintenance releases (0.6.5
being a notable exception, given its timeframe, for the low-profile
aspect) for one feature-rich release... All of this with our own
viewpoint - what we view as "icing" may be perceived by users as a big
feature. 

Therefore it would probably be OK to take our time for a feature release.
(reasonably so...)

If everyone's happy with the current state of the code we could push 0.6.6 
out as soon as tomorrow. As for 0.6.7 on the 22nd, sure! I just can't
guarantee which month.

Cheers!
