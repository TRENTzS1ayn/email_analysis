Yup, the whole thing was b0rked due to a braino on my part; I'd used "#" as a
comment marker inside an SGML Open Catalog (never ever do "cvs ci" mere hours
before release when you're terminally sleep-deprived).

If you look at <http://qa-dev.w3.org/wmvs/0.6.5/check?uri=http://koti.welho.
com/vskytta/bug705-2.html> and <http://qa-dev.w3.org/wmvs/0.6.6/check?
uri=http://koti.welho.com/vskytta/bug705-2.html> this ought to be fixed now.

Also, <http://qa-dev.w3.org/wmvs/0.6.5/check?uri=http://www.cs.tut.fi/
~jkorpela/test/frames.html> vs. <http://qa-dev.w3.org/wmvs/0.6.6/check?
uri=http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/test/frames.html> ought to indicate that
Jukka's problem is also fixed.

And finally, our favourite test case,
<http://qa-dev.w3.org/wmvs/0.6.5/check?uri=http://www.yahoo.com/> vs.
<http://qa-dev.w3.org/wmvs/0.6.6/check?uri=http://www.yahoo.com/> should give
something meaningfull.


Please double-check this to make sure I haven't missed anything again!


I've moved up the "validator-0_6_6-release" tag to include this fix; now we
just need to get someone to do "cd sgml-lib/ && cvs up sgml.soc" on v.w3.org
and we should be good.


Well, except there seems to be a problem with the stylesheets on v.w3.org.
Olivier: Did you do "cvs up -dP" or just "cvs up" when you updated? (and who
gave you permission to not be available on IRC 24/7 BTW? ;D)

Namespaces and W3C XML Schemas is a giant practical joke,   but I see no
signs of pranksters coming forward with a gleeful smile to announce that
they were just kidding.                              -- Simon St.Laurent
