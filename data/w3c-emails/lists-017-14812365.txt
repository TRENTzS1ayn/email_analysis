Some more thoughts: the error message was "Malformed multipart POST" but
the feedback said "when trying to validate online HTML documents"; that
combination makes no sense to me.  Did the user use upload or URI
submission?

If upload, at least some (old) versions of Opera did have issues with
file uploads, but AFAIK CGI.pm had a workaround for this already in
version 2.89, and v.w.o has 3.01.

If it was validation using a URI, I have no explanation.
