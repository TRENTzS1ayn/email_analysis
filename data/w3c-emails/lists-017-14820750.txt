Except "public"-qa-dev is subscriber-only...

Personally I could live with having Apache on v.w3.org give web-human as the
contact adress ??? it makes sense to me that all web service related issues get
adressed to the same place within the w3.org domain, and the web-human will
presumably direct questions to the right place for v.w3.org as for all other
sections of the greater w3.org site ??? but then it's not me that has to handle
the web-human mail queue so... :-)

These are the same customers you are referring to whom Microsoft thought
would need MS Bob and the Talking Paperclip?   One thing is to give them
enough rope to hang themselves,  but a boobytrapped thermonuclear weapon
running on a rand(time) countdown... Is that really wise? - Me to MS rep.
