Yep.  Attached is a couple of lowly scripts I've used every once in a
while (when bored or something :), first grab some URLs from the access
log on v.w.o:

  ./graburls.sh 3000 > urls.txt

...then transfer urls.txt to my box and replay on a local validator
instance, 'tail -f'ing its error log in another shell:

  ./replay-validator.sh < urls.txt
