[ I'm putting this on the agenda for our IRC meeting tomorrow, BTW]

It was fine as long as we were using the "send feedback" links on 
:8001, but now that they are on :80, even toned down, the number of 
lost users clicking on these links as though they were reaching for a 
floater in a shipwreck is a bit annoying...

I'd rather these messages with "default" subjects were kept for 
tracking of actual suggestions, not calls for help. On the other hand 
of course it's a nice change from the previous favorite subject "bug in 
the validator". Another issue is that this link bypasses the feedback 
page, thus not directing people to the FAQ.

I'd suggest these links go to a (dynamic) page similar to the feedback 
page:
- linking to the FAQ and feedback page for general feedback
- asking to *only* use this service to suggest error message 
explanations
- linking (eventually) to the appropriate mailto:

Other ideas?
