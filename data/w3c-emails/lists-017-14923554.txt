It seems we're slowly getting back to working conditions...

A few things I finally managed to do:
- restarted vwo:8001,
- reinstalled syncmail (twice) (so that we get notifications in 
www-validator-cvs),
- tested and installed the latest verbosemsg.cfg

There are a few issues remaining, but we're getting... somewhere.
