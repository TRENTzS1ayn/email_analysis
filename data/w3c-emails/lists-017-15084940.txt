There has since been another suggestion that a sequence-valued grouping key
should be taken to mean that the same node should be included in more than
one group (analogously to the way xsl:key works). It obviously can't have
both meanings...

I think there is some feeling in the WG that we have hit about the right
level of functionality with xsl:for-each-group and that we don't want to
complicate it any further. If there really are problems that can't be solved
(as distinct from problems that are a little awkward to solve) then we will
certainly look at them.
