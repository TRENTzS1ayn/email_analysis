I am fairly new to XML/XSL, but I have been keeping a list of the most
limiting issues I have encountered with XSL 1.0.  Thankfully it appears
that most of the ones on my list are being addressed by XSL 2.0.

However, one issue that I am encountering more frequently the more I use
XSL is that there is no way to indirectly dereference a variable.  There
is no way to construct or establish the name of variable into a variable
and then dereference the constructed/established name.  In short, there
is no way to dereference a variable (var1) which contains the name of
another variable (var2) to get the value of var2.

I have seen many issues is some the XML/XSL news groups archives related
to users trying to construct a variable name or use some other field to
determine the name of the variable, so I don't believe this problem is
unique to my experience.

Seems like a good candidate for an XSL 2.0 requirement.

Ed Knoll
