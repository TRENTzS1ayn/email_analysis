We do have "xsl:for-each" and "xsl:if" elements. Why
cannot we have "xsl:continue" or "xsl:break" element?
It's so inconvenient without such element cooperating
with "xsl:for-each" and "xsl:if" elements. 
I have encountered this problem while doing a project
using XSLT.
Thank you for your consideration!
Tong
