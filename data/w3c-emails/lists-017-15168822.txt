The instructions you propose would only make sense if <xsl:for-each> were
executed sequentially, that is, if the n'th node is always processed before
the (n+1)th. But the semantics of XSLT are non-sequential; the nodes
selected by xsl:for-each can be processed in any order, or in parallel.
Therefore xsl:break would not make sense.

You can always achieve the same effect by replacing the xsl:for-each with a
recursive template call.
