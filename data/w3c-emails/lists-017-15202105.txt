In section 12.2 of the WD, the last paragraph says that NaNs are less than
any other value (including -INF).  This conflicts with the XML Schema Data
Model description (sections 3.2.4 and 3.2.5), with which XSLT is supposed
to conform, that says that NaNs are greater than all other values
(including +INF).

So, we have two incompatible specs (3 if you count the IEEE 754 spec, 
which says a third thing about NaNs).  Who gets to make them right?
