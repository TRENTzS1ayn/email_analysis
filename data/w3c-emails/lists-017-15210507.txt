In the XPath 2.0 WD, in the Appendix, Section A.2 Precedence Order, the 
precedence of various comparisons are all listed with equal values (4).  
This seems different from XPath 1.0 (Section 3.4), which has Relational 
Expressions at higher priority than Equality Expressions.

Is this intentional? If so, it has been left out of Appendix F, which 
lists known incompatibilities between 1.0 and 2.0.
