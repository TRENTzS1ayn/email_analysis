hello.

a quick look through the xpath 2.0 draft reveals that the underlying 
data model seems to be hardwired to the xml infoset. however, it should 
be extensible, so that infoset extensions could be handled. an example:

http://dret.net/netdret/docs/tikrep148.pdf describes a proposal for an 
xlink data model in terms of infoset contributions. xpath and xslt 
should be designed in a way that this infoset extension could be 
associated with an identifier (for example, a namespace), and then i 
could write an xpath using the new axis selecting link information items 
in a very simple way:

someelement/xlinknamespaceprefix:link::title

theis would select the title property of the link item associated with 
the someelement element. don't take this example literally, but i guess 
you get the picture...

are there any plans to support this kind of data model extensibility? 
please see the following resources for related discussions:

http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200208/msg00831.html

even though i am currently trying to push the issue of defining data 
models in terms of infoset extensions (in particular, an xlink data 
model), it is pretty hard to keep track of discussions fragmented over 
multiple high-volume high-noise mailing lists. anybody has a better 
alternative for this?

cheers,
