Hi,

I have the feeling that I've commented on this before, but I still
don't like the fact that the typed value of an element with the type
xs:anyType is computed by taking its string value and converting that
to an atomic value of type xs:anySimpleType, whereas trying to get the
typed value of an element of any other type with complex content
causes an error.

I think it should be consistently one way or the other. Either getting
the typed value of an element with the type xs:anyType should raise an
error or elements with types with complex content should have typed
values based on converting their string value to an atomic value of
type xs:anySimpleType.

Either way could work I think; the first option is only really
practical if invalid/unvalidated elements don't have the type
xs:anyType.

Cheers,

Jeni
