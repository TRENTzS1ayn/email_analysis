In my reading of the F&O draft I noticed a number of typos and minor
errors, listed below.  Hope it's helpful.

Thanks,
Priscilla


8.4.6 - xf:get-seconds-from-dayTimeDuration says it returns an integer
(in the signature) - shouldn't that be a decimal?

8.4.9.1 - example shows the wrong function name (year instead of day)

8.4.11.1 - missing colon in xs:dateTime

8.4.21.1 - xf:time should be xs:time

8.5.8 - op:divide-dayTimeDuration - says result is rounded to the
nearest month. I imagine that no rounding takes place, but if it does it
would be to the nearest second.

8.6.1 through 8.6.5  All the examples are missing the seconds portion of
the time values (both in the arguments and the results.)  

8.7.3 and 8.7.4 both the subtract-dates and subtract-times function say
"If the value of $srcval1 follows in time the value of $srcval2, then
the returned value is a negative duration." but this conflicts with what
is shown in the examples.  I think this is meant to be reversed?

8.7.3.1 - second xs:date is missing a quote

8.7.4.1 - second xs:time value is missing a leading zero (needs to be 09
instead of 9)

8.7.8.1 - shouldn't the result of the example be 2000-10-27T09:57:00
(one day earlier?)

8.7.11.1 - first constructor should be xs:date not xs:dateTime.  Also
need a space between "thedate" and there's an extra quote at the end of
the sentence

13.1 - in the summary table, description of the local-name function says
it returns a QName rather than an NCName.

14.2.6 - example shows the wrong function name (empty instead of exists)

16.1 - the table does not appear to reflect the ability to cast between
the various date and time types, as described in section 16.8.

16.8 item 6, 1st bullet point - looks like it's constructing a gMonthDay
value instead of a gYearMonth value

16.8 item 7, 2nd bullet point says "If ST is gYearMonth, then TV is SV."
I think this is meant to say gYear instead of gYearMonth, since you are
casting to gYear
