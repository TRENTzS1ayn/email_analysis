The spec says xf:compare collationLiteral is an anyURI. But your examples
include
      xf:compare('Strasse', 'Stra?e', anyURI('deutsch'))

If that's really a URI, it's a relative URI reference and needs to be
interpreted relative to a base URI. But this example strongly suggests that
you intended it to be taken only as a literal string.

I submit that if it's a literal it shouldn't be called a URI, to avoid this
confusion. Remember the massive debate over whether relative URIs were
meaningful as namespaces? You _really_ don't want to go there.

Conversely, if it really us a URI, you shouldn't be using the relative form
in this example since (a) it's misleading to the reader and (b) it's not
typical use -- you generally wouldn't want a document's collation to change
if the document is moved to a new base URI.
