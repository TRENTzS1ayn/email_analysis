I'm trying to prototype the xf:node-name function. Problem is, I really 
can't tell what the behavior of the returned value should be. It's 
possible I'm not looking at the most recent documents, but:


Operators says this returns an expanded QName and points to the Data Model 
spec.

Data Model says "An expanded QName is in the value space of xs:QName, and 
consists of a namespace URI and a local name". But that doesn't tell me 
how this value behaves when I actually try to operate on it -- to take one 
trivial example, it doesn't tell me what the lexical representation of an 
_expanded_ QName should be.

You've got an open issue (Issue-0063: Is prefix preserved?) which suggests 
that the non-expanded lexical value -- the Namespaces-style qualified name 
-- _might_ be available. But it isn't clear that this is the intended 
lexical value under all cases, or which cases it applies to... and the 
issue itself indicates that you hadn't decided where the prefix would be 
taken from.

Checked the XSLT2 spec; didn't find any help there.


Is there really a hole in the spec where someone made an assumption, or 
did I miss something?
