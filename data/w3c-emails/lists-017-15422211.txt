The Working Draft of Functions & Operators dated 16 August 2002 says
in section 2.2 that the node-name accessor returns a QName "for node
kinds that can have names" but does not list those kinds. Please state
explicitly whether processing instructions are deemed to have names.

I note that we have the QName functions in chapter 9, plus name(),
local-name(), namespace-uri() in chapter 13, and chapter 4 gives rise
to Name(), NCName(), and QName(). If there are any conflicts or
possible surprises in the relationships among these 11 functions,
the spec should point them out.
