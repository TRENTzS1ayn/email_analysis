Yes, the discrepancy is unfortunate. The XSLT rule that NaN precedes other
values (note that this only applies to xsl:sort) was introduced as an
erratum to XSLT 1.0 (see E20 in
http://www.w3.org/1999/11/REC-xslt-19991116-errata/ ) and pre-dates the
publication of XML Schema, which adopted the opposite convention. It's not
obvious whether the problem is serious enough to be worth fixing, and if so,
how it should be fixed: as far as I can see it is untidy that the two specs
should adopt different conventions but it does not make anything actually
break.
