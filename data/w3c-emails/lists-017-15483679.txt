An expanded QName is a (URI, localname) pair. 

The current situation is that there is no way of converting an expanded
QName to a string (see
http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-operators/#casting-from-primitive-to-primitive)
and therefore there is no way of writing a QName to the result tree.

The operations you can perform on an expanded QName are to extract the
namespace URI and the local name. You can also compare two expanded QNames
for equality.

This isn't very satisfactory, but it's the best we could do for the time
being.
