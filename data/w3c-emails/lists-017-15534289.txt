> 20.2 XHTML Output Method

The XHTML output description specifies that the /> form should not be
used if the declared content model (by implication, in XHTML 1.0 DTD)
is non empty. However the first bullet simply says that a space should
be placed before the /> for "empty elements" which would seem to include
all empty elements rather than just those declared EMPTY in XHTML.

The first bullet point requiring a space before /> should probably be
explictly restricted to elements in the XHTML namespace with which are
declared EMPTY in (one of) the XHTML 1.0 DTD.

Would it be possible for the XHTML output method to force that the
xhtml namespace is default and so output XHTML elements unprefixed. If
the aim is to work in legacy HTML browsers outputting as <kjfkcwwa:br />
which would be allowed by the current rules will not realy work.

similar comment on the fith bullet
  "If there is a head element"
does this mean any element with local name "head" or an element with
local name name  "head" and namespace uri "xhtml-namespace".
