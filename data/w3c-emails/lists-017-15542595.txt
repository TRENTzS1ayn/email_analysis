Yes, I think this is essentially a question of editorial clarification:
perhaps the second bullet point should come before the first.

This seems a reasonable suggestion. I'll register it as an issue so it gets
onto the WG agenda. It's not trivial to specify this, because namespace
prefixes are allocated as part of the namespace fixup process during result
tree construction, not during serialization. It may be simplest to express
it in the form of a suggestion to implementors.

I think it means an element with local name "head" in the XHTML namespace,
and will add a clarification to that effect unless anyone in the WG objects.

Thanks for the comments, as always.
