I have added an appendix on design alternatives, entitled
"Appendix A: Design Alternatives". The bulk of discussion
on these has taken place years ago, and I have limited myself
to a rather cursory discussion. If anybody sees something that
really needs to be mentioned, please tell me.

I'm herewith tentatively closing issue altdesign-17.

Regards,    Martin.
