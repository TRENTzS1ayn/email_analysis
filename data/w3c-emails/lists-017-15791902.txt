While zero-length captured substrings might be permissible, I beleive
these examples would result in errors being thrown because both "()x*" and
"(^).*($)" match the zero-length string.

Accordingly, valid examples for this would be replace("xxx", "()x+", "$1")
and replace("xxx", "(^).*($)", "$1$2"), both of which do not have patterns
matching the zero length string. Like the original examples, these should 
result in the empty string.

Cheers, 
Jennifer
