A.3 Reserved Function Names

(Are these names in any particular order? If not, how about alphabetical?)

I can see why you'd need to forbid these as function names:
    comment
    if
    node
    processing-instruction
    text
    typeswitch
but why these?:
    item
    element
    attribute
    id
    key

In fact, since 'id' and 'key' don't occur anywhere in the grammar, there
doesn't seem to be any reason to reserve them in any context.

To eliminate the ambiguity of ItemType, it looks like you'll have to forbid
these lexemes as the QName of the AtomicType of an ItemType:
    element
    attribute
    node
    processing-instruction
    comment
    text
    document
    item
    untyped
Similarly, you'll have to forbid "empty" as the QName of the AtomicType of
the ItemType of a SequenceType.
