Hello Chris,

I have changed this to be about issue altdesign-17.

I'm very surprised that you interpret this in this way. The point
discussing applicability of IRIs with respect to various URI schemes
is section 1.2.c. This is the only applicability item where URI
schemes are discussed. [I hope you don't confuse XML Schema and
URI schemes.]

What the spec means by 'contexts' is slots in a protocol or format
where URIs or IRIs may go. As an example, the first line in a
HTTP protocol exchange usually looks like:

GET /foo/bar/baz.html HTTP/1.1

The "GET" is the request method. The "HTTP/1.1" is the protocol
version. The "/foo/bar/baz.html" is an URI, absolute (for proxies)
or relative to the server in question. The HTTP spec designates
this as an URI, and section 1.2.a says that you are not supposed
to suddenly use an IRI in such a context, which means that if you
have an IRI that you want to resolve, you have to convert it to
an URI as described in the IRI spec.

There is no such recognition, and there is no need to create new schemas.
While creating new schemas might in one way or another lead to a cleaner
solution, it would be overkill because it would be very difficult to
deploy.
