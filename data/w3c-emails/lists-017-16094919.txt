Xpath 1 supports comments (if the parser reports them, all parsers used
with xslt 1 do report these as far as can see). It is therefore
necessary that Xpath2 does the same. Xquery could of course not do so,
but wouldn't this be an unneeded difference between the two languages?

Supporting comments in Xpath1/XSLT1 turns out to be very useful.
A very common use case is to make "identity transformations" with minor
adjustments, perhaps updating from one version of a dtd to the next.

Documents often contain comments for good reason and there is no reason
why these transforms should drop the comments.
