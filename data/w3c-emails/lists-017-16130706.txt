As far as I know, RELAX-NG is a Schema language that does validation but
does not provide type information.  There is, for example, nothing like
the PSVI.  Of course, it could be made to provide type info but that's a
lot of work and what is the motivation for doing this work?  

All the best, Ashok

This kind of thing has been suggested and rejected in the past, and the
idea
is currently being explored once again to see whether it solves any of
the
problems with anonymous types. I've no idea what the outcome will be:
but
thanks for the contribution.
