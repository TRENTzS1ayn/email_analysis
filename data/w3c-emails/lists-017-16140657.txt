The reason any schema language provides type information is that it
can be used in downstream processing of the XML document. Currently,
there's no standard way of using that information at all; XPath 2.0
provides one. So the motivation for creating RELAX NG validators that
make available type information would be the ability for people using
XPath 2.0 to use it.

It's certainly true that it is a lot of hard work to enable RELAX NG
validators to create the data model currently required for XPath 2.0.
That's why I wondered whether a slightly different XPath 2.0 data
model would make that easier/possible and therefore XPath 2.0 less
schema-language specific.

Cheers,

Jeni
