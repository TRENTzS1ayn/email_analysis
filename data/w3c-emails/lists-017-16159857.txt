The only example of distinct-values appears to be targetted at 
the query users.
Isn't it about time that the two uses were seperated?
Common functions,
then two WD's, one for XSLT+XPATH, one for the query users?




for $a in distinct-values(//author)
return ($a,
        for $b in //book[$b/author = $a]
        return $b/title)


As a minimum, please provide examples for *both* user groups,
unless the query group have totally taken over the WD?
