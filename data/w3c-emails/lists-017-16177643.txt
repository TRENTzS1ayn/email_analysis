It's spelled out in 12.2 (April draft): <quote>Those attributes of the
xsl:sort elements whose values are attribute value templates are evaluated
using the outer focus. If the element that contains the xsl:sort elements is
an xsl:sort-key declaration, then the outer focus is a singleton focus based
on the document node of the principal source document. Otherwise, the outer
focus is the focus used to evaluate the select attribute of the containing
instruction (for example, xsl:for-each or xsl:apply-templates).</quote>

It is indeed a bit odd, but logical given that these attributes are
parameters to the sort operation as a whole, not things that can vary for
each sort key.

I will add this to my list as a candidate 1.0 erratum, though I'm not sure
if and when we'll get round to publishing further errata.
