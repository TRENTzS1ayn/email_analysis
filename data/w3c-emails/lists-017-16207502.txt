This is related to a user example recently posted to xsl-list.
The example was demonstrating some other problem but I note it had an
XPath variable $xml.

It wasn't clear to me (In XPath 1 or XPath 2 drafts) whether this text
(from XML 1.0 2e) is supposed to apply to QNames (which are by
definition also Names) used as variable names (and other syntactic
constructs such as mode names in XSLT). As stated in XML spec it is not a
restriction on element and attribute names but on the use of the Name
production itself (arguably).

  [Definition: A Name is a token beginning with a letter or one of a few
  punctuation characters, and continuing with letters, digits, hyphens,
  underscores, colons, or full stops, together known as name characters.]
  Names beginning with the string "xml", or any string which would match
  (('X'|'x') ('M'|'m') ('L'|'l')), are reserved for standardization in
  this or future versions of this specification.


I don't really mind either way but perhaps this could be made clearer in
2.0 ?
