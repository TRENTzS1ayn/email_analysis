I'm having difficulty understanding why you think this, Dave. Is it
because the result of the expression (in the XPath book, section 2.8)
has been shown with a particular serialization that might be more
familiar to XQuery users?

The problem of course is that XPath itself has no way of serializing a
sequence of elements, so the result of this expression can only be
described by inventing some notation. There might be a case for showing
examples of XPath as used in an XSLT context, but we've never done that
in the past (XPath 1.0 has no references to XSLT).

The example itself is actually rather artificial: in practice both
XQuery and XSLT users would construct a tree rather than a sequence
with the results, but tree construction is outside the scope of XPath
which is why the example has been done in this way. To be honest, I'm
not sure it belongs in this section of the document at all.
