If you are new to XSLT, Othman, then I suggest you concentrate on learning
XSLT 1.0 and XPath 1.0 for the time being, since the 2.0 versions are still
under development and not available yet in most products.
 
The only real way to learn about XSLT 2.0 and XPath 1.0 at present is to
study the W3C specifications, though you will probably find it useful to
read Evan Lenz's introductory articles first:

i'm sorry,
but i was wondering if studying any xslt tutorial is ok for me, even if i
want to work on the new XSLT2.0?
are they too many differences ?, i know there are some between XPATH 1.0 and
XPATH2.0 (sequences instead of nodes etc..), but does it change anything for
the XSLT?
thank you..
