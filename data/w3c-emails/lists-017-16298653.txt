There is a neat trick you can use for this: just declare your namespace as
an extension namespace.

<xsl:stylesheet
   xmlns:x="my.accessibility.namespace"
   extension-element-prefixes="x">


   <x:comment>....</x:comment>

The XSLT processor is required to ignore extension instructions in a
namespace that it does not recognize.
