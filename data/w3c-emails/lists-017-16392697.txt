Hi Michael,

Thanks for pointing out those inconsistencies. The Working Groups will
discuss them and improve the situation. In the meantime send your
comments to the list indicated in the relevant working draft. If you
have more general comments that do not necessarily refer to a single
document, send them to public-qt-comments@w3.org. The will always be people
from both working groups reading it anyway and able to forward the comment
to the appropriate group or subgroup.

That was an error and it is now fixed. Thanks.
