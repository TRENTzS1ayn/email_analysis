Michael: 
The F&O draft went to press before the change in the comments list was
announced.  We'll fix in the next release.

Subject: public-qt-comments@w3.org

Yesterday's Functions and Operators draft still says to send comments to
    www-xml-query-comments@w3.org
Presumably, that should be changed to 
    public-qt-comments@w3.org

Not surprisingly, the drafts that were not re-released yesterday
(Requirements, Formal Semantics, and XQueryX) also still point to
www-xml-query-comments@w3.org.  Will they stay that way until the next
release? Should commenters send to public-qt-comments anyway?

The Use-cases draft gives the address as
   public-qt-comments@w3.org@w3.org

The XSLT 2.0 draft doesn't appear to tell readers where to send their
comments.

At http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/,
the link for "XSL" has an empty href.

http://www.w3.org/XML/Query indicates that www-xml-query-comments@w3.org
is
now "for submitting comments just to the XML Query wg. Please use this
list
only if you think the XML Query working group, and not the XSL working
group, should be the recipient of the message." Any pointers on how to
make
that decision? I mean, of all the various Query drafts, if I were to
pick a
couple that I thought the XSL wg didn't need to see the comments on, I
would
guess the Uses-cases doc and the "XML Query Language" doc. But both of
those
docs tell me to send comments to public-qt-comments. So what's left?
What
would be of concern *only* to the Query wg?
