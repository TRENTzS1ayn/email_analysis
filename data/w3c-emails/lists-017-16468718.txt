Are there specific queries that the current XQuery WD [1] cannot handle?
If not why can you not base your system on the current WD even though it
might not be as stable as you wish?  

If the current WD cannot handle your application's queries requirements
then please give us some examples of these queries so we know more about
your requirements.
