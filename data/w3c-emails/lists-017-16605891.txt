which rather drives a hole through the argumment that XPath2 is not
dependent on Schema but takes a PSVI from any source.

If I wanted all elements matching copyright/date to be years I'd much
rather do something like xsl:key specifying an Xpath match, together
with a type. Given that I have Xpath available why should I go to a
completely different language to specify some subcollection of my
elements that should be dates?

yes.
