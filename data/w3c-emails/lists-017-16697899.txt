I would like to suggest that the title of the document is updated to read 
"XPath Version 2.0 Requirements" rather than its current form.

I would also like to suggest that the Working Group replace the phrase "XPath 
2.0 has the following goals" in 1. Goals with something less fatuous. Such 
anthropomorphic references to a technology serve only to conceal the 
rationale for a particular approach. And the rationale for the approach taken 
to XPath 2.0 is something that deserves more open discussion.

Perhaps change the phrase to, "The XPath 2.0 Working Group has the following 
goals for XPath 2.0 ...".

For each goal I would suggest a brief statement be added describing the 
benefits anticipated for/from the goal, and a description of who benefits and 
who is disadvantaged by the change.

I would also like to suggest that an explicit Goal "That XPath 2.0 does not 
add unnecessary and irrelevant complexity for users of XSLT" be added to an 
updated Requirements document.
