If XPath 2.0 is to support XPointer is there not a case for a much smaller 
XPath 2.0 specification which (as with XPath 1.0) corresponds to common 
functionality of XSLT and XPointer? To that can be added (as a distinct 
module) whatever additional functionality is relevant to XQuery 1.0.

It would also be useful to have some indication of how typing is to be 
handled for XPointer points and ranges.
