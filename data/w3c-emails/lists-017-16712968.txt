In Chapter 1.2 of the XPath 2.0 Requirements WD it is stated: "The scope of 
XPath 2.0 must be the set of common functionality between the expression 
language of XSLT 2.0 and the expression language of XML Query 1.0.".

Since XPath 1.0 contains functionality common to XSLT 1.0 and XPointer 1.0, 
the absence of mention of XPointer should be explained and justified.

Is the absence of mention of XPointer in the Requirements document an 
implicit indication that XPointer is to be dumped by the W3C? Or is it a 
conscious or unconscious oversight on the part of the WG?
