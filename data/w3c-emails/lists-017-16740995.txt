The XQuery Mission Document located at http://www.w3.org/XML/Group/Query is 
withheld from the public.

If those outside W3C are to comment meaningfully on XQuery and related 
specifications it makes sense that they are fully informed.

Asking those outside to comment on XQuery etc while withholding information 
about the strategy is asking for comment about the details of an answer to a 
question which is not disclosed.
