This is not a "Mission Document" - it's the internal working group
web page, with stuff like telephone numbers for conference calls,
links to travel arrangements for face to face meetings, internal
working documents in the process of being edited into drafts,
member contact information, and so forth.

The page you are looking for is at http://www.w3.org/XML/Query where
you'll find links to the requirements document and use cases.
