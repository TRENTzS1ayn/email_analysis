Hi,

The moderators of public-qt-comments will no longer allow cross-posts
to make it through to the list. Both public-qt-comments and xml-dev
serve different purposes: xml-dev is a discussion list while
public-qt-comments is actually not a list but an address to send
comments to the working groups about the specifications.

Max
