Hello Chris,

Many thanks for your comments. Because they are all editorial,
I have kept them as a single issue.
[http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/#editorial-Lilley-27]
Up to now, I haven't usually 'issuefied' editorial stuff, but I'm
starting to do that to document what has happened in last call.

Changed. I replaced "by such an approach" with "by separate schemes
for IRIs" to make things even clearer.

Do you have a reference? I'd like to give the underlying argument
rather than just saying 'the TAG said'.

Do you mean in the context of URIs, or much more general?
The subsection starts out with "At an early stage, UTF-7 was considered",
and in that context, it wouldn't be true. The fact that many URI
schemes now use UTF-8 in one way or another is largely due to the decision
to use UTF-8 for IRIs, and to the general rise of UTF-8.

That's a good point. I added:
"Requiring implementations to convert from UTF-8
to UTF-7 and back would be an additional implementation burden."

Thanks!

Thanks. That was a private suggestion from Chris Haynes.

In that case probably http://big.example.com/PopularPage.html.
Done. [I made that example.com, even though all other examples
are example.org, but I guess in that case, that's justified.]
