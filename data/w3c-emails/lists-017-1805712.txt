Hello Graham,

This is my last reply. Many thanks again for your comments.
This is issue needAPI-34.

We have already seen implementations of IRIs in various browsers
(Opera, Safari, IE (with the exception of IDN), Amaya, Netscape).
Nobody from these implementers has every mentioned the need for
an API, at least not to me.

In many cases I guess APIs for URIs are reused by making use
of the fact that IRIs essentially work the same way as URIs,
and in many programming languages these days representing
Unicode is no longer that much of a problem.

There may be other applications than browser that have other
needs. But I'm not sure we could guess their needs now.

If there turns out to be a need for an API in some area in
the future, I'm confident this can be addressed as a separate
project.


Regards,     Martin.
