Hello Graham,

Done.

They are referenced in a normative sentence in the bidi section, so
yes, fixed. I guess we could move [UNIV4] out of that, if we really
want (our reference practice seems to lean towards ISO 10646,
rather than Unicode).

Michel, what do you think? Can you have a look at it?
I guess the reference to 10646 may also need updating,
can you give me the newest version?


Regards,    Martin.
