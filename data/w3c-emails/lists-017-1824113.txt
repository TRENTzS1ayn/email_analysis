Martin,

Thanks for your response.  Where you say:
[[
I think what you mean is to only change some terminal productions,
but leave the rest unchanged. There are several reasons why this
hasn't been done:
]]
This was roughly what I had in mind, but I can see why you prefer not to do 
this.  This is primarily a matter of preference and perspective, and I am 
content to accept your decision.  Your point about URI vs IRI is well-made.

Simply adding a brief descriptive paragraph capturing the thrust of this:
[[
- In the most general sense, it would have been okay to just
   add ucschar to unreserved. But there is the issue of allowing
   private characters in query parts, but not elsewhere.
]]
in the introduction to the section about the grammar would have helped me 
to see quickly where the changes were; e.g.
[[
The following grammar closely follows the URI grammar in [RFC2396bis], 
except that the range of unreserved characters is expanded to include UCS 
characters, with the restriction that private UCS characters can occur only 
in query parts and not elsewhere.
]]
