Hello Graham,

I have added the text that you propose below, and appended the
following:
The grammar is split into two parts, rules that differ from
[RFC2396bis] because of the above-mentioned expansion, and rules
that are the same as in [RFC2396bis]. For rules that are different
than in [RFC2396bis], the names of the non-terminals have been
changed as follows: If the non-terminal contains 'URI', this has
been changed to 'IRI'. Otherwise, an 'i' has been prefixed.

I have tentatively closed this comment.

Regards,    Martin.
