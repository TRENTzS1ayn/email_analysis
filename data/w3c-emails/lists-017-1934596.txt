Thats good.

Architecture of the World Wide Web, First Edition
Editor's Draft 10 May 2004

2.4. URI Schemes
http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2004/webarch-20040510/#URI-scheme

Good practice: New URI schemes

A specification SHOULD NOT introduce a new URI scheme when an existing
scheme provides the desired properties of identifiers and their
relation to resources

MD> Do you mean in the context of URIs, or much more general?

Both.

MD> The subsection starts out with "At an early stage, UTF-7 was considered",

So its circular. Okay.

Great.

MD> Thanks!

MD> Thanks. That was a private suggestion from Chris Haynes.

Yes, thats fine.

Thank you, I am satisfied by the response to all my comments.
