Martin in the normative reference section please update as follows:

 [ISO10646]   ISO/IEC 10646:2003
              International Organization for Standardization,
              "Information Technology - Universal Multiple-Octet Coded
              Character Set (UCS), December 2003.

   [UNI9]     Davis, M., "The Bidirectional Algorithm", Unicode Standard
              Annex #9, March 2004,
<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/tr9-13.html>.

   [UNIV4]    The Unicode Consortium, "The Unicode Standard, Version
              4.01", March 2004, defined by: The Unicode Standard,
Version 4.0
              (Reading, MA, Addison-Wesley, 2003. ISBN 0-321-18578-1),
              as amended by Unicode 4.0.1
(http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode4.0.1/).

   [UTR15]    Davis, M. and M. Duerst, "Unicode Normalization Forms",
              Unicode Standard Annex #15, April 2003,
<http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/tr15-23.html>.
 

I updated the link to 10646 to the latest edition which was just
published by ISO. Technically it is the same as before, but that edition
merge the two parts.
You should make sure that the normative reference to the Unicode webd
sites are dated, one of your previous links [UNI9] went to the 'latest'
one which is not proper for normative references. The HTML version of
the IRI draft should also show explicitly the link values, which it
doesn't as of now. Unicode 4.01 still use the same repertoire as
10646:2003, so we are good on that part.
