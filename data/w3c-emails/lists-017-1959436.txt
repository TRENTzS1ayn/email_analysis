Hello Michel,

I have listed this as issue ISO-Uni-ref-34.

I think this should be 4.0.1, yes?

Thanks. This simplifies a lot.

Well yes. But for the record, my personal expectation would be
that the IRI spec follows updates of these other specs in the
future. In most cases, the changes only deal with edge cases
anyway. Of course, we have to make sure that we take this
decision explicitly in each case, so that we can assess
the impact.

If you know what option to set in xml2rfc, I'll do it.
Otherwise, I don't want to spend the time, because the HTML
version is just a sideline. What counts for the IETF is the
text/plain version.

I have marked this issue as tentatively closed.
Can you please do another cross-check?

Regards,    Martin.
