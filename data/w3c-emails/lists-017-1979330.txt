Thanks. I have decided to not reference it, although in theory,
a reference to 'work in progress' could be okay even for a
Standards Track document. But I think it's good to have this
here in the mailing list for potential future reference.
As for the underlying arguments, I think the current text already
provides them, although of course in a very compact fashion.

I have closed this issue.
