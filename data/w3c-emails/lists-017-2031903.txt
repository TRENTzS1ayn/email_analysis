Martin,

I think that's better, but I still think it is making normative statements 
about implementation technique, which was the point of my original 
comment.  (And I think the normative point you do want to make really 
should be a MUST!)

For example, I think this this might say what you want without dictating 
implementation:
[[
If the IRI is to be passed to another application, or used further in some 
other way, its original form MUST be preserved;  the conversion described 
here should be performed only for the purpose of local comparison.
]]
