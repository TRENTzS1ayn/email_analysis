I have proposed that the XML Core WG add the following motherhood note
to both NS 1.0 and NS 1.1:

Note:  Although namespace names are only identical if they
consist of the same characters in the same order, other uses of
URIs provide different rules for identity.  Therefore, namespace
names SHOULD NOT:

a) use upper case characters in the scheme name;
b) percent-encode any character that does not require it;
c) use upper case letters in the host name;
d) contain the sequences "/../" or "/./";
e) specify an explicit port number that is equal to the default;
f) end in "/" or "#" (namespace names used by RDF are an exception);
g) make use of the "file:" scheme, since its meaning is not absolute.

Of course, I'm not allowed to tell you what they think of the idea.  ;-)

Improvements are solicited.
