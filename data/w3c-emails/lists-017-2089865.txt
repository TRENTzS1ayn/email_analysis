I think it is a very good idea to add such a note. Another, related
thing is that namespace documents should actually contain the
namespace URI/IRI literally, rather than just rely on where they
are, because they might be found with a slightly different URI/IRI.
But I guess that's too much of implementation advice that probably
doesn't belong in the spec.

I would probably try to avoid the word 'identity'.

I think it is better to refer to the relevant section of RFC 2396bis,
and to wait for that to become an RFC. Several of your points are
not alligned with RFC 2396bis, and you risk to be out of sync if
there are any changes.

I think the '/' end is the default for some things in RFC 2396bis.

This is the only point that is not discussed in section 6 of RFC 2396bis.
But it should be more general, there may be other schemes that are similar
to "file:".

You should send this also to the URI list (uri@w3.org) for feedback.

One might also be able to argue that with the new URI spec and IRI spec,
the namespace spec(s) wouldn't need to say things like this anymore.
But it's probably still better to mention it.
