I agree. But the current text doesn't use a MUST, only a SHOULD, and
clearly gives conditions. If there are scenarios where speed is not
of importance to the extent that they need to use character-by-character
comparison, then the text doesn't apply anymore.

Well, in that case, the applications really must follow the infrastructure
where they use it, otherwise we get chaos. But that's for these
infrastructure specs to make sure, not for the IRI spec.
[and by the way, that part of the spec avoids any use of the word
'application' :-).]

Okay, then I declare this issue closed.

[By the way, if it turns out that some of the MUST/SHOULD don't
make sense when we try to go to Draft Standard, then we will just
have to take them out. That's what I understand the Draft Standard
stage is there for.]

I have adopted your text, thanks!
