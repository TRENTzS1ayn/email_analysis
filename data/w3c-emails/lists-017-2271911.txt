>This document defines a new protocol element, the Internationalized
>    Resource Identifier (IRI), as a complement to the Uniform Resource
>    Identifier (URI). An IRI is a sequence of characters from the
>    Universal Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646). A mapping from IRIs to
>    URIs is defined, which means that IRIs can be used instead of URIs
>    where appropriate to identify resources.
>    The approach of defining a new protocol element was chosen, instead
>    of extending or changing the definition of URIs, to allow a clear
>    distinction and to avoid incompatibilities with existing software.
>    Guidelines for the use and deployment of IRIs in various protocols,
>    formats, and software components that now deal with URIs are
>    provided.
