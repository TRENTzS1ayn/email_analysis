I just noticed that IE translates the <demographic> element as:
Demographic and socioeconomic data, such as gender, age, and income, not
tied to an identifiable person.

That last part ("not tied to an identifiable person") troubles me. Nothing
in P3P 1.0 indicates that is the meaning of the demographic element, unless
I'm missing something.

I notice that the Privacy Bird and Netscape translations don't include any
phrasing like this, too.

Also, while I'm on the topic, data like State and Zip Code also fall in the
demographic category, but none of the translations mention them. I would
guess that collecting region information is more often as or more common
than collection gender, age, and income, so I would suggest that the
translations include that in their translations, e.g. "such as geographic
region, gender, age, or income".
