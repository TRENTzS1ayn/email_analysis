I find that curious as well.

As I recall, it was a rather late decision we made to change the 
classification of state, postalcode, etc. to demographic (rather than 
physical contact). That is indicated in section 5.5.6.1 but never 
updated in the category definitions. Besides taking that into 
consideration in our UA guidelines, perhaps we should mention that in 
the definition of the demographic category in section 3.4? I'll add 
that to bugzilla.
