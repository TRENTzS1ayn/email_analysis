In a nutshell...

(I'm one of the co-chairs of the WG, Jaap Akkerhuis is the other, but
I am not an implementor of the protocol.)

Please note that I took "public-p3p-spec@w3.org" off the cc list - to
avoid cross-posting and I'm not on that list.  If anyone wants to
forward this message to that list, you have my permission.

Not that I am aware of - trouble with adapting P3P, that is.

On HTTP - one of the items in our charter has been to investigate
"other transports" with "other" meaning "not TCP" in the context.
But to date, there's been no sustained interest in pursuing any
transport other than TCP (with TLS) but multiple members of the WG.
It's not so much that HTTP was rejected, no one suggested doing it.

To some extent because our protocol is "business to business" and
constrained in it's reach, as opposed to being "person to business"
and in general use.

I'd have to research that.

None, other than to say that I thought the P3P specification is well
written and organized, especially from the perspective of someone who
has written specifications in the past.  I like having the
requirement clearly stated and then use prose to convey the spirit.
