There haven't been any responses to my previous attempt to get this
discussion going, so I'm going to attempt to summarize my view of the
problem and the ideas I've had so far. I look forward to some discussion.

I'd like to schedule a conference call of the task force for this week, so
if you think you'd like to be involved, please email me directly.

Terminology:
- Business agent: an entity that acts on behalf of another entity
- Business domains: list of DNS domains or hosts that are owned (directly or
indirectly) by a single entity
- First-party business: entity providing the primary site or service with
which user is interacting
- Third-party business: separately-owned entity that may have access to data
collected during user's interaction with first-party business
- Third-party context: non-primary domains that are owned by either: the
first-party business (other business domains), business agents for the
first-party business, or third-party businesses

The basic premise I'm working under is that user agents should only restrict
true third-party businesses, not sites/services provided by the first-party
business or its agents. We should consider changes to the specification for
required/recommended user agent behavior as well as the more fundamental
changes (discussed below) to make it possible to describe these
relationships.

Questions/Problems:
- Agent: how to denote that it is an agent of the first-party business
- Agent: how to denote which data is collected on behalf of the first party
- Agent: how to denote that purposes are stated in the first party policy
- Agent: how to denote that a domain belongs to an agent acting on behalf of
the business and should not be treated as a third-party domain
- Domain: how to denote that other domains are part of the same business and
should not be treated as third-party domains
- How to map these changes to compact policies
- How does policy reference file need to change

Ideas:
- Ability to denote agent status (in ENTITY element as addition to business
dataset?)
- Ability to list business domains (in ENTITY element?)
- If not otherwise specified, a domain in the third-party context should be
considered a third-party business and restricted as such.
- New recipient element (e.g. "<FIRST-PARTY>") for an agent's policy, to
denote that data is being collected on behalf of the first-party business
entity
- Ability for policy to reference the first-party policy that should apply
(e.g. URI attribute on new recipient element)
- New purpose element (e.g. "<FIRST-PARTY-USES>") for an agent's policy, to
denote that data will be used for purposes declared in referenced policy
- New P3P HTTP header to reference first-party domain or business domains
list, or compact policy token(s) to force use of full policy
