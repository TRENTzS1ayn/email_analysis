P3P 1.1 Specification working group members,

Please plan to participate in our first conference call on April 16 at 
11 am Eastern. Dial-in information is available from 
http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Specification/1.1/meetings.html (you may 
need a password to access... please try this URL and request a password 
now if you need one rather than waiting for the day of the call when 
you don't have the number!)

Task force chairs: I will ask each of you to give an update on the 
progress of your TF on this call. Please be ready to tell us how you 
plan to proceed and commit to some milestones for your deliverables.

Everyone should also sign up for a W3C buzilla account if you have not 
already done so http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/
