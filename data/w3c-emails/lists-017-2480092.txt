I have now posted the PB, Netscape, and IE translations at 
http://www.w3.org/P3P/1.1/documents.html#ua. UA task force members, 
please review these documents and send email directly to me to let me 
know your availability to participate in a conference call to begin our 
discussions on April 14 or April 21.

Lorrie
