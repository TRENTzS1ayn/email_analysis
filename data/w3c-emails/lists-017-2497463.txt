If the initial data collection had a particular policy (P3P) wouldn't it be 
best to pass on the initial P3P agreed to, with the data, when it is 
distributed to those with the "same" policies?

Let me back way up and ask what data is involved here? Was there a usage 
scenario? (Didn't see one, but I expect its clear to those involved with 
provreg, of which I'm mostly ignorant.) I was presuming, as you said, that 
the data was initially collected by a registrar and then shared with a 
registry. So for instance:
  https://www.gandi.net/whois?l=EN&domain=w3.org
contains personally identifiable data. My (continued) presumption was that 
the registrar, Gandi, might have a policy associated with the collection of 
this information. Now, Gandi might also share this with a .org TLD registry 
data base. So in it's initial <create> it would see the registry <greeting> 
and note its <dcp> (policy). If this didn't match the data it collected it 
under, then it might not upload the information if it said p3p:same, or it 
might if it said p3p:other-recipient. (In the first case, it's more likely 
to say p3p:public since whois is public, or at least to set its privacy 
policy based on the policies it knows it must interact with on the back 
end.)

However, my scenario, which is probably incorrect, fails to predict the 
variances in EPP.

I didn't follow this bit.
