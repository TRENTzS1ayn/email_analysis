Granted, I had prior general knowledge, but it did leak into PROVREG, via its
principle implementor.

    On a related note: Our presentation from monday's Centr workshop
    are online as well. You can get the .ppt files (and the latest
    source code tarballs) from
    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=66464 .

Let me clarify a bit about this. At the first day of RIPE meetings
there is usually a CENTR technical meeting. This time, the afternoon
was devoted to EPP.  SInce the meeting is limited to CENTR members
and invitees (Scott Hollenbeck was there, among others) I don't
feel comfortable about quoting from that, although often the meeting
minutes are published on the CENTR website.

Anyway, Otmar Lendl on behalf of the Austrian registry, presented
at the centr-tech meeting an implementation of an EPP server as a
mod_epp Apache module.  It is nice to see that this is actually
public information. For details, see the URL he mentions.
