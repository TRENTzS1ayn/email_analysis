The UA TF will have a conference call on Monday, april 21 at 1 pm 
Eastern (for 1 hour). We will use the same bridge and code as is being 
used for the full working group call. If you are not a TF member but 
would like to participate in this call (or join the TF), please send me 
email.

We will begin our discussions of high-level observations about the 
three translation documents and the questions I posed in
