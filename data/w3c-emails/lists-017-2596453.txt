Agent/Domain Relationship Task Force
Proposed Milestones

1) Agree on terminology. Proposed terminology (different from my last
email):
 a) Service: a web site (identified by domain or host name) or other
applicable endpoint
 b) Agent service: a service that acts solely on behalf of another service
 c) Primary service: service with which user is DIRECTLY interacting
 d) Secondary service: service with which user is INDIRECTLY interacting due
to configuration of primary service (e.g. image on primary web site served
by secondary web site)

2) Agree on goals. Proposed set:
 a) Ability to denote that a policy applies to multiple services (for full
and compact policies), e.g. because the same entity owns all services
 b) Ability to denote that a secondary service setting and receiving cookies
is an agent collecting data solely on behalf of the primary service (for
full and compact policies)
 c) Recommendation (requirement?) that user agents do not apply different
standards to  cookies set by secondary services when:
  i) same policy applies to both primary and secondary services, or
  ii) secondary service declares itself to be an agent of primary service
 d) Ability for agent services to refer to declaration of purposes in a
policy provided by primary service (for full and compact policies)
 e) Recommendation (requirement?) that user agents follow reference in (d)
and consider policy to be the union of the two policies

3) Draft proposal specification modifications to achieve agreed-upon goals

If possible, I would like to have a preliminary discussion of the
terminology and goals with the TF tomorrow, in advance of the Wednesday WG
call.
