We have some rules, things like delete-object-before-create-object returns
an error.

What we don't have rule about are where registrars go to get "data", they
could just be making it up.

There is no in-band mechanism to distinguish "registrar-generated-data"
from "entity-other-than-registrar-generated-data".

There is a data collection policy announcement from a data collector, which
is indifferent as to the originator of the data which it collects, and it is
possible that a registrar might use non-fictive data.

Did the registrar use P3P when collecting the data? I've no idea. I don't
even know if the registrar was the initial data collector, or if the initial
data collector was a reseller and the registrar engaged in onward-transport.
I don't know how the data got to the registrar.

What the <dcp> covers is _everything_ in a session. Since sessions exhaust,
for the time being, the semantics of state exchange between registrars and
registries, everything collected by a registry is policied. Note that any
registry may have a number other than one of applicable <dcp> statements,
with non-overlapping session-scope.
