INTRODUCTION

My name is Patrick and I am very interested in joining the "Beyond HTTP (BH)
Task Force."

Currently, I am working on a health informatics project at CSIRO by using
Web services technologies.
My main task is to tackle the security and privacy issues for this project.
You can download one of my 
papers about this project from:
http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigecom/exchanges/volume_3_(02)/3.3-Hung.pdf

In addition, I am the session chair of "Web Services Security" of the First
International Conference on Web 
Services (ICWS'03), which is to be held at Las Vegas in coming June:
http://tab.computer.org/tfec/icws03/

Therefore, I am keen to work in this task force.

Thanks and regards,
