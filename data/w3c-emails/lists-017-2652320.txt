Hi Joseph,

Referring to the document at http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/04-beyond-http.html
and your message posted on Mar 29, here are some comments.

I have done a bit about WS-Policy and also the delegation issues of Web
services
for a health informatics project by using Web services technologies. If you
are 
interested in it, you can check some relevant information at:
http://www.eti.hku.hk/eti/web/download/WSS2003.pdf
http://www.cmis.csiro.au/Patrick.Hung/documents/Hung-Qiu-2003-IEEE-CEC03.pdf

In fact, I have been thinking whether it is feasible and appropriate to
implement/apply P3P 
into WS-Policy for the project. Anyway, the first job for me is to
"modify/change/re-create" 
the PURPOSE elements (Section 3.3.4 from The P3P1.0 Specification) for this
project. Thus, 
I have to define the <purposes/> of collecting/processing the health data as
some specific 
purposes in the context of health data and epidemiological statistics, such
as "<vital-statistics/>," 
"<morbidity-statistics/>," and etc. Anyway, I am still studying on it.

As HTTP is a carrier for SOAP messages, I don't really get what you mean
here. Do you mean
that what happens if both "Web service requestor" and "Web service provider"
using HTTP and 
no SOAP message?

By "my understanding," it should not be possible for a Web service requestor
(i.e., Web service) to set 
cookies at the side of Web service requestor (e.g., an application program
or even another Web service), 
except the Web services requestor's interface resides in a browser. The Web
service provider always resides 
in a Web server.

Referring to the first question, do we need separate P3P (privacy) policies
for each operation 
(web method) in a Web service? Then, for the second question, it may be
closely related to
the matchmaking process between Web service requestors and providers. In the
workflow
environment, the service locators (i.e., matchmakers) may have to deal with
the P3P policies from
both tasks and Web services by using APPEL.

Please correct me if I misunderstood anything.

Thanks,
