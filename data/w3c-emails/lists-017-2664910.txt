Hi Marc,

I am interested in your paper at
http://www.inf.ethz.ch/vs/publ/papers/privacy-awareness.pdf

Could I get more details about the implementation of your paw3? Such as the
details of the SOAP 
services for handling P3P policies and APPEL at both user and data
collector?

Further, is it possible for me to have a copy of your paper:

Marc Langheinrich. Privacy by design - principles of privacy-aware
ubiquitous systems. In
Proceedings of Ubicomp, pages 273-291. Springer LNCS, September 2001.

Thanks a lot,

Patrick.
