In 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-p3p-spec/2003Apr/0018.html I 
posed the question:

    Should we try to converge on a single set of translations? Should
    we come up with a long and short translation for each element,
    perhaps using the click through approach like NS uses? Should our
    guidelines list all acceptable translations they people submit
    rather than trying to converge or one or two?

For most of the elements in the three translations, there are three 
versions of the translation that I find acceptable, but there is one 
that I find preferable. In most (but not all) cases I find the other 
two to be accurate, but less clear or more verbose. I would prefer to 
converge on a single translation because it would promote more 
consistency and make it easier for web sites to understand how users 
are going to see their policies. However, if we find it difficult to 
agree on a single translation I would rather have a set of acceptable 
translations than no guidelines at all. So my inclination would be to 
attempt to agree on a single set of translations but re-evaluate this 
approach if it ends up being problematic in practice.
