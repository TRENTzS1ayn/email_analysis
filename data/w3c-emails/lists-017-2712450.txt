I'll note this as more evidence that p3p:PURPOSE is likely to be a part of 
the vocabularly most likely to change. However, I'm thinking it will be 
useful to distinguish the meta "purpose" of "current" and "other" from the 
other terms. I expect you'd want to user both of those terms independent of 
the others...?

No, what happens if the HTTP header has a P3P statement, and the SOAP 
message has one too, and they don't agree, or they do in parts but not in 
others?

This is an interesting point, if the web service client isn't a web browser, 
it might not support cookies anyway. However, I don't think we can presume 
this just yet. Might be worth a few setences on the point.

Oh, good point. I'll add this as an issue to the outline I'm working on.
