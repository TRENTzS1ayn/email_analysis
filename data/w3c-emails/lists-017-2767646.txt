My inclination is that an application will specify which bindings its SOAP 
is supported with. *If* this is the case, then I would RECOMMEND that it 
define the SOAP statement as being inclusive of the SOAP interaction and 
the binding.

Yep, though I expect HTTP will be very common. (In fact, it was recently 
reported that of Amazon's SOAP and REST (HTTP) interfaces, 85% of their 
usage is of the REST interface.)
