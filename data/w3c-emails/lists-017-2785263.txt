** Sorry for the previous "fault" e-mail.

Thanks for your message, Joseph.

Let's talk about an application and a Web service. An application is trying
to call an operation (e.g., Webmethod in .Net Web Sevices) in a Web service.
Thus, the Web service have to specify the SOAP bindings for its operations.
The application has to follow those SOAP bindings in order to call a
particular
operation in the Web service. Now, our question is *if* both application and
Web service have their own privacy policies. Let's call them as WS-Policies.
I
still try to guess what is WS-Policy :-). What should be the scenario in
this
situation? When do they exchange/match their WS-Policies before an
interaction
is taken?

Yes, I agree with you.
