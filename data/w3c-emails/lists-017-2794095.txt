Let's talk about an application and a Web service. An application is trying
to call an operation (e.g., Webmethod in .Net Web Sevices) in a Web service.
Thus, the Web service have to specify the SOAP bindings for its operations.
The application has to follow those SOAP bindings in order to call a
particular operation in the Web service. Now, our question is *if* both 
application and Web service have their own privacy policies. Let's call them

as *** WS-Privacy ***. I still try to guess what is *** WS-Privacy *** :-). 
What should be the scenario in this situation? When do they exchange/match 
their *** WS-Privacy *** before an interaction is taken?

What should be described in these *** WS-Privacy ***?
