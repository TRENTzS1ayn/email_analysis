As stated, I've tried to put together an outline [1] that hopefully gives a 
sense of the goals, the scenario, and the "chunks" that we'll want to 
address.

I welcome comments on *anything* including any of the above, or volunteers 
to take a stab at:
1) Feel like writing up an instance of linking a P3P policy with an XFORM 
(xlink?), SOAP message or WSDL definition?
2) Writing text for one of the chunks?

For any examples or schemas that we use, I'd like to accept those as 
discrete self-validating files [1]. I've previously written a python script 
that when given a XML PI (processing instruction) can then take an excerpt 
from a remote XML file and include it in the spec. That way we don't have 
to maintain examples in the spec and as seperate files, with errors 
creaping into each, but particularly those in the spec.
