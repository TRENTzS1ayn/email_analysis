Here are some more files on this issue
I have corrected some small errors in the schema transform (e.g. it was
outputting category element and attribute element definitions with global
scope where it shouldn't have been).
I have also included a 2 stage transform which avoids using extensions (you
do transform 1 and then transform2 on the results of transform1 to eliminate
duplicates) and, for the benefit of other members of list the files for the
policy transform I sent earlier.

Apologies for confusing the acronyms BDS and BSD... BDS means the base data
schema and BSD is an OS...

For those who don't want to get bogged down in nasty amounts of complexity,
just look at the file bdsfinal.xsd which is the final result schema, or try
the policy transformer on a policy (e.g. the one included). Hope the
directory and file names are relatively self explanatory

Regards

Giles

I'm still not following, keep in mind I know nothing about MS IE and very
little about Java (I'm more of a XML and Python person) <smile/>. I was
expecting to do something like:
  xsltproc bsdtransform.xsl p3p1_0.xml > converted_p3p_1_0.xsd
then I can check a P3P instance against that schema:
  xsv p3p.xml converted_p3p_1_0.xsd

What is "BSD" btw?
