P3Pers, apologies for having missed the call today, XQuery is swamping me these days.
Anyway, some quick words on the "P3P data schema in XML Schema".
This issue had already been tackled quite some time ago in the P3P spec group (you might have wondered if somebody hadn't thought
about it before... right? ;)
In fact, this has at a time been discussed as an alternate proposal, and finally rejected.
I'll state the reasons and some comments here, because these still apply (which means, reopening this issue in P3P1.1 should then
again mean challenge again the "con" of the solution).

First big motivation: who needs it? What are the real advantages? Implementers, at the time, let us know they didn't like the
"xml-schema way" (let's call it this way), because
a) it makes parsing heavier
b) it makes simple data declaration too verbose (as you have to duplicate each subpart of a data element in begin and end tags)

This was the main objection at the time. Now, we are no more in the designing phase (1.0), so tackling this issue again in 1.1 has
to face the new, crucial, additional problem:
c) what are the costs of adding an alternate format to the spec?

There was also other considerations that led not to consider that design, that I'll recap here too:
d) splitting data elements (etc) in separate tags, apparently leads to the loss of the "reference with a URI" property: you'd still
need to recombine the info in a single-line canonicalization to get this property back (so, essentially going back to the status
quo).
e) makes DTD support more difficult

Ok, enough with historical motivations for today ;)
So all in all, the above considerations just apply if this proposal is going to end in 1.1 (i.e., it's reopening the issue).
If it's instead a translation-only thing (like the RDFization note of P3P), likely to end as a Note or so, then of course all the
above is moot ;)
