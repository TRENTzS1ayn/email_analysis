Giles,

Thanks for the detailed notes. One quick comment. You raised questions 
about the delivery definitions used by all three user agents. While the 
wording may be more or less clear, I think PB and IE both have correct 
definitions and Netscape has a definition that is correct, but 
incomplete. If a web site only uses delivery companies that use data 
according to the agent definition in <ours/> then they don't need to 
make an explicit delivery disclosure. The <deliver/> element was added 
for the common (in the US at least) case that a company uses a delivery 
service whose privacy practices they don't know (or they know to be 
less restrictive than their own).

Lorrie
