AGENDA

1. Task force reports
    - P3P beyond HTTP - Patrick Hung
    - User agent behavior - Lorrie Cranor
    - Compact policies - Brooks Dobbs
    - Article 10 vocabulary issues - Giles Hogben
    - Agent and domain relationships - Jack Humphrey

2. Bugzilla 283 Change definition of recipient in 3.3.5 for
    consistancy
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=283

Currently the definition of recipient in 3.3.5 says "the legal entity,
or domain, beyond the service provider and its agents where data may
be distributed." However the defintions of the individual recipient
elements include the service provider and its agents. For consistancy
we should drop the words "beyond the service provider and its agents"
from this definition. This can probably be viewed as an errata.

3. Discuss Jeremy's grouping draft and related proposals - Bugzilla 169
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=169

4. Discussion of Ari's revised identified/identifiable/link
    clarification draft.
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=167

5. Discuss performance issues (raised by Jeremy)

6. Set date for next call (Aug 13?)
