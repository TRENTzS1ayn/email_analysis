The latest version of the P3P Beyond HTTP Task Force Report is ready on:

http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-beyond-http/Overview.html

Any comment/suggestion is more than welcome.

As the current draft does not contain any W3C member confidential material,
I am going to invite non-W3C people to comment it via DBWORLD mailing list. 

Best Regards,

Patrick.
