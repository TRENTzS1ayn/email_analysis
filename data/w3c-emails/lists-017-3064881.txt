Dear all, 

attached a call for participation of the WHOLES-Workshop, which asks
more generic questions about privacy.

Best,

Dear all,

Thank you for agreeing to participate in the program committee of the WHOLES
workshop. You will find the first CfP attached in text, HTML and PDF. Please
feel free to redistribute it wherever you feel it would be appropriate.

Due to the late date of this first CfP, I felt that the submission deadline
and date for notification of acceptance had to be somewhat delayed, I hope
that this change will not cause problems for anyone.

More information about the workshop venue will be made available by the end
of August.

best regards,
