Hi!

The proposal looks good. Once Jerry contacts me, I'll work with him to 
resolve the remaining issues. Some initial ideas/remarks:
- the opt-in or opt-in elements inside all elements of an opt-in/out-out 
group where included
   to preserve backward compatibility of the semantics.
- The issue of the OURS/CURRENT may be resolved by defining that they 
cannot be included in an
   opt-in/opt-out group.
- Does it makes sense to use "required" instead of "no-group" or do you 
envision that with
   consent="no-group", one can nevertheless have opt-in's and out's inside?

Regards,
  matthias
