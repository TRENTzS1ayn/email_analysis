Yes, that's what I remember too. But the problem still occurs as to 
what to do if people violate this rule. I think we need to define how 
to handle this error case.

I think we may need to include them, but perhaps we can define that the 
opt-in/opt-out doesn't apply to them.

I was envisioning the "no-group" would indicate a mix of opt-in's 
opt-out's and required, or all required.
