Ari, 

you have _not_ taken into account my lengthy comments nor the comments
from Robert Horn _not_ to mix usage/storage/type into the term identity.
The idea expressed below is still the same. 

This will create heavy confusion as scope, processing and purpose are
mixed together. I think we should work it out together. Your definitions
sound compelling only at a first glance.
