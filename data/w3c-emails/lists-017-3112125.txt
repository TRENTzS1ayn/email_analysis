Rigo,

We discussed this on the call and basically the consensus was that 
while we understood your alternative view point, we could not 
understand what was wrong with Ari's approach *in addition* to yours. 
Ari did take into account your suggestions, but he was having trouble 
figuring out how to satisfy you as well as the people who thought it 
made more sense the way he approached it in the first place. I 
suggested to Ari that he use both approaches in the document, since 
some resinate with some people and other resinate with others. So his 
latest draft represents his attempt to satisfy everyone. It is of 
course open for further discussion, and we will discuss it on the call 
this week and perhaps you can help us understand why we should take 
*only* your approach and not both approaches.

Lorrie
