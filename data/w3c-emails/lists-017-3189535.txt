Lorrie, late but hopefully not too late: my 2 cents after re-reading the
draft.
=======================================================================
On Element opturi (attribute of POLICY element)

It currently says: Find out how to opt-out at [with link to opturi]

But the opturi can also be a uri to opt-in. By standardizing the text
above, we prevent the expression of opturi as opt-in

=======================================================================
<ACCESS><all />

It says: We give you access to all of our information that identifies
you

I'm a bit reluctant with my pigeon-english to comment here, but there
might be data attached to a record of a natural person that does not
identify this person but just enhances the profile. What about:

We give you access to all of our information about you

Hmm.. reading further in ACCESS, there is a mixture of "identifies you"
and "information about you". This could be canonicalized for better
understanding.
=======================================================================

<DISPUTES>

it says often "[display long description and short description, if
provided, with hyperlink to service URI]"

shouldn't we provide a default in the absence of such a description?

This could resolve some of the concerns of David Stampley, as we might
say: If other dispute resolutions have failed, you could ultimately go
to court with your case (which is always true ;) This makes more sense
for <law />. Your rights are ultimately protected by law.

=======================================================================

<REMEDIES> 

I agree with the concerns of David Stampley concerning the <law />
element.

=======================================================================

<NON-IDENTIFIABLE>

it says:

"We do not keep any information that could be used to identify you
personally"

But in fact, this is a question of retention. Non-identifiable means:

We do not collect any information that could be used to identify you
personally

=======================================================================

The rest is okay. I did not find any further thing that would merit a
comment. So I consider this already very good.

Rigo
