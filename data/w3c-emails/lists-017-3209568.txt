Regarding to some previous discussion with Joseph and Hugo, we have
mentioned that:

"When XMLP messages are conveyed over HTTP the existing mechanisms defined
in the P3P1.0 specification may be used to associate policies with XMLP
messages. 
However, it is unclear to us whether the P3P specification supplies
sufficiently level 
of granularity to identify XMLP messages. If it does not, it is likely that
the P3P extension 
mechanism could be used to provide this granularity, but again this would
need to be 
documented. Furthermore, if other mechanisms are defines specifically for
use with XMLP, 
then conflicts may arise between these mechanisms and the P3P1.0-defined
mechanisms. 
The proper way to resolve these conflicts needs to be documented as well.

Besides documenting how a P3P policy should be associated with an XMLP
message, we 
believe it would be useful to offer some usage scenarios that include P3P.
We are concerned
that in the absence of discussion of privacy and P3P, developers will be
likely to ignore privacy 
issues when implementing the XML Protocol.

This may be one of the items that this task force want to propose for
inclusion in the 1.1 spec.
I will try to do more thoughts on it.
