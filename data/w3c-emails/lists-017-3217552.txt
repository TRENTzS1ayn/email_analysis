What about opt-in/out (shorter ;)

But I find the 'identifies' a bit difficult because they have that
profile and now it identifies me ;). 'about you' is much more natural
and semantically works well with what we want to express. What you mean
is more of 'might be able to find out about you', which would work with
'identifiable'.

What text? A URI has no meaning here.. Just say 'for disputes click
here'? ;)

In this case, non-identifiable and non-ident are semantically equal
expressions in the user-interface.
That's what I want to prevent as non-identifiable is really much
stronger as non-ident in retention. Remember, non-ident is only about 
identified data and not identifiable data.
