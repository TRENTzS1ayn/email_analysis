But not very meaningful.

I agree that "about you" sounds better. But semantically it is wrong.  
You have it backwards. What I mean is information that we have  
identified with you (identified, not identifiable).

Well the semantic difference should be that non-ident is about  
"identified" data
and non-identifiable is about "identifiable" data.  I think the user  
interface expressions we are proposing make the correct distinction. If  
you want to change "keep" somewhere, arguably it would be better to  
change the "keep" in "nonident" to "collect" since that's the word used  
in the definition -- but I think its ok the way it is.
