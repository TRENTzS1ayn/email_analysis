Ari, 

it is much better than the first draft. I like the introduction. There
are still some mixings in the text, so see comments inline..

The phrase above is the kind of confusion that we wanted to avoid.
"identified" is a property of data, not a 'use' or what people intend to
do with it. The term 'use' belongs to the <purpose> - section of the
specification where we don't use the term identified. So I suggest we
take the lesson from the UA TF and alter the phrase to:

he most common term in the specification is "identified data" and
focuses on whether a service knows your identity.

information that reasonably can be used by the datacollector 
to identify an individual is "identifiable data". Identified means that
the identification already happened. This especially important if you
remember the worries about somebody coming up and wanting access to all
the info on him in the logs of a large portal site. We decided to say
that if information is well-organized and they know you, they should
give access. But we did not want to express access to some plain
log-info, where the pseudonyms (IP e.g) were not resolved.

Suggestion: 

"Identified data" is information in a record or profile and already tied
to an individual.

Ari, the attempt can happen anytime. If I use the identifiable data via
additional processing to identify an individual, this is purpose of
identification. The collection happened earlier and access has nothing
to do with it. So I'm a bit unhappy with your example. 

Suggestion (depending on my definition above)

For example, a data collector storing Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
(which can be created dynamically or could be static and therefore tied
to a particular computer used by a single individual) should consider
the IP address "identified data" only when this data is added to the
record or profile of a specific individual.

The rest is ok, good work
