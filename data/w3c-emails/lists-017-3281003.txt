In the absence of concrete proposal on the grouping mechanisms or 
documentation of the performance issues or follow up on the legal 
issues, I don't think we have much to discuss, so I am canceling the 
call this week. Our next next P3P spec WG call will be on Wednesday, 
August 26 at 11 am US Eastern.

In the mean time....

Please comment on Ari's latest identified/identifiable draft

Please comment on the user agent TF's plain English translation

and Rigo's comments

I would like to get the above more or less resolved via email so that 
on Aug 26 we can discuss the other items, assuming proposals are 
received.

Lorrie
