Referring to the spec call on 13 August 2003:

  - P3P beyond HTTP - Patrick Hung
    - Nothing new to report.  Waiting for comments.
    - WG comments not yet provided to Liberty
    - ACTION: TF to decide what we want to propose for inclusion in the
      1.1 spec

As the P3P 1.0 spec is described in the context of HTTP, it may be
appropriate to propose Web 
services protocols UDDI, WSDL and SOAP in the P3P 1.1 spec. In particular,
the P3P 1.0 spec 
does mention to have other protocols in Section 2.5.

Thus, I would suggest to describe P3P policy reference files in the context
of WSDL in the first place. 
It is because WSDL is definitely needed in both "publish" and "direct
publish" in the Web services model. 
In addition, a requestor should check the WSDL document (at least once
before his first time to bind to a 
specific Web service) via a service locator (acts like a user agent in P3P).
Furthemore, those <include/> 
and <exclude/> elements in P3P 1.0 spec can also be used to define which Web
methods in a Web service 
is covered by P3P policies and etc.

If all these suggestions sound ok, could we propose to describe this
scenario into Section 2.5 or even a new 
section in 1.1 spec?

Any comment/suggestion?

Patrick.
