The attendance on working group conference calls has been poor lately, 
and a number of folks who have committed to various action items have 
not been following through on them. This working group has an ambitious 
schedule, and in order to not fall behind we need everybody's 
participation and cooperation. I have not been enforcing the official 
participation rules because I realize it is summer and a lot of folks 
are on vacation. However, if things do not improve come fall, we will 
enforce these rules, as specified in our charter [1]:

   In order to maintain good standing status, WG members must
   consistently participate in two out of three working group meetings
   (both remote and face-to-face), take on working group assignments,
   and complete working group assignments in a timely fashion. These
   criteria may be relaxed at the discretion of the WG Chair and Team
   Contact for WG members who are contributing to the success of the
   working group but are frequently unable to participate in meetings
   due to funding, scheduling, or language issues.

If you cannot participate in a WG call, please let me know in advance, 
and try to send your comments on the agenda items we will be 
discussing. If you know now that you don't really have time to 
participate in this WG and would like to be taken off the mailing list, 
let us know that too (if you would like to stay on the interest group 
mailing list but be removed from the working group mailing list that is 
an option too, just let us know). If you can find someone else in your 
organization to replace you, so much the better.

Our charter [1] requires us to publish a last call working draft by 
January, and I intend to stick with this schedule. This means that any 
issues that are not resolved by January will not make it into P3P 1.1. 
I am pushing to get as many issues as possible resolved before I go on 
maternity leave in a few weeks. Rigo will be chairing the group in my 
absence for most of the rest of the year and will try to get as many 
additional issues as possible resolved. But if people are not proactive 
about stepping forward with proposals on the issues they care about, 
these issues will not be addressed in P3P 1.1.

We have actually made a lot of progress on P3P 1.1 and I really 
appreciate the efforts of those who have contributed. But I want to 
make sure that we keep up the momentum and continue to make good 
progress.

Thanks!

Lorrie
