Those comments were now provided, see on the member-only list

Yes, the beyond HTTP was already discussed earlier and we didn't wanted
to preclude other uses. For WSDL, comments from Hugo are pending. I will
try to get those soon. For SOAP, we might want some help from the XML
Prot Group in constructing the binding. Perhaps Mark Nottingham is able
to help us a bit.

I think it is definitely a good idea to look into WSDL bindings. Isn't
this what is already contained in the Task Force WD?

We still have to discuss advantages and disadvantages of having a
standalone document vs. integration into the 1.1 Spec (e.g. conformance)
