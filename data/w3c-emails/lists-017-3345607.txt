That would be great. I will keep on thinking along this line. In fact, I am
on vacation from 29/8 to 7/9. However, I will try my best to attend next

Yes, you are right. However, I think that we should polish the content in a
format that can be merged into the P3P 1.1 spec.

I am looking forward to discussing with you on Sept 9. Have a nice trip.

Cheers,

Patrick.
