Hi Jerry,

thanks for the update. I'll review it and comment/update it.

The reason why I did the mandatory opt-in was to preserve semantics:
- The semantics of a P3P 1.1 and P3P 1.0 policy should be similar

If the semantics supersedes the opt-in/outs of 1.0 or if there must not be 
any opt-in/outs then it may happen that something is optional in 1.1 that 
is required in 1.0 or vice versa.

Regards,
  matthias
