FOREWORD 
  
Daniel Sabbah, Vice President
A&IM Development and SWG Technology, IBM Software
  
Daniel Sabbah introduces the inaugural issue of JWSR, which he see as a
medium to provide a channel for industry professionals, academic researchers
and decision makers in the field of web services to publish and share 
information with each other. He feels the readers will gain the explicit 
and up-to-date knowledge of Web services research activities and
technologies
from this journal, especially researchers and architects to identify the
trends of the relevant R&D topics and coordinate their own positions in a
more competitive approach.


EDITORIAL PREFACE 
  
"Challenges and Opportunities for Web Services Research"
  
Liang-Jie Zhang, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center
  
Web services are becoming a major research topic for computer scientists,
engineers and business consulting professionals. In this preface, the
journal
editor in chief outlines the challenges of the current Web services research
topics from the modeling, interoperability, and mathematical foundations
points of view. Zhang introduces some research opportunities and possible
future directions for moving Web services forward via some illustrative
ideas
such as business semantic computing as well as killer application driven Web
services research approaches.


PAPERS

PAPER ONE

"A Spanning Tree Based Approach to Identifying Web Services"

Hemant Jain, University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, USA
Huimin Zhao, University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, USA
Nageswara R. Chinta, Tata Consultancy Services, India

Web service has been envisioned as an important trend in application
development
and integration. It allows pre-built applications/application components
wrapped
as web services to interact with each other through standardized interfaces
and
to from larger application systems. This paper describes a formal approach
to web
services identification, which is a critical step in designing and
developing
effective web services.

PAPER TWO

"Web Services Enabled E-Market Access Control Model"

Harry J. Wang, University of Arizona, USA
Hsing K. Cheng, University of Florida, USA
J. Leon Zhao, University of Arizona, USA

With the emergency of global e-markets, companies collaborate more and more
in
order to streamline their supply chains. Because of the complex
relationships among
companies, controlling the access to shared information found in e-markets
is a vital
but difficult task. In this paper the authors propose a process to integrate
several
known access control mechanisms such as role-based access control,
coalition-based
access control, and relationship driven access control into an E-Market
Access Control
model (EMAC).

PAPER THREE
  
"Integration of Business Event and Rule Management With the Web Services
Model"
  
Karthik Nagarajan, Herman Lam, Stanley Y.W. Su, University of Florida, USA

While Web services technology provides a promising foundation for developing
distributed
applications for e-business, additional features are required to make this
paradigm truly
useful in the real world. In particular, interactions among business
organizations need
to follow the policies, regulations, security and other business rules of
the organizations.
In this paper, the authors focus on incorporating the business event and
rule-management
concepts into the Web services model at the service provider side.

PAPER FOUR

"Implementation and Performance of WS-Security"

Satoshi Makino, Kent Tamura, Takeshi Imamura, and Yuichi Nakamura,
IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory, Japan

This article describes performance improvements for the Web Services
Security (WS-Security)
specification. In the course of its development and performance measurement,
the authors
identified bottlenecks in the XML parsing and public key operations such as
RSA signature
and encryption. To minimize the impact of these bottlenecks, the authors
implemented a
stream-based WS-Security processor and showed its efficiency in XML parsing,
in terms of
both the processing time and the memory usage.
