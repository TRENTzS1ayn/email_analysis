Here is a new version of the domain relationship proposal. The first
attachment is a "clean copy" and the second has highlighting showing all the
changes made from the previous same-entity domain relationship proposal --
less readable but useful if you're familiar with the previous proposal.
 
An HTML version will be posted on the site soon.
 
An overview of the changes:
1. Merged in agent proposal, consistent with the definition of recipient
element "ours" that includes "ourselves and entities acting as our agents"
(per Rigo's suggestion)
2. Moved PRF KNOWN-HOSTS element inside POLICY-REF element, also stated that
it can occur at the higher level (per Rigo's suggestion)
3. Added mention of PRF expiration applying to known-hosts declarations (per
discussion on recent call)
4. Revised P3P header for compact policy usage... I'm still hanging on to
this idea.
5. Revised proposed user-agent rules for interpreting known-hosts info
6. Added section concerning mentioning user-agent playback issues
 
Please read and comment. Thanks.
