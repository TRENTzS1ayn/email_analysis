> A Publication of Inderscience Publishers (www.inderscience.com)
> 
> 
> The International Journal of Web Services proposes and fosters discussion
> on web service technology with a focus on its application, emphasising
> issues of architecture, implementation, and standardisation. This
> perspective acknowledges the complexity and challenges developers are
> currently faced with when designing and deploying web service based
> solutions. As one cornerstone of web service technology, the journal will
> also include topics on standardisation with special emphasis on in-depth
> analysis of practical applications of existing standards as well as
> proposals for general solutions to still-missing pieces.
> 
> OBJECTIVES 
> The objectives of the journal are to establish an effective channel of
> communication between decision makers, academic and research institutions
> and persons concerned with the practical deployment of web services in
> industry. It also aims to promote and coordinate developments in the field
> of web services. By tackling issues of current research, standardisation,
> and deployment, it brings together people from both academia and industry.
> By allowing them to share new ideas and exchange best practice approaches,
> it creates a vital resource for both to drive future work and leverage web
> service usage. The international dimension is emphasised in order to
> overcome cultural and national barriers and to meet the needs of
> accelerating technological and ecological change and changes in the global
> economy.
>  
> READERSHIP 
> The journal provides a vehicle to help industry professionals, academics,
> researchers and decision makers, working in the field of web service
> technology, engineering and standardisation, to disseminate information
> and to learn from each others' work.
>  
> CONTENTS
> The journal publishes original papers, review papers, technical reports,
> new specification proposals, case studies, conference reports, management
