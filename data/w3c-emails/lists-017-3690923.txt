2004 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2004)
===================================================================
September 15-18 2004, Shanghai, China
http://conferences.computer.org/scc/2004

Sponsored by IEEE Computer Society Technical Community for Services
Computing (TCSC)
http://tab.computer.org/tcsc/
                                                        
With support of 
Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), China
E-Business Technology Institute, The University of Hong Kong, China


Call for Papers (Preliminary)
-----------------------------

Services computing is the evolution of Internet computing by leveraging
services oriented architecture. It encompasses a new class of ground
breaking technology suite - Web services and services oriented Grid/Utility
Computing, e-Business, and Autonomic Computing. Web services is finding
pervasive applications in new products and applications. Grid computing has
been leveraging Web services standards to provide standard interfaces for
Grid resources. The service collaboration and management afforded by service
computing will allow disaggregated businesses to form value chains for
improving productivity. The paradigm shift in focus from data management to
process management is also leading to large scale implementations based on
service-oriented architecture.

The 2004 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2004) will
be the first annual conference sponsored by IEEE Computer Society Technical
Community for Services Computing (TCSC) in collaboration with other
technical committees in IEEE Computer Society and other organizations in the
world. The scope of SCC 2004 is Web services centric Services Computing that
covers Grid/Utility Computing, e-Business Computing, and Autonomic
Computing. It will foster cross-disciplinary interaction in the field of
services centric computing technologies and applications. The insight and
vision would shape the research agenda in services computing over the next
decade.

SCC 2004 will be held in Shanghai, China, September 15-18 2004. SCC 2004 is
the extended event of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Web Services
(ICWS 2004, http://conferences.computer.org/icws/2004), which will be held
in San Diego, July 6-9 2004. SCC 2004 provides a forum for researchers and
industry practitioners to exchange information regarding advancements in the
state of art in Services Computing, to identify emerging research topics,
and to explore the future directions of services computing.

In SCC 2004, topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the
following: 

- Formal foundations of Services Computing 
- Web services and Grid architecture
- Web services and Grid security 
- Frameworks for building Web services and Grid applications 
- Grid services creation and enabling infrastructures 
- Web services representation, discovery, composition (Web processes)
- Grid resource management
- Dynamic Web Services invocation and orchestration
- Quality of services and deployment issues
- Solution management for Web services and Grid infrastructure 
- Standards (e.g., UDDI, SOAP) and their enhancements
- Role of semantics for Web services, Business semantic computing
- Detailed applications and case studies for Web services and Grid
applications for E-business, E-service applications, Science and Engineering
- Services-oriented business process integration and management 
- Business Grid: Business process Grid and business application Grid
- Services oriented autonomic computing technology and solutions for IT
system and e-business system management
