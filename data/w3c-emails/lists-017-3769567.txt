When looking over this sheet with ppl on my team we found 2 more issues
in the translations. They are around pseudo-analysis and development
being almost the same definition and the definition of the computer
category sounding too negative. I have proposed new definitions in the
notes column of the attached file.

 

Please give me any feedback you have on these.
