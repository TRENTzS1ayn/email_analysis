It depends on the availability of resources. I think the spec itself 
should just have the English translation. But we should post other 
translations on the W3C web site. Rigo mentioned the possibility of 
getting assistance from some EU government translation service or 
something. Of course, if there are any WG members who have access to 
translation services, all contributions would be welcome.
