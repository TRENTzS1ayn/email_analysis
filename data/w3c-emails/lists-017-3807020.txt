Thanks for taking the time to look at the matrix again.

Differentiating between pseudo-analysis and develop is tricky. Both are 
for research. Both are not supposed to identify the individual. The 
conceptual difference is that pseudo-analysis involves the creation of 
a (pseudonymous) profile of an individual (and thus lends itself to 
researching things that require tracking an individual's use of a 
service, for example), while develop does not involve the creation of a 
profile. So that's why I used the term "record identified with you." 
The new wording that you propose for develop could describe 
pseudo-analysis equally well. Any other ideas?

For computer you proposed: "Information about the computer you are 
using. Such as its hardware, software, or internet address." If you 
change the . to a , and make it "Information about the computer you are 
using, such as its hardware, software, or internet address." I would be 
happy with that.
