    http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/05-cc-changes-to-P3P.html
    This is also related to Bugzilla 169
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=169

3. Resolve Bugzilla 224
The UA TF recommends adding the following text to section 3.2.4 The
ENTITY element to address the problem tha tthe spec currently allows
for multiple instances of data elements within an ENTITY element but
user agents have trouble displaying this:

Although it is permissable for a particular DATA element to appear
more than once within a single ENTITY element, this is not
recommended as user agents may not display multiple instances of a
DATA element correctly. Policy writers who wish to indicate multiple
points of contact for customer service at a web site should use the
DISPUTES element, which is designed to have  multiple instances.

4. Discuss Jeremy's proposals (to be sent to the list soon)

5. Set date for next call (July 23)
