Regrets, I have another teleconf at that time. But I just published a new 
version of the report:
  http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-beyond-http/
  $Revision: 1.26 $ on $Date: 2003/07/08 21:23:04 $ GMT
  "wsdl example and extension now work in XSV thanks to PLH, 
  many URIs corrected to disambiguate between URIs of the registrar 
  and registry, and many other fixes"

I have not -- yet -- received the review nor comments that I expected from 
this group. (When Patrick is back, it would also probably be worthwhile to 
consider what will happen to this document when I'm no longer available to 
work on it after July -- and I'm also taking lots of Holiday this month so 
time is shortening...)
