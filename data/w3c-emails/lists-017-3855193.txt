An interesting P3P + Web services related paper that I found at the ICWS'03
last week:

Abstract - Individual service system will be combined
and collaborated over the network into one-stop service
systems within very short time. We have developed a
service integration platform based on the autonomous
decentralized service system (ADSS) architecture
influenced by TINA business model and functionalities.
On the platform, we propose and implement a mechanism
to control disclosure range of personal information
across the domains by expanding P3P framework to
personalize the services of the un-foreknown providers.
The platform can be applied to various types of service
systems. Here we also introduce an examples of
application developed on the platform.

Keywords: Service Integration, P3P, Privacy
Management, Mediation

If you are interested in it, I will ask for the authors' 
permission for distributing in our group.

Regrets, I have another teleconf at that time. But I just published a new 
version of the report:
  http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-beyond-http/
  $Revision: 1.26 $ on $Date: 2003/07/08 21:23:04 $ GMT
  "wsdl example and extension now work in XSV thanks to PLH, 
  many URIs corrected to disambiguate between URIs of the registrar 
  and registry, and many other fixes"

I have not -- yet -- received the review nor comments that I expected from 
this group. (When Patrick is back, it would also probably be worthwhile to 
consider what will happen to this document when I'm no longer available to 
work on it after July -- and I'm also taking lots of Holiday this month so 
time is shortening...)
