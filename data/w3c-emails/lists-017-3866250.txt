I also can't make it for the call this morning. Attached is a proposal for
how to solve the "same entity" domain relationship problem. Please review
and offer any comments. There is an extension to this proposal for the agent
problem, but Brooks and I are still kicking it around and aren't quite happy
with it yet.

Thanks.
