One of the AT&T lawyers looked over our translation draft and had only 
the following comments:

> 1. under "non-identifiable" -- not sure everyone would know what 
> "anonymized" means, is it technically a word?
>
> 2. under "historical" -- no idea what "social history" is
>
> 3. under "preference" -- I would use more of the p3P spec definition
