Hi Jim, 

The first paragraph of my suggested wording below was designed to give
people at least a hint of what is important when designing privacy
enhanced systems. Instead of just taking a whole paragraph to describe
one special case and raise the finger saying 'potential for abuse', this
hint should be kept. I compressed it to one sentence.

Additionally talking only about 'abuse' is not strong enough.
In most member-countries of the OECD, such behaviour would be illegal
and even subject to prosecution and penal sanctions. That's why I added
a sentence. 

See the suggested text inline..

Best, 

Rigo

It might be  illegal to create or process such linked information in
countries with data protection laws, especially in the EU, without
having a valid legal reason for the processing. Therefor it is
recommended to avoid generating a complete transparency of a natural 
person by accident of privacy unaware design.
