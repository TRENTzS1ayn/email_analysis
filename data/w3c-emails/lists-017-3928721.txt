Joseph, 

I owe you this since a long time.

The idea and solutions described below were developed as an outcome of
the dependency - discussions with XForms. 

Steven Pemberton suggested a very simple binding that would allow to
bind a P3P-Policy to arbitrary XML-Elements. He thought it would be a
quick and short specification to do as it would define a generic
attribute like xml lang=..[1] This could be done in a separate
specification, but is also a possible candidate be included in the
[beyond HTTP] stuff.

So I suggest to specify an XML-attribute that can be generally used to
point to a _Policy_ (not PRF). The binding is no issue as the attribute
itself defines it's own binding by the element it is sitting on. 

In a past email, Steven Pemberton gave an example of how this could look
like[2]
