Yes, and now I expect to have little time for this issue.

I don't completely understand. I note that in the CR [a] they have a 
mechanism for associating an input with a "p3ptype." (I'll also note that 
for historical purposes some privacy advocates *objected* to P3P 
controlling the exchange of information under a policy. For some reason, 
when we made the policy orthogonal to the actual auto-fill or control of 
the exchange, which permits someone to make misrepresentations in the 
policy and then solicit lots of unrelated information in a form, they felt 
*happier*. <shrug/>)

You seem to be suggesting that you'd associate an actual policy with an 
element (e.g., p3ppolicy), for example:
<model>
 <instance><root><yourname/><homeEmailAddress></root></instance>
 <bind "creditCardNumber" p3ppolicy="http://example.com/some-policy.xml"/>
</model>
but I don't think that's what Steven is discussing in [2]. I *think* they 
are using p3ptype and perhaps asking two questions:
1. How/when is the evaluation of a policy governing a form field 
corresponding to a p3ptype affect the auto-filling of the form. I think 
Steven is comfortable with the model there but I can't say I understand 
everything involved there.
2. Even if the P3P policy permits its release, should it be released if the 
form field is not displayed to the user via old CSS mechanisms, or XForms 
switch/case mechanism. I think it would be a good idea for the HTML family 
of specifications to recommend that fields should NOT be auto-filled if 
they are not presented to the user. (Of course, agents will not be able to 
figure this out in all cases as one could use various size,color, CSS 
tricks?)
