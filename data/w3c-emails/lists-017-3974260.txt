You introduce a <privacy /> element that carries the URI to a PRF

Instead of linking to a PRF and from the PRF back to the instance, you
could directly reference the policy:
so the example in "The Scope of Layers and Bindings (HTTP and SOAP)"[1]
would change to something with direct connection to a policy. That would
allow to have a policy per element as domain-info might have a different
impact than <PersonalInfo> (but hasn't here as we have whois)

So I give you the example of how powerful this could be. As it is
generic to XML, it could be also used in RDF.
