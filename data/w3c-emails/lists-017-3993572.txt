I think this is addressed by the report, the XML instance would have to 
reference a policy though with something like:
    <my:Privacy my:rel='P3Pv1'
       my:href='http://registrar.example.com/w3c/p3p.xml'/>

Can't the Policy simply enumerate that particular element via 
  <DATA ref="#user.home-info.city"/>

What is WKL? Is this addressed the same way as (a) above?

Yes, this is addressed in the report.
