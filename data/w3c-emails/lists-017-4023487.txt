The semantics of a P3P policy is that is applies to all data collection 
associated with a URI -- you cannot currently exclude data collected at 
that URI from your policy. If you only reference a particular element 
in your policy and do not reference the other elements at that policy, 
then your policy is wrong. This is especially problematic in the case 
of multiple policies applying to different elements on a page -- how 
would you explain that in the existing framework unless each element 
was submitted to a different action URI?

Imagine that the INCLUDE syntax in a PRF allowed you to say that the 
scope of a policy was a specific set of XML elements found at a URI 
rather than to all content found at that URI.
