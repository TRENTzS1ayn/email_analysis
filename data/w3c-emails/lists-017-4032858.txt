MINUTES: 14 July 2003 User Agent Task Force Call

We spent most of the call discussing the Fidelity comments
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-p3p-spec/2003Jul/0006.html
and some related suggestions from Dave Stampley. Lorrie has posted an 
updated matrix at http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-translation.htm that 
reflects the changes we made to the access elements, admin, tailoring, 
pseudo-decision, individual decision, physical, and financial (email 
her if you want the excel version). She has also folded in the other 
comments that have been raised over the past week that we will discuss 
on next week's call.

We had some discussion about changing the phrase "allow you to access" 
in the access definitions to "let you access" or "give you access to" 
... the consensus was that both of these choices were better than what 
we have currently but people wanted to think more about which choice 
they prefer.

We had some discussion about the RECIPIENT definition in the spec. 
There is some inconsistency in that the recipient definition states 
that it applies to the legal entity *beyond* the service provider and 
its agents, and yet the ours definition references the service provider 
and its agents. This might be solved by removing "and its agents" from 
the recipient definition and "ourselves" from the ours definition. We 
will discuss this further on the next call.

Jeremy asked when the work of this task force would be finalized and 
said that it would be useful to have it finalized by mid-August to have 
time to get this language into an upcoming browser release. The group 
felt that mid-August was reasonable. While there is still the 
possibility that changes might be made during the spec review process 
(last call, CR, PR, etc.), hopefully those changes will be minimal.

Our next call will be on Tuesday, July 22 at 11 am US Eastern (the 
usual bridge has been reserved).
