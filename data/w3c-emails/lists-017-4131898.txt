Thank you Steven, it's useful to see the original source when trying to 
figure out what the issue is! <smile/>

I'll note that since this email was sent over a year ago, you presently 
don't appear [1] to do either of these. Instead,
(a) XForms doesn't have any special mechanisms for the policy association, 
instead you reference the existing methods [2] (well known location, link 
tag, HTTP header).
(b) Orthogonally, a P3P data element type can be bound [3] to an XForms 
instance data node. I assume there must be a one-to-one mapping for each, 
so the binding list could get rather exhaustive.

Even your suggestion above did *not* require a per element (e.g., 
"user.personname.given") policy association, only a per submission 
association.
