Minutes of the 22 July 2003 User Agent task force call

Present:

Lorrie
Bill
Dave
Jeff
Brooks
Ari

1. Discuss access wording:
"give you access to" vs. "let you access"

The group agreed to use the phrase "give you access" because it is more 
active, correctly implies that the site will do something, and best 
mirrors the wording in the spec.

2. Should we use full sentences or sentence fragments for purpose and
recipient? Alternatively we could provide both. Another alternative
would be to provide only one but indicate that it is acceptable for
user agents to do the other.

The group agreed to use sentence fragments because most user agents 
will display these fragments below an appropriate heading. Dave had 
some concerns about whether some of the elements might be less clear 
this way. He will raise the issue again if he finds specific instances 
of this.

3. Go through comments in red in translation matrix
at http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-translation.htm

We got through the proposed changes for the ACCESS, DISPUTES, and 
NON-IDENTIFIABLE elements, as well as some of the PURPOSE elements. We 
made changes to the following translations: nonident, all, 
contact-and-other, ident-contact, other-ident, none, DISPUTES, 
NON-IDENTIFIABLE, PURPOSE. Lorrie posted an updated matrix at 
http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-translation.htm. She will update it 
again with any additional comments she receives before the next call.

4. Our next call will be on Tuesday, July 29 from 10:30 am to noon. 
Please try to call in on time so we can try to get through the rest of 
the matrix on this call.
