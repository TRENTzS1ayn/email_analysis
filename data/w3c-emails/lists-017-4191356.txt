Participants:
Lorrie
Bill

We worked through most of the red comments at 
http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-translation.htm and reached a consensus 
on most items. Changes were made to the following elements: current, 
develop, pseudo-analysis, individual-analysis, RECIPIENT, ours, 
delivery, same, other-recipient, unrelated, public, RETENTION, 
no-retention, stated-purpose, legal-requirement, business-practices, 
indefinitely, CATEGORIES, computer, interactive, demographic, content, 
political, preference, location. Lorrie has posted a spreadsheet with 
remaining items for discussion. Those who participated should also 
check to make sure all changes are accurately reflected.

Our next call will be tomorrow, 30 July at 11 am Eastern (the spec call 
will be cancelled).
