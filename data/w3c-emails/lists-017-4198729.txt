The P3P spec call previously scheduled for 11 am Eastern on Wednesday, 
July 30, 2003 has been cancelled because we are still waiting for the 
Microsoft proposals.

The next P3P spec call will be on Wednesday, August 6.

The user agent task force will use the bridge on July 30 at 11 to 
continue going through the spreadsheet at
