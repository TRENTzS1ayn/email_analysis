Hi Jeremy,

thanks for your design. I feel that grouping statements is a good idea.

The actual syntax for grouping is elaborated in our earlier draft on 
consent choices:
  http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/05-cc-changes-to-P3P.html

I feel that grouping statements is a good idea for multiple purposes.
Therefore, I feel that we should have a general group mechanism where each 
group should have multiple properties:
- opt-in opt-out or always (from consent choices)
   syntactically this can be implicit: either all statements are 
always/opt-in, or opt-out.
- target (something specifying whether it's the ebay or amazon part)
   The target is something that might be useful to add to your proposal.
   I don't know how to express this in a nice syntax.

Why don't we merge both proposals into a "grouping statements" proposal?

Regards,

matthias
