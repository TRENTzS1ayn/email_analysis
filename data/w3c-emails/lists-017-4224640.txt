Minutes of the 30 July 2003 User Agent task force call

We completed discussing the remaining comments on the matrix at 
http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-translation.htm. We made changes to the 
following elements: law, pseudo-decision, individual-decision, 
historical, public. We will recommend to the full WG that the words 
"beyond the service provider and its agents" be removed from the 
RECIPIENT definition in the spec. Some concerns remain about the spec 
definitions for some of the DISPUTES and REMEDIES elements. We will try 
to get more feedback on this from some of the lawyers who have been 
involved, especially Joel Reidenberg.

Lorrie posted a revised matrix and has invited public comments by 13 
August. This will allow us to make another pass at revisions by the end 
of August so they can be incorporated in the next browser releases.
