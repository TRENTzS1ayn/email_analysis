User agent task force members (and anyone else who is interested) - I 
would like to get another round of feedback on the user agent 
translation document by June 10. If you haven't already done so, please 
review the document at http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-translation.htm 
(if you would like an MS Excel version for easier printing and editing, 
please email me and I will send it to you). I last updated this 
document on 27 May 2003.

To see what a P3P policy looks like translated with all these 
components, please check out: http://www.goats.com/features/privacy/
One of my students (who also runs the goats web site in his spare time) 
put this demo together.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, get your feedback in so we can move forward 
with further external vetting and testing. If I don't get feedback I 
will assume that you all think the proposed translation is perfect as 
is.

Remember we are mostly interested in the following questions:

- Will the proposed language be clear to end users? Are there ways we 
can say the same thing that are clearer, simpler, or more concise?

- Is the proposed language consistent with the normative definition of 
each element in the P3P specification? While the proposed language may 
omit some details included in the full definition, our objective is 
that it should be consistent with the normative definition and that an 
end-user reading this definition only will not be mislead.
