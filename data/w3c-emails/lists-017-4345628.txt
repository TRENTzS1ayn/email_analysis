I'm not willing to state the opposite: that, absent a mechanism for 
end-to-end security, a SOAP sender and receiver will be the only SOAP 
parties to see a message. "SOAP does not specify how such a message path is 
determined and followed." [1] In example 16 [2], a SOAP intermediary 
changed the message in a way that the sender did not necessarily know 
about.

I'm still not sure I understand. We've already documented the question of 
(transparent) intermediaries (one can include a mandatory header of 
policies they must respect or use e2e security). If your question is that 
people typically only associate a P3P policy with an HTTP server's log, and 
there might be other logs that are relevant, I'm not sure. I think the 
governing section of P3P is "2.3.3 Applying a Policy to a URI". It has a 
bunch of examples, and we *could* include our own, but the basis is still 
about a method (GET, POST) on a URI, which is still perfectly applies to 
our scenarioius...?

OK, that's good to have in the back pocket

You mean in the UDDI context specifically, or the in general. I don't see an 
immediate need for this, I presume policies are deprecated by simply 
removing an old policy from the dereferencing URI and replacing it with the 
new one...?
