Yes, there are some other logs beside the HTTP server's log such as the 
application can also keep its logs, e.g., ASP.NET.

Yes, it is fine.

I mean in general. I just wonder whether there is any practice for privacy
policies
mangement? If an organizaiton changes its privacy policy, what's happened if
there
is conflicts between old and new one? Can the data's subject has the right
to ask
for remedies? Do we also have to cature these issues in P3P? Maybe these
issues are
not relevant to this document; they are more on the management side or even
strongly
relate to legal aspects. Just some thoughts.

In the coming few days, I will check the document and see whether we miss
any important
points.

Thanks and talk to you later.

Patrick.
