How is this done? I've read [55] and it's written in the abstract, and I've 
also looked at [56], but I'm not sure how to apply it. (Also, while we've 
been exploring various options, we also having been avoiding the "exotic" 
features unless there some cause to demonstrate them.)

We've mocked up a header by which a sender can "ask" all intermediary nodes 
to also understand the privacy policies of the carried application data:

<env:Header 
  xmlns='http://registry.example.com/2003/soap-header-p3p-extension.xsd' 
  xmlns:env='http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope' >
  <Privacy env:role='http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/role/next'
    env:mustUnderstand='true'>
    <rel>P3Pv1</rel>
    <href>http://registry.example.com/P3P/PolicyReferences.xml</href>
  </Privacy>
</env:Header>

But what does one have to do to represent it as a "feature"? Also, since we 
are not an application ourselves (but expect P3P to be used by "adopting 
applications") we presently can't limit this to any particular MEP. I'd 
expect such a header would be orthogonal to other MEPs and "features".

So, for example, a UDDI registry would probably know how to pull information 
for its own puproses and translate it into UDDI syntax?

There's nothing terribly novel in this case. But in your example, we didn't 
have the HTTP and the CGI presenting you with different policies. The 
policy associated with the HTTP was good for your interactions with the 
specified URI (e.g., the CGI). In SOAP, the recipient of the *transport* 
layer (the SMTP recipient or HTTP server the POST is sent to) might be 
different the the SOAP ultimateReceiver, right? Which brings me to the 
question, in SOAP, how do you identify the "ultimateReceiver"? What URI 
should the PolicyRef file refer to, the URI of its immediate transport 
counterpart (I don't think so), or the "ultimateReceiver" -- if you can 
identify that?

I think this relates to my question above, and Patrick has explored this a 
bit. In our example, we associated it with the definition (my:Privacy is a 
child of the wsdl:definitions), are you recommending it be a child of the 
wsdl:operation element?
