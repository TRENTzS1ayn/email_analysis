I also checked [55] and [56]. Based on my understanding, if we can describe
the proposed privacy assertions for SOAP messages in the context of MEP and
also
describe the proposed privacy assertions' properties in the context of SOAP 
Processing Model and the SOAP Protocol Binding Framework. Then, the proposed

privacy assertions can become a "feature" or I should say a new "feature" in

the SOAP framework. From the other aspect, we also have to define the 
event-condition-rules for the proposed privacy scenrio in the context of
MEP.
Is my interpretation correct? 

Any illustrative example? Or is there any standard graphical representation
to 
depict MEP such as Petri-Net? It sounds that this topic is very interesting.

Does Hugo mean that we should have a generic MEP for the proposed privacy
assertions in SOAP messages? Not tie up with any domain specific
application.

Yes, we should have this assumption and I do believe some related research 
should have been done (though I haven't checked it). :-)
However, you can only see those unautomatic UDDI at
http://www-3.ibm.com/services/uddi/
or http://uddi.microsoft.com

I would believe that the URI should be the URI of the ultimateReceiver's
privacy policy. For those intermediaries, that's why we may have to define
some new roles or "features" for them.

I would believe that we may have to provide two levels (service and
operation)
for optional privacy policies. The operation level's privacy policy can
overwhelm 
the service level's once there exist any contradiction? In the normal case,
the privacy policy should be the union of both for each operaiton? If there
is no operation level so that it is inherited from the servce level.

However, this may cause more thoughts about UDDI as UDDI has three levels:
Business Entity, Business Service and tModel.

Lastly, just a very little typo found at
http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-beyond-http/Overview.html:
"Our scenario is not intended to be a completely accurate 
representation of real world requirements, nor does our 
document necessarily provide a satisfactory solution. 
Instead, this scenario is intended to be sufficiently 
represenative ..."

Talk to you later. Have a nice weekend!

Patrick.
