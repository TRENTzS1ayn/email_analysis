Hi-

I just wanted to briefly introduce myself to the other P3P 1.1 Specification WG
members.  I will be representing American Express on the WG, with particular
interest in the User Agent Behavior and Compact Policies task forces.  As luck
would have it, I'm unavailable for tomorrow's WG call, but I would like to
attend the UA TF call on Thursday.

Regards,

Jeff Edelen
American Express
