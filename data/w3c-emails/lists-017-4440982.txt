I'm Robert Horn and will be representing Agfa on P3P.  This email might
arrive in time for today's conference call.  I have been very active in the
security and privacy area for healthcare, especially hospital operations.
I represent Agfa on:
   the Joint NEMA/Cocir/JIRA Security and Privacy Committee,
http://www.nema.org/index_nema.cfm/1590/
  several DICOM standards committees (especially WG-6, Base Standard),
http://medical.nema.org
  the Infrastructure and Radiology Technical committees of Integrating the
Healthcare Enterprise (IHE), http://www.rsna.org/IHE/index.shtml

I edited the interim security audit trail draft for IHE last year, and we
are now working on a replacement international standard for privacy and
security audit trails with the IETF, DICOM, HL7, and ASTM standards groups.
Current IHE Infrastructure activity has begun work on healthcare staff
identity management.

The P3P will be important as we extend beyond the internal operations to
include inter-enterprise communications and direct patient communications .
