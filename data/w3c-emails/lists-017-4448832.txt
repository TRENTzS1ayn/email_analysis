This doesn't work without changing the semantics of the
PolicyReferenceFile. The PolRef can only point to relative URI's. So the
issue here is that this PolRef could only state on registry.example.com
and NOT on uddi.example.com..

I'm much more sympathetic to the approach to define something in WSDL
1.2 as there, the properties of a service are defined..

Best,
