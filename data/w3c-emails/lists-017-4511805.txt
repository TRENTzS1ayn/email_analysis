Hi Hugo,

Thanks a lot for your explanation and clarification.

May I ask one more question here. I apologize if I further confuse
you by my misunderstanding... :-)

>When using the http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap/bindings/HTTP/ SOAP
>HTTP/1.1 binding, the P3P feature is expressed as an HTTP header as

>

Based on your description, I believe that I have a picture of how
to define a "feature." Assume my understanding is correct. Then,
it seems that the "feature" is an independent structure that can
be applied/attached into UDDI, SOAP or even WSDL, am I correct?

> A WSDL 1.2 description of a service with such a feature could be (this

>    <value>http://registry.example.com/P3P/Policy.xml</value>
>  </property>
>  </feature>

If I do not misunderstand it, how can I specify/attach the "feature" into 
UDDI, SOAP or even WSDL? Sorry that I am lazy to check the related
specifications.

In many cases, I do imagine that we may need a privacy policy at the
<wsdl:definitions/>
level and then with some other privacy policies at the <wsdl:operation/>
level. Thus,
we may have to do a logical "AND" between the privacy policies in two
different abstraction
levels.

Thanks a lot,

Patrick.
