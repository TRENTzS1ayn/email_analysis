Patrick, I finally got around to adding the references (through some clumsy 
XSLT hackery [1] <smile/>) and I also tried to clean up the use of our 
identifiers and Namespaces[2]. However, it's just as likely I broke 
something, so let me know if I have.

Hugo, a problem I'm experiencing is when I try to validate our WSDL example 
(wsdl-eg.xml) against our augmented wsdl schema (wsdl-p3p-extension.xsd) -- 
because we've added my:Privacy as a child of wsdl:definitions -- XSV gives 
me an error about 'wsdl12-ext.xsd'?
