Hugo, thank you for this extensive (tutorial!) email!

I still can't say I understand all of this Feature and WSDL stuff, but I 
think you have a very important point there. A Policy Reference file 
designates a (1) life time (expiration), (2) policies, (3) and set of paths 
for a web site (via INCLUDE and EXCLUDE) where those policies apply. 
Basically a set of URIs over which one does HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT)
That makes lots of sense for browsing a web sites, but not so much for Web 
Service.

In the Web Service case one will be doing port names (operations) as applied 
to a soap:address? In which case, a Policy Reference file isn't really 
needed.

So we sort of have this, less formally, and we haven't given ita special 
"feature" URI...

Yes, I think so. So in our scenario, we'd still want the Policy Reference 
file for the XForms/XHTML aspect, but not for the registrar to registry 
aspect.

Patrick, is your understanding sufficient that you have a sense of what 
changes we could make to our document? I still need to keep thinking it 
through for myself....
