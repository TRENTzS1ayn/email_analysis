Thanks a lot for your explanation, Hugo!

Hi Joseph,

I can't say that I am understanding sufficient... However, I will study the
SOAP and WSDL "features" and do more thoughts. In the first cut, we
***may*** 
have to revise those SOAP and WSDL examples by using "features" or make the 
"features" version as another option in our document. 

I will be out of office/town and in California from June 22 to July 2.
That's
why I may not be able to check e-mails regularly. Anyway, I have bring
enough
relevant materials with me for reading during the trip. Will get back to you
once I get back to office.

I found a typo in our document: "... secion 1.3) ..." :-)

Cheers and talk to you later.

Patrick.
