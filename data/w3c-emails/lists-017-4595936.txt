Our next User Agent task force call will be on Monday, 23 June 2003 at 
11 am US Eastern. We will use the usual dial-in number (see 
http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Specification/1.1/meetings.html)

AGENDA

1. Discussion of alternatives to "this site" language

2. Continue discussion of proposed translation 
http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-translation.htm ... please continue to 
send your feedback. I have highlighted with red underlined text the 
parts that have been flagged for discussion. If you see something that 
needs discussion that isn't flagged, please let me know.

3. We need to return to the one/multiple entity discussion at some 
point but I would prefer to have some email discussion on it so we 
don't take up a lot of time on the call. We may discuss briefly if time 
permits.

4. Schedule next call
