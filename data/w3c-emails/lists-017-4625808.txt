Minutes of 23 June 2003 P3P User Agent Task Force call

Participants:
Lorrie Cranor (AT&T)
Jeff Edelen (American Express)
Rigo Wenning (W3C)
Brooks Dobbs (DoubleClick)
Giles Hogben (JRC)

1. We discussed alternatives to the "this site" language that we 
generated on our last call. Rigo also suggested we consider using the 
term "party." We decided to recommend use of we/ours/us/ etc... with 
the option that sites might substitute in the name from the entity 
field or hyperlink the "we" to the name from the entity field.

2. We continued discussing the red underlined parts of the matrix. We 
reached a consensus on wording for the access elements and the purposes 
pseudo-analysis, pseudo-decision, individual-analysis, and 
individual-decision. Lorrie has updated the matrix at  
http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-translation.htm accordingly. All that is 
left to discuss is the categories heading and the state category 
(unless people raise new issues).

We began discussing the categories heading. Some concerns were raised 
about how to convey to people that just because a site says they may 
collect a category does not mean that they will collect all data 
elements in that category. We postponed that discussion to our next 
call.

3. Our next call will be on Monday, June 30 at 11 am US Eastern time -- 
same dial-in info. We will try to finish going through the matrix and 
revisit the one-or-many entity issue. Please send any additional agenda 
items or additional items you want to flag from the matrix for 
discussion by the end of the week.
