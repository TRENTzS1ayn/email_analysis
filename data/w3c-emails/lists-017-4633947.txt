A new study was published today by Joseph Turow at the University of 
Pennsylvania called "Americans & Online Privacy: The system is Borken." 
You can find a WSJ article and synopsis at 
http://cryptome.org/dark-privacy.htm -- along with a link to the full 
36-page study. This study basically finds that people don't understand 
privacy policies and don't have a good conceptual understanding of how 
their information flows online. It also finds that when typical web 
site data practices are described to people, they generally don't like 
them.

The author recommends (on page 35) three proposals for US legislation 
including legislation to require websites to use P3P. He discusses P3P 
earlier on page 10, noting that adoption rates are still low. He also 
mentions Privacy Bird (which he describes as "ingenious" -- and no, I 
didn't lobby him to write that -- I'm not sure I've ever talked to him, 
let alone about Privacy Bird.)
