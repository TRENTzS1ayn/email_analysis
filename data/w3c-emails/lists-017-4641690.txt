Folks,

This was sent to nanog earlier in the day. Asrg contributors would help
the (US jurisdiction) FTC's "Do Not Call" (phone spam) service roll-out
by letting Richard Callahan know how to keep the eventual AT&T GS mails
from being some systems' false-positive, and not delivered.

I'll sumarize to the list responses that I'm copied on, using white-out
appropriately if requested. The question will come up again.

P3P contributors are noticed simply because ... watching the US go down
the opt-out path is -- er -- interesting.

Semi-related, the special WHOIS:43 (and other kludges) workshop of the
Montreal meeting of ICANN should be winding up, and I'll sumarize what
others who attended sumarize elsewhere, but the bottom line is something
along the lines of you-know-already -- (US) law-enforcement and (WIPO)
trademark interests claim compelling interests in manditory spam-prone
databases, and the (non-US) ccTLD registry operators and GAC reps reply
that <insert-country-here> isn't a town in California (or Maine for you
who know how Maine's towns are named). ICANN head-butting, or butt-heads.

Oh. The going price for 30 million (that's 3 times 10 to the sixth) email
addresses culled from the combined whois databases is ... US$30. I just
can't wait for enum-on-port-43, oops ... my phone is ringing...

Cheers,
Eric

Good Afternoon 
     and forgive the new guy if I break any rules or conventions.

I work for AT&T Government Solutions and we are about to launch the Do Not Call Registry for the Federal Trade Commission.  At a high level this allows consumers to register their phone numbers to  keep most telemarketers from calling their homes.  Penalties for calling a consumer on the list can be $11K per call and enforcement begins in October.

We are launching consumer registrations on Friday.  My concern:

 - every registration using the web generates an email which must be opened to complete the registration process

We are looking at the potential of MILLIONS OF EMAILS PER DAY beginning Friday.  These will be from the same address and have the same subject line.

I am worried about denial of service or blocking by spam filters if providers are not aware this is coming.

I am hoping this group is a good medium to get the word out to inform the community of this impending event.

At this time I am unable to provide the link or email address, but will do so on Thursday evening if it is of value.

Any thoughts?
