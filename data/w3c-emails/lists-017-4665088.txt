Looks like XSV doesn't know how to handle redirects appropriately:

The effective location of the WSDL XML Schema is
http://www.w3.org/2003/06/wsdl/wsdl12.xsd, and not
http://www.w3.org/2003/06/wsdl. Therefore, the include statement in
wsdl12.xsd should be resolved against
http://www.w3.org/2003/06/wsdl/wsdl12.xsd.

I note that the old version of Xerces that I'm using is also subject to
this problem. Didn't try with a latest one.

Not sure if the WSDL 1.2 specification should reference the effective
location of the XML Schema instead of the namespace...
