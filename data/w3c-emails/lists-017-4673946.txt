Minutes
P3P User Agent Task Force Call
30 June 2003

We discussed and resolved the remaining two flagged items on our 
translation matrix: the category heading and the state category.

Category heading. We decided to adopt the proposed wording: "Types of 
information that may be collected."

During this discussion we discussed the problem that some user agents 
do not enumerate all the data elements that a site lists in their 
policy. Some felt we should encourage sites to always enumerate all 
data elements, but others objected that this may lead to lengthy 
translations. We decided to recommend that all elements be enumerated 
somewhere, but not necessarily in the default view. We will append the 
following words to bullet point 1 of 6.1 (the user agent guidelines): 
"including an enumeration of all data elements referenced in a P3P 
policy."

State. We decided to adopt the wording "Cookies and mechanisms that 
perform similar functions"


We also discussed the question raised previously about whether to 
continue to allow multiple instances of data elements within the ENTITY 
element. Although some members of the group would like to see multiple 
ENTITY elements allowed in the future, adding this now is not going to 
be clean (and some are still skeptical it is needed). We decided 
instead to add the following language to section 3.2.4 of the spec: 
"Although it is permissable for a particular DATA element to appear 
more than once within a single ENTITY element, this is not
recommended as user agents may not display multiple instances of a
DATA element correctly. Policy writers who wish to indicate multiple
points of contact for customer service at a web site should use the
DISPUTES element, which is designed to have  multiple instances." (this 
needs to be approved by the full WG)


Lorrie will post a revised matrix at 
http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-translation.htm later today and Jeremy 
and Rigo will assist in trying to fix the HTML problems.
