public-p3p-spec is the new P3P 1.1 Specification working group mailing  
list. It is publicly archived at  
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-p3p-spec/

Our first working group teleconference will be on Wednesday, April 16  
at 11am US Eastern. For dial-in details, members of this group can see  
http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Specification/1.1/meetings.html. Hopefully  
this group will be officially re-chartered by then.

I would like to get things started via email now. Here are some things  
I would like everyone to do:

- If you haven't already done so, please review the task force  
descriptions at http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/03-tf.html and select at  
least one task force to participate in. Please send email both to me  
and to the task force chair to volunteer for a task force.

- Familiarize yourself with Bugzilla at http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/  
and  
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/ 
reports.cgi?product=P3P&output=most_doomed&links=1&banner=1 -- we are  
going to be using this instead of our issues list to keep track of  
pending issues. This is not exactly the intended use of bugzilla, but  
if you mentally think "issue" when you see the word "bug" I think you  
will find that it works. Please create a bugzilla account for yourself  
so that you can submit and comment on bugs/issues. I have already  
created a bunch of issues in the system based on our discussion at the  
f2f meeting and things that have come up previously on the mailing  
list. I will be assigning many of the issues to the appropriate task  
force chairs once they have created their bugzilla accounts.

Task force chairs: please start thinking about how you want to run your  
task forces. Take a look at the rough list of milestones I created for  
you and let me know if it is ok, and if possibly flesh it out a bit  
more. We are not going to setup separate mailing lists for each TF. I  
suggest that you use public-p3p-spec to communicate with your TF (of  
course you can communicate off list arrangements for teleconferences  
and what not) but prefix your messages with a shorthand for your TF,  
for example I might send a message for the user agent behavior  
taskforce with the subject "UA: reviewing IE6/Netscape7/PB strings". I  
expect all TFs to get started and to have some progress to report on  
the April 16 call.
