I have posted the documents explaining the translation from the P3P 
vocabulary to the terminology used by the Privacy Bird and Netscape 7 
user agents at http://www.w3.org/P3P/1.1/documents.html#ua -- I will 
add the Microsoft IE6 translation as soon as I receive it.

User agent task force members, please start reviewing these documents 
with an eye towards creating a recommended set of translations that we 
can put in a guidelines document. You should consider the overall 
approach of each user agent as well as the specific wording for each 
element. I would like to start a discussion on the high level approach 
and then delve into the details. I am hoping to arrange a conference 
call for this taskforce to discuss sometime the week of April 7.

Lorrie
