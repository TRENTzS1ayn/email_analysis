Thanks Eric, does this mean you would like to be listed as a member of the 
taskforce? <smile/> I've briefly looked into each of of the apps below 
looking for salient requirements and/or features of a scenario that might 
be relevant. Please correct me if you think I've missed something.

This appears to be an extension of the P3P privacy vocabulary with a more 
extensive XML data profile based on XML Schema data types. It appears they 
have the significant portion with {Access, Purpose, Retention, Recipient}. 
Because it's based on a 2000 snapshot of P3P I can't discern any particular 
divergence in the privacy vocabulary because of this app's context. I can 
conclude that they felt there was a need for more extensive and XML Schema 
typed data structures that would perhaps be of interest to the P3P Schema 
taskforce.

I followed this work back in the day and my conclusion would be that there 
was a requirement for terse expression. This appears to be satisfied with 
compact policies and I would expect other apps with a similar requirement 
to use them, or perhaps in the future a binary-XML representation of the 
complete markup...? I've included this in
  http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/04-beyond-http#sec-Others

I'm unfamiliar with this work but I've poked about on:
  http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/provreg-charter.html
  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-provreg-epp-09.txt
and see they have a :
  """   - A <dcp> (data collection policy) element that contains child
    elements used to describe the server's privacy policy for data
    collection and management."""
with an {access, purpose, retention}, elements based on P3P. Since this is 
active work, I think it makes sense to ask them why don't they use the 
elements from P3P itself? And if there are reasons, we'd appreciate the 
feedback. Do you have connections with this work, could you help start that 
conversation?
