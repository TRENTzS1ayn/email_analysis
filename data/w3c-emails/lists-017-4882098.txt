Minutes

   in wait-state on W3CM (management), with no conditions (yet).

2. Task force reports -- chairs please comment or ammend as needed
   - P3P beyond HTTP - Joseph
   Joseph reported:  Chunks posted and may schedule teleconference,
will list five pending if prompted. Rigo intends to comment
that the Joseph/Patrick exchanges are too focused on web
services. Joseph discussed forms and other applications, e.g.,
PROVREG (IETF). Eric commented on the distinction between
onward-transport (EPP) and initial data collection (P3P).
Rigo responded to question on "personal" vs "not" signaling
(IETF/EPP/WHOIS, aka "recipient-only" context), mentioning
Italy and Greece where corporate and personal may be same.

   Lorrie reported:  Disapointing teleconference, will schedule again
this week. Comments on the translation document are sought.

P3Pv1.0 UA read and process w/o error a P3Pv1.1 policy?)

limits for P3Pv1.1.
