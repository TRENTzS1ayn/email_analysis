I attach an xslt for converting policies expressed in XSD format back to the
old format. It is quite short actually. The one which would be almost
impossible to do would be converting new schemas back to old schema format.
But having thought this one over, I came to the conclusion that no-one would
want to do such a thing. If they have written a schema in the new format,
nobody will need it in the old format since that was pretty much useless in
any case. Am I right?

You can try it out on the results of the forwards transform I have also
attached
