Hi Joseph,

I am still catching up with you guys' accent in this research area. :-)

Oops... Yes, you are correct. I was thinking those issues NOT based in the 
context of the Domain Name Service (DNS) registration example described in 
this document. I have to switch my mind to this example only... :-)

Yes, I agree with you. Referring to this DNS registration scenario, the UDDI

issues are not in the top priority.

I was thinking a scenario of mutual privacy validation process, e.g., both
registrant
and registrar have to check each other privacy policies based on their
preferences.
Anyway, this is not the scenario as discussed here.

Referring to this DNS registration scenario, "not precluded" is fine. I am
thinking that it may not be ok in other scenario.

Referring to "2.8 S030 Third party intermediary - 2.8.2 Description," it
says
that "The buyer may be as simple as a browser or as complex as a procurement

application." In this DNS registration scenario, most likely, the registrant

is using a browser to interact with the registrar. Thus, "using cookies" is
definitely feasible and applicable.

Yep, I got what you mean.

I will start to write up the chunks in the context of DNS registration
scenario.

Another typo in the document:

Recipient Service (registry) 
A Web Service that offers an interface to registrars for registering and
maintaining 
domain name registrations. The registry is the participan responsible for
managing 
                                                         ^ *participant*
the database for a DNS Top-Level Domain (TLD) such as ".com". This service
has privacy 
policies as well.

Do you have any timeline for this document? Maybe, we should have a
conference call
for this task force after we have more content in those chunks.

Thanks and talk to you later,

Patrick.
