Soliciting Data from the User

   [P3P] provides four mechanisms for indicating the privacy policy of a
   site, the policy reference file

    1. may be located in a predefined "well-known" location, or
    2. a document may indicate a policy reference file through an HTML
       link tag, or
    3. a document may indicate a policy reference file through an XHTML
       link tag, or
    4. through an HTTP header.

   Adopting applications that rely upon a data format other than (X)HTML
   to solicit information SHOULD support the first and fourth mechanisms
   under the presumption that it is not possible that a user agent will
   mistakenly release information to an application it is not familiar
   with on the basis of [P3P] mechanisms that it is. Adopting
   applications MAY provide a means of associating a a policy reference
   file with their own format.

  XForms and Associating an XML Instance with a [P3P] Policy

   [XForms] is a powerful means of soliciting information in a form,
   validating that information and sending the result to a service.
   [XForms] is expected to be adopted by [XHTML2] which itself includes a
   link tag. Consequently:
     * A future version of P3P SHOULD include the [XHTML2] link element
       as a recognized indicator of a policy reference file, as is
       already done for [XHTML] in [P3P, section2.2.4 The XHTML link tag]
   However, the exact specification of the [XHTML2] link element has not
   yet been resolved. Originally, [XHTML2] defined a link element in its
   own namespace. However that community is now considering the
   requirements and features of [XLink] in the [XHTML2] context.
   Applications other than [XHTML2] will also be able to take advantage
   of [XForms], or different solicitation mechanisms, and MAY also define
   their own indication mechanisms. If they do so, such applications
   SHOULD follow the results of the [XHTML2] and [XLink] discussion. In
   any case, applications using version "1.0" of [P3P] should employ the
   resulting link tag by
     * setting its rel attribute to "P3Pv1"
     * setting its href attribute to the URI of the relevant [P3P] policy
       reference file
