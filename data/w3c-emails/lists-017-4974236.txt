4. Discuss bugzilla 171
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=171

The IBM P3P Policy Editor defines a P3P extension to assign a name
attribute to the STATEMENT element. This is useful for the editor
itself, but it has also proven useful for user agents when they
display policy summaries to users. We should consider making this
extension an "official" part of the P3P specification -- probably by
referencing the extension in v1.1 and turning it into a regular
attribute (without using the extension mechanism ) in future versions.


5. Discuss bugzilla 178
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=178

Consider including mention of postal code, state, or region
information, etc. in definition of the demographic category in section
3.4


Our next call will be on May 28
