It does, and in as far as that happens that is a good thing. However, I have 
two comments:
1. Would it lead to the presumption that a unsigned P3P policy is somehow 
less committed to or binding?
2. Who exactly is validating the signature? This isn't something users are 
likely to comprehend or be able to easily do. (How is it that they are 
getting the service's public key for the validation, this presumes a level 
of infrastructure and knowledge which is not yet present.)

So I think a signed privacy is a nice exercise, but don't find it that 
compelling in the b2c scenario and might weaken the interpretation of a 
unsigned policy.
