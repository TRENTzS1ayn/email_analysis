I don't think by adding non-repudiation to a P3P Policy one reduces the
meaning or value of a non-signed policy. The signature does not add
meaning to the policy. It is only a question of evidence.

That's actually a good question. I would _love_ to see native XML
Signature support in browsers to be able to sign XHTML-pages (for courts
and laws e.g.). But I agree, we are far from there.

It might create yet another incentive to implement XML Sig into an
agent. I think the signature requirement is more or less a requirement
to be able to link old-style paper procedures with digital ones without
to much change. (see EU-Directive on Sig that create an _equivalent_ to
handwritten signature)

So for me, it's a nice enhancement, but not a must be. In fact, it might
be nice to have a common way to do signatures on policies, if there are
many ways to implement that. But Jo, you can tell better _if_ there are
really many ways..
