Right. And I shouldn't have used "bound" as it recalls "bind" which means 
something else in the SOAP context. I'll try to stick with "associate" a 
policy with the application (layer).

This generally sounds ok, though I plan on using XForms with serialized XML 
[1] as part of the user2registrar interface, and SOAP (or UDDI/WSDL as 
approriate) for the registrar to registry. So please don't worry about the 
user2registrar via SOAP bit.
