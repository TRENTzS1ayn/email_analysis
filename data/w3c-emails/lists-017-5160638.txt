The User Agent task force will have a conference call at 11 am US 
Eastern on Friday, May 16. It will be on the usual P3P bridge (see 
http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Specification/1.1/meetings.html)

We will discuss the comments on the translation documents 
(http://www.w3.org/P3P/1.1/documents.html#ua) and especially the 
questions I outlined at the end of
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-p3p-spec/2003Apr/0018.html

If you are a member of this TF and you cannot participate, please send 
your comments prior to the meeting.
