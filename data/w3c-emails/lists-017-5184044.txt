Patrick,

Indeed, an interesting paper. However I read it with an eye towards what we 
could apply towards our "P3P Beyond HTTP" work and don't see any immediate 
take-away. However, since I bothered to read it, I figure I might as well 
share my comments: <smile/>
1. Certainly interesting to see this in light of RDF/DAML.
2. From the point of view of user security and privacy, relying upon a 
service ontology as the significant factor in releasing information does 
not give me great confidence. In their example, my credit card is 
considered "free" to anyone that calls themselves a 
AitTransportationService? Perhaps my reaction is unfair or confused, but 
they make the point that their proposal is *not* limited to the Web and 
URIs, which P3P is. I believe that *any* privacy solution, including those 
for Web services, will depend upon some declaration of service identity 
that is associate with some URI -- not merely an association in an 
ontology.
3. Having been around the course with respect to "negotiation" I prefer to 
use that term to exclusively describe multi-round (interactive) protocols. 
Specifying alternatives in a single transmission can have similar effects, 
but not necessarily as Lorrie and Paul touched on [1].
