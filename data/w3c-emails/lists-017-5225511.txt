Patrick, the service description is true to the scenario, but as I'm not a 
WSDL expert, what led you to include the my:Privacy element as a child of 
the wsdl:definitions?

Section 2.1.2 states:
  Zero or more namespace qualified element information items
  amongst its [children]. Such element information items MUST be a 
  member of one of the element substitution groups allowed at the 
  top-level of a WSDL document as described in 6. Language Extensibility.
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-wsdl12-20030303/#Definitions_XMLRep

So if I understand the WSDL extension model, we would also have to have our 
own schema that includes a redefinition of globalExt or base my:Privacy on 
the ExtensibilityElement complexType? (I don't understand this myself yet 
and haven't found a good example.)

Also, I presume that our WSDL extension is optional. Privacy is not optional 
at the point of solicitation, but since we are saying a WSDL declaration is 
(usefully) redundant, I don't think we need to argue that a WSDL processor 
must understand our extension to even process the description.
