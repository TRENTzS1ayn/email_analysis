No, I simply find WSDL confusing and I'm rather ignorant of it.

Cool, that's a good schema for the data instance sent via XForms -- and that 
can be included in the WSDL *instance's* wsdl:types. My question is about 
the WSDL itself. Does WSDL generically allow you to place any old element 
from a foreign namespace in it's instance? (I don't think so.) If it does 
permit this, does it require you to first provide a schema to validate the 
augmented instance? I think so because of this in the WSDL schema:

  <xs:complexType name="Definitions" mixed="false">
    <xs:annotation>
  <xs:documentation>
  Any top-level, optional element is allowed to appear more
  than once - Any extensibility element is allowed in any place.
  Such extensibility elements must be in the substitution group of
  globalExt or postTypes
  </xs:documentation>

I'm looking at [a], and think we need something like:

<xsd:schema
  targetNamespace="http://registry.example.com/register/schemas"
  xmlns:my="http://registry.example.com/register/schemas"
  xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
  xmlns:wsdl="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/"
  elementFormDefault="qualified">
  
  <xsd:import
  namespace="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/"
  schemaLocation="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/"/>
  
    <xsd:element name="my:Privacy"
      substitutionGroup="wsdl:globalExt">
         <xsd:attribute name="rel"  type="xsd:string" use="required"/>
         <xsd:attribute name="href" type="xsd:anyURI" use="required"/>
    </xsd:element>
</xsd:schema>
