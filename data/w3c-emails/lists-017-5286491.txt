Dear Lorrie,

Thanks a lot for your comments. I will take them and try to decide a more 
practical approach to conduct such a survey.

I will also check the "An Analysis of P3P Deployment on Commercial,
Government, 
and Children's Web Sites as of May 2003" report.

I will definitely ask for your comments/suggestions again.

Cheers,

Patrick.

Patrick,

I'm not sure what you will learn from a survey like this. From my 
experience talking to web services folks in the past, most of them 
don't know much about privacy policies and so their opinions are not 
going to be all that enlightening. If there is a session where they 
would first be informed about these issues and then surveyed, perhaps a 
BOF or something, then a survey like this would be more useful I think.

Lorrie
