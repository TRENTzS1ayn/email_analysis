I've also done some re-org, and make sure that all XML is well-formed, and 
most all of it is valid as well -- just haven't check the SOAP messages.

Not sure, in your message I would read that header as the registrar 
(service) representing the policy associated with data (*transfer* along 
the SOAP exchange) to the registry (recipient service). (There's also a 
question of how the registrar knows the registry's policy which I want to 
explore a little further -- it can be out of band, I just want to document 
the issue)  But in order.xml I included the Privacy element as a child of 
the OrderInfo element, so it's like a "tag" associated with the data (at 
the application layer) for clarity. What does it mean when such a tag is 
provided in a SOAP header versus the actual application data? (We need to 
dig into the semantics of a SOAP envelope.)

From the reorg perhaps you can see that I wasn't planning on introducing 
another party... Granted, the present scenario isn't a proper "SOAP 3-way 
intermediary" because our first leg was mediated by XForms/HTTP, but I 
think that's ok. The important thing for me is to explore the three 
questions:
1. The Scope of the P3P Service Provider and Recipients (given their P3P 1.0 
definitions.
2. The Scope of Layers and Bindings (HTTP and SOAP) -- I'm pretty confident 
we've ruled WSDL and UDDI as orthogonal/optional.
3. This question of should a privacy "taggit" be in the SOAP header, or with 
the application data, or both? (I don't think "taggit" is a word, but a 
while ago I heard that gunpowder has little identifying particles in it 
that can be used with forensics, and I remembered someone proposing that 
the policy should also "follow" the solicited data. I just can't remember 
the name."

How's that sound? And yes, we've made great progress, we're approaching the 
point where it'd be good to explore the scenario with a web service guru 
who could tell us how confused we are. <smile/>
