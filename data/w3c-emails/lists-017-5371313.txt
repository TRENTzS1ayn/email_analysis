16 May 2003 User Agent Task Force Call

Participants
Lorrie Cranor - AT&T Research
Giles Hogben - JRC
Jeremy Epling - Microsoft
Brooks Dobbs - DoubleClick
Ari Schwartz - CDT

We discussed the question of whether to aim for a single translation of 
all P3P vocabulary elements or multiple translations. The consensus of 
the group was that we should aim for a single translation. In the 
process of doing this we may come up with multiple alternatives that we 
want to vet with lawyers and/or test in the usability lab, but at the 
end of the process we hope to have a single translation for each term.

ACTION: Lorrie, Jeremy, and anyone else who wants to, use one of the 
translation documents as a starting point and make revisions based on 
feedback received so far and send to group by 23 May. The group will 
then use these revised documents as a starting point for further 
discussion of each element.

We discussed the question of whether we should have guidelines on 
completeness of translations, including display of human-readable 
fields and specific data elements (as opposed to categories). The 
consensus was that we should not recommend that user agents display all 
possible fields in a P3P policy, but we should have guidelines to 
ensure that critical information gets displayed.

ACTION: All TF members should send to the mailing list by 23 May 
proposed guidelines related to what elements need to be included in a 
translation.

We discussed whether we wanted to make recommendations on issues that 
go beyond displaying policy translations, for example guidelines on 
saving and printing policies, checking the sanity of compact policies, 
etc. The consensus was that we do want to try draft guidelines in this 
area.

ACTION: All TF members should send to the mailing list by 23 May other 
proposed user agent guidelines.

ACTION: Brooks will try to enumerate impossible combinations of tokens 
in compact policies

Our next call will be Tuesday, May 27 at 11am US Eastern.
