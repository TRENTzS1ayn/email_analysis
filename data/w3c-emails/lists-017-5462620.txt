Patrick, I integrated your latest contribs with the doc:
1. I include the my:Privacy element in the application data that is sent 
from registrar2registry.
2. I call at the SOAP envelop issue (and XML encryption) as a special case.
2.1 On the question of do we need to say anything more about forwarding and 
active intermediaries, I would prefer to rely upon the text in the spec now 
unless we are further presssed.
3. I'm going to be on Holiday Thur/Fri, then attending a conference much of 
next week (see .sig). But I hope to address most of the @@to-do's before 
then (feel free to comment on them), then I think the document will be 
semi-coherent for other readers. I plan on trying to get some attention 
from my Web Service colleagues, but I know this week they are at WWW2003 
and many might be travelling catching up next week. But I think we're still 
on schedule for getting/responding to outside feedback in the month of 
June.

-- 
* I will be travelling May 22/23, and attending OSCOM3 May 28-30. 
I will not be as responsive during these periods but will 
respond to any email as soon as possible upon my return.
