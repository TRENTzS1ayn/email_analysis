I think we specified that already by saying in 2.3.2.7 The
COOKIE-INCLUDE and COOKIE-EXCLUDE elements:

A cookie policy MUST cover any data (within the scope of P3P) that is
stored in that cookie or linked via that cookie. It MUST also reference
all purposes associated with data stored in that cookie or enabled by
that cookie. In addition, any data/purpose stored or linked via a cookie
MUST also be put in the cookie policy. In addition, if that linked data
is collected by HTTP, then the policy that covers that GET/POST/whatever
request must cover that data collection.

Best, 

Rigo
