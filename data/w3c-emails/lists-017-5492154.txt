Hi Joseph,

Thanks a lot for your effort.

case.

I don't quite understand here as I can't find anything related to "XML
Encryption"
in the working draft.

I read the working draft again. I think that the "Transfering Data to a
Third
Party" section is strongly related to the "Intermediaries." Thus, I would
recommend to combine these two sections. In particular, those three types of
information flow may be used to determine the role of SOAP intermediaries.
I will spend more thoughts on it next week and discuss with you later.

That's great if your Web service colleagues can also be participayting in 
discussion or giving us some comments/suggestions.

There is a few minor typos, and you can find them by using "find:"

(1) ".."
(2) "a a"
(3) "th"
(4) "business to consumer" should it be "business-to-consumer?"

I will also be on business trip on May 22 & 23. I am planning to do more
studies on those "@ @" points in the working draft. Beside it, I also
consider
whether we should also introduce P3P into UDDI in order to attract UDDI
researchers.
In addition, have you ever thought about XrML for protecting the privacy of
digital content as what Microsoft is doing right now? Should we also mention
that in this working draft.

Have a nice trip and talk to you next week.

Cheers,

Patrick.
