Dear All,
It turns out that due to administrative problems, Diana Alonso-Blas and
members of the Art 29 WG were unable to make it to Ispra for May 23rd.
We therefore have an alternative plan.
Rigo and I will produce a draft plan to resolve the issues (we will meet
tomorrow to discuss this). We will send this round for comments to the P3P
WG and then to the Art 29 group for comments and arrange a telephone
conference and if necessary (we hope not), either I or Rigo can also visit
Brussels in July for a face to face.

Regards

Giles
