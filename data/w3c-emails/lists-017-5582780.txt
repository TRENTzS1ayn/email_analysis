The next User Agent Task Force call will be on Tuesday, May 27 at 11 am 
US Eastern. WE WILL NOT BE USING THE USUAL DIAL-IN NUMBER. Please see 
http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Specification/1.1/meetings.html for the 
number of the MIT bridge that we will be using.

AGENDA

1. Review first draft of UA guidelines
http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/ua-guidelines.html

a. What things do people want to see changed?

b. What is missing?

c. Should we recommend to the WG that something like "P3P user agents 
should not rely on P3P compact policies that do not comply with the P3P 
1.1 specification or are obviously erroneous. Such compact policies 
should be deemed invalid and the corresponding cookies should be 
treated as if they had no compact policies." be made a requirement for 
P3P 1.1"? This is currently not stated explicitly in the spec, although 
it is consistent with the spirit of section 2.4.4.

2. Begin review of translation document
http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-translation.htm
(please flag items in the proposed translation column that you find 
problematic for discussion on the call)

3. Set date for next conference call (June 2 or June 5?)
