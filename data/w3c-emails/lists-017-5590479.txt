AGENDA

1. Task force reports
    [- P3P beyond HTTP - Joseph Reagle]
    - User agent behavior - Lorrie Cranor
    - Compact policies - Brian Zwit
    [- Article 10 vocabulary issues - Giles Hogben]
    - Agent and domain relationships - Jack Humphrey
    - Consent choices - Matthias Schunter
    [- Converting P3P data schema to XML schema - Giles Hogben]

2. Discuss Consent Choices working draft.
http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/05-cc-changes-to-P3P.html

3. Discuss bugzilla 178
    http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=178

Consider including mention of postal code, state, or region
information, etc. in definition of the demographic category in section 
3.4

4. Discuss bugzilla 168
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=168

Consider adding human-readable explanation strings to all elements that 
don't have them
- could be done for a specific set of elements or generically
- it appears that the way the extension mechanism is defined in the P3P 
schema we cannot add such elements in arbitrary places -- for example, 
I think we can add them to high-level elements such as PURPOSE but not 
as sub-elements of individual PURPOSE elements

5. Discuss bugzilla 170
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=170
Consider expanding definition of CONSEQUENCE field to reflect how it is 
actually being used -- in particular to express summary of STATEMENT as 
well as value proposition. Alternatively, consider adding actual 
structure to CONSEQUENCE element to seperate out summary from value 
proposition.

6. Set date for next call (June 4 or June 11?)
