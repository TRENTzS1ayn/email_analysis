Notes from 27 May 2003 UA TF call

Participants
Lorrie Cranor (AT&T Research)
Brooks Dobbs (DoubleClick)
Giles Hogben (JRC)


We reviewed Lorrie's initial UA guidelines draft [1]. Other than some 
typos and minor wording issues, the main substantive issues we 
discussed were:

- need to explain in intro why consistency is a good thing

- need to add guidelines for evaluating policies that parallel the 
sanity checks for CPs

Lorrie will update the UA guidelines draft shortly. At this point we 
are ready to have the entire WG review this draft and provide feedback.

Also, the group felt that adding a requirement to the spec that UAs not 
rely on CPs that don't comply with the spec was a good idea. This will 
be proposed to the full WG and scheduled for discussion at an upcoming 
conference call.


We discussed Lorrie's proposed translations [2]. No other proposals 
have been received, so unless someone else steps forward real soon now, 
we will use Lorrie's proposal only as our working document. Giles had a 
number of minor suggestions which Lorrie will incorporate into the 
document and update on the web site (anyone who wants an Excel version 
should email Lorrie). We are waiting for other TF members to provide 
their comments, and Lorrie is working on engaging some additional legal 
and usability experts.

We will wait to have another conference call until after Lorrie updates 
the drafts and we get more feedback.
