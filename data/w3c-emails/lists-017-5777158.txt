Hi all, 

we are through all the issues in the Draft[1]

the only remaining issue was erasing "beyond the service provider and its
agents" in the <RECIPIENT>-Definition.[2] The new definition reads:
"the legal entity, or domain, where data may be be distributed"

But we already accepted that change at the 6 august 2003 call[3], so I
will now edit a clean version of the User Agent Draft and tell you as
soon as I'm through.
