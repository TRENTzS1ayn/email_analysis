Another point on "agent" terminology: I think agent/processor is well
defined in the NAI Web Beacon Guidelines
<http://www.networkadvertising.org/Statement.pdf> Could we use or refer to
those definitions?

I agree, but if we can find a way to express these relationships
effectively, then I think we should also offer some examples of how UAs
might use the additional information.

Is entity not well enough defined in the 1.0 specification? I agree that
agent is difficult, although the data controller/processor terminology from
the EU Directive seems helpful.

A PRF can only make declarations about the current site. If the current site
is not entirely owned by a single entity, then it shouldn't use the
same-entity declaration mechanism, as that would not make sense. However, if
it is owned entirely by a single entity, which also owns another site, then
it makes sense for those two sites to declare each other same-entity via the
PRF. Perhaps we should introduce the concept of an entity key in the policy
file which would be matched against a key declaration in the PRF, so that
UAs could further validate the same-entity relationship when parsing the
actual policy files.

If we have the HTTP header support for declaring same-entity, we can build
an expiration property into it. There seems to be some debate as to whether
or not we should even provide this mechanism for CPs at all, though. Not
sure where I stand on that yet.

I think these are good arguments for doing away with the HTTP header portion
of the proposal.

Example:
1. UA has been configured to not allow third-party cookies.
2. UA visits a.com. A response from an image request to b.com wishes to set
cookie B1.
3. UA evaluates PRFs and determines that a.com and b.com have a same-entity
relationship. Cookie B1 is accepted.
4. UA visits a.com again. Cookie B1 is sent along on image request to b.com.
5. UA visits x.com, which contains an image reference to b.com.
6. Since B1 is only valid for playback on a.com, UA delays image request to
b.com and fetches x.com's PRF.
7. UA evaluates PRF and determines the x.com and b.com have a same-entity
relationship. 
8. UA sends cookie B1 with image request to b.com.

Notes:
- UA could cache same-entity relationship information along with PRF to
avoid future fetching. 
- Since same-entity is a transitive relationship, the UA could then extend
it to say that x.com and a.com are same-entity for a future transaction.
