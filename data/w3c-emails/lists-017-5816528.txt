We can't help here, as this is Microsoft specific. This is the user
interface issue we want to solve with the user-agent guidelines. But we
can't help with IE specifics and the specification doesn't mandate to
many things in the user interface. (which is good to allow competition)

The issue here is the diversity that is enabled by web services. The
privacy issues simply depend on the current service, the data that it
needs and the way it handles that data. In general, non-technical stuff
is governed by sector-specific industry best practices or laws. But we
should be able to help them express it in P3P and show the power of
transparency here.

IMHO, the creation of preferences is more a process than a static thing.
For the time being, implementers preferred to have static preferences
for the sake of simplicity and ease of implementation. Also, it is not
easy to write things back to an apple file. Giles already had some
remarks on this and suggested to use xpath instead. We haven't even
attacked this issue so far.

Security obligations were always a part of the computer-privacy world.
Personal data is sensitive data and should be secured. JRC and Giles
suggested to have a security-metadata system to be able to express the
security features of a service in order to make privacy decisions. But
there was not much interest in such an ontology.

At the moment, this is stalled. I can't tell you more for the
moment.
