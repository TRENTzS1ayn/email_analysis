The next P3P specification group conference call will be on
Wednesday, December 3, 2003, 11 am - 12 pm US Eastern. Dial-in
information is available at
http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Specification/1.1/meetings.html


1/ Report and discussion on Art. 10 issues 

2/ Continued discussion of agent-relationsships

3/ discuss the link-texts from Giles and Jeff
+are they ready
+Where should they go,

4/ decision on consent-choices
Should we go for the proposal as is? Which deadline for comments
do we give?

5/ Suggested wording for <money />
On 5 November, we decided to change the text of money. See
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=386

We suggested to add some wording to the spec. I suggest to add 
the following wording:

Money stands for compensation for alleged infringements of the
stated privacy practices. In order to have those errors also 
corrected, <money /> and <correct /> must <em>both</em> be
present in the policy.

We should also change the user-string connected to.
Actual wording:
We will pay individuals if we violate our privacy policy

Suggested wording:
We will compensate violations of our privacy policy

6/ some precision for <law />

<law /> can take an attribute URI that points to the law in
question. So human description was wrong. I erased it from the
definition.

Please feel also free to discuss the points on the mailing-list
