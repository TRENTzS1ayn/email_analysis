Sorry I haven't offered the "court" definition I promised, and I failed to
coordinate the fact that today I'm at a conference and won't be on the call.


Frankly, I'm still struggling with what could be conveyed that would be
meaningful for what sounds like the few who might now use it.  But it might
be more important in the future.

If LAW allows a site to recite the various laws that might govern the
business (e.g., for a bank in the California, GLB, Cal. Financial Privacy
Law, California Notice of Security Breach, among others)...

COURT might not be meaningful if it had the meaning of "Authority," as in
"government agency that has jurisdiction over the privacy rules & affairs of
this business."  For a bank (Bill?) maybe that would be the OCC.  For a
state bank, it might be the AG.  Other agencies might still have some
jurisdiction, but perhaps there is one authority more important than others.

In Canada, AUTHORITY might be the Canadian equivalent of a national bank
overseer, plus the Privacy Commissioner for the nation or the province.

It's a bit like I'm trying to find a job for COURT to do.

At the bottom line, it the spec were to stay as it is and is optional, then
a given site could take it or leave it if the site is concerned about
unintended implications of using it.
