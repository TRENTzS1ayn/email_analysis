1/ Task Force reports:

A/ P3P beyond HTTP
Patrick reported from his trip on Web Services. In conclusion he
mentioned three important points: 

(1) Start to interact and communicate with W3C SOAP and WSDL working groups.
I need help from Rigo and Hugo.
(2) Draw and describe a diagram to demonstrate the importance of privacy
technologies in a big picture. This is what I am now thinking...
(3) Find more participants. In fact, I did try to invite some researchers
involving into this task force. 

I did invite some researchers from Hitachi (Japan) and
Virginia Tech (USA) to join us.

Dicussion about further steps. Rigo reported from talk with Hugo
Haas and Rigo will contact Philippe Le Hegaret.
Action Rigo: Talk to HH and PLH and report back


B/ Article 10
Meeting on 11 Sep was cancelled as Art. 29 WP wasn't ready yet.
Giles sent a new document in. Diana will circulate this document
at Art. 29 WP. 

C/ Converting data schemas
Giles sent document to Rigo. Will be ready for review by the end
of the week With new announcement. Rigo is actually doing edits and
formatting of the document. Announcement will be sent to the list when
the document is online. 

2/ Discussion on elements postponed
Continue discussion on the mailing-list. In absence of Dave Stampley, we
postponed the discussion on
http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-translation.htm


3/ We discussed Rigo's primary purpose
Rigo reported about his exchanges with IBM and that it still needs
further discussion. They don't have a list of such primary purposes. 
Missing primary purposes was one of the disadvantages compared to short
notices. Rigo asked Jeff to think about a list of some primary purposes 
in the financial industry, but not issuing it as an action item.

Action item Rigo pending:
Talk to IBM on primary purpose

4/ Giles: cookie is like a database identifier
   Jeff: whether use is intended or not, one has to declare.
 GH: doesn't have to be unique ID. It has the purpose to select
 a bunch of records in a database.
   Jeff: cases are sites with single sign-on etc and scope is not
 always clear. Has to be clarified what happens with the
 information, e.g. purpose. 
 Jeff: also when converting to compact policy, it looses
 semantics and sounds more that the actual collection is. 
 
Action: Giles: Write some paragraphs about linked data and
cookies.  

Action: Jeff: Write some paragraphs describing the issue.

Talking about APPEL, there was no result from the P3P Event in Sydney.
We might consider doing another meeting with JRC in Ispra/Italy

5/ Next call will be on 15 October 11am-12pm EDT
