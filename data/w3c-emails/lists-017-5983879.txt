One more thought.

Should it be possible to apply different sets of statements on the data.
Imagine
<information>
  <name>Philippe</name>
 <email>plh@w3.org</email>
</information>


and
<operation name='send'>
 <input element='information'/>
</operation>

Should you be allowed to express a privacy for the name and a different
one for email? If yes, then the policy will need to be referenced from
the schema definition itself.
<patrick>Yes, it should be allowed. I would like to ask for your opinions.
In addition, would you please explain it more? Many thanks!</patrick>

Philippe
