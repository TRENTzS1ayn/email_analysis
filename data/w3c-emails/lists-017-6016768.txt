How about sending a note inviting them to provide feedback and even
participate if they wish? I would certainly be happy to help the P3P WG.

Rigo: Do you have any idea which mailing list should I send?

Actually, I realized that section 4.3 explicitly mentions that a WSDL
description directly references a policy, not a policy reference.
Therefore, since the policy doesn't contain any reference,  it does
exclude the case I was trying to address.

please, make sure this item is not dropped when defining the
requirements for the next version. In any case, the current version
should indicate that the statements are only applicable to the
information received by the service, and not the client interacting with
the service. What is the schedule regarding the first version of the
document btw?

<patrick2>
Hope to get more comments/suggestions by the end of Oct. And then, I would
generate another version by the end of Nov. Thanks a lot for your
contributions.
