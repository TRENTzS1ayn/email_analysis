============================================================

2004 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2004)
Theme: Convergence of Web Services, Grid Computing, e-Business and Autonomic
Computing
July 6-9, 2004, San Diego, California, USA
http://conferences.computer.org/icws/2004/
Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society

Call for Papers


ICWS is a forum for researchers and industry practitioner to exchange
information regarding advancements in the state of art research and practice
of Web Services, to identify emerging research topics, and to define the
future directions of Web Services computing. ICWS 2004 has special interest
in papers that contribute to the convergence of Web Services, Grid
Computing, e-Business and Autonomic Computing, or those that apply
techniques from one area to another. 

Web services are network-based application components with services-oriented
architecture using standard interface description languages and uniform
communication protocols. Typical industry solution areas of Web services are
business-to-business integration, business process integration and
management, content management, e-sourcing, composite Web services creation,
design collaboration for computer engineering, multimedia communication,
digital TV, and interactive Web solutions. Currently, Grid computing has
also started to leverage Web services to define standard interfaces for
Business Grid services and generic reusable Grid resources.

As the first academic conference in the field of Web services, the 2003
First International Conference on Web Services (ICWS'03) was held at the
Monte Carlo Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada, June 23 - 26, 2003, attracting
hundreds of participants from 25 countries (USA, India, France, China, Hong
Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, Canada, UK, Sweden, Switzerland, The
Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Italy, Korea, Thailand, Finland, Austria, New
Zealand, Poland, and Turkey). The second one is the 2003 International
Conference on Web Services - Europe (ICWS-Europe'03), held in Erfurt,
Germany, September 23 - 24, 2003. ICWS'03 and ICWS-Europe'03 have proven to
be an excellent catalyst for research and collaboration. With the growing
interests of Web Services in both business and scientific information
management practice, we fully expect that ICWS 2004 will continue this
success.

The program of ICWS'04 will feature a variety of papers on fundamentals,
infrastructure, technology support, and business management for Web
Services. 

SCOPE: Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Mathematical Foundations of Web Services
- Data Management Issues in Web Services

SUBMISSION OF PAPERS:

Prospective authors are invited to submit a draft paper of about 8-10 pages
in IEEE Proceeding style (single space, two columns, font size of 10 to 12)
in PDF or Word format via the Microsoft's CMT system for on-line submission
(to be announced in ICWS 2004 website). The length of the Camera-Ready
papers (if accepted) will be limited to 8 (IEEE style) pages. Papers must
not have been previously published or currently submitted for publication
elsewhere. Each submission should add an additional cover page including:
title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal address, E-mail address,
telephone number, and Fax number for each author. The cover page should also
include the name of the author who will be presenting the paper (if
accepted) and a maximum of 5 keywords, and whether the paper is submitted as
a student paper. 
All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings in
hardcopy and on-line version by IEEE Computer Society. The best papers
presented at ICWS'2004 will be invited to submit to the International
Journal of Web Services Research (JWSR), International Journal of Grid and
Utility Computing, International Journal of Business Process Integration and
Management, and International Journal of Autonomic Computing. 
EVALUATION PROCESS:

All submissions will be evaluated for originality, significance, clarity,
and soundness. Each paper will be refereed by at least three PC members in
the topical area. 
BEST STUDENT PAPER AWARDS:

One Best Paper award and 1-3 Best Student Paper Awards will be presented by
ICWS'2004. The first author of the best student papers should be full-time
students.
