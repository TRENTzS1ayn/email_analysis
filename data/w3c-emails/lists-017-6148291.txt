Attached are two proposals concerning domain relationships. 

The first proposal, which covers "same entity" domain relationships, is a
revision of the proposal I sent out previously. If you are familiar with the
previous version, the only difference is the removal the ability to
reference full URIs in the POLICY-REF INCLUDE. This part of the proposal was
really only an optimization, and apparently the there was a long discussion
concerning full URIs in policy reference files for the 1.0 spec, which we
don't need to rehash.

The second proposal, which covers "agent of" domain relationships, is new,
but builds on the mechanisms described in the first proposal.

Please review both proposals at your earliest opportunity and discuss your
questions/concerns on the mailing list. I may organize a task force
conference call to discuss them in greater detail, so please let me know via
direct email if you'd like to be part of that discussion.

I apologize for the delay in getting these proposals out to the group.
