P3P beyond HTTP:
Patrick reported from the new dynamics developing around the cooperation
with WSDL and SOAP-Groups.  Much feedback from WSDL Group. Hope to
attract more people from the Soap group. Hope to have the new version
out soon. Should it bit a stand-alone document?

Action Rigo: Provide feedback on the Draft request for comment to
WSDL and SOAP

2/ Compact policies
Much of the stuff dependend on Jeremy Epling and Brian Zwit.
There was not much correspondence so the TF is stalled. We discussed
further steps and the actual roadblocks. The performance testing is
still outstanding. With policy prefetched and acceptable performance, we
might get rid of the compact format and the question about accuracy of
the compact format would disappear. But if performance reports are bad,
we have to think about the grouping mechanism and the resulting
semantics. Brooks and Giles added, that even a grouping mechanism can
have some performance impact and that this should be also measured
against the full policy approach.

We agreed to defer the decision whether we go on with grouping
without waiting for performance report by 3-4 weeks

Action: Rigo: Try to contact Jeremy
