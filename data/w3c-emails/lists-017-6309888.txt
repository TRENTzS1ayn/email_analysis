Ari confirmed the date of his latest draft (Aug. 18).  Ari checked Canada's
PIPEDA and confirmed the law did not define "identifiable". Lorrie proposed
and Ari agreed to make final changes (including Rigo's previous comments)
and submit the draft for final review, allowing 2 weeks from submission for
comments.  If no objections are raised this document will be included in the
1.1 Specification, as part of the Terminology section (1.3).


3. Discuss revised consent/grouping proposal
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-p3p-spec/2003Aug/0039.html
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-p3p-spec/2003Aug/0039.html> )
Lorrie offered a few comments on Matthias' latest e-mails.  First, Lorrie
recommended a clean-up of the language in the proposal.  Second, she
recommended specifying a maximum number of characters for the short
description.  Third, a more significant issue, Lorrie made a case for a
'mixed' consent option.  Rigo raised concerns with "mixed" statements, and
discussion on handling mismatches ensued.  Lorrie proposed that the 1.1
specification should require the 1.1 user agent to perform a consistency
check with the Web site; if an inconsistency is found it would be treated as
a mixed interpretation by the user agent.

Lorrie will re-write Matthias' draft and review with Matthias and Jeremy.


4. Discussion of disputes definition issues -- see comments in green at
http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-translation.htm
<http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-translation.htm> 
David Stampley provided background information on the work on Disputes.  The
proposed change to the Disputes definitions are intended to explain to
consumers the laws that would apply to their activities on a Web site
instead of dictating rights to consumers.  Rigo expressed concerns in light
of the EU directive. Giles will raise the proposed Disputes definitions in
his meeting with EU members on September 11.

Action: All should read David's comments (in green) and send feedback to the
e-mail list.

6. Next call (September 17)
