Hi Lorrie,

thanks for your work! I've read through it and have only minor changes:
- Typo in Heading 3.7.2 "STATMENT-GROUP"
- Thanks for renaming 'required' to 'always'. This is more intuitive.
- By defining that for required="always", all inside statements must not 
have a required attribute, one can allow 'ours' and 'current' in 'mixed' as 
well as 'always' groups. I changed the spec accordingly.
- I agree that it may be easier to understand if statement-group-def and 
statement-group are explained together. In this case, the STATEMENT section 
in the consolidated spec should contain a reference/pointer to the 
STATEMENT-GROUP extension.

Enclosed is an update an a HTML-diff (note that this is experimental; just 
look at the differences in the text; it garbles the BNF).

Regards,
  matthias
