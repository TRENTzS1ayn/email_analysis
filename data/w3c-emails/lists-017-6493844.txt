Two points:
1. For finishing the XML schema stuff for the working draft. My colleague
who has been working on finalizing the schema stuff is away till the 19th
April so I would prefer to be able to deliver this at the end of that week
(the 23rd April). If it is really urgent and it will not get in otherwise,
IO could conceiveably delve into it myself and have something by the 16th.

2. I just discovered an error in the existing spec regarding custom data
schemas:
The guidelines for categories say:
<DATA-STRUCT> elements MAY include category definitions. If a structure
definition includes categories, then all uses of those structures in data
definitions and data structures pick up those categories. If a structure
contains no categories, then the categories for that structure MAY be
defined when it is used in another structure or data element. Otherwise, a
data element using this structure is a variable-category element. Any uses
of a variable-category data element in a policy require that its categories
be listed in the policy.

But the example custom schema does not follow this rule because it uses the
vehicle data structures without inheriting their categories. This was
causing an error in our validator for the inline schema test case.
