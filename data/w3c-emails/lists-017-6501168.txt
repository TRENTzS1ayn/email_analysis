Dear all, 

I took an action item last week[1] to explain further about the 
W3C Team Note around privacy in Web services[2].

In the ongoing discussion about Web Services and Privacy in
special and policy in more general terms,  the Web Services 
Activity needed something more concrete. I pointed Hugo Haas, 
Web Services Activity Lead to our early notes[3]. I explained 
the concept of the generic p3p attribute as initially suggested by 
Steven Pemberton to Hugo Haas and Phillippe Le H?garet (Architecture
Domain Lead) We had intense internal discussions with Massimo 
about the meaning of the attribute. The discussions were extended 
to Lorrie and the P3P Group. I came to the conclusion that the 
generic p3p attribute as it stands today is more a suggestion to 
XML Schema makers on how to use P3P in their context and allow 
them (even expect them) to further constrain the attribute in the context 
of their application/interface description.

The team-note in [2] does exactly that. It uses the p3p generic attribute
to link policies! (not PRF) to Web Services interfaces allowing and 
constraining the use of the P3P attribute in WSDL. This can be taken 
up by a WG and be transformed into some Rec-Track or WG Note to 
give it even more authority.

Best, 

Rigo
