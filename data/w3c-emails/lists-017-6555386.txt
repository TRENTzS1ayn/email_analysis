Minutes 14th April

Attending:

Giles
Rigo
Lorrie

Generic attribute:
What would the XML binding mean in terms of RDF. In RDF you don't have a
tree structure so what does the application of a P3P binding to child nodes
mean?
Maybe RDF can already cope with this by using reification (statements about
statements or groups of statements). We would like to get an opinion from
the WG. Even if we decide that RDF can cope without a special attribute, we
should at the very least give some examples to show how it can actually be
implemented. Lorrie has emailed some RDF people to see if we can get some
guidance.

We discussed the paragraph of the draft on the allowed uses of P3P - Giles
said that it should be emphasised a little more if we want people to take
notice of it and not use P3P for describing desired data practices. People
are encouraged to send their comments.

Primary purposes. When we put out a last call, Lorrie should make an
executive summary for the less technical interested parties. So let's just
try to put out a reasonable first attempt. The latest draft is in the
mailing list - also in the agenda.
Suggest removing actions because this information (e.g. acquire PII) is
contained elsewhere in the policy. Suggest merging content and result
because the division is not relevant.

Next draft - Rigo is very busy so - definite maybe :) for next week.

Next call - Monday 26th 11am EST.
