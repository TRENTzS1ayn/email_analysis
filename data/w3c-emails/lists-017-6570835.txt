Hi Lorrie,

To clarify my thoughts a bit, I think there are two interesting things 
to specify;
   1) who will conform to the policy
   2) what data the policy applies to

In P3P 1.0, #1 was always the Web site, and #2 was data submitted to 
the Web site, as laid out by the various policy reference mechanisms, 
etc.

When I made the distinction between interfaces and data, I think that 
what I was trying to say (and hadn't fully thought through) was that in 
P3P 1.0, #2 is always in relation to an interface, as identified by a 
URI; ultimately, the policy still applies to data. This effort, as I 
see it, is to allow greater flexibility in specifying #2, because of 
that.

So,

I think this would be better stated as:

> data submitted to Web resources, which are identified by URIs or bound

I.e., P3P tells you how a site will handle the data (e.g., form fields, 
HTTP headers, TCP/IP connection information) sent to a particular 
interface, which is identified by a URI. The data itself is NOT 
identified by this URI; there's been talk at the TAG about how you 
identify the data in a POST, for example; it's clearly separate from 
the resource identifier.

P3P 1.0 also allows you to refine by method, etc., which I think 
supports this view.

If that's the case, this:

should be something like:

and so forth.

I think you also need to require people who use this attribute in their 
formats to explicitly identify who is required to conform to the policy 
(#1).

Does this make sense? I've been away from P3P for a while, so I could 
be off-track.

Cheers,
