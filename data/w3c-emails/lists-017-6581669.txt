Present: 

Lorrie Cranor

1. P3P Generic attribute for XML applications - discuss draft and what 
to do about RDF binding.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-p3p-spec/2004Apr/0012.html

Rigo reported from Exchanges with Fabien Gandon and that we might 
want to renew the P3P Note. In fact, Fabien suggests that
application outside of P3P might want to use the P3P classes.
Those classes would have to be defined using RDFS to define P3P.
