4. Schedule next call (May 12?)

Items 1-3 are all that's left on our todo list before going to last 
call. If nobody has anything new to report on these items it will be a 
very short call.  Everyone should also review the latest working draft 
at http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-P3P11-20040427/ to see if there's 
anything else we need to change before going to last call. Hopefully we 
will be ready for last call by the end of May.
