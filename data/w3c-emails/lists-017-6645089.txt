Apart from the issue on primary purpose, the following is the latest
suggested text for the UA Guidelines

Some jurisdictions (E.g. the European Union) require human readable
information on purpose of collection to be presented to the user before any
information is captured. One way to comply with this is to present human
readable translations of policies for action uri's of forms simultaneously
with the forms. As a best practice, information on purposes should be made
available before any personal information is transmitted. This might be
achieved be achieved for example by a privacy tab which is synchronised to
display information before pages load, or by including information which is
displayed on clicking a link.
