Here is the latest suggested text and Jurisdiction Extension spec: please
review the text as I don't think we discussed it in the call.

Jurisdiction Disclosure:

We suggest that an Jurisdiction extension be added to the recipient element:

[??] Extension
 =
 Jurisdiction
`</Extension>
 
Jurisdiction
 =
 `<JURISDICTION 
 " service=" quoted-URI
 [" short-description=" quotedstring]
[" long-description=" quotedstring]
">"

"</JURISDICTION>"

Example:

<RECIPIENT>
<EXTENSION><JURISDICTION
service="http://europa.eu.int/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CE
LEXnumdoc&lg=EN&numdoc=31995L0046&model=guichett" short-description="EU law"
long-description="This service operates within the EU"></JURISDICTION>
</EXTENSION>
</RECIPIENT>

Text for specification:


The jurisdiction extension element allows user agents to make judgements
about the trustworthiness of a data recipient based on the regulatory
environment they are placed in. For example organizations within the
European Union can be assumed to comply to European data protection law.
Some jurisdictions prohibit transfer of data to certain other jurisdictions
without the explicit consent of the data subject. Therefore declaring a data
transfer activity using the P3P jurisdiction extension is not sufficient to
guarantee its legality.
