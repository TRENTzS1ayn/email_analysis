Here are the latest suggested changes (the guidelines text has changed quite
a lot so please check):

Text for 2.3.2.7.
-----------------
Add:
User agents evaluating cookies SHOULD apply the results of a preference
match on the cookie's policy before setting the cookie.

Text for guidelines
-------------------
Certain jurisdictions view the storage of cookies on a user's hard drive as
an act of data processing. In such jurisdictions (e.g. the EU), policies
should always be evaluated before a cookie is set and cookies should not be
stored unless the cookie's policy is found to comply with the user's
preferences.
