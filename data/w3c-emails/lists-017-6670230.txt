Here is the latest suggested modification and text for the Spec:

Security issues:
We suggest using the existing disputes attribute which is a placeholder for
seals of any type (which can then be included in the browser's list of
approved seals, along with a type attribute). 

Accompanying text for spec (Section 3.2.6, after independent
organization...):

Policy writers may also use this attribute to specify and seals related to
the entity's information practices (including privacy and security seals).
