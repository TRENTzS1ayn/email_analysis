Dear Colleague,
 
Among the technologies that are impacting and guiding the evolution of the
World Wide Web are Web Services and the Semantic Web.  These technologies
will support the creation of complex, adaptive systems organized around the
information that they manage and exchange and the orchestration of the
services they provide. 
 
We are trying to organize a Web Services and Semantic Web special session at
the upcoming SCI 2004 Conference.  This conference will be held July 18 - 21
in Orlando, Florida.  Specific details on the conference may be found at the
conference web site, provided below.  
 
We are inviting you to summit a paper to us on this topic - Web Services and
the Semantic Web.  While you could propose a paper on either technology, of
particular interest would be papers that bridge or show convergence between
these two areas.  We must have your submission by February 12th, 2004 for
consideration.
 
The conference organizers require that we, as proposed session chairs,
obtain a minimum of 5 papers to hold this proposed session.  If we can
obtain the required number of submissions, this special session will be
established as part of the SCI 2004 conference agenda.  Submission
information follows.
 
Please forward this information to people that you think may be interested
so that it gets the widest possible distribution.
 
Regards,
Bob Cherinka and Bob Miller
(Our apologies for duplicate email)
