I'm not sure we want to say that. A user might specify, for example, 
that cookies that don't match their preferences should be converted to 
session cookies rather than deleted altogether. Also, I could imagine a 
user agent that gives users the option of storing rejected cookies in a 
separate place for later analysis or inspection. So I think we should 
make the point that cookies should be evaluated before set time. But 
I'm not sure we want to specify what should happen as a result of that 
evaluation. We could say:

User agents that evaluate cookie policies SHOULD perform this 
evaluation before setting a cookie so that the cookie can be discarded 
without being set if that is what is dictated by the user's 
preferences.
