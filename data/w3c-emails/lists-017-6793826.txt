The next P3P specification group conference call will be on

information is available at
http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Specification/1.1/meetings.html

NOTE: THIS CALL IS STARTING AT 10 AM!

AGENDA

1. Agent and domain relationships
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-p3p-spec/2004Feb/0012.html

2. Primary purpose specification

3. Clarify what we mean by data linked to a cookie
http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=172

We discussed this on the call last week but did not have time to finish 
it. Consensus that we need better text to describe direct linking. 
Question remains about what we should say about indirect linking.

4. How to proceed on compact policies?

5. Set time/date of next call (Lorrie not available Feb 18 or Feb 25)
