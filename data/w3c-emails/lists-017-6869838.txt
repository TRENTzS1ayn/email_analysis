I would say no, a user agent should not make that inference. I can add a
statement to the spec stating that the user agent can only apply the "ours"
relationship to the two hosts involved -- that the relationship is not
transitive due to the possibility of B being an agent for both A and C,
which are completely separate entities.

Question:

Does this address A=B, B=C but A<>C?  So imagine the case where hosts on
different domains www.a.com and www.b.com list each other as reciprocal
known hosts.  Also imagine www.b.com and www.c.com describe the same
relationship, should a user agent be able to make inferences about the
relationship between www.a.com and www.c.com?

A few concerns:

- When the HTTP header method is used to refer to a PRF on another 
host, it only makes sense if the other host has the same file structure 
or if the policy applies to * and/or to all cookies. Otherwise you 
could end up with conflicts. Perhaps this should be pointed out.

- "Any number of KNOWN-HOST elements can be declared inside a 
POLICY-REF  element or inside the POLICY-REFERENCES element. Known host 
declarations at the POLICY-REFERENCES level are considered to apply to 
all policies in the file, excluding those that have specific 
declarations at the POLICY-REF  level." Is this really necessary? For 
simplicity I think it would be better to put KNOWN-HOST elements only 
inside a POLICY-REF element.

- We should make clear that there is nothing wrong with sites 
continuing to refer to PRFs on other hosts without using the KNOWN-HOST 
extension. The extension just buys you extra information about the 
relationship.

that makes sense

The only conflict I see is with "Such verification implies re-fetching 
the policy reference file and evaluating its known host declarations 
only if the policy reference file has expired." which suggests that the 
re-verification should not be done if the PRF has not expired. While 
there is no reason to do it if the PRF has not expired, I don't think 
we need to say it shouldn't be done. What if we said instead "Such 
verification implies re-fetching an expired policy reference file and 
evaluating its known host declarations."

Hmm... this is not ideal, but I think it is the best solution. If we 
were to add another extension than a user agent that was not aware of 
the extension would not be able to apply the policy at all. As it is 
written now, user agents can still figure out what policy applies even 
if they don't know the extension, they just won't know about the ours 
relationship.
