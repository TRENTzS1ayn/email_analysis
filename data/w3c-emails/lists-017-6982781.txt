This actually goes to the heart I what I was trying to do... I wanted 
to define "linkable" independently of technical architecture but define 
"linked" more narrowly. So far I haven't come up with an example of an 
architecture in which we would want to say that data is linked and does 
not involve either triggering a database retrieval or storage. Perhaps 
you have an example?

Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
