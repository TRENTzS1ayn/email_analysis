What if I reformulated the second bullet of the linked definition as 
follows... note that
I used the term "identifiable" here rather than "identified"... I
think that best reflects what we mean in this case.

<p>A piece of data X is said to be <i>linked</i> to a cookie Y if at
least one of the following activities may take place as a result of
cookie Y being replayed:</p>

<ul>

<li>X is retrieved from a database.</li>

<li>Information identifiable with the user -- including but not
limited to data entered into forms, IP address, clickstream data, and
client events -- is added to a record in which X is stored.</li>

</ul>

<p>
If either of these activities happen immediately upon cookie replay or
at some future time (perhaps as a result of retrospective analysis of
server logs), then the piece of data X is considered linked to cookie Y.
</p>
