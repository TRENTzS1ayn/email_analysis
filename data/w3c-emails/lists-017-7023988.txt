Okay phrased badly on my part.  I guess my point is simply that if A and C
both point to the exact same policy (on B and shared by B) using "same
entity", it seems logical to me to infer that A and C are themselves the
same entity?  No?

-B

My understanding is that KNOWN-HOST lets host A point to a PRF and 
policy on host B instead of declaring their own policy.  So there is no 
other policy to be the same with.
