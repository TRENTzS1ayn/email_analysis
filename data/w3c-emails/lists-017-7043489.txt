Hmm.... without KNOWN-HOSTS A can use the HTTP header method to 
reference a PRF on B, which is about a policy on B. That policy may or 
may not actually apply to any URIs on B. With KNOWN-HOSTS, B can 
declare that the policy A is referencing is a policy that has been 
established as part of an "ours" relationship. Before we can answer any 
questions about transitivity and what not, perhaps we need to actually 
spell out what an ours relationship is. Probably something like:

- A single entity operates host A and host B, but might possibly have 
different policies for host A and host B
- Host A acts as an agent of host B and all data collection and uses 
are in accordance with host B's policy (or one of host B's policies) 
and are done on behalf of host B - either A or B might be declared as 
the entity in the policy
- Host B acts and an agent of host A and all data collection and uses 
are in accordance with host A's policy (or one of host A's policies) 
and are done on behalf of host A - either A or B might be declared as 
the entity in the policy
