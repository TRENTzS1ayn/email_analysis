I think that the crucial point is that whatever behavior is dictated by the
evaluation should be carried out setting the cookie.
So how about:

User agents that evaluate cookie policies SHOULD perform this evaluation
*and its resultant behavior* before setting a cookie so that the cookie can
be discarded without being set if that is what is dictated by the user's
preferences.
