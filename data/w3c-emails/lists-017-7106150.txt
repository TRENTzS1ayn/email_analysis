OK agreed - How about this then:
Jurisdiction Disclosure:

 We suggest that an Jurisdiction extension be added to the recipient
 element:


 jurisdiction= "<JURISDICTION"
  " service=" quoted-URI
  [" short-description=" quotedstring]
 ">"
[longdescription]
 "</JURISDICTION>"



longdescription=<LONG-DESCRIPTION>PCDATA</LONG-DESCRIPTION>




 Example:

 <RECIPIENT>
 <EXTENSION><JURISDICTION 
 service="http://europa.eu.int/smartapi/cgi/
 sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CE 
 LEXnumdoc&lg=EN&numdoc=31995L0046&model=guichett"
 short-description="EU law"
>**EU"></JURISDICTION>
 </EXTENSION>
 </RECIPIENT>
 
 Text for specification:
The jurisdiction extension element allows user agents to make judgements
about the trustworthiness of a data recipient based on the regulatory
environment they are placed in. Jurisdictions of recipients can be rendered
machine readable by inserting a known URI into the service field (e.g. the
URI of a body of legislation which applies). For example organizations
within the European Union can be assumed to comply to European data
protection law and could therefore insert the URI of the 95/46 directive as
in the example above. Some jurisdictions prohibit transfer of data to
certain other jurisdictions without the explicit consent of the data
subject. It should be noted therefore declaring the data transfer activity
of a recipient using the P3P jurisdiction extension is not sufficient to
guarantee its legality.
