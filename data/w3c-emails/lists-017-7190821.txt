I hope you are able to discuss this at the technical plenary and then 
fill the rest of us in on what conclusions you come to, if any.

I understand Rigo's perspective that the XML writer that uses the P3P 
tag should understand all possible ways this chunk of XML will be 
processed and make sure the P3P policy applies to all of them. But, if 
I were a lawyer (and I'm not, but Rigo is, so he can comment as to how 
good a lawyer I would be), I might advise my clients not to use this 
generic P3P XML tag, because in reality I cannot anticipate how this 
chunk of XML might be processed (see my example in 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-p3p-spec/2004Feb/0019.html). 
I would like to have some way of saying "P3P policy X applies to chunk 
of XML Y only when Y is processed under condition Z."  I think this is 
feasible if we include an attribute that is a URI that can be used to 
specify condition Z. Then each XML application that wants to use P3P 
could establish their own URI that explains the assumptions that are 
made about what it means to process XML in that context (and presumably 
similar applications might find they could use the same assumptions).
