I think that this new draft is very good because it gives a practical 
and reasonably comprehensive idea of the meaning of linked to the 
implementer, without being too prescriptive. Only one thing I don't 
quite agree with:

"is added to a record, data structure, or file (other
 than a log file) in which X is stored."

Shouldn't this really be 

"is retrieved from a record, data structure, or file (other
 than a log file) in which X is stored."

because we don't really care if it's added as long as no-one ever sees 
it.
