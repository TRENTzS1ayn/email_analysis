Happy New Year of 2004!

FYI. Rigo Wenning, Hugo Haas, David Booth, Philippe Le Hegaret, Michael
Sperberg-McQueen and Patrick Hung have been discussing
about P3P and Web services in the past few weeks. We held two conference
calls in Dec 03:

P3P / WS call 5 Dec 2003
http://www.w3.org/2003/12/05-p3p-ws.html

P3P / WS call 16 Dec 2003
http://www.w3.org/2003/12/16-p3pws.html

These two conference calls came up in the context of discussing how to
attach P3P info to a Web service message schema 
or WSDL document. During the calls, it was decided that gonig with the
generic P3P attribute was the way forward. In particular, 
Rigo has already got the schema for the p3p-attribute from Michael
Sperberg-McQueen, our Schema-Chair, as follows:

<xsd:schema
 xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
 targetNamespace="http://www.w3.org/2004/01/p3p-gen" >
 <xsd:annotation>
  <xsd:documentation>
   <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    <p>Sample schema document for Rigo Wenning, to demonstrate
     how to declare a global attribute.</p>
    <p>Here, we let the attribute be called 'P3P-generic'.</p>
   </div>
  </xsd:documentation>
 </xsd:annotation>

 <xsd:attribute name="p3p-gen" type="xsd:anyURI">
  <xsd:annotation>
   <xsd:documentation>
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
     <p>The P3P-generic attribute takes a URI as its value.</p>
     <p>The meaning is that a P3P document describing the privacy
      policy relevant to this element may be found at the URI
      given.</p>
     <p>Examples: ...</p>
     <p>Other notes: ...</p>
    </div>
   </xsd:documentation>
  </xsd:annotation>
 </xsd:attribute>
</xsd:schema>

And also Hugo has already started a new document "Use of the P3P generic
attribute in WSDL 2.0:"
http://www.w3.org/2003/12/p3p-wsdl

Any comment or suggestion are welcome.
