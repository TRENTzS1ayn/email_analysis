http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=334

says there is erratum. I changed the text to 

The POLICY element contains a complete P3P policy. Each P3P policy MUST
contain exactly one POLICY element. The policy element MUST contain an
ENTITY element that identifies the legal entity making the
representation of the privacy practices contained in the policy. In
addition, the policy element MUST contain an ACCESS element andone or
more STATEMENT elements.It SHOULD contain a DISPUTES-GROUP element. It
may contain a P3P data schema and one or more extensions.

If you have an issue with this, notify me by monday 26 Jan

Best,
