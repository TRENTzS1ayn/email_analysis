International Journal of Business Process Integration and Management

Business processes have played an important role in enabling business
application integration and collaboration across multiple organisations. The
integration can be categorised into two types: internal integration and
external integration. Internal integration includes all the integration
aspects within one enterprise. Enterprise application integration (EAI) is a
typical example of internal integration. External integration covers all the
possible integration patterns across multiple enterprises. The typical
business process based external application integration includes business
process to application integration (BP2Ai) and business process to business
process integration (BP2BPi).

To stay competitive, companies must be agile in adapting their business
processes to the ever-changing market dynamics. The adaptive business
process based enterprises should look beyond the traditional enterprises and
marketplaces through collaborative interactions and dynamic e-business
solution bindings. The enterprise infrastructure has to provide the
capability for dynamic discovery of trading partners and service providers
as well as enabling federated security mechanisms, solution monitoring and
management.

The International Journal of Business Process Integration and Management
will focus on the emerging business process modelling, simulation,
integration and management using emerging technologies. IJBPIM is the first
academic journal that concentrates on the information technology (IT) level
as well as the relationship between the business level and IT implementation
level.
