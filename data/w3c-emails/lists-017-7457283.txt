The International Journal of Web Services Research (JWSR) is a high-quality
refereed journal on Web services research and engineering that serves as an
outlet for individuals in the field to publish their research as well as
interested readers. As a research and engineering journal, the International
Journal of Web Services Research, will facilitate communication and
networking among Web services/e-Business researchers and engineers in a
period where considerable changes are taking place in Web services
technologies innovation, and stimulate production of high-quality Web
services solutions and architectures.

Web services are network-based application components with services-oriented
architecture using standard interface description languages and uniform
communication protocols. Due to the importance of the field, standardization
organizations such as WS-I, W3C, OASIS and Liberty Alliance are actively
developing standards for Web services. The International Journal of Web
Services Research (JWSR) is the first refereed, international publication
featuring only the latest research findings and industry solutions dealing
with all aspects of Web services technology. The overall scope of this
journal will cover the advancements in the state of the art, standards, and
practice of Web services, as well as to identify the emerging research
topics and define the future of Services computing, including Web services
on Grid computing, Web services on multimedia, Web services on
communication, Web services on e-Business, etc. In conclusions, the JWSR
provides an open, formal publication for high quality articles developed by
theoreticians, educators, developers, researchers and practitioners for
professionals to stay abreast of challenges in Web services technologies.
