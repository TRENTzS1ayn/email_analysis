Here is my revised primary purpose list that I mentioned on the call 
today.  It reflects Rigo's comments and my re-ordering and grouping. My 
student, Serge, is going to take a pass at going through it and coming 
up with XML tokens, short human-readable descriptions, and full 
definitions. He and I will iterate on it and hopefully have something 
for you all to look at before the call next week.
