Hi hi, got your first version of Draft. Should be fixed now

Pattern not found: required. or mixed 

But I think we deprecated the use of Group-Info as it is already 
included in the grouping mechanism..

We decided to remove 4.7, no? At least this is what the Spec says at the 
moment. I think it is already said in 6.4, no?
