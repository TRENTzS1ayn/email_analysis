OK, I like the distinction between interface description and data. I 
know very little about WSDL and other languages for writing interface 
descriptions... would an interface description include some reference 
to a particular entity or URI where the interface will be processed 
(not sure if that's the right word)? I guess what I'm wondering is 
whether there could still be a problem that a chunk of XML describing 
an interface might be processed by multiple entities, including 
entities that the one who wrote it is unaware of (and thus can't 
anticipate when writing the P3P policy).
