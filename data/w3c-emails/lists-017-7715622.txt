Haven't seen any comments on the latest domain relationship proposal:
http://www.w3.org/P3P/2004/03-domain-relationships.html

Please see the copy I sent to the list previously if you want to see the
bolded sections that changed from the previous version of the draft.

Would love to get this wrapped up soon, please get your comments in before
Wednesday if possible.

Thanks.

Here is the new draft of the domain relationships proposal. I have
incorporated all of the comments I've received and also tried to clarify
some of the relationship questions.

Changed sections are bolded so you can quickly scan what changed. Rigo, can
you incorporate this draft into the working draft now (removing my bolding,
of course)?

Thanks. Sorry for the delay.
