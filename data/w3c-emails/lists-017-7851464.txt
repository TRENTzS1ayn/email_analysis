There seems to be something wrong with the initial argument:

The existing P3P spec says:

"A policy referenced in a policy reference file can be applied only to URIs
on the DNS (Domain Name System) host that references it. Thus, for example,
a policy reference file at the well-known location of host www.example.com
can apply policies only to resources on www.example.com."

So when you say

"forinstance.com is configured to return the HTTP header

    P3P: policyref="http://www.example.com/w3c/p3p.xml"

This policyref can only apply to files on www.example.com 

Have I missed something in this discussion?
