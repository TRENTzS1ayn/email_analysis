I think the problem is the ambiguity of the word "it" in the sentence:

We have been interpreting this sentence to mean:

A policy referenced in a policy reference file can be applied only to 
URIs
on the DNS (Domain Name System) host that references the policy 
reference file.

Thus in Jack's example, if forinstance.com returns a P3P header, the 
policy reference file it references gets applied to forinstance.com. I 
am pretty sure that is how it has been implemented in IE6, Netscape7, 
and PrivacyBird.
