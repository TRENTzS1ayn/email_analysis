This is a good trick. I like it. But curly braces don't carry attributes ;) This means 
the grouping mechanism of <statement> can't be applied. Your examples 
for grouping are good, but I would really like us to have a chunk of full 
policy in the example and the grouped compact representation that goes 
with it.

Best,
