Attached is the new, leaner, simpler domain relationships (a.k.a. OUR-HOST)
proposal. Please review -- we can discuss tomorrow.

I think in our discussion last week we talked about something even 
simpler. We suggested that there was not a need to have a two-way 
handshake. A site should be able to use our-host even if the host it is 
referring to does not point to its PRF.

So... an our-host tag in a POLICY-REF would mean that for any URIs 
covered by this policy, any embedded content (anything that would be 
covered by a HINT element) that is served from a URI covered by the 
our-host tag should be considered as coming from the entity or its 
agents (or entities for whom it is acting as an agent).  [not very well 
said, but hopefully, you can tell what I mean]

And, an our-host token in a CP would mean that any cookies served with 
the current page that domain match the our-host tag should be 
considered as coming from the entity or its agents (or entities for 
whom it is acting as an agent).
