Hmm... interesting question. So, my interpretation of the current 
proposal is that there are no transitive relationships. If 
publisher.com declares weathersite.com and adserver.com as our-hosts, 
then both of them can be treated as first party regardless as to 
whether they are embedded directly or indirectly. That should probably 
be made explicit.
