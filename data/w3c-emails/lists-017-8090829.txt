Does this section of the proposal not clarify it?
---
Any relationships inferred by this mechanism are valid only in the context
of the policy reference file and policy for which they were discovered --
this is not a mechanism for declaring globally that two hosts have a
relationship in all contexts. By extension, the relationships are not
transitive. Suppose two distinct hosts A and C are matched by OUR-HOST
entries in a policy reference file for host B. Even if the same policy
applies to both, nothing may be inferred about the relationship between A
and C for use in other contexts.
---
(I think that first sentence needs to be rephrased: "in the context for
which they were discovered"?)

Brooks, in your example, publisher.com would definitely have to declare both
weathersite.com and adserver.com as our-hosts. There is no hierarchy or any
kind of transitivity.

Hmm... interesting question. So, my interpretation of the current 
proposal is that there are no transitive relationships. If 
publisher.com declares weathersite.com and adserver.com as our-hosts, 
then both of them can be treated as first party regardless as to 
whether they are embedded directly or indirectly. That should probably 
be made explicit.
