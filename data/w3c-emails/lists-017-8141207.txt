Nice draft!

This sentence is ambiguous as it can read:
1/ a site MUST make compact policy statements
2/ if a site makes compact statements, it has to do so 
in good faith.

The first requirement sounds really strange. It is raw access to 
the tokens as arrived at the user agent. This is normally done 
by experts using telnet or perl tools. But I think this was the consensus 
we had. We should be clear that it is really only raw access.

Why transform? The whole paragraph does not make too much sense 
anymore.

Another thing is, does P3P 1.1 use mandatory extensions? In this case, 
the third paragraph is an issue too:
Full policies that include mandatory extensions MUST NOT be represented 
as compact policies.

In the same direction, 4.7 could be integrated somewhere instead of having 
an own point. I also wonder why we said SHOULD NOT while the above 
indicates that by inference it is supposed to read MUST NOT.
