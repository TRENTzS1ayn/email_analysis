OK, how about:

However, if a site makes compact policy statements, it MUST make these 
statements in good faith.

I don't so much care about whether a user agent gives me an ascii 
string or whether it formats it in a pretty way, as long as all the 
information is there. I think the current wording captures that. In 
what way do you think it might be misinterpreted?

For backwards compatibility, the aggregation is still legal. We could 
change this paragraph to say:

The P3P 1.0 specification required that all purposes, recipients, and 
categories that appear in multiple statements in a full policy be 
aggregated in a compact policy, as described in section 3.3.1. With the 
addition of the compact STATEMENT element in P3P 1.1, this is no longer 
necessary, although it is still permitted. When performing the 
aggregation, a Web site MUST disclose all relevant tokens (for 
instance, observe Example 4.1, where multiple retention policies are 
specified.)

I believe we only include optional extensions in P3P 1.1. If we used 
mandatory extensions it would introduce backwards compatibility 
problems.

4.7 is entirely repeated as the first paragraph of section 6.4, so I 
think we could drop 4.7.

(Rigo, here is one typo in 6.4 - a ] that should be removed.)

At the time we wrote this we agreed to SHOULD NOT. However, I think 
MUST NOT may be appropriate given our other changes. So I would propose 
that the first paragraph of 6.4 say:

P3P user agents MUST NOT rely on P3P compact policies that do not 
comply with the P3P 1.0 or P3P 1.1 specifications or are obviously 
erroneous. Such compact policies SHOULD be deemed invalid and the 
corresponding cookies should be treated as if they had no compact 
policies. The following guidelines are designed to reduce the chance 
that a P3P user agent will accept an invalid compact policy.
