"Content" is the site's designation of the subject-matter component of it's
primary purpose.  

I.e., a site might indicate that one of its primary purposes is to: ACQUIRE
USER PII to AUTHENTICATE THE USER and FULFILL ONLINE the user's request for
GAMING content.

I don't understand that either. I additionally don't understand the 
content class. Is this content received or content sent? If it is content 
received, this is out of scope of P3P. If it is content sent, it duplicates
the base dataschema.

Can somebody help?
