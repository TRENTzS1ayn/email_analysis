[please send comments BEFORE the call]

Discussion on David's proposal:
Content can expressed as category or data items in statements
Different statements can have different primary purposes, so 
no need for more than one primary purpose per statement.
Different statements can be grouped with the grouping 
mechanism to constitute an assembly that reflects the 
actual web-site.
 
Horizont should be the declaration of the site: I collect 
this data and I'm telling you what I'm going to do with 
it. Dave called this actions upon data or content. See above, 
this can be already expressed with the dataschema.

ACTION Dave: Bring up new list of actions as a first model 
for questions to the wider community.
