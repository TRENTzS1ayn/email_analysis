him. 
Action: Lorrie: Changing XML attrib to mention the RDF Note


2. primary purpose specification
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-p3p-spec/2004Mar/0035.html
[Dave please send revised draft]

Lorrie called Dave and reported. Yet gone to another direction. 
Lorrie presented that direction. Dave tries to put the assertions
in a sentence of eight parts. 

a. EU wants primary purpose (principle of finality)
b. useful to have a human readable statement
c. useful to have a computer readable statement

Conclusion is that the direction of eight parts is not okay. We only 
need to have the verbs.

So just come down with the list here. 

Sales 
products
services

banking and financial management

registration subscription (account management) reservations

advertising marketing promotion

education 

gaming

gambling

information

feedback

payment

Action: Lorrie send list to mailing-list


3. XML schema stuff
[Giles to send draft and any questions group needs to consider)

Not enough time..

4. Schedule next call (May 12?)

Next call is May 12!
