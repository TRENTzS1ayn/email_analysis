Thanks for these comments Mark. A few thoughts...

I think the word "submitted" is too limiting, as P3P also covers log 
data that is created as a result of a transaction but might not really 
be considered to be submitted, as well as data collected by client-side 
scripts. I also think we really are binding a policy to a URI, or maybe 
a policy to a URI and all the data associated with it? I  would be 
happy with:

P3P 1.0 was designed to associate XML-encoded privacy policies with Web 
resources, which are identified by URIs or bound to cookies.

I think something like that is ok.

Wouldn't that be covered by the ENTITY element? Or are you thinking of 
something beyond that?
