Based on our discussion today, here is a very rough proposed list of 
primary purposes.

We need to first decide if this approach generally makes sense (as 
opposed to say the proposal Dave sent out earlier today). If so, we 
need to refine this list (what's missing, what should be folded 
together, etc.) and then produce for each item a) an XML token b) a 
definition c) a short human-readable description. I would propose that 
the primary purpose extension allow sites to list one or more of these 
tokens and a human-readable description.

I think this is the largest piece of work remaining before we can take 
P3P 1.1 to last call, so let's get on with it... please review and send 
your comments to the mailing list.
