Log data is sourced from aspects of the request (e.g., IP address, 
referer header, etc.), so it's still targeted at the incoming data. How 
about:

P3P 1.0 was designed to associated XML-encoded privacy policies with 
data collected by Web resources, which are identified by URIs or bound 
to cookies.

?

Given the above, it might need some tweaking in the second clause half 
of the first sentence; perhaps

... in general, they only allow one to identify data associated with 
HTTP requests, and only on the granularity of an entire message.

Ah, yes; that should do it. Does ENTITY have some mechanism for 
identifying an anonymous party (e.g., "Anyone I send THIS message to me 
MUST conform to this privacy policy)? I'd imagine there are cases where 
people using this attribute won't want to explicitly enumerate the 
entity responsible for conforming to the policy.
