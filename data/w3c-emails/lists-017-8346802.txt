Hmm... I'm still pondering whether it is accurate to say that P3P binds 
a policy to data as opposed to binding a policy to a URI. I'm hoping 
others will weigh in on this.

I think it is important that the party responsible for the policy be 
identified. If they are not identified, then it is difficult to find 
them if you have a problem with the way they are following the policy.

Also, P3P is not designed for telling data collectors how to treat 
data; it is designed for data collectors to describe their policies. 
That was part of the point we were trying to make in the XML Generic 
Attribute section. If you have a chunk of XML that you are sending 
around to different places and you want them all to respect your 
privacy you need something other than P3P to describe this (perhaps 
EPAL, perhaps some language based on P3P).
