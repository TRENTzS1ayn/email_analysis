we associate some URI with a certain privacy behavior, NOT with data. 
As Lorrie said, some of the data is generated directly over there:

P3P 1.0 was designed to associate XML-encoded privacy 
policies with URI's describing the privacy impact of the Web 
resources behind those URI's.

Talking about "data" is too dangerous IMHO as people will 
mix that up with the data schemata in the policy.. This is NOT 
what we mean. We can describe the data in the POST, as 
we have a data schema for that. The violation of attaching 
a P3P Policy to a set of data happens on the protocol level.

"I send a policy over the wire to force someone to apply it" is
is what we want to avoid.

Best, 

Rigo
