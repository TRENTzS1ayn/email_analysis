Mark, here you fall exactly into the trap of the wrong protocol. 
You send PREFERENCES instead of POLICY in your example ;)
You don't go to the supermarket to impose your conditions. You 
accept their conditions. 

In data protection, you need the ENTITY element to be able 
to get to your rights as you can't force your rights against 
anonymous. In a web-service scenario, this is tricky as the 
WS interacting can be a privacy client in one second and a 
data controller in the next second. 

Imagine WS1 discovering WS2. WS1 is requesting something to 
WS2 and finds the P3P Policy in the WSDL. The PP is good and 
WS1 makes its request. If there is need for feedback and WS2 
makes a request to WS1, WS2 would have to check the P3P Policy 
of WS1 first.

(Note that this only applies if _personal_ data is involved, means 
some end-user or request on behalf of an end-user)

Sending Policies forward and saying SOAP "must understand" 
can't be solved with P3P, it needs EPAL.

Best, 

Rigo
