We were supposed to have a p3p spec call today. However, mailing list 
discussion has been minimal so there is not much to talk about, so I am 
going to cancel the call. Basically we need some progress on:

- P3P Generic Attribute (Rigo is consulting with Fabian on RDF aspect)
- XML schema (Giles is working on it)
- Primary purpose (Lorrie sent a draft to the mailing list and is 
looking for feedback)
- Rigo's latest working draft (everyone should review and comment)
