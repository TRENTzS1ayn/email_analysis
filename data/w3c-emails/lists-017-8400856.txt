On May 3 I sent out a draft proposal on primary purposes
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-p3p-spec/2004May/0003.html

Only Rigo responded
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-p3p-spec/2004May/0006.html

I really need input on this list (there are some questions in my
original email). It would also be great if some of you might volunteer
to start writing some definitions and human readable language....
