Hi Rigo, sorry for the delay responding.

I agree that there are different models; if one were to generalise 
them, they might be
   Entity X will honour policy P when handling data D.
for "policy" (e.g., P3P), and
   Entity Y requires entity X to honour policy P when handling data D.
for "preferences (e.g., EPAL).

My original point was slightly different; in both cases, the data is 
identified as D; P3P specifies this by associating policy with "data 
that is submitted to resource R" but this is really just a referential 
way to identify D.

Would you agree that the vocabulary for describing the policy and means 
of specifying it could be the same for either application, with the 
only difference being the assertions about who is requiring or 
committing to do what with them?
