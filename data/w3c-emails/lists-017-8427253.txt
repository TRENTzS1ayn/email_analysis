Hi,
Here are the long promised files for the XML Schema P3P Base Data Schema.
There is a new spec (the HTML file) - an openoffice file.
Then there are the various transforms (the one for transforming policies to
legacy format is included in the spec).
The main issues which I think people should think about are at the end of
the spec doc.
We can discuss these issues on the next call.

As predictable, it was a lot more work than initially anticipated, mainly
because XSD specs and XSD parsers don't always agree...
