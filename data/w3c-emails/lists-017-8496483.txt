Subject: P3P next steps list


Thanks to everyone who participated for a great workshop! We
had some very useful discussions and got a good sense of
the areas where there is interest in additional work. Rough minutes
will be sent to this list soon and a summary report should be ready
in mid-December.

The following is the list of areas for future work that we identified
and prioritized during the closing session. I have indicated the
names of the people who volunteered to write up a 1 page proposal
on each of these areas. Please include purpose, scope, resources,
and time frame and send your proposals to this mailing list by
Dec. 13.
