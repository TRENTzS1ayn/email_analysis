P3P Workshop Attendees:

[Sorry if you have gotten this multiple times...
some people did not get it the first time... also
don't forget to RSVP for dinner.]

A draft agenda for the P3P workshop is now posted at
http://www.w3.org/2002/p3p-ws/. You wil also find a link to
all of the position papers that were submitted. We are 
expecting a few more papers and to add a few additional
people to the program later this week. The web site
will be updated as the final speakers are confirmed.

We do not plan to distribute printouts of the position papers
at the workshop, so we encourage participants to review
the papers prior to the workshop.

For those of you who have been invited to give a short
presentation at the workshop, please remember to keep
your remarks to 5 minutes. I expect most presenters will
not be using slides, however, if you think slides will
enhance your presentation, you are free to use them. If you
want to use slides, you must email them to 
P3PWorkshop@aol.com by this Friday, November 8.
You will not be able to display them off your own laptop.
You are also welcome to bring handouts to distribute to
participants. Please plan to bring 50 copies.

We are planning to go to an Asian restaurant called
"Big Bowl" for dinner at 7:30 pm on November 12 (note this
is not a sponsored dinner). Please email me ASAP to let me 
know whether you plan to join us for dinner.

See you all next week!
