Dear all, 

it has taken a while to publish the minutes as I was travelling and
became sick and had to recover. 

But the minutes are finally published. There is no summary report yet. 

The minutes are under:
http://www.w3.org/2002/p3p-ws/minutes/

but they are also linked from the Workshop - Homepage:

Best,
