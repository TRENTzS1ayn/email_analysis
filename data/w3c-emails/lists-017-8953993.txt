To better evaluate this future work proposal, it would be helpful to
understand in more detail just what types of changes you are proposing. For
example, today we can identify on an individual element basis whether that
information element is opt-in opt-out or required - what more are you
recommending?

Subject: Future Work Proposal: P3P Spec. Ambiguities



SCOPE

A P3P policy should make clear  what recipient is allowed to perform
what purpose on which data element. In addition, it should define what
data can be collected, whether it needs to be anonymized at
collection, and how long can it be retained.

Unfortunately, the P3P specification only describes the meaning of a
policy that restricts itself to the most primitive case. Complicated
cases, like conflicts, are not sufficiently addressed.

The following issues should be clarified:
- Overlapping Statements: What is the meaning of overlapping statements
   In particular if some have opt-in opt-out, some haven't.
- Meaning of non-identifiable: It is unclear what an non-identifiable
element
   means.

RESOURCES

- Review and proposed changes to the spec.
- Aiming at an addenum to 1.0 that clarifies these issues.
