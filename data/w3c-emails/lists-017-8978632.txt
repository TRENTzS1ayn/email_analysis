Work Item: How to use P3P independently of HTTP binding and possibly with
references to objects that have no URIs.

Purpose: Workshop participants from a variety of technology communities have
recognized the value the P3P vocabulary for describing the privacy policies
of objects outside the HTTP URI scheme. This work item proposes a means of
abstracting the P3P vocabulary elements from their original HTTP context in
order to be useful in other application contexts. Successful completion has
two basic requirements:

a. abstract description of P3P vocabulary
b. demonstrated use of this abstract description in a non-http application
context

Scope: The goal of this work item is to develop a generalized representation
of the P3P vocabulary for use in applications contexts beyond http. This
goal can be satisfied by producing a W3C Note describing the P3P vocabulary
alone, without the associated protocol description in the P3P 1.0
Recommendation. While this work must be done in cooperation with at least
one other such application context (such as Geopriv or other IETF
activities, as an example), this particular activity would not, itself, be
responsible for describing bindings to other URI schemes or application
settings.

Resources: An initial draft of the proposal can be done by one or two
individuals familiar with P3P and the basics of Web architecture. W3C hopes
to be able to devote a few weeks of staff engineering resources to this
activity in order to develop the initial draft. Completing this work will
require  cooperation with those in another application domain. The P3P
Coordination Group should work to solidify commitments from those who
expressed initial interest at the Workshop.

Timeframe: An initial draft can be completed with a 2-3 months of work from
a W3C staff member and comments/support of the P3P technical working group
and representative of the target non-http application domain. More time will
be required to finalize the problem, dependent on the schedule of the target
application.
