P3P Future Work: Item 12 - Coordination with other efforts

Purpose: Establish reliable mechanism for coordination work between ongoing
P3P specification development activities and other efforts. A variety of
efforts to address privacy in contexts related to the Web are working in
areas closely connected to the P3P application space. Workshop participants
identified a need to develop cooperative mechanisms to coordinate work
between P3P and these other efforts such as the Liberty Alliance and IETF
initiatives such as the Geopriv WG.

Cooperative efforts should be coordinated through the P3P Coordination
Group. As necessary, representatives of initiatives outside W3C may be
invited to participate in the P3P Coordination Group on either an ad hoc or
formal basis. The P3P CG will develop concrete liaison statements with
specific outside activities as the basis for cooperation becomes more clear.

Scope: Ongoing P3P work at W3C should include mechanisms to coordinate
activities with outside groups as appropriate. This coordination should
provide for an exchange of requirements and, where possible, communication
about deployment and outreach efforts.

Resources: Coordination is often most effective when there is cross-over
membership between W3C activities and those outside W3C. Hence, adequate
participation from W3C members in both P3P WGs and outside activities will
be important. W3C Members can provide vital leadership in coordination when
shared objectives are recognized within a given Member organization and
communicated to the participants in all related activities. W3C staff will
provide resources to the P3P Coordination Group as available to help develop
shared goals across activities.
