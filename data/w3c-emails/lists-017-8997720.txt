Well crafted statement and having considerable knowledge of what is 
happening in the IETF as one of its WG chairs issues relating to privacy 
and data collection are now continuing to come up not only in the GEOPRIV 
WG but also now in PROVREG which is defining the interfaces between domain 
name registrars and registries and as such must collect PII and other forms 
of social data.

IETF has a mandate now that all IETF RFC's have a security considerations 
section in the document there has been some consideration of extending that 
to privacy as well.
