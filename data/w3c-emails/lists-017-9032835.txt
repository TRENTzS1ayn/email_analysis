The W3C membership is considering the P3P activity proposal renewal (please
ask your AC representative to vote to approve it). If all goes well, we
expect to proceed with our P3P 1.1 Specification Working Group meeting March
6-7 in Boston. For more information, see
http://www.w3.org/2002/10/allgroupoverview.html

If you plan to attend the meeting, please go ahead and register at

Also, if you would like to stay at the Royal Sonesta Hotel where the meeting
will take place, you need to make your hotel reservations by Wednesday, Feb
1. The hotel reservation form is at
http://www.w3.org/2002/10/allgroupoverview/hotelform.html

This meeting (and the P3P 1.1 Specification Working Group) is open to
employees of W3C member organizations and invited experts only (although we
are proposing that the minutes and mailing list archive be made available to
the public). If you are interested in joining the working group and would
like to  be considered for invited expert status, please let me know.
