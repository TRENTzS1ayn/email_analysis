Dear all, 

due to low attendance, the program-committee shortened the W3C Workshop
on the long term Future of P3P and Enterprise Privacy Languages to
one and a half day. 

The Workshop will be held on 19 and 20 June[1]. The program is now
published and accessible from the Workshop-homepage[2]

At the same time, the location has been moved to the Independent Centre
for Privacy Protection Schleswig-Holstein.[3] As we are viewer people,
it is more convenient and closer to the town-center.


IMPORTANT
If any of the attendees has trouble with the shortenings, please email
immediatly to me (rigo@w3.org)
