We are in the process of reorganizing the P3P mailing lists in 
preparation for our restructuring of the P3P working groups (awaiting 
W3C membership vote and director decision in the coming weeks).

We will create a public P3P interest group mailing list that will be 
publicly archived and allow anyone to subscribe. Everyone who is 
currently subscribed to the P3P interest group mailing list, the P3P 
workshop mailing list, or the P3P specification working group mailing 
list will be subscribed automatically to this new mailing list. If you 
DO NOT want to be subscribed to this mailing list, please email 
rigo@w3.org

We will create a P3P 1.1 specification working group mailing list for 
members of that working group. This mailing list will be publicly 
archived, however, only members of the working group will be permitted 
to post messages. Everyone who attended or dialed in to the working 
group meeting in Boston last week will be subscribed. If your AC rep 
signed you up for the P3P1.1 working group you will also be subscribed. 
If you don't fall into one of these two categories and you would like 
to participate in the working group as a W3C member representative, an 
invited expert, or a task force member, please email me to discuss. 
MEMBERS OF THE CURRENT SPEC GROUP MAILING LIST WILL NOT BE SUBSCRIBED 
TO THIS NEW LIST UNLESS THEY HAVE SIGNED UP TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 
P3P1.1 GROUP.

The new publicly-accessible P3P1.1 spec group home page is under 
construction at http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Specification/
