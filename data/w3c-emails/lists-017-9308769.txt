Alexander,

Thank you for your comments. I would like to provide you with a few 
clarifications and answer the questions you raised.

First, the document I circulated does not contain any new elements. 
These are the same elements as are found in the P3P 1.0 Recommendation 
that was published in April 2002. The new document simply translates 
the legal definitions in that document into "plain English."

As for the question of why the P3P 1.0 Recommendation offers the 
opportunity for web sites to use elements that describe practices that 
violate data protection laws or fair information practice principles, 
the answer is that these elements exist because they describe practices 
that are in widespread use. By providing these elements we make it easy 
for a P3P user agent to identify sites that have these practices. If we 
did not provide these elements, sites with these practices would not be 
able to use P3P, and thus we would not know anything about their data 
practices without taking the time to read through a lengthy privacy 
statement.

You may be interested in a study my colleagues and I have performed to 
assess the data practices at P3P-enabled web sites (mostly US sites) -- 
see http://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/icec03.html. We were able to 
determine, for example, that about two-thirds of these sites list their 
data retention policy as 'indefinitely.' We can now easily capture a 
lot of information about the kinds of policies that are being offered. 
This information may be useful in future debates about privacy 
regulation and enforcement.

I think it would be quite useful if short P3P guides were developed for 
particular jurisdictions. For example, a guide to P3P in Germany might 
point out which P3P elements describe practices that are not legal in 
Germany or that are legal only if an opt-out is offered. In addition, 
rule sets could be developed for P3P user agents that would warn users 
or block access to sites that declare practices that violate laws in a 
particular jurisdiction.

Regards,

Lorrie Cranor
