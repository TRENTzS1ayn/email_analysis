Hi Roger,


here are some basic facts on EPAL that may help you separate facts from 
fiction:
- EPAL is a policy language. Like any other piece of XML, it does not 
enforce anything.
   However, it can be used to express fine-grained enterprise-internal 
policies that
   can then be read and enforced by EPAL-aware systems or middleware.
   EPAL has been designed to be easy to enforce.
- We have submitted EPAL as a member publication to W3C. We are currently 
looking
   for partners to actually start a working group to standardize EPAL in W3C.
   See: http://www.w3.org/Submission/2003/SUBM-EPAL-20031110/
- An example enforcement engine for J2EE has been published at
   http://alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/dpm
- EPAL and P3P augment each other: EPAL is a fine-grained enterprise-internal
   privacy policy language while P3P is meant for customer-facing privacy 
notices.
   As a consequence, EPAL contains enterprise internals that would be 
abstracted away
   by the P3P notice (e.g., P3P does not specify what persons/group inside 
an enterprise
   can use what data but rather only specifies what the complete enterprise 
can do).
   fyi: I am a member of the P3P 1.1 group as well (this is how I received 
your mail).

If you want to get more (technical) information just send a note or call.
The business side of EPAL (non-technical questions) is covered by Steven 
Adler <adler1@us.ibm.com>.

  matthias
