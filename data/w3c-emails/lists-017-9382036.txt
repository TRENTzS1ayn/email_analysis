Dear all, 

AT&T has released to code for privacy bird[1] as open source. 

I quote from the release-notes[2]:
AT&T is making the C++ source code to Privacy Bird available to open
source software developers. This code is provided as-is with no
documentation or support. Developers may find the code useful as a
starting point for developing their own P3P user agents, for adding
features to Privacy Bird, or for porting it to other platforms. The
included APPEL engine may be useful for other purposes as well. The
downloadable tar ball includes the code developed for Windows as well as
a tar ball of files that have had the Windows-specific code removed so
that they can be compiled on a Unix system (this code currently has no
GUI support).

W3C very much hopes, that this code is taken up for further development
