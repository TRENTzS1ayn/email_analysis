Dear all, 

as announced some time ago, W3C is organizing a W3C Workshop on the long
term Future of P3P and Enterprise Privacy Languages[1] together with the 
Independent Centre for Privacy Protection Schleswig-Holstein[2].  

The position papers are now published[3] and the program committee will now
choose the ones that will be presented at the Workshop. 

Registration is still open.
