The user agent task force of the P3P specification working group has a 
draft plain language translation of the P3P elements now available at 
http://www.w3.org/P3P/2003/p3p-translation.htm  A version of this is 
likely to get incorporated into the P3P 1.1 Specification.  This is the 
language we will be recommending that future P3P user agents use to 
present P3P policy information to end users.  We would appreciate any 
feedback anyone might have on this translation.
