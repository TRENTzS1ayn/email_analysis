The new checklink doc page has been online since validator 0.6.0 was
installed to validator.w3.org.

Could someone make the old doc page,
<http://www.w3.org/2000/07/checklink> redirect to
<http://validator.w3.org/docs/checklink.html>?

I think redirect is needed because the new page has some relative links
that wouldn't work with proxying.

TIA,
