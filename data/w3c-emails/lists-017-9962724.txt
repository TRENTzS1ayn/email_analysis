I'll try to set them up on the throwaway box (the old Bugzilla) tonight
some time (after midnight GMT, probably).

If you're happy to host them, what say you we just add a link to some
suitable place on cachalot.ods.org so we can freeze and tag 0.6.1?
Eventually I'd like to see this hosted at w3.org somewhere, but pointing
elsewhere for convenience while we figure out this whole packaging and
releases thing seems the smart way to do it.
