Ok, validator-0_6_1-release has been tagged and tarballs are at
<http://validator.w3.org:8001/validator-0_6_1.tar.gz> and
<http://validator.w3.org:8001/sgml-lib-0_6_1.tar.gz>. I'll bug Olivier
about updating :80 when I catch him on IRC next (you've been warned
Olivier! ;D).

Next step is to merge validator-0_6_0-branch onto HEAD and then I'll begin
to merge in my local changes...

...those being the beginnings of a templateified version! :-)


Among other things, that means HEAD is off-limits until I finish the merge!

The validator-0_6_0-branch is open if there is anything that is appropriate
for a 0.6.2 release (just don't committ to the 0_6_1-*release* tag!).


Another consequence is that HEAD is about to get real borken for a while!

If anyone wants a stable baseline to work from I recommend getting
validator-0_6_1-release and working from that.
