RPMs rolled as well, and uploading to <http://cachalot.ods.org/> right

Terje, some last-minute CSS changes made fonts in 0.6.1 look ugly on
RH8, Galeon/Mozilla, Konqueror and Opera.  I don't have time to

in particular the monospace font in buttons.

moz-old.png is from 0.6.0, and looks fine here.
