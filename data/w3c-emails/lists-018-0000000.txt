I have a number of specific suggestions to make regarding Chapter 3.3 of the 
Data Model WD.

1. In the first paragraph the PSVI is referred to without a link. Either a 
link should be provided to W3C XML Schema Part I or (probably better) a 
self-contained document should be provided introducing PSVI in a clear, 
manner and, if possible, avoiding newcomers to XQuery having to grapple with 
W3C XML Schema Part I.

2. Reference is made to "schema-validated" documents and "DTD-valid" 
documents. The terms should structured the same way.

3. When reference is made to documents not conforming to Namespaces in XML a 
reference should be added to clarify whether version 1.0 or 1.1 is being 
referred to. By the time XQuery 1.0 gets to REC this may be a practical 
issue. A link should be added to whichever is relevant.
