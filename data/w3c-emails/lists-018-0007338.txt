I would like to suggest that the WG provide, in due course, an XQuery Part 0, 
by which I mean an introductory document analogous to W3C XML Schema Part 0. 
This should, in my view, be published as a REC in the way that Part 0 of W3C 
XML Schema was.

Already concerns are being expressed about the difficulty in accessing the 
meaning of XQuery 1.0. Since those comments are coming from those more 
towards the cutting edge of XML the need for succinct introductory 
information can only be anticipated to increase, as others with more general 
interests come to grapple with XQuery.

The Use Cases document might be usefully adapted to provide useful tutorial 
level information.

Depending on the route the WGs take to clarify/resolve a number of concerns 
raised about XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 in relation to XQuery there may also be a 
need for one or two additional "Part 0" type documents for XPath and XSLT 
users.

For many current users of XSLT 1.0 and XPath 1.0 the learning burden brought 
by XQuery is substantial. It would be sad to see XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0 
languish in the way that XHTML 1.0 has.
