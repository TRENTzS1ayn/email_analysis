Thanks for the suggestion. I agree that tutorial material is often useful,
though in my view a normative spec should be written to be readable on its
own by anyone with a computer science education, and for those without such
an education, the job is best done by commercial publishers or interested
individuals.

In the end it comes down to finding someone who has the time, inclination,
and skill to do the writing.
