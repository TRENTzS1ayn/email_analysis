The XML Infoset REC refers to a "document type declaration" information item.

The Data Model WD (for example in Chapter 2) refers to a "doctype" 
information item.

In my view the terms in the Data Model WD (and possibly elsewhere among the 
XQuery / XPath  2.0 / XSLT 2.0 WDs) should be aligned with the terminology in 
the Infoset REC.
