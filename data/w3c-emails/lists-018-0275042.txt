Reference is made in 3.4 of Data Model to the term "Expanded-QName".

It was not clear whether an "expanded-QName" is or is not the same as the 
more familiar terms "expanded name" or "expanded-name".

If the two terms differ then I suggest it would be useful to describe the 
essential difference(s) when the term "expanded-QName" is first introduced in 
3.4.

If the two terms mean the same what is the purpose of adding a new term with 
essentially the same meaning?
