XQuery builds documents "bottom up": it is possible to construct, and
manipulate, element nodes that have not yet been connected into a document
(and perhaps never will be). The data model therefore needs to describe
these "partial InfoSets", which can exist transiently even though they
cannot be obtained by parsing source XML documents.
