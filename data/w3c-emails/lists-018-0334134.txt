Yes, we should explain this term better.

We had a problem because the term "QName", which traditionally (and in the
Namespaces REC) is used to mean a construct of the form prefix:local-name,
is used in the Schema recommendation to refer to a data type whose lexical
form is prefix:local-name and whose value space consists of (namespace-uri,
local-name) tuples. XPath 1.0 referred to this as an expanded name. To avoid
ambiguous use of the term "QName", we decided to use "expanded-QName" to
represent these tuples.
