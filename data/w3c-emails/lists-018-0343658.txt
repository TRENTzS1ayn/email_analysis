The model is based on the InfoSet, but it doesn't necessarily include
everything that's in the InfoSet.

No, the term "item" used in the XPath data model is quite unrelated to the
term "information item" as used in the InfoSet. We probably need to make
this clearer!

Yes, a node in the XPath model and an "information item" in the InfoSet
correspond pretty closely.

No, XPath 2.0 nodes are essentially the same as XPath 1.0 nodes which are
essentially the same as InfoSet information items (though XPath 1.0 was
published before the InfoSet).

Indeed they are.

The result of an XPath 2.0 expression is a sequence of zero or more items.
Each item is either a node or an atomic-value. A node is, for example, an
element node or an attribute node. An atomic-value is, for example, a string
or a number. 

I hope that makes it clearer.
