This is a cut-and-paste error; the specification of the document() function
was transferred from the XSLT specification. The reference should now be to
the static context. And XQuery needs to define how this variable in the
static context will be initialized (it will probably just say that it's
implementation dependent).

Possibly. But it's the normal convention on the web that when one file
contains a reference to another, the reference is considered to be relative
to the file in which the reference was contained. Yes, this makes it
difficult to move files around: which is one reason xml:base was invented.
But of course, an XQuery expression, not being an XML document, cannot take
advantage of xml:base. In practice I think it's most likely that queries
will use absolute URIs.

Thanks for the comment.
