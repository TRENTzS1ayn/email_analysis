A few questions/statements about validate expressions and other things
 
1.) The semantics of validate { $x }[0] are very poorly specified especially with regard to how one obtains IN-SCOPE SCHEMA DEFINITIONS when there is no schema import mechanism described in the WD. 
 
2.) Considering that XPath is designed to be embedded in other XML technologies like the DOM or XSLT unlike XQuery, are a validate{ $x} operation as well as run time type identification (instance of) and casting (assert as, cast as, treat as) or complex error handling [2,3,4] really necessary? 
 
3.) Speaking of which exactly WHAT is the rationale behind both XPath 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 being strongly typed languages? Is the W3C assuming that people that don't use types when querying XML documents are second class citizens? 
 
4.) The XQuery and XPath data model do not give the ability to query over the entire PSVI[1], what is the reason the particular  supported subset was chosen?
