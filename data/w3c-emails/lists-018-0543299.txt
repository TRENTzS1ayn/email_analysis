well yes but personally I don't think that's sufficient justification
but also I only know that at all because I have W3C access (or because
you just told me), the documents as written just inflict the syntax with
no suggestion as to why it is there.

> It doesn't actually mean quite the same
you can't always replace << by following:: but I think in this case
it means the same (after coercing to boolean) doesn't it? and in other
cases (involving attributes or multiple documents you can do _something_)

> You think we should allow "let" in XPath?
I'm not sure, it's just a comment. (An alternative is to take out for
and move iterating over sequences to xslt, as per Jeni's suggestion)
The disability to bind variables does mean that if you are doing
anything very complicated you are going to have to re-evaluate
expressions, or try to move the looping to XSLT anyway. It's easier to
point out problems with the current situation than to suggest fixes...

Hmm OK if XSLT compatibiliy can be recreated then perhaps this isn't so
bad.
