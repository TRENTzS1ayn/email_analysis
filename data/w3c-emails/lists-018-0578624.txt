Dear Andrew,

We plan to address your suggestions in the next version of
the document. In particular we plan to
- add a link to W3C XML Schema Part I when the PSVI is referenced
- use the term "DTD-validated"
- specify the version of the Namespace REC 
We do not plan to provide a self-contained document describing
PSVI or XML Schemas. 

Thank you for your comments!

Best regards,
Marton Nagy
