Dear Jeni,

Thank you very much for your comments.
See my replies below.

You are right. At the time of the publication we took a very simple
approach for handling restrictions of simple types: we just used
xs:anySimpleType to label those. Since then, we have revisited this
decision and will likely do what you suggest: label these restrictions
with the name of the base type (if that has a name), or walk up the
type hierarchy till we find one that is named and use that.

Also note that the data model already handles list types.
If your example would just be a list of dates (rather than a list
of restrictions of dates), the atomic values in the sequence would
be properly labeled with xs:date. So once we fix the algorithm
of obtaining the type name of a subtype the whole example will be
handled properly.

I'll try to add some clarification to that section, and possibly
point out the reason you mention: for consistency with the treatment
of well-formed documents.

Thanks. I'll fix the typo.

Right. I'll move the attribute declaration outside sequence.

Right again! I'll make the change.

Yes! Thank you very much!
