Yes. The strongest use case for adding LET is that it would allow you to
bind to the context node at each level of predicate nesting:

   chapter[let $c := @id return section [starts-with(@id,$c)]]

I don't like the syntax: it would be much nicer to write

   chapter[$c; section [starts-with(@id,$c/@id)]]

but at least it gives the functionality.
