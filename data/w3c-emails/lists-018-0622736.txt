'course if you don't provide let then we'll end up telling people to
abuse for instead...


chapter[for $c in @id return section [starts-with(@id,$c)]]

let reads better but is only extra functionality if you want to bind to
a sequence of more than one item. I suspect that extra functionality
will be needed if (as in the current draft) sequence manipulation is 
an XPath rather than XSLT operation.
