I agree we do need the ability to tokenize a string. I'm working on a
proposal for regular expression handling (it's now on its third iteration)
which will meet this requirement, although it might be a little heavyweight
for simple splitting of a space-delimited string. We could look at providing
a convenience function to make easy cases easy.
