The  word "nodeid" appears in two places (not in bold and not defined)

2.3 Path Expressions
... after elimination of duplicates based on nodeid.

2.4.2 Combining Sequences
... without duplicates based based on nodeid.


I think this should be spelled as "node identity" and  explictly defined
with reference to the data model function  dm:node-equal (or
equivalently the XPath "is" operator).

In fact given that document order + removal of duplicates is such an
important link connecting XPath 2 sequences with XPath 1 node sets, I
think probably (at least in the XPath version of the document) it merits
a subsection of its own somewhere in the introductory sections.
