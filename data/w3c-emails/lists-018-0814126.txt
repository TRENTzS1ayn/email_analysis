A Basic XQuery implementation that does not support the Schema Import 
Feature does not accept schema imports. If it encounters one, it raises a 
static error. The Schema Import Feature relaxes this limitation. If an 
implementation that supports the Schema Import Feature encounters a schema 
import, it processes it instead of raising a static error.

Subject: XQuery 1.0 - 2.5.2.1 / 2.5.2.2 Inconsistency?

I am having trouble reconciling numbered point 1. in 2.5.2.1 with the 
first 
sentence of 2.5.2.2.

If numbered point 1. is correct I don't see how 2.5.2.2 alleviates the 
problem.

I am assuming that a SchemaImport (no space) and Schema Import (with an 
intervening space) refer to the same concept/process. It might help if 
this 
term / these terms were linked to relevant further explanation.

Perhaps there is some additional explanation that can reconcile the 
seeming 
inconsistency?
