Andrew,
I don't believe there's an issue number for this. I'll reword the 
sentence.

Subject: XQuery 1.0 - 2.3 "open issue"

In the penultimate paragraph of 2.3 it is stated, "Transformation of a 
Data 
Model instance into an XML document is currently an open issue.".

It would be convenient for cross-reference if the Issue number were given.
