Andrew,
The meaning of "." is defined in the section on Abbreviated Syntax. I am 
not aware of any change in the meaning of self::node().

Subject: XPath 2.0 - 2.1.2 - self::node() and .

In 2.1.2 of XPath 2.0 the context item is defined. Michael Kay's response 
to 
a query I had about XSLT 2.0 indicates a change in meaning of self::node() 

and . in XPath 2.0.

It seems to me that that change is not mentioned in XPath 2.0 but ought to 

be. Chapter 2.1.2 seems an appropriate place to express the change.

An equivalent change would need to be made in XQuery 1.0 spec too.
