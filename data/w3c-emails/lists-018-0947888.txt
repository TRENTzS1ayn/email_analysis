Subject: XQuery 1.0 - 2.3 Transformation / Serialization?

In 2.3 the following sentence is found: "Transformation of a Data Model 
instance into an XML document is currently an open issue.".

Where the term "Transformation" is used is "Serialization" intended? Using 

the term transformation seems inappropriate since XPath 2.0 is referenced 
by 
XSLT 2.0.

I assume an equivalent change needs to be made in XPath 2.0.
