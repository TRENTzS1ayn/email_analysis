Hi,

The XQuery 1.0 WD (section 4.1) says that namespace declarations that
appear in element constructors are added to the in-scope namespaces.
It's clear what this means for namespace declarations with prefixes.  

It's not so clear (at least to me!) what this means for default
namespace declarations.   The definition of "in-scope namespaces"
appears to specifically be referring to resolving prefixes, and it is
listed as a separate component of the expression context from the
"Default namespace for element and type names" and the "Default
namespace for function names".

So, my question is, do default namespace declarations in element
constructors override these two default namespaces (declared in the
prolog)?  Both of them, or just the element/type one?  

I think the rec could use some clarification.  

Thanks,
Priscilla
