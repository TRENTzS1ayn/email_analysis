The XML Schema Working Group has been preparing comments on
the Datamodel and Functions/Operators specifications, but we
have not yet completed our review.  This is to let you know
that we hope to send you a complete set of last-call comments
on both documents fairly soon; we can send fragmentary sets
of comments earlier, if that will be helpful.
