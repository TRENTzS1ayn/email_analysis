Subject: F&O Problems with patterns for duration types





Hi,

In F&O sections 8.2.1 and 8.2.2, the patterns for yearMonthDuration and
dayTimeDuration have two problems.  The dashes that appear within square
brackets should be escaped, as per XML Schema Errata E2-18.   Also, the
numbers should be represented as [0-9] rather than \p{Nd} as per XML
Schema Errata E2-23.

Thanks,
Priscilla
