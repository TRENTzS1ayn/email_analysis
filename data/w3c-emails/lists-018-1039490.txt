Hi,

In F&O, section 5.1, it says "They also apply to user-defined types
derived by restriction from these types."  This should say "..apply to
built-in and user-defined derived..." or simply "...apply to types
derived...", since there are also built-in types derived from integer.

Thanks,
Priscilla
