XPath/XQuery doesn't have the notion of "tuple"; the best that
collection() could do is return a sequence in which document names and
document nodes alternated, and that would be messy, particularly in
terms of typing.

Instead, you have to capture the sequence of document nodes in a
variable and use other functions to access information about them. I
don't think that this is too onerous.

Cheers,

Jeni
