It would be incredibly inconvenient to make users spell out the literal each
time it is used, rather than referring to a global variable.

In addition, XSLT 1.0 has shown that dynamic sorting capability is high on
users' requirements lists, and they are prepared to pay a heavy performance
penalty to achieve it.
