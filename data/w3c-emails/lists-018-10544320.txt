The distinction isn't apparent on serialization - both positive and negative
zero display as "0" (assuming we adopt something close to the XPath 1.0
rules).
 
There are operations that distinguish between them but they are pretty
obscure. (23 div 0.0e0) > 5 is true, but (23 div -0.0e0) > 5 is false.

Functions and Operators, Section 6.1 Numeric Types 



Are there any operations that distinguish a -0 from a +0 ? 
Or is the distinction only apparent on serialization ?
