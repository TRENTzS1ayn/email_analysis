This aligns with a comment made in Software AG's review of the data model
that it would be useful to support an extensible set of user-defined
properties for document nodes, along the lines of the WebDAV model.

Functions and Operators, Section 15.4.5 fn:collection <fn:collection>  



It would be nice if there were some way, using fn:collection <fn:collection>
, to get metadata (eg document name) alongside nodes, probably in a sequence
of tuples or a tuple of sequences.
