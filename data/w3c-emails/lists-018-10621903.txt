Generally, the default type for "comparison" operations is string, and the
default type for "arithmetic" operations is numeric. min, max, etc fall into
the "comparison" category rather than the "arithmetic" category.
 
But I agree that this is going to confuse users a lot, in fact there are
errors in our published use cases in this area. Generally we still have a
big problem with handling the polymorphism of the aggregate functions.

Functions and Operators, Section 15.3.3 fn:max <fn:max> , 15.3.4 fn:min
<fn:min>  



The type conversion rules for fn:max <fn:max> , fn:min <fn:min>  are
inconsistent with the type conversion rules for fn:avg <fn:avg> . 


eg fn:avg <fn:avg>  says "If all values in $srcval are of type
xdt:untypedAtomic <xdt:untypedAtomic>  they are converted to xs:double
<xs:double> ".
while fn:min <fn:min>  says "If all values in $srcval are of type
xdt:untypedAtomic <xdt:untypedAtomic>  they are converted to xs:string
<xs:string> ".
