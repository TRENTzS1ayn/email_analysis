Without this functionality (these two functions and resolve-QName), it
becomes completely impossible to manipulate QNames in schema-less documents.
This functionality was provided after careful consideration as a replacement
for the namespace axis that provides access to the in-scope namespaces in
the data model, without the overheads reported by some implementors for
providing this information in the form of nodes with identity and parentage.
