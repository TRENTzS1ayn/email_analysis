I agree and would go further.
 
If we are to keep item-at($x, $n) then it should have the same behavior as
$x[$n].
 
And if it has the same behavior, then we might as well drop it.

Functions and Operators, Section 15.1.6 
"If the value of $posParam is ... equal to zero (0), then an error is raised
". 
This is inconsistent with the way the substring functions work. 


Suggest: each of the string functions should define what they do with zero
and negative values for position and length, and they should be consistent.
