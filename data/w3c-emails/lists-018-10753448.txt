fn:deep-equal is used to compare arbitrary sequences, and is true if they
are pairwise equal, that is, if
 
length($S1) eq length($S2) and
 
every $n in 1 to length($S1) satisfies deep-equal($S1[$n], $S2[$n])
 
It would be very odd if the empty sequence were an exception to this rule.
 
fn:sequence-node-identical() did return () if both arguments were () but
this was widely reported as a bug and has now been fixed.
 
fn:contains is a different case since it is comparing strings rather than
sequences, but there have been separate comments suggesting that the way the
string functions handle () is unhelpful.

Functions and Operators, Section 15.2.1 fn:deep-equal <fn:deep-equal>  



Why does this function return true if both arguments are the empty sequence
? 


cf fn:contains <fn:contains>  which returns false if either argument (and
presumably if both arguments) is the empty sequence.
cf fn:sequence-node-identical <fn:sequence-node-identical>  which returns
the empty sequence if one or both arguments is the empty sequence.
