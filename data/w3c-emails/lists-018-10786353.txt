There was supposed to be a note explaining this, but it seems to have got
lost. And I think it should be ($val eq $val).
 
The condition $val eq $val is true except when $val is NaN. This predicate
therefore has the effect of discarding NaNs from the sequence.

Functions and Operators, Section 15.3.3 fn:max <fn:max> , 15.3.4 fn:min
<fn:min>  


Why do we have "$val ne $val" in the example queries? Surely this condition
will cause the query to return the empty sequence ?
