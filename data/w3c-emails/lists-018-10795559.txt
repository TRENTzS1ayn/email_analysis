The handling of an empty sequence as an argument to the "eq" and "="
operators is described in sections 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 respectively of the XPath
language book.

I think it would be much better if the specification were not split between
two separate documents, and the WGs are looking at the feasibility of this.
