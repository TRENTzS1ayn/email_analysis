For clarification, here is an extract from the Perl documentation
(running the command, perldoc perlretut, will display it)

======================
*  no modifiers (//): Default behavior.  '.' matches any character
   except "\n".  "^" matches only at the beginning of the string and
   "$" matches only at the end or before a newline at the end.

*  s modifier (//s): Treat string as a single long line.  '.' matches
   any character, even "\n".  "^" matches only at the beginning of the
   string and "$" matches only at the end or before a newline at the
   end.

*  m modifier (//m): Treat string as a set of multiple lines.  '.'
   matches any character except "\n".  "^" and "$" are able to match
   at the start or end of any line within the string.

*  both s and m modifiers (//sm): Treat string as a single long line,
   but detect multiple lines.  '.' matches any character, even "\n".
   "^" and "$", however, are able to match at the start or end of any
   line within the string.
======================

So, by default, . does *not* match \n in Perl.
