Apologies for the tardiness of this extra comment from
XML Core WG (mostly by Fran?ois Yergeau).

Missing version property on document nodes
------------------------------------------
[4.2.1] says that Document nodes have only base-uri, children, 
unparsed-entities and document-uri properties.  But there is at 
least one function in F&O which will behave differently depending 
on the XML version (fn:codepoints-to-string raises an error if a 
code point is not a "legal XML character").  Therefore it would 
seem that documents also need a version property reflecting the 
infoset one.
