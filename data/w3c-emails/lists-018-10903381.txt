A version property on a document node would not help the
codepoints-to-string function, which has no knowledge of any document.

On the working assumption that the XSLT/XQuery specifications will support
XML 1.1, the aim is that the data model will support the union of what is
permissible under 1.0 and 1.1, and that serialization (or infoset mapping)
will have to sort out fallback to cover any differences.
