XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Formal Semantics 
W3C Working Draft 16 August 2002

There are some mistakes in the BNF:

4.4.2
[61 (XQuery)] SchemaGlobalContext: the parens should be angle brackets

5.1
[227 (XQuery)] The production number is off by 1.

5.1.1
[193, 194, 195, 214 (XQuery)]: The production numbers are off by 1.

[214 (XQuery)] StringLiteral: The (" ") and (' ') appear to be quoted blanks.

5.7
[70 (XQuery)] ElementConstructor: (| "<") should just be "<"
[81 (XQuery)] EnclosedExpr:       (| "{") should just be "{"

5.9.1
[6 (XQuery)] SortExpr is missing the final '*'.

5.12.1
[14 (XQuery)] InstanceofExpr is missing the final '?'.

A.2
[16] ForClause: <"for" "$"> should be just "for".
[17] LetClause> <"let" "$"> should be just "let".

The 'Formal' BNF appears to be missing productions 47-48, 52-55, and 60-129.
