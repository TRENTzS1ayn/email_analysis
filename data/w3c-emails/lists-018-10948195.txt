Ashok, equality does not require a total ordering.  Only gt/ge/lt/le require
an ordering.

Also you've already defined eq and ne for every other type (or supertype),
including those that are not totally ordered.  (For example, xs:QName and
xs:NOTATION.)  xs:duration is the only type omitted.


Thanks,
michael

That's deliberate!  Equality is not defined on xs:duration because it
has a partial order.  Equality is defined only on the two fully ordered
subtypes of xs:duration -- xdt:dayTimeDuration and
xdt:yearMonthduration.

All the best, Ashok
