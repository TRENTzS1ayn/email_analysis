Looking at http://www.w3.org/2001/05/xmlschema-errata
In the item E2-9 Clarification, the canonical form for xs:base64Binary
contains an error:


B64line                 ::=  B64x15 B64x15 B64x15 B64x15 B64 #xA
                            /* 76 Base64 characters followed by newline */

But, as you can clearly see, there are only 4 groupings of 15 followed by
one additional character, so there are 61 characters instead of 76.
Apparently the canonical form should be:

B64line                 ::=  B64x15 B64x15 B64x15 B64x15 B64x15 B64 #xA
                            /* 76 Base64 characters followed by newline */

I also suspect the trailing new line is an error; shouldn't the very last
newline character be omitted?


This affects the XQuery expression

declare variable $b as xs:base64Binary external
$b cast as xs:string
