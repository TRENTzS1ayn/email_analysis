1. The beginning of Section of 10.1 says "Since the validity of a QName
is situation dependent, there is no constructor function for QName
defined in 5 Constructor Functions. Neither is casting defined for QName
from any other type in 17 Casting Functions."  These sentences should be
removed, since they are no longer true.

2. The draft does not say what error resolve-QName or expanded-QName
should raise if the argument is not a valid XML name (e.g. starts with a
number or contains an invalid character).  This could be fixed for
expanded-QName by making the second argument an xs:NCName, but for
resolve-QName it seems you would need a new error message.

3.  The example in the "Usage Note" (Section 10.1.1.1) has two errors:
(a) it is missing a right parenthesis at the end of the if-expression,
and (b) it passes the empty sequence to expanded-QName when it should be
passing a zero-length string.  (This example is repeated in the "Casting
to xs:Qname" section.)

Thanks,
Priscilla
