<q>Everything that comes under serialization is a "should" because
serialization itself is optional.

My own view (and the way that XSLT 2.0 may go) is that serialization
should be an optional conformance module, and that most of the things
within it should then be "must"s.</q>

+1 to the idea of conformance chunks; So if a processor supports 
that chunk it must do X and Y and Z, because they are musts.

I really like that.
