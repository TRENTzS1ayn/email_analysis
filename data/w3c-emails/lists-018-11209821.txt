/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, **Section 1, Introduction. *The distinction between data
| model and value in the second paragraph is good, but I think a third
| concept should also be introduced and given a name. This third concept
| is the set of all values currently under consideration during the
| execution of some processor (XSLT, XQuery, etc.) using the data model.
| A possible name for this concept is "data set". Thus the three
| concepts are:
|
| "data model" - the abstract framework specified by this specification
| "data set" - a concrete realization of the data model at a particular
| point in the execution of a processor
| "value" - a value in a data set.

I'm not sure I understand your comment. Are you suggesting that the
term "data set" should be defined for a concrete instance of a data
model? Where would this term be referenced? (I don't see any value in
defining the term if it isn't referenced.)

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
