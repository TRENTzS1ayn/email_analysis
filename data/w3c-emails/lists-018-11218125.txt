/ "Kay, Michael" <Michael.Kay@softwareag.com> was heard to say:
| Section 4.3.2 of the data model document does not appear to reflect the
| decisions of the working group in relation to mixed content: specifically,
| that the type of an element declared as having mixed content should be the
| string value, as an instance of xdt:untypedAtomic.
|
| The correct rules are stated in section 4.1.6. It is not clear why 4.3.2
| attempts to restate the same rules in a different way. In fact, the overall
| structure of section 4, which presents the same accessor functions organized
| first by function and then by the kind of node that they apply to, seems
| designed to lead to inconsistencies of this kind.

That's a good point. I'm content to call this editorial and address it
by reducing the per-node-kind accessor sections to a simple list of
cross references back to the appropriate section in 4.1.x.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
