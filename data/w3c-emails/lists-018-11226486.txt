Hello,

would you please explain the reason for having recoverable errors?
(Yes, they are already in XSLT 1.0, but nevertheless ...)

If it is implementation-dependent whether such a recoverable error
will be reported or not, don't you think that this leads to non-portable
stylesheets? The XSLT developer might not be aware of the recovering action
when developing the stylesheet. So, theoretically, an XSLT engine built 
into a web browser could report the error (and nothing else), while
the developer's engine seems to work fine.
Both are standard compliant.

This kind of choice for the behaviour of an XSLT implementation is a bad
idea in my mind. It would be better to require that all implementations
must produce the same defined result on a given input.

Best regards,
Oliver Becker
