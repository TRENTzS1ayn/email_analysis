I think Steve's point is a very good one. We often slip into talking about a
"data model" when we mean a "data set". For example, section 2.2.1 of the
latest XPath (internal) draft is titled "data model generation" - the very
title shows the problem, and it occurs again throughout the section.
Sometimes we use "data model instance", but it's not entirely clear what we
mean by the term.

It would be very awkward if we didn't have the word "relational database"
and instead always referred to it as "an instance of the relational data
model", or worse, as "a relational model". I'm not quite sure about Steve's
proposed definition, though.
