This is not something we have reviewed recently, and perhaps we should,
though it would be difficult now to change the rules.

The non-portability issue seems to me to be a good reason
to take up this issue. 
 It reflects my concern over the number of implementation dependencies
(in xslt+xpath).

The fact that its late in the day I hope won't stop the WG addressing
this issue?
   I still think of a rec as a 'standard way of working'. If this WG
is less concerned about portability, then could that be clearly stated.
