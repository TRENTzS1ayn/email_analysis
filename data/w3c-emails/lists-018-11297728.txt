I would think this can be achieved with regular expressions. Something like:

replace(., "(.*?)(-.*)?", "$1")

(untested)

is a "substring-after-last(op1, op2)" that returns the substring of op1
after the last op2 in the string.

Again, I think this is one for regular expressions. Something like: 

replace(., "(.*/)([^/]*)", "$2")

(again untested)
