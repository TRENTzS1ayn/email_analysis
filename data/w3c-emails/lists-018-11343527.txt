I just spotted, this, and apologize that I am beyond the deadline
for public comment, but in

  http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xpath-datamodel-20030502/

in section "4.3.2 Accessors", there is a table with the various
accessors of element nodes.  After the table is a series of short
paragraphs, for the most part explaining the accessors listed in the
table.  The fourth paragraph reads:

   If the element node's type is xs:anyType, the dm:typed-value accessor
   returns the node's string value as xs:anySimpleType. If the type is a
   complex type with complex content, invoking dm:typed-value raises an
   error.

However, the 4th table item is dm:string-value, which has no explaining
paragraph, and the 5th paragraph is (also) an explanation for dm:typed-vale,
so I wonder if the accessor named in the 4th paragraph should be
dm:string-value, rather than dm:typed value.
