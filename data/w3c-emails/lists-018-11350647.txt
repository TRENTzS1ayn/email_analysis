Again I apologize that I am beyond the deadline for public comment, but in

  http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xpath-datamodel-20030502/

in section "4.6.1 Overview" (of Processing Instructions), the second
pargraph that starts:

   Namespace nodes must satisfy the following constraints.

I'm quite sure this should read:

   Processing instruction nodes must satisfy the following constraints.

 Thanks. Dave Evans, Sirius Software, Inc.
