Thank you for your suggestion.  The F&O taskforce agreed on 7/18/2003 to
replace the existing figure in the F&O document with the figure you
suggested.  

All the best, Ashok

Subject: MS-FO-LC1-008: Type derivation figure issues

 

Class: Editorial/Technical

 

The figure that represents the type hierarchy has the following
problems:

 

1.It misses the namespace URI or prefixes
2.It confuses people w.r.t. derivation by lists
3.It is missing the node types

 

Proposed solution: Replace it with a version of the type hierarchy
figure in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-query-wg/2003May/0096.html
(member-only).
