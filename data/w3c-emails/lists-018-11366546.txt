Michael:

Thank you for your comment.  The taskforce agreed with you and decided
to change the example so as not to use a pattern.

All the best, Ashok

Subject: MS-FO-LC1-011: Bad example with pattern on non-string type

 

Class: Editorial  

 

Section 6.2 Operators on Numeric Values uses the following example:

 

As another example, a user may define height as a derived type of
xs:integer with a minimum value of 20 and a maximum value of 100. He may
then derive oddHeight using a pattern to restrict the value to odd
integers.

 

 

Do not use an example with a pattern on a non-string type. Pattern
restrict the lexical space which leads to problems when there is no
1-to-1 correspondence (as pointed out in other parts of the spec).
Providing an example that does use a pattern in this way, may lead to
the believe that this is a safe and accepted use.

 

Proposed resolution: Remove or change this example.
