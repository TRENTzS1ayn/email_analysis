Steve:

This section was complex and difficult to follow so we decided to break
it up into 4 separate sections.

I believe the problem you refer to is now gone, but please take a look
at the next version and double check.

All the best, Ashok

Functions and Operators, Section 17.8 Casting to numeric types 

In item 1, the 6th 'outer' or 'hollow' bullet ("If ST is
xdt:untypedAtomic, xs:anySimpleType or xs:string or a type derived from
xs:string, SV is converted to an intermediate value IV of type
xs:token."
<IfSTisxdt:untypedAtomic,xs:anySimpleTypeorxs:stringoratypederivedfromxs
:string,SVisconvertedtoanintermediatevalueIVoftypexs:token.> ) is
followed by 4 additional 'outer' or 'hollow' bullets; those final 4
bullets should be indented as 'inner' or 'solid' bullets under the 6th
'outer' or 'hollow' bullet.
