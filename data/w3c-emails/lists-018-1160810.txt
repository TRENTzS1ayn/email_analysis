 20.2 XHTML Output Method

I wonder if this ought to be called XHTML1 output method, used as
<xsl:output method="xhtml1"

XHTML2 is well on the way to being specified and (regrettably) uses a
different namespace. If people start generating xhtml2-namespaced
elements then an "xhtml" output method will be confusing as it won't
recognise head elements etc for special treatment. If the output type
were "xhtml1" it would be more clear I think. (I think that would be
preferable to trying to make the xhtml output method cope uniformly with
however many xhtml namespaces the html WG end up defining.) 


The first bullet point says:

That is, it should output <p> </p> and not <p  />. 
                          ^^^^^^^

but I believe that an empty p should be serialised as empty but not
minimised, so
<p></p> not <p> -space- </p>
