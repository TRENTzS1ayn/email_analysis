Thank you.

Document order is defined for nodes. We may want to preserve the *sequence order*
between the distinct elements that would be returned. 

The example I gave before:

I have the following sequence of random numbers:

3, 5, 2, 8, 6, 4, 9, 7, 1, 5, 2, 10, 9, 3

I want to get only the (first occuring) distinct numbers with their ordering
preserved:

3, 5, 2, 8, 6, 4, 9, 7, 1, 10

This could be possible if the distinct-values() function was defined with an
additional argument "preserve-order" (possibly with default value of false).


fn:distinct-values($srcval as xs:anyAtomicType*,
                   $preserve-order as xs:boolean? ) as xs:anyAtomicType*


Cheers,
Dimitre Novatchev.
