Steve:

Thank you for your comment.  The description of the function includes
"All the values must be of a single type or one if its subtypes (for
numeric values, the numeric promotion rules defined in 6.2 Operators on
Numeric Values
<file:///C:\xmlspecs\query\operators\Work\xpath-functions.html#op.numeri
c#op.numeric>  are used to promote all values to a single common type)."

 

Thus, in your first example the two lexical forms have the same value
and the value 1 would be returned.  In your second example, you have two
values that compare equal and the semantics say that it is
implementation dependent which value is returned.

 

All the best, Ashok

Subject: ORA-FO-DISTINCT 15.1.11 fn:distinct-values 

 

Functions and Operators, Section 15.1.11 fn:distinct-values 


What are the type conversion rules ? For example, what is the result of
fn:distinct-values("01", 1) ? 

What is returned from fn:distinct-values(+0, -0) ? 
Is this implementation-defined ? Is this stable ?
