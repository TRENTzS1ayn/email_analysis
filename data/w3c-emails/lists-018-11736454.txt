The 4th paragraph of 11.1 fn:resolve-uri says [1]:

If the $relativeURI is the zero-length string,
returns the value of the base-uri property from
the static context in the first form and $base in
the second form.

The typo is "$relativeURI" should be "$relative".

The minor comment is that this paragraph should say what happens in the 1st case when the base-uri property is not initialized in the static context (like the paragraph above does), i.e., something like:

If the $relative is the zero-length string,
in the first form returns the value of the base-uri
property from the static context if it is defined
(if the base-uri property is not initialized in the
static context an error is raised), in the second form
returns $base.
