Subject: typo and minor comment on fn:resolve-uri

 

The 4th paragraph of 11.1 fn:resolve-uri says [1]: 

        If the $relativeURI is the zero-length string, 
        returns the value of the base-uri property from 
        the static context in the first form and $base in 
        the second form. 

The typo is "$relativeURI" should be "$relative". 

The minor comment is that this paragraph should say what happens in the
1st case when the base-uri property is not initialized in the static
context (like the paragraph above does), i.e., something like:

        If the $relative is the zero-length string, 
        in the first form returns the value of the base-uri 
        property from the static context if it is defined 
        (if the base-uri property is not initialized in the 
        static context an error is raised), in the second form 
        returns $base.
