In a comment on the last draft I queried the result of this function in
the case that the entity had no PUBLIC id.
In your reply you suggested that the text should have an "issue" and that
perhaps () rather than "" should be returned.

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2002Aug/0054.html

I think that the text is unchanged in this draft and I don't see a
specific issue in the document.

I do note that the data model document 
http://www.w3.org/TR/query-datamodel/
does state that () is returned for both dm:unparsed-entity-public-id 
and dm:unparsed-entity-system-id  accessors but that doesn't directly
specify the user accessible functions, I believe.
