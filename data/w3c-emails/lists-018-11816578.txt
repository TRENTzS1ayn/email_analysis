Michael:

Thank you for your comment.  I have looked at the op: functions in
section 6.2 and elsewhere and the semantics do not describe

behavior if the functions are passed ().  I will double check.

All the best, Ashok

Class: Editorial      
 
section 6.2 and others: The operator function signatures do not allow
(), however the actual operators accept (). This mismatch leads to
confusion and should be solved by either adding the semantics for () or
by some other form of consolidation.
