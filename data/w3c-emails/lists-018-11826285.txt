Michael:
I'm not sure exactly what you would like changed.  All 3 functions in 
section 6.3 discuss behavior for NaN arguments.  I think it reads better

this way.  As someone else commented you can come to a function
definition
by following a pointer.  If common semantics are put at the top of the 
section the user can miss it.

All the best, Ashok
