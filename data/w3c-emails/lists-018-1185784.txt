 From section "20.2 XHTML Output Method"

The following is included in the newest version of xslt20:

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=EUC-JP">

 I checked in the definition of XHTML and found no specific indication 
that an "ill" formed "meta" element was a requirement. There are several 
indirect comments that cite the importance of XHTML being valid XML. I 
think XSLT20 should include a requirement that the "meta" element (and 
for that matter all the elements produced by a transform interpreter in 
XHTML output mode) be rendered in a well formed manner. MS seems to 
consistently ignore this aspect of the XHTML definition in their 
products. I hope that the eventual general recommendation for XSLT will 
insist that output produced in XHTML mode be well formed XML.
 
 I can think of a lot of very good reasons to include this requirement. 
I can't think of any "good" reason to allow ill formed XML output. 

Just my two cents worth ... your mileage may vary.
