Steve:

Duplicates are eliminated from the result for op:union(), op:except()
and op:intersect().  For op:union, the two nodes in 

the two sequences are unioned, duplicates eliminated and the result
returned.  

 

For op:except(), the nodes in the first sequence that do not appear in
the second sequence as collected, duplicates

eliminated and the result returned.  If the second argument is the empty
sequence, the first argument, is returned 

after eliminating duplicates.  

 

For op:intersect(), the intersection of the two sequences is computed,
duplicates eliminated and returned.

 

I think the wording in the document is clear.  Please take another look.
If you think it's confusing I can attempt to clarify. 

 

All the best, Ashok

Subject: ORA-FO-EXCEPT 15.2.5 op:except 

 

Functions and Operators, Section 15.2.5 op:except "Constructs a sequence
.... eliminating duplicate nodes" 

If there are duplicates in $parameter1, do they get eliminated ? 
If so, do the duplicates in $parameter1 get eliminated even when
$parameter2 is the empty sequence ? 

What about op:union, op:intersect - are duplicates in one of the input
sequences preserved or eliminated ?
