Steve:
Thank you for your comment!
 
As Mike Kay replied to an earlier note of yours re. passing a sequence
of nodes to fn:sum "You can pass in a sequence of nodes; under the
function
calling rules they will be atomized. The sequence must then consist of
values of a single type."  
See:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jun/0315.html
 
Thus, you can pass a sequence of nodes to fn:max and fn:min.
 

All the best, Ashok

Functions and Operators, Section 15.3.3 fn:max, 15.3.4 fn:min 


Why aren't these defined on nodes ? 
It makes sense to operate on nodes that have simple content.
