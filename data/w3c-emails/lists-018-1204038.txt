In the document "XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language" dated 15 Nov. 2002, 
there is an error in Section 3.5.2 ("General Comparisons"). The section 
contains two bulleted items which should not be present. The two items 
read "a is numeric and a VC fn:number(b) is true", and "b is numeric and 
fn:number(a) VC b is true". These two items should be deleted from the 
XQuery document. They pertain only to "XPath 1.0 compatibility mode", a 
feature of XPath 2.0 that is not used in XQuery.

I apologize for this error.
