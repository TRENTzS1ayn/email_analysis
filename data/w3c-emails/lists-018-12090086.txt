Max,

It seems to me to be a questionable approach to tie serialization of XSLT / 
XQuery / whatever so tightly to a transitional technology - XHTML.

Even if one considers that XHTML has some significant value then one must 
recall that the XHTML 1.0 Rec only defines XHTML documents which consist solely 
of XHTML. The Rec recognises that mixed-namespace documents which include 
elements from the XHTML namespace are also possible but fails to define how they 
are to be structured or handled. 

It seems to me to be wholly inappropriate to tie XSLT 2.0 serialization 
tightly to a narrow, backward-looking definition of XHTML 1.0.

I guess my more fundamental question is "Is an xhtml output method worth 
having?
