The XQuery language May 2 draft does not specify what happens if more than one 
validation declaration is used in the prolog.  Perhaps this is an error, or 
the last one used applies?

Ditto for multiple xmlspace declarations.

(In contrast, multiple default collation declarations are defined to raise an 
error.)
