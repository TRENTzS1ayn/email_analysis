Greetings,

I suggest that you remove Appendix Section A.2 Lexical Structure, for the
following reasons:

  * The XPath EBNF grammar makes the lexical rules redundant.  You shouldn't
     be specifying equivalent things in more than one place.
  * It isn't helpful.  It's hard to believe anyone would write a real lexer this way.
  * It mixes syntax into lexical analysis.  Real implementations may mix them
    for various reasons; specifications should keep them separate for clarity.



Thank you,

jeff kenton
