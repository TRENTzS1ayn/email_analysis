It would be very useful if the value of an XPath predicate expression could be
*a sequence of values* of a numeric type.

Use: Since <xsl:copy-of> can now be used to copy a sequence of items,
it would be excellent if one could write

<xsl:copy-of select="foo[1 to 4]"/>

instead of the more long-winded

<xsl:for-each select="1 to 4">
     <xsl:copy-of select="foo[.]"/>
</xsl:for-each>
