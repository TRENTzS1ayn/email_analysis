Suppose the element Stuff were defined as

   <!ELEMENT Stuff (Thing1, Thing2, ...., Thing99)>

If $aStuff identified a Stuff element node
and $parts contained the sequence ('Thing24', 'Thing27', 'Thing82')

one would be sorely tempted to write  $aStuff/$parts
to get the corresponding sub-elements of the Stuff node

That wouldn't work, but how easy would it be write the necessary expression
(preferably in XPath alone) given $aStuff and $parts?
