Note you could (and can, even in xslt1) do
<xsl:copy select="foo[position() &lt; 5]"/>
to get this effect, which isn't so much more verbose than the to syntax
(which I agree would be nice to have if it could be done without further
complicating the interaction between numeric and boolean valued
predicates)
