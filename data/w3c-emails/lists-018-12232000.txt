Thanks for the suggestion. We're currently looking at a proposal to add
select attributes to a number of instructions that don't currently have
them. xsl:copy is one that I was having difficulty with, because the
semantics could become fairly complex, but we'll bear the suggestion in
mind.

I think one problem with your suggestion is that it's not obvious whether
xsl:copy with a select attribute should change the context node. In your
example it clearly should, but I can think of other examples where this
would be confusing.
