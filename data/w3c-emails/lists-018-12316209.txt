| I have reviewed it, and I'm copying this to the public comments list.
|
| I would like to see the Infoset-only model nevertheless process xsi:type
| attributes as a special case.  This would make it possible for a process
| to serialize information about element types, at least, directly into
| an XML document.

What do you mean? Are you asking that xsi:type attributes be used even
when documents aren't (WXS) schema validated?

| In addition, an xdt:attributeTypes attribute would be a Good Thing:
| this would have list-of-QName type, and would alternate an attribute name
| with its type.

Where would this appear and what function would it serve?

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
