Yes, that is just what I mean.  For example, a document with a DTD could
have xsi:type attributes that are #FIXED, in which case the XPath DM would
be able to process these documents as containing typed data, despite the
absence of a PSVI.  Alternatively, explicit xsi:type attributes could
be inserted either by transformation or by the originating process.

This would appear on an element and would provide the types of other attributes
of this element:

<foo bar="32" baz="94.44"
xdt:attributeTypes="bar xsd:integer baz xsd:double"/>

Again this could be defaulted from the DTD or inserted by transformation.

These two features, plus direct recognition of xsi:nil, would enable an
Infoset-only document to provide all the same information to the DM that
a PSVI-ed document would.
