Just to fill in the gaps here, presumably you're only suggesting that
an XPath 2.0 processor be able to do anything with xsi:type attributes
holding the names of types that it recognises, and that other type
annotations should be ignored?

Also, I assume that you're suggesting that the XPath 2.0 processor
validate the content of the annotated element, such that, for example
<foo xsi:type="xs:integer">rubbish</foo> isn't labelled as being of
type xs:integer. Or are you suggesting that elements be labelled with
types without necessarily being valid against those types?

(The same answers will apply to xdt:attributeTypes, I imagine.)

Thanks,

Jeni
