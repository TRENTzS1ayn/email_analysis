In effect, I think that is achieved by the penultimate paragraph in
3.6, which says that unknown types are to be promoted to xs:anyType or
xs:anySimpleType, as the case may be.

Hmm, that's a point I hadn't considered.  It's formally messy, because
there is no formal definition of type validity in the DM -- it can
delegate to the XML Schema documentation for that.  OTOH, asking an XPath
processor to cope with examples like that is more than a bit awkward.

Indeed.
