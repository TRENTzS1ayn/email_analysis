If you just want the ability to have an instance document be decorated with 
xsi:type attributes to indicate the types, in the absence of a schema, you 
can do that, but you have to either (1) ask an XML Schema processor to 
create the PSVI for the document and map that into the data model, or (2) 
find some proprietary processor that builds the desired data model instance 
from scratch. I think either is feasible using our current documents.

To a DTD-only processor, though, the xsi:type attribute will always be just 
an attribute, and there's no place to put type information in the output of 
a DTD-only processor, since it is just an Infoset.

As a thought experiment, suppose you wanted to support a schema language 
that allowed just DTDs plus XML Schema simple types. If you write an XML 
processor for that language, you could have the processor create data model 
instances directly, or it could have some intermediate format, the map from 
the intermediate format to the data model instance.
