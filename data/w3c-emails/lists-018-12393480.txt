I may have been unclear. I assumed that you understood that section, and 
are of course an expert on the Infoset. What I was trying to clarify was 
not the mapping itself, but the justification for that mapping - that we 
are trying to be literal and avoid creativity.

To me, the Infoset-only mapping in our document needs to be consistent with 
the standard definition of XML. There are many ways we could decide to 
doctor an Infoset or reinterpret it, and I think this is a dangerous path 
to go down for mappings defined in our specifications.

On the other hand, we give plenty of flexibility for an implementation to 
create data model instances without using our PSVI or Infoset mappings.
