In fact the conformance rules (which will probably be rather clearer in the
next draft) say that you can construct a data model any way you like. So if
you want to write a processor that starts with XML decorated with
my:magic-type-annotation attributes, and turns these into type annotations
in nodes in a data model, you are perfectly free to do so. The only thing we
require is that the data model you provide as input to the XSLT/XQuery
processor should satisfy some consistency rules, for example the values of
nodes must be consistent with their type annotations.
