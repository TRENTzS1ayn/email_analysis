Well, if I understand Norm correctly, xsi:nil is to be interpreted in
Infoset-only processing in any event, and it doesn't seem to me too much
of a stretch to require the interpretation of xsi:type as well.  These
attributes are nicely Schema-compatible and aren't likely to be used in
the incoming XML for any other purpose, and they do provide rough parity
between Schemaful and Schemaless processing that does not currently exist.
xdt:attributeTypes *is* more of a stretch, but adding it provides completeness
at small cost if xsi:type is in.

IOW, I don't think the slope is all that slippery.

I acknowledge that, but I want something that implementations will provide,
by making it a standard part of XPath processing, rather than something an
idiosyncratic implementation might provide.
