Hmmm.

If I understand Norm correctly, Elliotte Rusty Harold was asking for that, 
but Norm wasn't. Norm, was that something that you support?

At any rate, the current mappings do not support *any* W3C XML-Schema 
semantics in the Infoset-only mapping. I do think this is a slippery slope, 
and I wouldn't support it. In effect, both you and Elliotte are asking that 
we support the syntax of XML 1.x, but change the semantics by adding some 
pieces that each of you like.

But it's not just XPath, is it? Suppose the path expression were issued 
from the DOM, wouldn't you like those types to be available in the DOM 
representation as well? Personally, I would like to see a small, simple way 
to add datatypes to documents governed by DTDs, but I would also like to 
see it be part of general XML processing, not something used to doctor up 
documents just before they are queried, and not recognized by the rest of 
my XML tools.

I think that XPath should operate on the data given it by the XML specs. 
What you want makes sense, but this is the wrong place in the processing 
stack to try to do it in a standard way.
