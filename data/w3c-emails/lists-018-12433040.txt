That's pretty much what Namespaces does, too: certain attributes get magic
values that effect the understandings about other attributes and elements.

1) DOM is getting an XPath (1.0) module, and may some day get XPath 2.0 as well.

2) The best is the enemy of the good.  There is a lot of grass-roots opposition
to requiring a PSVI (or Schema processing generally); providing this relatively
modest addition to the Infoset will help deflate that.

Or schemaless (lower-case s) documents generally.
