No. xsi:nil is not specially handled by the infoset processor. 

I think any attempt to have xsi: attributes creep into well-formed
document should not be done and not be driven by the XQuery/XPath
datamodel. If we are not allowed to remove stuff from the infoset after
validation, we should not start changing the meaning of well-formed XML.

I think this slope is so slippery that I think everyone that goes that
path will break his neck.

Best regards
Michael
