1. The XQuery WG does not own the Infoset. The Core WG does (as you
should know). If we core would add this, it could only do so as part of
a new version of XML (not that I would like that).

2. xsi:nil is one of the worst feature of XML Schema (not necessarily
some of the concept, but the actual way it was done). Especially its
interaction with lists or complex content where you specify minoccurs=0
and defaults etc. Moving this into the data model/infoset implicitly
would be a reason for me to stay with true XML 1.0.

3. I don't think that this "modest addition" will help deflate the
PSVI-fears. It will add to it in my opinion. Others will want to add
user-derived simple/atomic types and it will lead a creeping muddling of
the boundaries.

4. A type annotated infoset can be supported by the XPath/XQuery data
model if a body with authority or enough support from the
market/community defines one. It is not part of the charter or the
requirements of the XQuery/XPath/XSLT groups to define one.
