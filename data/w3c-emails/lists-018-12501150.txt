That may be, but it isn't what 3.6 says:

# If the expanded-QName that results from this derivation is not available
# in the processor's In-Scope Schema Definitions, the expanded-QName
# is promoted to xs:anyType for elements or xs:anySimpleType for
# attributes. This can occur, for example, if the processor does not
# support the schema import feature or if it was unable to import the
# necessary schema.

Based on the indentation, this clause is in effect whether PSVI typing
is available or not.

As Jeni notes in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jun/0035.html ,
processors already have to do datatype validation to support union types
and casts.
