I'm sorry that this one got overlooked in the last round. I've now raised it
as XSLT issue #158. Thanks for raising it again.

I think that the text is unchanged in this draft and I don't see a specific
issue in the document.

I do note that the data model document 
http://www.w3.org/TR/query-datamodel/
does state that () is returned for both dm:unparsed-entity-public-id 
and dm:unparsed-entity-system-id  accessors but that doesn't directly
specify the user accessible functions, I believe.
