Clarification please John.
If I'm transforming a well formed instance, no schema,
I'm going to find the output decorated with data type information;
that wasn't there in any original DTD that may have been used
to develop these instances?

And presumably which might then fail  validation on receipt
by another business if the document type is re-introduced?

Gratuitous decoration isn't my idea of fun for those who
don't want/need it.

regards DaveP.
