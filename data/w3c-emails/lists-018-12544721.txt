/ "Dare Obasanjo" <dareo@microsoft.com> was heard to say:
| This seems like a horrible idea. I sincerely hope the the working
| group does not alter the data model in such a short sighted manner
| which unnecesarily tightly couples it to W3C XML Schema while adding
| a heedless burden on implementers.

Another WG member pointed out in private mail that I may be mistaken about
our consensus position. My apologies.

I'll move this issue back into the "technical" pile and see what
happens.

BTW, cross-posting to xml-dev and public-qt-comments is probably a bad idea.
I've sent this message as two separate posts to remove the cross-post.
