/ Jonathan Robie <jonathan.robie@datadirect-technologies.com> was heard to say:
| As a thought experiment, suppose you wanted to support a schema
| language that allowed just DTDs plus XML Schema simple types. If you
| write an XML processor for that language, you could have the processor
| create data model instances directly, or it could have some
| intermediate format, the map from the intermediate format to the data
| model instance.

It may be worth pointing out that we decided in Gaithersburg to make
Section 3.6 of the data model informative rather than normative. You
can build a data model any way you darn well please provided that you
don't voilate its constraints.

So, in fact, I don't think there's anything preventing an implementor
from making a processor that recognizes xsi:type and xsi:nil even in
the absence of a schema and builds a data model accordingly.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
