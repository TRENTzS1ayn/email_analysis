| Well, if I understand Norm correctly, xsi:nil is to be interpreted in
| Infoset-only processing in any event, and it doesn't seem to me too much

As I said earlier today, I'm not sure we have consensus on xsi:nil
processing. But I had been persuaded (mostly by Jeni, as I recall) to
believe that we should get nilled from the PSVI property not the
attribute, so we would not support it in the infoset-only case.

                                        Be seeing you,
