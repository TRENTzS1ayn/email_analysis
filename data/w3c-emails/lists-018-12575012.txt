Ghaack! I said exactly the opposite of what I meant. Or read what John
said in exactly the opposite sense, or something.

That's *not* what I meant. I meant that xsi:nil should be recognized only
from the PSVI property, not from the literal attribute value.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
