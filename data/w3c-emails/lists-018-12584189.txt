| | In my previous posting, archived at 
| | http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003May/0169.html ,
| | I forgot to mention that xsi:nil should also be recognized directly
| | from the Infoset.
|
| Yes, thank you. That's been pointed out several times and was, in
| fact, supposed to be fixed before the LC draft, but somehow I missed
| it.

Sorry folks, the preceding paragraph says exactly the *opposite* of
what I meant. I think I misread the last word of John's last sentence
as "PSVI" not "Infoset". It must be because they have so many letters
in common :-/

I have been persuaded that the current data model text *incorrectly*
references the "xsi:nil" attribute information item. It should only
refer to the PSVI [nil] property.

A thousand apologies for the confusion. And a thousand more for the
screams of outrage I fear this correction will incite. :-/

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
