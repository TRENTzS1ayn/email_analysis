In the May 2 language draft, in the definition of typeswitch (3.12.2, 
paragraph 4), the explanation of variable types does not make sense for the 
default clause:

"Within the return expression of the case or default clause, this variable 
name is bound to the value of the operand expression, and its static type is 
considered to be the SequenceType named in the case or default clause."

But, the default clause has no sequence type.
