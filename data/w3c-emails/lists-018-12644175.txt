Over the next couple of days (and potentially weeks), I will be
forwarding feedback from our internal review of the last call documents.

 

The feedback will normally be sent as one posting per issue, although
sometimes issues belonging to the same section may be sent in a single
mail. An issue that spans more than one area in the spec will normally
only be sent once.

 

For easier reference, I will number the issues and provide an indication
whether we consider it to be technical or editorial. 

 

Sometimes, we may even provide a proposed solution.

 

Best regards

Michael
