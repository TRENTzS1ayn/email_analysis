Section 1.6 Notation says:

Some functions accept the empty sequence as an argument and some may
return the empty sequence. This is indicated in the function signature
by following the parameter or return type name with a question mark: "?"

Please add

 

or with a star: "*"

 

You also may want to explain that ? means empty or one and * means empty
or many.
