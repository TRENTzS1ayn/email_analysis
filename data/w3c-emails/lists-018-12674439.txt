First sentence in 5.1 Constructor Functions for XML Schema built-in
types says:

 

Every built-in atomic type that is defined in [XML Schema Part 2:
Datatypes] <http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-operators/#schema2#schema2> ,
except xs:NOTATION, as well as xdt:untypedAtomic and the two derived
types xdt:yearMonthDuration and xdt:dayTimeDuration defined in this
specification, has an associated constructor function

 


The "as well as" part can be misread. Please rewrite to:

 

 

Every built-in atomic type defined in [XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes]
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-operators/#schema2#schema2> , except
xs:NOTATION, has an associated constructor function; as do the following
types defined in this specification:  xdt:untypedAtomic,
xdt:yearMonthDuration and xdt:dayTimeDuration.
