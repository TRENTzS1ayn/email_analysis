Most functions operating on a class of types has an indented
representation of the type hierarchy.

 

This representation is confusing (especially if printed with varying
page widths) and does not give much information. Since the type
hierarchy is given earlier, it would suffice to give the most general
types on which the functions and operators operate instead of repeating
the hierarchy.

 

Proposed solution: Only list most general types.
