I held a series of reviews with colleagues in Software AG last week. The
original purpose of these reviews was to collate comments on the two
documents in the XQuery suite that have reached "last call" status. 

We decided to stick to big issues rather than a detailed search for bugs in
the specs. Inevitably some of these cross document boundaries, and some of
them are not very directly relevant to the two documents that are on last
call. However, I will raise all the comments in a series of separate mail
items on the public comments list, to put our views on the record.

The overall thrust of the comments is that we believe that it is both
necessary and possible to reduce the size and complexity of the current
specifications.
