Software AG does not believe that there is any good reason to include
fn:trace() in the core function library.

We already have diagnostic features in our product that are much more
sophisticated and usable than the proposed fn:trace() function. We do not
have a sensible way of implementing fn:trace() in our product architecture,
and we believe that as a result of query optimization, the output is likely
to be unintelligible to most users.

We see no need for diagnostic capabilities to be standardised. This should
be an area that is left entirely to implementors to add value.

We recommend that the fn:trace() function should be dropped, or at least
marked as optional.
