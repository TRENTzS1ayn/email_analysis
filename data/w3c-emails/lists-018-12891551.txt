Section 4.3.2 of the data model document does not appear to reflect the
decisions of the working group in relation to mixed content: specifically,
that the type of an element declared as having mixed content should be the
string value, as an instance of xdt:untypedAtomic.

The correct rules are stated in section 4.1.6. It is not clear why 4.3.2
attempts to restate the same rules in a different way. In fact, the overall
structure of section 4, which presents the same accessor functions organized
first by function and then by the kind of node that they apply to, seems
designed to lead to inconsistencies of this kind.
