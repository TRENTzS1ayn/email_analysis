Hi

http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#d0e165
"The term stylesheet reflects the fact that one of the important roles 
of XSLT is to add styling information to an XML source document, by 
transforming it into a document consisting of XSL formatting objects 
(see [XSL Formatting Objects]), or into another presentation-oriented 
format such as HTML, XHTML, or SVG."

Current versions of HTML/XHTML are (luckily) only marginally concerned 
with presentation, but mainly with structure and semantics.
(Future versions hopefully and most likely will be purely about 
semantics and structure.)

So I suggest to change the text, and to not list HTML and XHTML as 
"presentation-oriented format"s.

BTW, instead of URLs like
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#d0e165 , I'd prefer more meaningful URLs like
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#what_is_xslt
