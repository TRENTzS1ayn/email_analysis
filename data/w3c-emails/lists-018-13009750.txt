Dave, I think if you want your comments on the public-qt-comments list to be
taken seriously, then you should summarize the problem a little more
carefully, and explain in full English sentences what action you would like
to be taken, rather that simply cross-posting a reply to a thread conducted
on a different list.

There have been a number of requests for introductory or "primer"
information, and the working group has generally declined these - it's
something that's much more efficiently done by individuals. There would be a
great danger that it simply added yet more pages to the growing pile, which
many people already find uncomfortably large.
