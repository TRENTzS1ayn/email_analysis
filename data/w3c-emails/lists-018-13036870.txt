As an aside, in the customisation of the xmlspec stylesheets used for
the mathml spec I modified the code to use xsl:number rather than
generate-id for generating html ids when no id is given in the source.
so you end up with things like
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#id.5.3.2
for section 5.3.2.

If thinking of names for all sections in all the xslt/xquery documents
is too burdensome this might be an option for you as well (or for the
default xmlspec stylesheets).

Actually I have thought about _always_ using this form even if there is
an id in the source so that you can tell the URI ref to a section just
from looking at the displayed document rather than having to view the
source to find the internal ID.
