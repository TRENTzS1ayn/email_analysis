Dear Jeni
 

Thank you very much for your review of the F&O document. The functions
and
operators taskforce reviewed your request to provide a function
fn:type()
and after carefully consideration of the arguments in favor and against
decided to not add such a function at this time. The main reasons for
not including the function now were presented by Michael Kay in [1] and
[2]. However, we will consider such functionality for a future version
of the recommendation.
