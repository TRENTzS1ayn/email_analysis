Dear Tobi:

Thank you for you comments on the F&O documents on May 2, 2003.   The
F&O taskforce discussed your comments on the 5/29 telcon and concluded
that there was insufficient motivation for adding another function to
test for value equality of nodes in addition to vendee-equal.  We agree
that other definitions for value equality of nodes are possible but
there is not another single definition which obviously needs to be added
to the document.  Also, users can write functions for the flavor of node
equality they desire.

Please let us know whether you agree with this response.

All the best, 
Ashok Malhotra on behalf of the F&O taskforce
