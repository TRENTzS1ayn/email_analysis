Forget that, I think item()* is available for that use.

Hoever at the beginning of 9.1 it says

  If the as attribute is omitted, the supplied value of the variable is
  used directly, and no conversion takes place. The effect is the same as
  if the type were specified as item()*. 

which is misleading as it implies that omitting as= is the same as
specifying as="item()*" which isn't true for xsl:variable, as explained
in 9.3.
