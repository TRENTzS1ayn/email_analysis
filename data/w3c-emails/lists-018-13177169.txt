Hi Ashok, hi F&O taskforce

Thank you very much for your reply, and for having discussed the issue.
(more below)

I really appreciate the fact that XSLT and related WGs are quite 
communicative.

Which function are you referring to with "vendee-equal"?

I guess you mean that there will be no fn:node-equal()?

I can live with it :)

I hope that an initiative like EXSLT will design and specify a 
comprehensive library of useful functions for XSLT 2, which can be 
implemented natively by XSLT processors (not written in XSLT, but in the 
  language the processor is written in, eg C++ or Java).
