... if the W3C doesn't.

If still hope that the W3C will (continue to) design, grow, and specify 
a comprehensive standard library, required for conformance for all 
implementations or only for a specific category of implementations (the 
latter would be acceptable for me).

Initiatives like EXSLT then can provide additional facilities, which 
might be regarded by some as less general or less widely applicable, or 
which are prototypes of candidates for future versions of XSLT and 
related languages.
