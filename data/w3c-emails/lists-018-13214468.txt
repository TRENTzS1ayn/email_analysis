I sent this privately to one of the editors, but am sending it
here as an official last call comment from the WAI so it gets
addressed.


Also, in his reply Ashok indicated to me that the group was
thinking  of getting rid of the nested HTML lists that show type
hierarchy relations in later sections, please do not do this as
it would make your specification document even more inaccessible.

Finally WAI --we may want to point the QA group at these kinds of
issues where type hierarchy and other technical information get
buried in a diagram in a specification document, I think that is
just a bad idea in general.



Details:

 section 1.2 contains a diagram for the type hierarchy --but fails
 to spell out the hierarchy outside of the diagram.
 
 It does pretend to be a good access citizen in that it explains
 the notation used in the diagram; however this is inadequate for
 someone wishing to get at the content.
 
 Could you:
 
 A) provide me witht he missing content,
 and
 B) ensure that the next working draft fixes the problem?
 
 What I'm looking for is a textual summary of the type hierarchy
 --set of nested html lists would do fine.
