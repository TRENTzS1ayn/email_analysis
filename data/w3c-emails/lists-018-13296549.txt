Let me try again.
11.6, the example, shows xsl:namespace as a standalone,
possibly a top level element, same status as xsl:variable.

As we appear to agree,  it must (somehow)
be wrapped in an element, literal or xsl:element.

The example, on that basis, is unclear, as an example.
Your use of a called template is noted, hence my phrasing was wrong.

2.
quote.Note the restrictions described in 5.6.1 Constructing Complex Content
for the position of a namespace node relative to other nodes in the node
sequence returned by a sequence constructor. unquote.

The list at 5.6.1 reads, to me, as quite unconnected with the position of a
ns node,
simply noting what happens when two with same name are used.
