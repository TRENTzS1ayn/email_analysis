What *should* be the result of applying 
xsl:xpath-default-namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"

as in 
 <xsl:template match="template"
default-xpath-namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

<xsl:value-of select="value-of/@select"/>

I'd expect it to provide the result of the select attribute
of a template.


It appears not to be explictly forbidden by the WD.
Equally, it could be useful for self documented stylesheets?
