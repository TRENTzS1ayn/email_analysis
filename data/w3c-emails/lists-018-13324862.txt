This addressed at the bottom of the paragraph following the second table
in 6.2, which says:

"As far as possible, the promotions should be done in a single step.
Specifically, when a decimal is promoted to a double, it must not be
converted to a float and then to double, as this risks loss of
precision."

All the best, Ashok
