Thanks for the clarification.

Shouldn't the text in F&O 6.2 be changed to the same as in Appendix B of 
[XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language] then? ie:

" 2. Type promotion: xs:decimal may be promoted to either xs:float or
xs:double, and xs:float may be promoted to xs:double." ?

Was this correct?

Thanks again,

Caroline
