The specification makes it clear that xsl:namespace is an instruction,
therefore it must appear in places where instructions are allowed.

I agree that an example that shows the use of this instruction in-context
might be more helpful.

List item 4 in section 5.6.1 is concerned with the order of nodes:

an attribute node. This is a recoverable error...
