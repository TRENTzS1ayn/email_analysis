Dave, please see

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jun/0145.html

"Alternatives

There are various solutions specific to the problem described in the

underlying general issue."

The solution described in

does not work if the processor chooses to abort the transformation 
(conformant), as David C. states in the very same text.
