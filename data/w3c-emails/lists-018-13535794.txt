I agree with Mike. We should not use ** because no semantics is
associated with it.

I don't think we should use a non-XPath operator "**" and expect people
to guess what it means.

Thanks, Michael. You asked:

2 to the

Following text contains the phrase:

"where Emin is the smallest possible xs:float or xs:double
exponent."

I think this addresses your concern.

All the best, Ashok
