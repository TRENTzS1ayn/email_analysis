The example in section 3.7.2.3 of the XQuery May 2 draft appears to contain an 
error (missing curly braces): It should be

document
   {
      <author-list>
         { doc("bib.xml")//book/author }
      </author-list>
   }

It is not a syntax error without these, but then the path will be included 
verbatim instead of executing it as an embedded expression.
