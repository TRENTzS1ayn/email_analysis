I should add that the example will result in an error, since the doc() 
function returns a document node and document nodes are disallowed in element 
content (section 3.2.7.1, second rule numbered 1).

Also, the two computed element constructor examples in section 3.2.7.1 that 
compute the name are both type errors:

element
   {node-name($e)}
   {$e/@*, 2 * data($e)}

(which has been reported previously) because node-name() returns an xs:QName? 
instead of an xs:QName, and also

  element 
    {$dict/entry[word=name($e)]/variant[lang="Italian"]}
    {$e/node()}

(which returns an element instead of xs:QName).

Either the examples need to be corrected to match the rules, or else the rules 
need to be corrected to match the examples (possibly by applying atomization 
to the name expression).
