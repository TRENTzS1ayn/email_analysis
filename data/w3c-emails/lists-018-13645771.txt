Mike quoted an example of a mismatch between xquery and xslt requirements.
Its my belief that the split point, xquery and xslt, is way too far down,
i.e. too much is lumped together as being common, too little is either 
query or xslt. The architecture of that split appeared when someone
determined
that there was commonality, true, but the split point appears badly designed
IMO.
I remain totally unconvinced that the area of common need is anywhere near
as
large as is currently posited by the design.

As usual, I'll quote the typing as the most gross error.
Apparently needed in query, certainly not in XSLT.
