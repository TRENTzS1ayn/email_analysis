Hello,

I'd like to make two stylistic but important points
about the 2 May 2003 draft of XSLT 2.0 [1].

1) Some words are underlined but are not links. In the context
   of the Web, this can be confusing. I recommend that some
   other convention be used to emphasize those words. Some
   examples are "doc" or "collection".

2) I noted in 2.2 Notation that "An attribute is required
   if and only if its name is in bold." For accessibility
   reasons, please do not rely on style alone to convey
   information, especially normative information. Someone
   listening to the document read as synthesized speech is
   likely to miss this. 

   It's fine to highlight required attributes by using
   bold text, or colors, for example. But there needs to 
   (also) be a indication in text. 

   One suggestion is that in the appendix C, before 
   "Permitted parent elements", include a line 
   "Required attributes: a, b, c"

Thank you,

 _ Ian
