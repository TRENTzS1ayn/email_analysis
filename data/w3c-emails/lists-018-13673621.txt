In principle both XPath and XQuery are capable of determining which
documents from a given collection of documents satisfy some condition.
XQuery differs from XPath in that it has richer capabilities for defining
the criteria.
 
In practice, the XPath and XQuery specifications speak of a "collection" of
documents at a very abstract level. Whether this collection can be mapped to
a set of documents in an operating system folder or directory depends on the
implementation. Many implementations are likely to work only on documents
that have been preloaded into a database. You are asking about product
features which have quite deliberately been left outside the scope of the
language specification.

Hello all.
I?m new at XQuery and XPath and I?m not clear about how it works.
 
I have a set of xml documents in a directory and I need to select the
documents that satisfy a condition from a Java application. For example, to
select all documents whose node Name was 'John'. I don?t want to use any
kind of database. 
So, is it possible to make this query with XPath?. Can only XPath use to
make a query to one document or can it make querys to a set of documents?.
Should I use XQuery?.
Thanks in advance. 
 
 Noem?
