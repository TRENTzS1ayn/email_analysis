I think the data typing is needed when handling structured data
applications, and is not needed (much) when handling narrative text.

Many people seem to be under the impression that XQuery is designed to
handle data and XSLT is designed to handle text. This is not the case. Both
languages have explicit requirements to handle the full spectrum of XML
applications.
