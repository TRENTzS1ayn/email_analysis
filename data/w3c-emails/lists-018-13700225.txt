Hi Michael,

Thank you for the explanation. I apologize if I missed an
explanatory note to that effect.

Thank you for your consideration. One other approach
would be to use the word "required" in the prose description
of the meaning of the attribute. For instance, in 16.3.1:

 "The required name attribute specifies the name of the key."

or

 "The name attribute (required) specifies the name of the key."
