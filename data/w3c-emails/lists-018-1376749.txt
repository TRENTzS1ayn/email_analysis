I'd agree that a version attribute would be more versatile if there was
anything much that could be done for later xhtml variants but I suspect
that is not the case.  If you have an xhtml2 document using nested
<section elements, xforms, linking using hlink (or xlink) etc, then some
serialisation tricks like putting a space before "/>" aren't really going
to make the thing render in netscape 4. 

xhtml 1 (.0) is explictly designed to be able to work in legacy browsers
by using the lax error checking of html parsers, and it's useful to have
an xslt output type that uses the compatability guidelines to generate
xhtml1 in that style.

Conversely xhtml2 is (as I understand it) trying to have as little as
possible magic html rules and so the xml output method should really
be enough (although adding th eencoding info to the head would perhaps
still be useful)
