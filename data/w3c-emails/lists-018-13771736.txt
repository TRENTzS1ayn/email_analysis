DN-FO-07: 15.1.9 fn:exists

There are two issues with this function:

1.  The function name does not accurately reflect its semantic ? it does
not provide an answer if a
          sequence exists, but if a sequence is non-empty.

2.  This is a synonym for:

                    $srcval[1]

          and does not add any new functionality.

 Suggested solution:
Change the name to more precisely reflect the semantics (e.g. non-empty())
and/or consider removing this
function from the document.
