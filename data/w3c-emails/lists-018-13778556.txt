DN-FO-08: 15.1.10 fn:distinct-nodes

This function is of little use because:
 ?The order in which the distinct nodes are returned is implementation
dependent?.

The programmer will not be able to find the answer to the following two
questions:

1.  Which nodes and in what order are exactly returned?
2.  What should we do if we need to preserve order in the result?

Suggested solution:
Change the semantics of the function to return each first in document order
node having a distinct value (e.g. the EXSLT definition of
set:distinct() ).
