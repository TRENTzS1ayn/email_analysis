DN-FO-13: 15.1.15 fn:unordered

There are two issues withthis function:

 1. The description is completely confusing. It is not specified what
    the function returns and the definition is
    very imprecise:
    ?This function takes a sequence or more typically, an expression,
    that evaluates to a sequence, and indicates that the result
    sequence may be returned in any order.?

 2. Is ?an expression, that evaluates to a sequence? a separate datatype in
Xpath/Xquery 2.0?

Suggested solution:
1. Explain precisely what the function does, what it returns and
         why/when it might be useful.
2. Consider removing this function from the document.
