DN-FO-14: 15.2.1 fn:deep-equal

The definition of this function is wrong:

?If either node has attributes, and if either node has an attribute that is
not deep-equal to an attribute of the other node, using the selected
collation, then the result is false.?

According to this definition any two elements with two attributes each ar
not deep-equal.


Suggested solution:
Replace the above excerpt with:

?If either node has attributes, and if either node has an attribute
       that is not deep-equal to any attribute of the other node, using
       the selected collation, then the result is false.?
