DN-FO-15: 15.2.2 fn:sequence-node-identical

There are two issues with this function:

1. The name is misleading. The name suggests that the function
   will return a sequence of the corresponding nodes in two
   sequences, which (the nodes) are identical.


2. Incorrect definition:

   ?Returns the empty sequence if one or both of its arguments
   is the empty sequence.?

   This is not correct. If:

              $seq1 = () and $seq2= (someItem)

   a programmer would expect  (what seems more intuitive) that:

             sequence-node-identical($seq1, $seq2) = false

   It is not clear why it is necessary to use three-valued logic with this
function.


Suggested solution:

1. Correct the name to better reflect the semantics of the function.

2. Simplify the semantics by using two-valued logic.
