DN-FO-16: 15.3 Aggregate Functions

max() and min() are given the following explanation in the ?Meaning? column
of the table introducing all aggregate functions:

?Returns the member with maximum/minimum value from
a collection of comparable objects?

This is probably an error, since all function operate on sequences and not
on ?collections?.


Suggested solution:

Replace ?collection? with ?sequence? in the above text.
