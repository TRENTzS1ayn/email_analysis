Being able to have fn:distinct-values return the values
implementation-dependent provides for better performance for this often
performance critical operation. Thus I would be strongly against
mandating an order.

If you need to preserve order you have the following options:

- Write your own function that does so
- Lobby your favorite vendor to provide the functionality
- Lobby for the next version of XQuery/XPath to provide this
functionality.

In order to do any of the last two, you would need to provide some
compelling use cases.

Best regards
Michael
