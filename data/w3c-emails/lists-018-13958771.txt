Actually I think your reformulation suffers the same ambiguity as the
original: it's not clear whether it means "A has an attribute that is (not
deep-equal) to some attribute of B" or "A has an attribute that is not
(deep-equal to some attribute of B)".

I think we need to get pedantic:

"If either node has attributes, and if either node has an attribute A such
that the other node does not have an attribute that is deep-equal to A,
using the selected collation, then the result is false."

The initial "If either node has attributes, and" is of course redundant.
