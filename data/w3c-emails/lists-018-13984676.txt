Dear WG,

The substring-after specification mentions "the first occurrence of a
string that is equal to the value of $operand2".  However, for some
collations (e.g., those ignoring combining diacritical marks) there
could be multiple substrings of $operand1 that start with the same
character but have different lengths and that are all equal to
$operand2.  It is not clear which of these substrings is the "first"
one.  You should specify whether the shortest or the longest such
substring should be used.
