The XML Query Requirements includes a Usage Scenarios section which
mentions being able to process all of "human readable documents",
"data-oriented documents" and "mixed-model documents".  And Section "XML
Query Functionality" outlines the requirements to be able to operate on
both Schema types and text values.

I do not know how someone could have drawn the conclusion:

if they had actually read the XML Query Requirements as quoted above.

Maybe this perception is caused more by the implementation profile for
early XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 implementations.  But this is not
something that is under our control.
