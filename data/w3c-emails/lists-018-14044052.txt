There is always a danger of course that users will discover that some
implementations return results in a predictable and useful order, and become
locked-in to this behavior.

There are definitely arguments both ways on this one. One approach would be
to define the order that distinct-values returns, and advise people to wrap
it in a call of unordered() if they don't depend on this order. But that's
not a perfect solution either.

XSLT users, of course, can always use for-each-group in which the ordering
is well defined.
