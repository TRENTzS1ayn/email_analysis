I agree that this is missing. I think that in other documents we use a
phrase such as "consistent for the duration of a query or transformation",
which reflects the intent.

Who can say what the lifetime of an instance is?

I think the "In other words" is wrong. The second sentence is saying
something quite different from the first; it is saying that although it's
implementation-defined whether nodes from document D precede or follow nodes
from document E, they are never going to be intermingled.
