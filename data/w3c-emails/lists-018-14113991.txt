  My Oracle colleagues and I have been reviewing the Data Model and F&O 
Last Call documents.
  I will be posting Oracle's comments following a similar format to 
Microsoft and Software AG, one comment per e-mail message.
  I will make an effort not to post comments that have already been 
posted, and to cross-reference similar comments.
