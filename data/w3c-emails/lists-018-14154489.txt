*Data Model, **Section 1, Introduction. *The distinction between data 
model and value in the second paragraph is good, but I think a third 
concept should also be introduced and given a name. This third concept 
is the set of all values currently under consideration during the 
execution of some processor (XSLT, XQuery, etc.) using the data model. A 
possible name for this concept is "data set". Thus the three concepts are:

"data model" - the abstract framework specified by this specification
"data set" - a concrete realization of the data model at a particular 
point in the execution of a processor
"value" - a value in a data set.
