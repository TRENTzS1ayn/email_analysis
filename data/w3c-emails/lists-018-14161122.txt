*Data Model, Section 4. Nodes. *It seems that a node is similar to, but 
not exactly the same as, an information item, as found in the Infoset 
recommendation and enhanced with the PSV contributions in the XML Schema 
Part 1 recommendation. It would be helpful to say this explicitly, 
especially since you share the term "property" with the Infoset, so it 
is easy to form the impression that a node is simply an information 
item. The reader who starts with this impression is then left wondering 
where the properties not found in the Infoset came from (for example, 
the document-uri property of the document node).

In addition, it would be helpful to specify your general conventions for 
nodes here at the beginning. For example, each node consists of a list 
of named properties. In the Infoset, a property may be "unknown" or "no 
value", but in this specification, those values are not used, and 
instead you say a property may be "empty", even if it is not a collection.

Suggestion: The Data Model document might be well advised to include an 
appendix describing the relationships between Data Model properties and 
the Infoset information items and the PSVI, just as the XPath 1.0 spec 
did for its data model

(We are aware of the Processing Model work and its relationship to this 
comment).
