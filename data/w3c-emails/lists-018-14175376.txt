*Data Model, Section 4.1.6* says:

/"If the node is an element node with type xs:anyType, then its typed 
value is equal to its string value, as an instance of xdt:untypedAtomic."/

But *Data Model, Section 4.3.2* says: /"If the element node's type is 
xs:anyType, the dm:typed-value accessor returns the node's string value 
as xs:anySimpleType"/

This seems to be contradictory.
