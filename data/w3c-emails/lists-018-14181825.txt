*Data Model, Section 3.3* /"Schema-validated documents include documents 
in which some elements or attributes have been validated by "lax" or 
"skip" validation."/

This sentence probably means "a document is considered to be 
Schema-validated if it has been validated against a Schema even if, as 
part of that validation, some elements or attributes have been validated 
by 'lax' or 'skip' validation".
But it can be read as "if a document has had one element validated using 
'skip' validation, then that's sufficient for it be treated as a 
'Schema-validated document' ".
