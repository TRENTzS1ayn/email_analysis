*Data Model, Section 3.4*
What is the namespace for an anonymous type name ?
Can it be the result of an expression ?
Does it need to come from a schema ?
What is legal in an anonymous type name ?

Michael Rys addressed this question in

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003May/0305.html 
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003May/0291.html> 
by saying that "Since the name is not exposed and thus the format used 
by an implementation not testable, any such definition would be vacuous 
and not testable or enforceable."

So, is it the Working Groups position that there are no rules at all 
governing anonymous type names ? If so, please add text to that effect.
