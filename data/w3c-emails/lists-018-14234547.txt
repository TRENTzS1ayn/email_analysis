Since the node represents the document information item and we call it
document in the type system it is probably better to call it document
node. "Root node" is often interpreted as the top-level element node in
a document and thus not a good choice.

 

Best regards

Data Model, Section 4.2.1 says "Document nodes and XPath 1.0 root nodes
are essentially identical." 
If these terms are identical, why invent another term ? 
If they are not identical, it would be good to have some indication of
the differences here. 
And if we must have another term, why call it a "document node" ? This
will naturally be confused with the "document element", which in XPath
1.0 is the child of the root node.
