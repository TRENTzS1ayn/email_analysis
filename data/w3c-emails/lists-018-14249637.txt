*Data Model, Section 5* says:

/"The typed value of nodes whose type is unknown (for instance because 
they have not been validated) are labeled with the type xs:anySimpleType."/

This should say "... labeled with the type xs:anySimpleType or 
xs:anyType" to be consistent with *Data Model, Section 3.4 6th paragraph*
