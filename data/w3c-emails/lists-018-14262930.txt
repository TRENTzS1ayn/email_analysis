The term "fragment" is used inconsistently throughout the Data Model 
specification, appearing sometimes in the phrases "document fragment" 
and "data model fragment".

The authoritative definition appears to be in section 4 "Nodes", second 
para:
"A tree whose root node is some other kind of node [ie, not a document 
node] is referred to as a fragment".
In view of this definition, the term "document fragment" appears to be 
an oxymoron.

The phrase "data model fragment" appears to be used to mean something 
more general than this definition of "fragment".
For example, Appendix A, "XML Information Set Conformance" first para:
"The following information items must be exposed by the infoset producer 
to construct a data model fragment:...".
In point of fact, the listed information items are equally necessary to 
support documents and not just fragments (note the definition says that 
fragments and documents are mutually exclusive, not that fragments are a 
superset including documents).
