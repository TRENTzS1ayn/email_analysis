While I agree that the data model needs to change here, I don't think
your wording is correct.

 

Typed values have to always be a (potential sequence of) atomic type(s).
Thus the type value of a node whose type is unknown should be
xdt:untypedAtomic (mapped from the PSVI type annotation called
xs:anySimpleType).

 

Xs:anySimpleType should not be used as an instance type (it is a general
type of all atomic types and sequences and choices thereof), xs:anyType
is the most general type of a node and not a value type.

 

Best regards

Michael

Data Model, Section 5 says: 

"The typed value of nodes whose type is unknown (for instance because
they have not been validated) are labeled with the type
xs:anySimpleType." 

This should say "... labeled with the type xs:anySimpleType or
xs:anyType" to be consistent with Data Model, Section 3.4 6th paragraph
