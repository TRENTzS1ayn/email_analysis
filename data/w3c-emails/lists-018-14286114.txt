Unfortunately though there are real worries in the community that the
majority of "errors" detected by the typing in Xpath2 will be
essentially spurious errors. constructs that worked in xpath 1 will fail
to work in xpath 2 because of the smaller number of places where
implicit coercions happen. So this has all the signs of being an error
detecting device that generates more errors than it detects.
