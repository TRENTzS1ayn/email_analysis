*Data Model, Section 3.2 Document order*
Assuming that the term 'stable' means 'stable for the life of the 
query', it is not clear that there is any requirement that namespace 
declarations must always appear in the same order, or that attributes of 
an element must always appear in the same order. For documents that are 
dynamically generated, this requirement may be burdensome.
