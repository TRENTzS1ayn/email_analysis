*Data Model, Section 3.2 Document order*
The definition defines "document order" for all nodes in a document, but 
the same notion of order is intended to apply to all trees, including 
fragments.
This is seen, for example, in section 4.1.8 "children Accessor", where 
it says that "For document and element nodes, it returns the nodes that 
are children of that node in document order". An element in a fragment 
needs to have its children ordered, but the definition of "document 
order" does not currently cover this case since "document order" only 
applies to documents.

One solution would be to change the term from "document order" to "tree 
order". However, the term "document order" seems pretty well entrenched, 
so perhaps a better solution is to keep the term but make it apply to 
all trees, not just documents.
