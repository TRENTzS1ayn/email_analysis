Data Model, Section 3.2 Document order*
Is this section about "document order" or is it actually about "order of 
nodes" whether they are in the same document or not?
The title says it is about "document order", and the only definition in 
this section is called "document order", but the last two paragraphs 
broaden the discussion to include order of nodes in multiple documents, 
or not in a document at all.


Suggested solution: change the title to "Node order" or something similar.
