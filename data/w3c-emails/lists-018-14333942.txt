*Data Model, Section 3.3 XML Schemas and the XML Information Set*
third paragraph, second sentence: "XML documents that are not well 
formed are not XML".
In that case, how can you begin the sentence by calling them XML 
documents? That's like saying "Chickens that are not birds are not 
chickens" - the sentence is self-contradictory.

Proposed solution: delete the first occurrence of "XML".
