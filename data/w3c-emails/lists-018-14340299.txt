*Data Model, Section 3.3 XML Schemas and the XML Information Set*
fifth para, third sentence: "The data model also supports values that 
are not nodes. Examples of these are atomic values,...".
The terms "node" and "atomic value" have not been defined.
Section 3.1 "Node identity" says that XML documents are tree-structured, 
and consist of "nodes" but does not define what these nodes are.
The term "text node" is in common use regarding XML, referring to a 
maximal sequence of consecutive character information items that are 
children of an element.
Section 4 "Nodes" does define nodes, and specifically mentions text 
nodes. But a "text node" looks like an "atomic value", so we seem to 
have a contradiction at this point, because it says that an "atomic 
value" is an example of a "value" that is not a "node".

To fix this:
1. Section 3.1 "node identity", first para, should state that nodes are 
defined in Section 4, "Nodes".
2. "Atomic value" is defined in section 5; add a forward reference to 
that definition here to eliminate the suspicion that a "text node" is an 
"atomic value".
