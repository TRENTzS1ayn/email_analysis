*Data Model, Section 4.1.4 parent Accessor*
In the Infoset recommendation, the element information item EII 
containing an attribute information item AII is not referred to as the 
"parent" of AII; instead, there is the [owner element] property which 
may be traversed to go from AII to EII. Based on this, it is not clear 
in this specification whether EII is the 'parent' of AII or not.

The first two paragraphs of Section 4 "Nodes" do not resolve this. 
Section 3.1 "Node identity" does say that you assume all the 
"conventional terminology for trees". This might be construed to mean 
that EII is the parent of AII, but then there is the precedent of the 
Infoset recommendation that it is not. On the other hand, 4.3.1 
"Overview" item 10 says "If an attribute node A has a parent element 
E..." which indicates that attributes do have a 'parent' rather than an 
'owner element', and 4.4.2 "Accessors" defines that dm:parent of an 
attribute returns "the parent element node".
