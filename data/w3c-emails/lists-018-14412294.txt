*Data Model, Section 4.3.3 PSVI to data model mapping*
First bullet under the children property: it says that the order of 
nodes is implementation-defined. Granted that the character nodes will 
be collected into a single text node, should the processing instructions 
and comments retain their relative order?

That is, take the original sequence of [children], delete all the 
character information items, map the remaining information items to 
nodes, retaining the order, and finally insert the text node at an 
implementation-defined point in the sequence of nodes.
