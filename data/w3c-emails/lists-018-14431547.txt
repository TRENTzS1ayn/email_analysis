*Data Model, Section 4.3.4 Data Model to Infoset Mapping*
The mapping to the [children] attribute is described as creating a 
"sequence".
However, the term "sequence" has a reserved meaning in this specification.
It would be better to say that the result is an "ordered list", the term 
found in the Infoset recommendation.

In addition, it should be made explicit that this mapping preserves order.
