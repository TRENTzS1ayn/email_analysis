Perhaps the first sentence should be modified then.
The sentences we're discussing are

   "The relative order of nodes in distinct documents is 
   implementation-dependent but stable. In other words, given two 
   distinct documents A and B, if a node in document A is before a 
   node in document B, then every node in document A is before every 
   node in document B."

I interpret this first sentence as a statement about the order of node 
pairs, i.e. any two nodes from different documents are in some order 
and this order is stable.
You want to say that the *documents* are in some implementation-dependent
order which means if doc A is before doc B then node Na from A is before 
node Nb from B.

I think removing "nodes in" from the first sentence would avoid this
misinterpretation.
