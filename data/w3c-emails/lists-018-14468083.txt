Yes, for example:

$someNodeSet[2]

where $someNodeSet contains nodes from at least two different documents. Using a
positional predicate requires that there is total order on any node-set.

This order must be stable, otherwise one may get different results on two different
references to the above XPath expression.

Because sets are unordered by definition, it is meaningless to talk about some other
order (e.g. order of nodes as they come in the node-set) except document order,
which is specified in XPath with exactly the purpose of being the only order
specified.

Therefore, document order covers by definition all types of node-sets, including the
case of node-sets comprising nodes from different documents.

I also find the name "document order" confusing in this last case.

Probably "canonical order" or any name which doesn't refer only to a (single)
document will be better.
