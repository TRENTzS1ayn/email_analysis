I don't think that a fragment is a node. A fragment is a tree whose root is
not a document node. But we don't really use the term fragment and it would
be better to drop it.

Data Model, Section 4.1.2 If a fragment is a node (as implied by Data Model,
Section 3.3 ), we need a node kind for it here.
