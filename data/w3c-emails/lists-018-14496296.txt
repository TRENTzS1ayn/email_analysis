Since document order is exposed to the application, I think it could cause
all sorts of subtle problems if it changes during the life of a query.
Applications are entitled to assume that the input data model is immutable,
for example that
 
sequence-deep-equal(@*, @*)
 
will always be true.

Data Model, Section 3.2 Document order 
Assuming that the term 'stable' means 'stable for the life of the query', it
is not clear that there is any requirement that namespace declarations must
always appear in the same order, or that attributes of an element must
always appear in the same order. For documents that are dynamically
generated, this requirement may be burdensome.
