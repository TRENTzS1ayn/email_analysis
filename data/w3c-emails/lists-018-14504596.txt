No, it should say "distinct names". The name of an attribute node is a
QName, but there are other properties that are QNames as well, for example
the type annotation. The property we are talking about here is correctly
called the "name" property.

Data Model, Section 4.3.1 " attributes of an element must have distinct
names" should say "distinct QNames"
