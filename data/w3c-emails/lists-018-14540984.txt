A question about path expressions:

"/" is a legal expression
"/ + 5" also seems to be legal

so,

"(/) * 5" is probably legal
"(/) div 5" likewise

what about

"/ * 5" or "/ div 5"

Do we require spaces? Or parentheses? Or does an xpath parser need to look ahead to distinguish these cases? (My vote is for parentheses).

Thanks,

jeff
