My understanding is that we require parentheses, but I'm not sure this is
clearly documented. The examples above are actually all legal in XPath 1.0,
which has a known bug in that it doesn't describe how to disambiguate these
cases. Fortunately none of the above examples is likely to appear often in
real code. In XPath 2.0, though, it becomes more likely: for example "if (/
is $n)" needs to be written as "if ((/) is $n)", or perhaps as "if (/. is
$n)". Or you can always write root(.)!
