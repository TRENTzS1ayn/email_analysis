What should you do now?

If you sent the email from a corporate network, you should first
contact your local Helpdesk or System Administrator for advice.
They will be able to help you clean your workstation.

If you sent the email from a personal or home account, you will
need to disinfect your computer yourself. To do this you will
need an anti-virus program. We suggest using one of the leading
industry anti-virus packages such as McAfee or Norton.
