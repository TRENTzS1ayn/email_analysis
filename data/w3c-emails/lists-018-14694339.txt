*Functions and Operators, Section 17.8 Casting to numeric types*

In item 1, the 6th 'outer' or 'hollow' bullet ("If ST is 
xdt:untypedAtomic, xs:anySimpleType or xs:string or a type derived from 
xs:string, SV is converted to an intermediate value IV of type 
xs:token.") is followed by 4 additional 'outer' or 'hollow' bullets; 
those final 4 bullets should be indented as 'inner' or 'solid' bullets 
under the 6th 'outer' or 'hollow' bullet.
