There is also a backwards compatibility issue in this area which the XSL WG
noted in its review.

Functions and Operators, Section 7.4.14: fn:translate <fn:translate>  says
that the result is the empty sequence if $transstring or $mapstring is the
empty sequence. This is not intuitive. 


If $mapstring is the empty sequence, then the result should be $srcval. 


If $transstring is the empty sequence, then the result should be 
either 
    $srcval 
or 
    $srcval minus the characters in $mapstring 
[either definition would make sense].
