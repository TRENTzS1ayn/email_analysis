Both are correct. You can pass in a sequence of nodes; under the function
calling rules they will be atomized. The sequence must then consist of
values of a single type.

Functions and Operators, Section 15.3 Aggregate Functions 


"Except
<Exceptforfn:count,thesequencemustconsistofvaluesofasingletypeoroneifitssubt
ypes,ortheymustbenumeric.> for fn:count, the sequence must consist of values
of a single type or one if its subtypes, or they must be numeric." 


But one example xquery in the xquery spec (4.10 Function Definitions) passes
in a sequence of nodes to sum() 


Which is correct: FandO or XQuery?
