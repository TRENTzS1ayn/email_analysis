Class: Editorial

In section 6.4 and many other sections where the static type semantics
is described, the document currently says: " For detailed semantics, see
section XYZ of [XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Formal Semantics]."

Please change this to the following, since the reference is only
normative for the type semantics:

For detailed type semantics, see section XYZ of [XQuery 1.0 and XPath
2.0 Formal Semantics].
