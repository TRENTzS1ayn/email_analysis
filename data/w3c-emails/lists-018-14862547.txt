Class: Technical

Section 7.3: Every implementation will be able to support codepoint
collation. But we should not require implementations to support
collation URIs at the base conformance level.

In analogy to schema import, we should make explicit collation URI
support a separate conformance level in XQuery. There are systems with
existing collation support that may not want or can provide such
fine-grained, operation-by-operation collation control.

Note: MS-FO-LC1-021 to 023 and MS-FO-LC1-025 to 030 were editorial
comments and were forwarded to the editors directly during a working
group internal review meeting.
