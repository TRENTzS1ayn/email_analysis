Thanks for your comments.  I think we need to say that the 'eq' operator
is used to determine whether two values are distinct or not.  We do not
need the total order requirement.  

All the best, Ashok

I agree. (And I personally think that we should define equality over
durations, based on reducing the duration to a (months, seconds) tuple).

Yes, we should add a note that if several values are eq to each other,
it is
implementation-dependent which of them is returned.

We have been doing a lot of work in the last week or two to redefine
"eq" so
that it is transitive. This should remove this problem.

This function is consistent with the decision we made in XSLT that NaN
is
equal to itself for the purpose of grouping, sorting, and key lookup. I
think it's the right way to go. (Java does it this way too).

True (but it doesn't do any harm either).

Yes.

Thanks for the comments!
