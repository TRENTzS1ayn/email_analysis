Class: Technical

start-with and most other string functions have an XPath 1.0
incompatibilty: () maps to "" in XPath 1.0 string functions. No good
reason to be incompatible. Treat () as zero-length string and return
xs:boolean instead of xs:boolean?.

Add this change to all other string functions as well.
