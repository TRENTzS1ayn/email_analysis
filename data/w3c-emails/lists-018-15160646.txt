Some functions take parameters with generic types, and define the 
semantics of the atomization/conversion that is done inside the 
function. Others expect to have more specific types passed in. We think 
the latter is preferable: functions should not be expected to do 
type-conversion.

eg the boolean-not() function should take a boolean argument rather than 
item* - the caller should do the implicit or explicit casting to boolean 
before passing the argument to the function.
