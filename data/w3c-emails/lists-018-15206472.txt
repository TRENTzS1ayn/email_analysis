This section uses a different format for describing its mappings than 
the next section, 4.2.4, Data Model to Infoset mapping.


This section lists each target property in bold with an indented 
paragraph describing how to compute the target property, whereas section 
4.2.4 arranges the information in a table.

The tabular form seems better, chiefly because the column headings 
"Property" and "value" are of value.

Glancing over the other node types, it appears that you have been 
consistent in this convention, but we would prefer to simply have a 
table for the mappings in either direction.
