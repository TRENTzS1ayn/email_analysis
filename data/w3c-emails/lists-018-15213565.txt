*Data Model, Section 4.2.4 Data model to Infoset mapping*

The result of the mapping is supposed to be an instance of the Infoset 
specification. It says that the [children] property in this Infoset is a 
'sequence'.
But 'sequence' is a term reserved for an XQuery data model instance, not 
a term for something that occurs in an Infoset.
The correct term in the world of Infosets is 'ordered list'.
