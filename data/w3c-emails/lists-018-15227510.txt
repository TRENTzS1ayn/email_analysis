*Data Model, Section 4.3.1 Overview*

Point 9 says that attributes are not children of their parents.
Shouldn't this also say that namespaces are not children of their parents?

More generally, the use of "parent" for what the Infoset calls "owner 
element" is probably a mistake.
It is unduly confusing to say that something is not a child of its parent !
