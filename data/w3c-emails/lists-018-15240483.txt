*Data Model, Section 4.3.2 Accessors*

It says "The accessors dm:namespaces and dm:attributes return the same 
set of namespace and attribute nodes (respectively) associated with the 
element. They are not constrained to return them in any particular order."
 From this one might conclude that these accessors might return nodes in 
different orders on different invocations.
But Section 3.2 maintains that there is a stable (though 
implementation-defined) order of namespace nodes and attribute nodes.

If these accessors are not bound by that order, does it really make 
sense to say that these nodes are ordered? Probably what is meant by 
this sentence is "These accessors return nodes in document order, which 
is stable but implementation-defined" instead of saying there are no 
constraints on the order at all.
