*Data Model, Section Appendix A, XML Information Set Conformance*

First para, second sentence uses the undefined term "data model 
fragment". The term "fragment" is defined. However, "fragment" is 
defined to exclude XML documents, and I believe that the material in 
this list is intended to apply to XML documents as well as fragments.
The encompassing term appears to be "tree". See section 4 "Nodes" second 
para.

(If we do away with the term "fragment" as suggested in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jun/0287.html
presumably it will be replaced here by "tree" ?)
