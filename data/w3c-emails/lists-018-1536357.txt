It seems to me that it's best to choose the one that most people would
find intuitive.  In my experience, I generally expect that if you say
you want to insert something at the N position, it becomes the Nth item.
But, of course, my experience could be different from others, or it
could be that it's simply not worth changing at this point.

Thanks,
Priscilla
