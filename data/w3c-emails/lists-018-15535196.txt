On the contrary, this capability was included in the XPath 2.0 data model
specifically for backwards compatibility with XPath 1.0. It is needed to
support an XSLT construct such as:

<xsl:variable name="x">
  <e/>
  <e/>
</xsl:variable>

It also turns out to be useful, I understand, in mapping the data model to
relational databases.
