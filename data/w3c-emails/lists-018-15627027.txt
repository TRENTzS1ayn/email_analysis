Paul, 

I guess that shows the value of the specifications being open to public 
comment. If the WG members haven't already proposed a primer, it seems to me 
to be a surprising omission.

Given the passage of time since I first raised the issue I will simply 
comment that, at least as judged by the November 2002 WDs, there is in my 
view a VERY long way to go to make the specification documents 
"approachable".

I reiterate my request for the WG(s) to consider producing one or more primer 
documents to significantly improve the level of approachability of these 
specifications.
