In [22] it is indicated that the arity for DefaultCollationDecl is zero or 
more.

The text description of the default collation declaration in 4.4 only seems 
to describe the scenario of zero or one such declarations.

Does [22] need to be modified or should clarifying text be added in 4.4?

The same issue seems to arise when comparing XMLSpaceDecl in [22] and the 
text description of the xmlspace declaration in 4.3.
