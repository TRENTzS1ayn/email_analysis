In 4.1 the production for a namespace declaration refers to URLLiteral yet 
the text goes on to refer to URI. Given the potential differences between 
what is or is not a URL or URI, I wonder whether some redrafting is needed.

Line 1 of the text of 4.1 begins "A namespace declaration defines a namespace 
prefix ...". In what sense does a namespace declaration *define* a namespace 
prefix? I suggest that rewording be considered.

In line 2 what is the meaning of "valid URI"?
