We have to have the full "cast as" form because otherwise it wouldn't
be possible for someone to create a value of a type in no namespace
whose name clashed with one of the built in functions or node tests,
such as "data" or "node".

The short forms, on the other hand, are a lot more convenient for the
common cases.

Cheers,

Jeni
