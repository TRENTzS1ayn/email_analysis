For the following examples in 3.2.3 and 3.2.4,

child::text()
text()

the corresponding definition refers to *all* child text nodes of the context 
node.

Isn't it the case that there can only ever be one such text node which is a 
child node of the context node? The term "all", therefore, seems potentially 
misleading.
