Is there any mechanism for defining/declaring a library of user-defined 
functions?

Would it be possible to add to the query prolog a mechanism to add an import 
mechanism for groups of functions analogous to the schema import 
functionality? Or has that possibility been considered and deemed 
inappropriate?
