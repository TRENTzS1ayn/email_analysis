Thank you very much for your reply, it clears up a lot.  

Just to be clear though (before I implement this ;-)), Jonathan 
mentions below that the datatypes in the 
"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes" namespace are only available 
if that schema is imported.  

In the XPath 2.0 spec, section 2.6.2.1.1 (Basic XPath) it states that:

"In a Basic XPath implementation, the in-scope schema definitions consist 
of a fixed set of 48 predefined type definitions. These include the 44 
built-in datatypes defined in [XML Schema], plus four additional types: 
fn:yearMonthDuration,  fn:dayTimeDuration, xs:anySimpleType, and 
xs:anyType."

Wouldn't that mean that in a basic XPath2 implementation, without importing 
the above schema, only the third example below is legal?

[I assume you mean that Jonathan's implication was correct?] So does this 
mean that this xs: binding takes precedence over any other xs: binding 
done by a user in a document?

Thanks very much for your help,
Caroline
