Todd,
Here is how I think the Schema type below would map
into the internal type system (I didn't double check
the formal rules)

define type blockEnum { Anon1 | Anon2 }
define type Anon1 restricts xs:string { xs:string }
define type Anon2 restricts xs:string { xs:string* }

All types are defined at the top level, even those
with anonymous names.  The only difference between
user-defined types and anonymous types is that 
the former are global and the latter are local (and
their names are system generated)

Hope that helps
Mary
