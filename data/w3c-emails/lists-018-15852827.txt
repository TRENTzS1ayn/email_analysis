XPath 1.0 imposes a restriction that concat() has 2 or more arguments. This
means that implementations have to check specially to treat 0 or 1 arguments
as an error, and software generating XPath expressions has to generate
different code if the number of items to be concatenated is 0 or 1. The
restriction imposes unnecessary burdens on both the implementation and the
user, it is better to make the function general rather than impose
artificial limits.
