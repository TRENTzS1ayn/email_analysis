In the example code showing the pattern for the yearMonthDuration type the 
prefixes of the elements seem inconsistent. For some elements there is no 
namespace prefix. For the xsd:pattern element, unusually in the XQuery 
specifications, the "xsd" prefix is used.

With regard to the specified pattern it seems that values such as P1Y99M are 
allowed. Is that intended?
