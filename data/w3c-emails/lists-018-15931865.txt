Hi Caroline,

The xs: prefix is predefined, bound to "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema", 
so there is no need to bind anything to xs.  I'm trying to remember if we 
outlawed redefining this prefix - I think not, but I also asked the WG the 
question, and I will reply here if I find out that I was wrong.

So under the assumption that you actually can redefine this prefix, if you 
do not import the schema, these types will not be predefined, and you will 
get a type error, since the system does not know what types you are 
referring to.
