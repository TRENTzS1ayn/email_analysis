Just to keep everything clear, and I cannot speak for GALAX, but isn't
'node*' the return type of the document() function, not the 'document'
type?  The 'document' type results from computed document constructors,
not calls to the document() function.

Furthermore, would it not be a static type error to rewrite the function
so that the argument type is 'item' rather than 'element', as was
suggested?  'node*' is not a subtype of 'item' (but 'item*' would be
valid, as would, of course, 'node*', which is what I would recommend for
the argument type).
