Hi Paul,

Thanks for the response.

With all due respect the references located at the URL which you give are 
predominantly either (at this point in time) vapourware, outdated or 
inappropriate to the audience which would benefit from a primer. For example, 
XQuery Early Adopter was written based on a Q3 2001 WD and was already out of 
date by its publication in January 2002. Pity the newcomer to XQuery who has 
to try to work out from that book what is still part of XQuery and what is 
now of merely historical curiosity.

I don't think that I suggested or implied that the XQuery WG would be the 
*only* source of introductory XQuery material.

It remains my view that an XQuery Primer produced by the XQuery WG would be 
of benefit to the hopefully emerging XQuery community.

I hope that in time you will come to agree with that view.

Regards

Andrew Watt
