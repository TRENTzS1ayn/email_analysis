Dear XQuery WG,

The QNAME lexical state seems useless.  It is a subset of the DEFAULT
state and as far as I can see there is nothing else in the DEFAULT state
that, when recognized in the QNAME state, would give anything but parse
errors.

Therefore I suggest removing the QNAME state and replacing all
transitions to it with transitions to the DEFAULT state.
