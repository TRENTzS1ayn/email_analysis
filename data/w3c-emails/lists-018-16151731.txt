Hi Andrew,

I agree that it would be of benefit.

However, I also think that the editors need to be working on the core 
documents right now, and that the XQuery 1.0 document and the Use Cases 
already give people a reasonably approachable entry to the language, with 
lots of concrete examples. We need to get the standard done.

It's a question of where you allocate the effort. I don't think the Working 
Group's time should be taken up with a primer at this point. You will 
almost certainly see up-to-date tutorials when the language stops changing 
and the tutorials can be stable.
