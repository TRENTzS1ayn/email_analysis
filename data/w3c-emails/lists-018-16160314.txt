Actually the document() function in the current working drafts allows the
URI to contain a fragment identifier, and if it does, the returned value may
be an element node rather than a document node. This is the way document()
is defined in XSLT 1.0.

We've made a recent decision, which (if all goes smoothly) will be reflected
in the next working drafts, to use a simplified version of the document()
function for XQuery. This will not allow fragment identifiers and will not
allow multiple URIs; it will always return either a document node, or
nothing.
