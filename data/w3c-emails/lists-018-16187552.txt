I assume it means escaping a URI, e.g. to be embedded inside another, or 
something like that.

Not specifically, though I did include some in my suite; e.g. below.  I've 
not at all considered escaping entire URIs, which seems to be the thrust of 
your comments.

With the respect to the special case you mention, my reading of the spec 
was that '%' not followed by two hex digits is not valid in a URI.  Hence 
my invalid tests.

My full test suite is in file "URITest.hs" at:
   http://www.ninebynine.org/Software/HaskellURI.zip
Of course, many of the tests were lifted from yours.
