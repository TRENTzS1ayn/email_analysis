Hi Vagelis,

Thanks for your comments on the XQuery and XPath Full-Text Use Cases.

My answers are inlined.

Also, for further comments, could you please use this email address:
public-qt-comments@w3.org

It will read the whole FTTF (full-text task force) group and you might
get answers from people with different perspectives (industry,
information retrieval, librarians, ...).

I am creating a thread in the above mailing list in case people have
more comments.

Thanks

Sihem

Yes, indeed. I wanted to come listen to you at ICDE but I had a
conflict at that time. I will definitely read your paper.

There is not always a major difference between queries. In particular,
the two queries you refer to are in Section 13: Use Case "STRUCTURE":
Queries using XPath Axes whose aim is to combine XPath navigation with
full-text querying and the only difference between 13.2.3 and 13.2.5 s
that one uses the Descendant axis while the other use the Ancestor
one.

All queries seem to specify exactly where to search for keywords. We
do not have a use case that explicitly deals with your concern. It is
definitely a use case we will have to consider. To make sure I
understand your request, an example of the kind of queries you would
like to see is:

Return book titles and authors for books that contain the words
"usability" and the word "performance" (meaning anywhere in their
descendant elements without specifying which elements they are).

>3. How about IDREFs? Do you plan to support phrases spanning across IDREFs?

We do not have any plans to support searching for phrases spanning
IDREFs. Do you have any example we could discuss?
