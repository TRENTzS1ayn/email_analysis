Shane,

I may be misunderstanding your question.

Try the following query in the X-Hive online demo:
<books>
 {
  for $b in document("/XQuery/docs/XMP/bib.xml")/bib/book
  where $b/publisher = "Addison-Wesley" 
  return $b
 }
</books>

http://support.x-hive.com/xquery/index.html
Paste the above query into XMP 1.1.9Q1

Is that the usage of the where clause you are interested in (given the 
constraints on what can be queried in the online demo)?

BTW general XQuery questions can be discussed at the mailing list on
http://yahoogroups.com/group/XQuery
