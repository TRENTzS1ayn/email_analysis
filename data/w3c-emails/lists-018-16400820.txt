Kai,

I will propose adding such a use case and build it if the group wants
to add it.

Thank you for the education.  I'm not an expert searcher, it never
occurred to me that stemming could be a problem in this way.

It is very close.  I am suggesting to add a use case which does
"linguistic phrase search" and leave it to the implementation whether
they use a linguistic parser or map it to proximity search or they ask
the Oracle of Delphi.
