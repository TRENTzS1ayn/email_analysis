We reviewed the question of whether xsl:copy-of should retain the base URI
of copied nodes  at the XSL Working Group meeting yesterday, and confirmed
our decision that it should not.

Copying relative URIs will always be a risky thing to do, whatever
technology you use for copying them. It's intrinsic to the concept of a
relative URI that its meaning depends on where it is, and that this can
change when you move it. Sometimes when you copy relative URIs, you actually
want them to point to a new place, relative to their new location. If you
don't want this behavior, you have two courses of action open to you: you
can absolutize the URI before copying it, or you can retain the original
base URI. The easiest way of doing this is to write an xml:base attribute to
the new tree.

The decision not to retain the original base URI on xsl:copy-of is
consistent with the decision that it isn't retained on serialization of a
final result tree (we never add xml:base attributes automatically). I think
these two operations should have the same behavior, so that a multi-phase
transformation works the same way whether the intermediate results are
serialized trees or temporary trees.
