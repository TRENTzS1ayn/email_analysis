The curly braces enclose expressions; in this case sequence
constructors.
I'll try and fix the quote marks.

All the best, Ashok

The string-join function was introduced in the 15-November-2002 Working
Draft of F&O. The examples in subsection 6.4.2.1 look like they have
typographical issues, including:
Braces instead of parentheses
Mixed single and double quotes
Use of paths (abra, cadabra) instead of string literals
I didn't notice problems with the other functions that are brand new in
this draft.
