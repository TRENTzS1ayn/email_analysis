Hi,

In the "XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes" date timezones are said to be 
"allowed as for dateTime".

Which is the correct canonical representation of a date:
1999-05-31-05:00 or 1999-05-31T-05:00 ?  Are they both lexically correct?

In the Functions and Operators 8.6.3 add-timezone-to-date shows the return 
values as including the "T" seperator for numerical timezones but no "T" 
seperator for "Z".  If the timezone qualifier is "Z" should there be 
a "T" seperator?

Cheers,
Natalie
