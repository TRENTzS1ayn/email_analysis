A personal response:

Bryan, thanks for telling us your views. I'm sure some people on the working
groups have similar feelings. However, a note like this isn't going to be
persuasive unless it provides some concrete evidence of problems caused by
the current design, and positive proposals for an alternative. 

It would be helpful to know whether you disagree with the published
requirements for XPath 2.0 [1] (and if so, which specific requirements you
dispute), or whether you are suggesting that the current design is not the
most appropriate response to those requirements, in which case it would be
nice to see alternative suggestions.

The term "strong typing" means different things to different people. There
are some type rules in XPath 1.0, for example you cannot supply a number as
an argument to the count() function or as an operand of the "/" operator. We
have tried to ensure that XPath 2.0 remains usable in a world where there
are no schemas and all data coming from source documents is untyped. Do you
feel that we haven't catered adequately for this scenario, and if so, can
you be specific about where you see the problems? Or do you think that the
alternative scenario, where data has been validated and typed, is one that
XPath 2.0 should not cater for?
