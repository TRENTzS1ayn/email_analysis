XML Schema Part 2 and XLink both refer to RFC 2396 "as
amended by RFC 2736".  But F&O only refers to RFC
2396.

RFC 2736 adds some reserved characters (namely square
brackets) that would affect the escape-URI function.

I don't have any particular reason to need F&O to
refer to RFC 2736, but it seems like an inconsistency
between W3C recs.  Was it intentional?

Thanks,
John
