Hi, 

In section 6.3.15.1 of the F&O spec, it says that:

"In string mode, the meta-character . matches any character whatsoever. In 
multi-line mode, the meta-character . matches any character except a newline 
character."

This seems to infer that in string mode, the meta-character . should match
the newline character. However, this behaviour would differ from that of
Regular Expressions in XML Schemas: in appendix F of the XML Schema
Datatypes spec the equivalent character class for . is given as [^\n\r].

Can you please verify whether a newline should match the . meta-character 
in string mode? Is the newline character considered 'any character'?

Cheers, 
Jennifer
