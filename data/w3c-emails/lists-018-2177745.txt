[Re-send of a post which didn't seem to make it to the list.]

In line 1 of paragraph 2 of 1.5 in Functions and Operators the term "actual 
namespaces" is equated to "the URIs of the namespace".

As I understand it a namespace, and presumably an "actual namespace" is a 
collection of names.

A namespace URI references such a namespace but is not synonymous with it.

Perhaps it was intended to refer to "actual namespace name" rather than 
"actual namespace"? But isn't the word "actual" redundant here?
