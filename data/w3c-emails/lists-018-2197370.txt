[Re-send of a post which didn't seem to make it to the list.]

In paragraph 5 line 1 of 2.3 we read, "The value of an element is represented 
by the children of the element node, which may include text nodes and other 
element nodes.".

Should "an element" be "an element node"?

Should "children" be "descendants"?
