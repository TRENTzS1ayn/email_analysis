[Re-send of a post which didn't seem to make it to the list.]

In the penultimate line of ordinary text in 3 an "element" is given as an 
example of an "item".

However, the definition of an "item" in XQuery 1.0 is an atomic value or a 
node.

Is there a need for editing here or an inconsistency in definitions? Was an 
"element node" intended in 3?

In passing, 3.1 uses an element (and its content) as an example of using 
xf:error.
