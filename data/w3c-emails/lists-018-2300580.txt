In 1.4.4 it is stated, "The following results assume that the queries were 
executed on Feb. 1,1999.".

However, Q8 relates to sales in March 1999 which would be rather difficult to 
estimate on 1st February 1999.

A similar inconsistency arises with respect to Question 9 which relates to 
several months in 1999 after February.

Is there a typo in the first line of 1.4.4.8 Q8? Should "actioned" read 
"auctioned"?
