In the fourth bullet point reference is made to a "document node with no 
children".

Perhaps I am parsing the sentence wrongly but a document node with no 
children does not correspond to a well-formed XML document and therefore no 
XSLT transformation can be transformed.

Perhaps the phrase could be amended or clarified.
