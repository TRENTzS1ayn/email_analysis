Intriguing.

Isn't your use of "element" a significant departure from that in XML 1.0?

I don't find it problematic. XML 1.0 is interested in the syntactic
representation of an element using angle brackets, we are interested in a
different representation of the element using a node on a tree. But it's the
same element.
