Thanks for the typos, I've fixed these.

It has always been possible in XSLT to construct a tree consisting solely of
a root (document) node:

<xsl:variable name="empty-tree"><xsl:value-of select="''"/></xsl:variable>

The Data Model document (section 4.1.1) makes it clear that the XPath data
model allows trees that do not represent well-formed XML documents, though
it doesn't actually mention this one as an example.
