I've made the change for consistency's sake but I'm not convinced that
it's the best choice of word.  Need to discuss. 

All the best, Ashok

[Re-send of a post which didn't seem to make it to the list.]

There is a minor terminology inconsistency between 2.2 of Functions and 
Operators and the referenced section of Data Model.

The latter uses "expanded-QName" (with a hyphen) whereas Functions and 
Operators uses no hyphen.

I suggest this be made consistent in those places and elsewhere across
the 
working drafts.
