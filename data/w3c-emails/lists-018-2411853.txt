The note below that text was supposed to cover that situation.  I've
expanded it to do so.

All the best, Ashok

[Re-send of a post which didn't seem to make the list.]

In the numbered points following Issue 177 I have a question about the 
results stated.

If we have op:numeric-subtract(1,INF) is the result really INF? cf
numbered 
point 2.
