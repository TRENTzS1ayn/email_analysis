In the first line of a paragraph of 2.5 it is stated, "Sometimes the focus is 
based on a single node rather than a sequence.".

I understood a single node to be a sequence, in the new terminology of the 
Data Model.

In which case it seems to me that the quoted sentence needs to be rephrased 
to assist clarity.
