In 2.5 of XSLT 2.0 it is indicated that . is the XPath expression which 
returns the context item.

Later in 2.5 it is indicated that self::node() returns the context node.

Since the context item and context node need not be synonymous isn't this 
usage a departure from the XPath 1.0 usage where . and self::node() are 
synonymous? See 2.5 of XPath 1.0.
