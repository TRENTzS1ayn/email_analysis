If the context item is a node, then "." and self::node() will return the
same thing.

If the context item is not a node, then "." returns the context item, and
self::node() - indeed any path expression - raises an error. (Currently a
dynamic error, we are discussing whether we should allow a static error).

Yes, this has moved on since XPath 1.0.
