In the Abstract of the Data Model WD no mention is made XPath 2.0 in the list 
of specifications which depend on the Data Model.

I suggest that XPath 2.0 be explicitly mentioned in the Abstract, to minimise 
the impression that XPath 2.0 is the poor relation in the emerging 
specification documents.

Also, the specificity of the reference to [XPath] later in the Abstract would 
benefit by being expressed as [XPath 1.0], there and elsewhere in the 
specifications.
