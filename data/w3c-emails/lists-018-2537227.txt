It seems to me that the prose "The pseudo-code syntax defines functions to 
construct values, called constructors; and functions to access parts of 
values, called accessors" could be better written as "The pseudo-code syntax 
defines functions, called constructors, to construct values and functions, 
called accessors, to access parts of values".

It seems to me that the terms constructor and accessor are applied to the 
functions, rather than to the values.
