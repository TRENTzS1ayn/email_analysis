It seems to me that the term "incompletely validated document" used in 3.3 
implies that the *process* of validation is incomplete, rather than what I 
understand to be the case - a document for which the process of validation 
has been completed but that process has shown the document not to be fully 
valid.

The terms "incompletely valid document" or "non-valid document" or "invalid 
document" seem to me to better describe the WG's intent here.
