May I suggest/request changing the XQuery grammar from:
[81]    EnclosedExpr    ::=    "{" ExprSequence "}"
to:
[81]    EnclosedExpr    ::=    "{" ExprSequence? "}"

I.e. making the ExprSequence be optional.  This may seem
pointless, but it makes it easier to nest XQuery comments
inside ElementContent (and function definitions).  E.g.:

<table>
{ {-- We use a table here, just because. --} }
<tr> ...</tr>
</table>

as opposed to having to put extra parentheses:
{({-- We use a table here, just because. --})}
--
