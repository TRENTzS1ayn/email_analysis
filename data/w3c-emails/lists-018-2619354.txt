In the second paragraph of text after the numbered list an example is given 
whereby a version attribute may have type xsd:decimal.

Since a decimal may be negative perhaps a type more specifically suitable to 
a version number could be used?

If that change is made I assume it also needs to be made in XPath 2.0.
