In 2.1.2 of XPath 2.0 the context item is defined. Michael Kay's response to 
a query I had about XSLT 2.0 indicates a change in meaning of self::node() 
and . in XPath 2.0.

It seems to me that that change is not mentioned in XPath 2.0 but ought to 
be. Chapter 2.1.2 seems an appropriate place to express the change.

An equivalent change would need to be made in XQuery 1.0 spec too.
