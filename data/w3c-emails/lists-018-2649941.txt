The description in 2.2 of the xf:collection function is confusing, to me at 
least.

A collection is said to be any sequence of nodes but a sequence is defined 
elsewhere as a collection of both nodes and atomic values. So, by that latter 
definition it isn't that kind of sequence at all.

Also it doesn't seem helpful to define a collection by using a term which is 
itself defined in terms of an (ordered) collection.

A similar lack of clarity/consistency seems to afflict 14.5.4 in Functions 
and Operators.
