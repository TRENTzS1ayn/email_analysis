This may be one of those cases where I am not picking up the key piece of 
information across the multiple documents but at present I am unclear about 
what regular expression support is or is not present in XQuery 1.0 (and XPath 
1.0).

I note that XSLT 2.0 has recently added the <xsl:analyze-string> element to 
provide some regular expression support.

In XQuery 1.0 / XPath 2.0 can a regular expression, for example, be used as 
an argument to the function xf:contains()?

I also notice that the "TEXT" section in the Use Cases WD makes no mention of 
using regular expressions in full text searches. That seems, to me at least, 
a significant omission in the TEXT use cases. In fact, the Use Cases document 
seems totally to omit the notion of using regular expressions.

I would be grateful if someone could clarify for me whether the seeming 
omission in the TEXT use cases has a corresponding deficiency of regular 
expression support in XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0.
