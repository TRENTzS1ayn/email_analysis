I am having trouble reconciling numbered point 1. in 2.5.2.1 with the first 
sentence of 2.5.2.2.

If numbered point 1. is correct I don't see how 2.5.2.2 alleviates the 
problem.

I am assuming that a SchemaImport (no space) and Schema Import (with an 
intervening space) refer to the same concept/process. It might help if this 
term / these terms were linked to relevant further explanation.

Perhaps there is some additional explanation that can reconcile the seeming 
inconsistency?
