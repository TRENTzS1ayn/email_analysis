No.  The regular expressions supported in the specifications currently
can only be used via the xf:matches function described in Section 6.3.15
xf:matches of 
http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-operators/#func-matches

This is a good question.  Recently the XQuery WG agreed to make changes
to the Use Cases document to clarify that the TEXT use case is NOT about
full-text searching but only about "string searching".  The revised
document will be published in Nov.  

In addition the XML Query and XSL WGs have a joint task force that is
looking into full-text searching requirements and solutions for XPath
and XQuery.
