On reading the XSLT 2.0 specification I can see no new element to add the 
equivalent of SVG 1.0's <desc> element or W3C XML Schema's <documentation> 
element.

Did I miss it? Or is it not there?

If there is not yet a documentation element in the XSLT namespace,I would 
like to suggest that such an element be added to the XSLT namespace to 
provide a convenient way to achieve stylesheet documentation. Particularly 
with the likely increase in modularised stylesheets and carrying out 
transformations across multiple documents a pukka, standard documentation 
element, whatever it's element type name, seems to me to be essential.
