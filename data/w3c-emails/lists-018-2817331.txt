There seems to me to be an inconsistency in 3.5 relating to top-level 
elements.

The content for xsl:stylesheet and xsl:transform is shown as:  "Content: (<A HREF="file:///C:/W3C/XSLT%202.0/XSL%20Transformations%20%28XSLT%29%20Version%202.0%20WD%2020020816.html#element-import">
xsl:import</A>*, top-level-elements)".

However, it is later stated that "An element occurring as a child of an <A HREF="file:///C:/W3C/XSLT%202.0/XSL%20Transformations%20%28XSLT%29%20Version%202.0%20WD%2020020816.html#element-stylesheet">
xsl:stylesheet</A> element is called a top-level element."

So, in the first xsl:import is distinct from a top-level element but in the 
second it is a top-level element. Maybe modify the content to refer to 
non-xsl:import-top-level-elements?
