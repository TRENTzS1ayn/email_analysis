Yes, this is an inconsistency, one which is carried forward unchanged from
the XSLT 1.0 specification. 
 
I've been hoping for some while to replace the current element proformas
with a notation based on XML Schema, but it's proved difficult to do this,
so I'll look at fixing the terminology.

Subject: XSLT 3.5 - top-level elements


There seems to me to be an inconsistency in 3.5 relating to top-level
elements.

The content for xsl:stylesheet and xsl:transform is shown as:  "Content:
(xsl:import
<file:///C:/W3C/XSLT%202.0/XSL%20Transformations%20%28XSLT%29%20Version%202.
0%20WD%2020020816.html#element-import> *, top-level-elements)".

However, it is later stated that "An element occurring as a child of an
xsl:stylesheet
<file:///C:/W3C/XSLT%202.0/XSL%20Transformations%20%28XSLT%29%20Version%202.
0%20WD%2020020816.html#element-stylesheet>  element is called a top-level
element."

So, in the first xsl:import is distinct from a top-level element but in the
second it is a top-level element. Maybe modify the content to refer to
non-xsl:import-top-level-elements?
