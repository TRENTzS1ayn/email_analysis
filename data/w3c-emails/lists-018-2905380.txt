We did some work on this at the meetings last week, and I hope it will be
clearer in the next version. The decision in principle (if my notes are
correct) was to allow comments anywhere that separator whitespace is
allowed, except in the constructs that mimic XML, e.g. between the
attributes or around the "=" signs in an element constructor. The detailed
implementation of this decision is yet to be done.
