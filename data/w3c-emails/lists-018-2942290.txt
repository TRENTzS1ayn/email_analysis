Clearly, a sequence that contains nodes only is a special case of a sequence
that can contain both nodes and atomic values. So yes, it is that kind of
sequence.

Well, we're not actually defining the term "collection" here, only the
behavior of a function named "collection".

There's a narrow line between abstraction and lack of clarity. The
definition of the collection function is deliberately abstract, in that the
concept of a collection identified by a URI may have many different concrete
realizations in different implementations. In some implementations it might
be something like a WebDAV collection, or a region of a database; in others
it might be a directory or folder in filestore, or the set of documents
listed in some XML index document. We don't want to rule any of these things
out.
