Seems to be a bug.  I'll take a look.

All the best, Ashok

Subject: xf:dayTimeDuration datatype









I encountered a problem with the schema fragment that defines
xf:dayTimeDuration in section 8.2.2 of the 7-Oct-2002 draft of the
Functions & Operators document. As written, the number of days can only
be
a single digit. The piece "\p[Nd}D" should become "\p[Nd}+D", similar to
the hour (H) and minute (M) fields.
