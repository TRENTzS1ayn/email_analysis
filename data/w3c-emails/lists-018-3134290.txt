2.4.1 says:

When stylesheet execution starts, a document node is
implicitly created for the result tree 


Which more or less matches the XSLT 1 behaviour.
But is that now the right model? In particular it seems to imply that
the principal result tree is never empty.

If one arranges that the initial template just generates secondary
result trees it is in fact often useful not to generate any principal
output at all.

Couldn't the implicit creation of a root node be fired when something is
inserted into the principal result tree rather than by stylesheet
execution?
