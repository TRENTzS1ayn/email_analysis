Some of the functions in F&O (namely, distinct-values, max and min) say that all dates/times in the sequence must either have a time zone or not (so they can be totally ordered).  It seems like there has been a shift to just assuming that dates/times without time zones have the implicit time zone (at least in the compare functions), which would mean that there would be a total order on time with vs. without time zones.  Should the text for these functions be changed?

Thanks,

John
