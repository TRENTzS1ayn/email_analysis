Does get-dayTimeDuration-from-dateTimes back up the minus operator? It appears that way from the Operator Mapping table in the XQuery 1.0 spec, but it doesn't say that it does in F&O.  If it does, shouldn't it be an operator instead of a function and be named subtract-dateTimes for simplicity and consistency?

Thanks,

John
