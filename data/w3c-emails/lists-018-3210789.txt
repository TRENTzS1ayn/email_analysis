The xf:get-yearMonthDuration-from-dateTimes function describes an algorithm for rounding months (based on 15.5 days.)  Should this same algorithm be used in multiply-yearMonthDuration and divide-yearMonthDuration?   The algorithm seems a little underspecified in those two functions - specifically, it does not say that a month is considered to be 31 days.

 

Thanks,

John
