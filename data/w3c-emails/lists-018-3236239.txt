That was a bug.  It's now fixed.

 

All the best, Ashok

Does get-dayTimeDuration-from-dateTimes back up the minus operator? It
appears that way from the Operator Mapping table in the XQuery 1.0 spec,
but it doesn't say that it does in F&O.  If it does, shouldn't it be an
operator instead of a function and be named subtract-dateTimes for
simplicity and consistency?

Thanks,

John
