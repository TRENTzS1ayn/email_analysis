Hi,

I've made the assumption that extracting from a negative 
yearMonthDuration, dayTimeDuration, dateTime, and date returns a negative 
value (as opposed to the component's absolute value).  Is that a correct 
assumption?

If it is, then there's a problem with the inclusive statements 8.4.10 - 
8.4.12 (eg. "The hours value ranges from 0 to 23, inclusive").

If this assumption is not correct, then should there be a 
is-positive function (or an equivalent statement) for these datetypes?  

Cheers,
Natalie
