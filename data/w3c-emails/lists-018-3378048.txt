I believe it's correct for durations but not for absolute dates and
dateTimes. In the latter case, I think the months value for a negative year
should still be positive, because it represents the number of months AFTER
the start of the year, so month 2 is later than month 1 regardless whether
the year is negative or positive. Only the year value should be signed.

You are quite right to point out that the spec needs to make a clear
statement on this.
