John:
What this means is that the XQuery type system is a simplified form
of the XML Schema type system.  In particular, the minOccurs and
maxOccurs declarations are mapped into the occurrence indicators, *,+,?
and 1.
See section 7.1.4.2 of the Formal Semantics document.

All the best, Ashok

Sorry to latch onto one tiny part of an important
message, but I don't understand what it means to say
that XQuery doesn't support minOccurs/maxOccurs.  Does
that mean that the "validate" expression doesn't pay
attention to them?  If so, it doesn't say so in the
spec.  I can't think what else that would mean...

Thanks,
John
