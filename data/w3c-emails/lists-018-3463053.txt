I would prefer to avoid splitting XSLT into multiple documents: I think
people generally find a single document less unwieldy than a collection of
documents that cross-refer to each other. I don't think we need to write
tutorial material in the XSLT 2.0 specification, because it exists
elsewhere. We do need to define the concepts and terminology, and in the
case of new features, I think we owe the reader a brief explanation of what
purpose the features are intended to serve.

In the current draft, I have pulled together a lot of the explanatory
material that was previously scattered around the document into the first
couple of sections, and I have tried to balance it so that a similar style
of explanation is used for all the main concepts: previously some concepts
like keys and patterns received lengthy justification in the spec, while
other concepts were dealt with very tersely. But other people have also made
negative comments on these sections and more work is clearly needed.
