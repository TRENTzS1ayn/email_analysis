Jonathan:
We need to solve this problem in any case.  The Schema WG
has started to discuss the NuNs question again and I'm hoping
there will be a proposal soon.

All the best, Ashok

Subject: Re: Why no xf:type accessor?

One problem with an xf:type accessor is that not every type has a unique

name - there are anonymous types that have no name, and local element
and 
attribute declarations whose names may be identical to other element and

attribute declarations.

One way of solving this would be to create a universal naming schema for

all types that can occur, but this was deemed too complex for XPath and 
XQuery 1.0.
