As you note, "1,2,3" is not an expression unless you put parentheses around
it.

In a sense, ExprSequence is a generalization of an Expression: every Expr is
an ExprSequence. XQuery allows an ExprSequence in certain contexts, for
example the content between "{}" in an element constructor. We could decide
in XSLT to allow an ExprSequence rather than an Expr as the top-level
construct.

I think the only reason that 1,2,3 is not a valid expression is that it
wouldn't make sense to write it as an argument to a function call, or in
certain other contexts such as E1 in "for $e1 in E1, $e2 in E2 return E3"
Perhaps it would make more sense to rename the productions:

Expr := ExprSequence
ExprSequence := OrExpr (',' OrExpr)...

ArgumentList := OrExpr (',' OrExpr)...
