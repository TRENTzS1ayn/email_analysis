Ashok,

As you know, I've been a proponent of NUNs since before they existed, and I 
hope we do come up with a universal naming scheme that is as simple as 
possible.

In my opinion, once that naming scheme exists, xf:type makes a lot of 
sense, but it doesn't make sense before that time. And this is something 
the W3C XML Schema WG should do, not XML Query.
