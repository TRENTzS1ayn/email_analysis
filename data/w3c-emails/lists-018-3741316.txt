I think that very few use cases have come up over the last couple of years
that require nested sequences, which justifies the original decision not to
provide them. I also think it would be quite confusing to have two separate
mechanisms for managing trees in XPath, one based on XML and the other based
on nested sequences, but supporting a completely different set of
constraints and operators.

If we do ever want to add nested sequences, I don't think it's difficult; we
would just add a new kind of item called a sequence-reference.

It's certainly too late to contemplate this kind of change at this stage of
the proceedings, without a much better justification than an unwarm heart.
