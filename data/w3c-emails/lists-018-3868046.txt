You are unlikely to receive a specific answer from anyone on the Working 
Group.

In times past the target, if I recall correctly, was the end of 2002. Clearly 
that wasn't achieved.

Realistically, assuming a new Working Draft this month (surely one is due 
soon), I don't imagine a Recommendation appearing before Q3 2003.
