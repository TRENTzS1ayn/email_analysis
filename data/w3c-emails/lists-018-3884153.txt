I don't think you have added anything to your previous comments on this
subject and I don't think I can add anything to my previous replies. As I
mentioned before, I discussed this briefly with colleagues and none of us
considered that this needed to be raised as an issue against the
specification. You sent an example of the style of coding which you want to
use, and I found it easy to convert into the style which we consider
preferable because it is interoperable.

I find the argument that we "are limiting recursion" untenable. We are
indeed placing constraints on the structure of the application, but these
constraints do not limit your ability to use recursion. What they say is
that a stylesheet that produces multiple outputs must adhere to the same
constraints as an application that produces a single output: specifically,
the processing logic must be aligned with the output structure and not the
input structure.

It's true that the restriction was not present in earlier working drafts and
in vendor implementations. We introduced the restriction because it was
discovered that the facility as previously specified (or under-specified)
was not interoperable. 

When the time comes for last call comments you will have the opportunity to
raise this as a formal comment and you will then be entitled to a formal
reply from the working group, not just an informal one from me.

Regards,

Michael Kay
