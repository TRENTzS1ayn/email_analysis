The F&O draft says:

"Functions with optional arguments are allowed. If optional arguments
are omitted, omissions are assumed to begin from the right."

Is this old text, or is this really true?  Is an argument "optional" if
it allows the empty sequence? Is it assumed to be the empty sequence if
it is omitted? 

It seems there would be some ambiguity as to how the following function
call would be interpreted:

substring ($myString, 1)

which returns a different result from: 

substring ($myString, 1, () )


Thanks,
Priscilla
