The entry for Parent of xsl:stylesheet reads "None".

It seems to me that this might be better expressed as "None in the XSLT 
namespace".

Perhaps there is a comment somewhere about what "None" means but it wasn't in 
obvious proximity to what seems an absolute statement. Maybe the reference to 
"context in the stylesheet" much earlier in the Appendix was intended to 
convey that.
