I might be wrong, but I think that: 
- in the QNAME state there should be a transition to the OPERATOR state
for the following patterns:
            - IntegerLiteral | DecimalLiteral | DoubleLiteral |
StringLiteral 

Without these the xpath statement:
   //some-node/'some literal' - is valid
and the statement
   //'some literal' - is invalid.

Please correct me if I am wrong!
