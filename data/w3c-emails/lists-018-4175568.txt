Priscilla:
The value comparison should be done on the value space and not the
lexical forms.  The value space for hexBinary and base64Binary are
binary octets.  The F&O task force recommends that the definition of
equality be changed from:

> "Returns true if $value1 and $value2 are of the same length and
contain
> the same code-points"

to:

+ "Returns true if $value1 and $value2 are of the same length and
contain
+ the same binary octets"

With this definition,

> hexBinary-equal(xs:hexBinary("0FB7"), xs:hexBinary("0fb7")) 

returns 'true'.

Would this change address your concern?

All the best, Ashok
