Didn't know that ([1]), thanks for the tip, and for the implementation :)

If you need, implemented, and use it, and if I need and will use it, 
then that's already some relevant evidence of its usefulness IMHO :)

I'm sure that others will find it useful too.

Already having it in Saxon, and hopefully seeing it in EXSLT would be OK 
for now (what do the EXSLT people on this list say?). Personally I 
believe that, as a basic and general mechanism, it belongs in the spec, 
but I can understand that you want to keep the spec small.

What do you think about the syntax?:

<programlisting>
   <xsl:serialize format="xml_snippets">
     <xsl:copy-of select="$snippet"/>
   </xsl:serialize>
</programlisting>

What do you think of (instead of adding xsl:serialize) changing the 
definition of xsl:result-document, to include something like

"If the href attribute is not present, the result of the serialization
is created in place, and not written to a file. This means it 
contributes one text node to the result of the content constructor it is 
part of."

?

TIA,
Tobi
