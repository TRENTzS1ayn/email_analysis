Hi Ashok,

Yes, it addresses my concern.  It might be worth mentioning that the
length is measured in number of octets, since two base64Binary values
can have different "string" lengths but still be equal (because of
whitespace intermingled with the base64 characters).  But, since this is
stated in the XML Schema recommendation, perhaps it's unnecessary.  

Thanks!
Priscilla
