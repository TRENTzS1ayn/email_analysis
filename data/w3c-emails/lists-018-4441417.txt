As I think I mentioned before, the only way of distinguishing positive and
negative zero that I am aware of is division: 1 div 0e0 gt 0 is true, while
1 div -0e0 gt 0 is false.

Positive and negative zero compare equal and cannot be distinguished in our
specification.

All the best, Ashok

Functions and Operators, Section 6.1 Numeric Types 


Are there any operations that distinguish a -0 from a +0 ? 
Or is the distinction only apparent on serialization ?
