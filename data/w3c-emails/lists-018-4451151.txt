For the record, I am in favour of distinct-values being defined to retain
the first occurrence of each set of of duplicates, and for the result to be
in "order of first appearance".

I think that making this implementation-defined will lead to
interoperability problems. People will discover that their favourite
implementation returns results in a predictable order, and they will come to
rely on it, which will give them problems moving to a different product.

Our data model provides sequences of values, not sets of values, and we
should therefore assume that by default, the order of the values is
significant. They can always wrap the result in a call to fn:unordered() if
they want a higher-performance implementation that doesn't retain order.
