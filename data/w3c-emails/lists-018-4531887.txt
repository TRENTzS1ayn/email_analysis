I don't think there is an inconsistency.
 
XSLT 1.0 and XPath 1.0 use namespaces to qualify variable names and function
names. We can't change that, so there is little point arguing about whether
or not it was a good idea.

This extended use of XML namespaces was first introduced in XSLT 1.0. You
may not like it, but it works, and it's too late to change it.



Which aspect(s) of the inconsistency underlying the problem are you
suggesting are immutable?

In the various draft XQuery, XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 documents it is
indicated that datatypes and functions are contained in designated XML
namespaces. A similar seeming error made in W3C XML Schema is also carried
forward into the XQuery/XPath/XSLT2 documents.

This seems to me to be in conflict with the Namespaces in XML 1.0
Recommendation which defines an XML namespace as applying to element type
names and attribute names. There is no provision that I can see in the
Namespaces in XML Rec for datatype or function names being part of an "XML
namespace".

Correcting this seeming discrepancy should be straightforward but it seems
to me that it needs to be tidied.
