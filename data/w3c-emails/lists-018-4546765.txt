The namespaces 1.0 recommendation speaks of elements and attributes as
being qualified by a namespace identifier, but it very definitely does
not say that the only things that can be so qualified are elements and
attributes.  This open-endedness is consistent with the broad principles
of extensibility that have motivated much of XML and it also reflects
current practice, as noted below.

I don't think there is an inconsistency.

 

XSLT 1.0 and XPath 1.0 use namespaces to qualify variable names and
function names. We can't change that, so there is little point arguing
about whether or not it was a good idea.

In the various draft XQuery, XPath 2.0 and XSLT 2.0 documents it
is indicated that datatypes and functions are contained in designated
XML namespaces. A similar seeming error made in W3C XML Schema is also
carried forward into the XQuery/XPath/XSLT2 documents.

This seems to me to be in conflict with the Namespaces in XML
1.0 Recommendation which defines an XML namespace as applying to element
type names and attribute names. There is no provision that I can see in
the Namespaces in XML Rec for datatype or function names being part of
an "XML namespace".

Correcting this seeming discrepancy should be straightforward
but it seems to me that it needs to be tidied.
