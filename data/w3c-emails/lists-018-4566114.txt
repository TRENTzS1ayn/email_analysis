I agree with Andrew's comment.

It's true that there are difficulties caused by the use of
namespace prefixes within attribute values and within element
content.  The problems that these uses of namespaces are
addressing are themselves not simple.

As the XML family of specifications continues to evolve, we are
starting to see patterns in the ways that namespaces and namespace
prefixes are used, and perhaps in time we will find ways to extend
XML namespaces more cleanly to information not directly held in
individual Information Set Items.

For now, if there are technical inconsistencies in the specifications,
particularly specifications currently being worked on, the Working
Groups concerned will certainly be interested in a clear and detailed
explnanation of the problems, especially if possible solutions are
offered!  As Mike Kay said, though, it's too late to make people
stop doing what they are already doing without providing an
alternative mechanism.

Best,

Liam
