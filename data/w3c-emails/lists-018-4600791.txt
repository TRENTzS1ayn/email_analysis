The rules for duration overflow/underflow are the rules agreed to by the
F&O taskforce and ratified by the two WGs.  For seconds values the
overflow/underflow rules do follow the rules for decimals.  For the
other components they follow the same rules which are different from the
rules for integer overflow/underflow which allow more latitude.

This is not an editorial fix.  If you think these rules need to be
changed please ask that this issue be reopened. 

All the best, Ashok
