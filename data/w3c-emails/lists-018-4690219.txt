Steve:
Thank you for your comment.  I've fixed the example which seemed to
reflect some outdated thinking.  But, as you know, the comparison of
time values is an issue we have reopened and are currently discussing.
So it is possible that the semantics of the time comparison functions
will change in future versions of the document. 

All the best, Ashok
