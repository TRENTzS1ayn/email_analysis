I'm not 100% positive that this message answers that request, but...

There is a new Java Specification Request (JSR 225) to establish a *Java* 
API for XQuery.  Of course, that doesn't address users of other languages, 
and probably not the needs of script writers, but it is likely to help Java 
programmers.

Hope this helps,
    Jim
