Not so!  See extract from the XQuery document below.

The F&O uses "context node" as a default argument for several functions
with
an appropriate error message.

"The context item is the item currently being processed. An item is
either an atomic value or a node. When the context item is a node, it
can also be referred to as the context node. The context item is
returned by the expression ".". When an expression E1/E2 or E1[E2] is
evaluated, each item in the sequence obtained by evaluating E1 becomes
the context item in the inner focus for an evaluation of E2."
  

All the best, Ashok
