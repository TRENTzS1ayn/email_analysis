I think this decision made sense for numeric return values: for example,
get-day-from-date returns an integer in the range 1 to 31, which does not
map exactly to any of the built-in subtypes of xs:integer, and is a subrange
of several of them.

I don't think it makes so much sense in this case. The range of values of
the result of local-name() is precisely the range of values permitted by
xs:NCName, and there is also a match between the intended semantics of this
type and the actual semantics of the return value. Function composability
would be improved by returning xs:NCName, because the return value could
still be used anywhere an xs:string is required, and could additionally be
used in places that expect an xs:NCName.

The only downside is that this requires xs:NCName to be present in the
static context. Currently XSLT "basic" does not include this type in the
static context for XPath expressions.
