My understanding is that the xsi:nil attribute is not directly
accessible for validated elements.  It is, instead, reflected in a
'nilled'

property.  So we need to make this change to fn:deep-equal.

 

My hesitation in making this change is because I don't know what happens
if the element is not validated and typed as "anyType".

The datamodel document says the nilled property is not set.  See quote
below.  Does this mean I can access the xsi:nil attribute?

Or is this information not available at all? 

 

Norm, can you please clarify.

 

<quote>

If the [validity] property exists on an element node and is "valid" then
nilled may be set. The nilled property is never set for nodes that have
not been successfully schema validated.

All the best, Ashok

Won't two nodes that differ in their "nil" property always differ in
their xsl:nil attribute as well?

Functions and Operators, Section 15.2.1 fn:deep-equal 


What is the effect of the "nil" property of the nodes ?
