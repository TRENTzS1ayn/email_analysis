Michael:

Thanks for your comment.  I have added appropriate wording.

Please make a suggestion for the font for "numeric".  As you know,

we have had difficulty finding appropriate fonts and have an open item

on using a different font for situations where the return type varies 

depending on the type of the argument(s).

All the best, Ashok

Class: Editorial      
 
section 6.2: Term "numeric": Use different font since it is not a true
type and give explanation of the following form: In this recommendation,
we use the pseudo-type numeric to indicate that a function may take any
of the numeric types as its argument. For example, a function f with the
signature f($x as numeric) as ... represents the following functions
signatures: f($x as xs:decimal) as..., f($x as xs:float) as..., f($x as
xs:double) as.... It is represented in a different font since it is not
part of the language but only used for definitional purposes.
