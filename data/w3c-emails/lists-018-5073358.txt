Thanks!  Done!

Only the 4 numeric types and the two duration subtypes or types derived
from them can be averaged.

All the best, Ashok

Functions and Operators, Section 15.3.2 fn:avg 

It has already been pointed out (in a reply to
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003May/0243.html
) that "date/time values" do not "support addition and division by an
integer", and so cannot be avg'ed. 

We would like to see a list of supported built-in types included in the
definition of fn:avg.
