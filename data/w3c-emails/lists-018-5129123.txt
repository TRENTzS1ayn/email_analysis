I would be inclined to put fn:string() and fn:number() together in a new
section "5.3 Conversion Functions". (Under 5 Constructor Functions). They
are clearly misplaced at the moment.
 
(Alternative: list all functions alphabetically and abandon all attempts at
logical grouping).

fn:number is listed under Functions and Operators on Nodes because it used
to take a node as argument.

It now takes item()?.  I don't feel strongly about where it goes but I'm not
sure whether there is a clearly better home for it.

All the best, Ashok

Functions and Operators, Section 14.1.4 Why is fn:number <fn:number>  listed
in the "Functions and Operators on Nodes" section ?
