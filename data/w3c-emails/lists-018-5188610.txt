Thanks for the quick reply,

[I am looking at the latest public version of F&O, 2003-05-02]

I understand that you cannot construct xs:NOTATION, but it is not clear to 
me from the specs that this applies to all types *derived* from 
xs:NOTATION.  Are they dissallowed as well?

I think this should be made clearer, since in the casting table we are 
allowing casts from xs:NOTATION to xs:NOTATION, which implies that there 
is some way to get a hold of a value of type xs:NOTATION or derived from 
it.

Thanks again,
Caroline
