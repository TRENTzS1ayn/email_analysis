These things are not functions. They don't behave like functions (in
computing a value that depends on the values of the arguments), they merely
use a function-like syntax.

The intention is that the bindings of fn:, xs:, and xdt: should be
explicitly defined in the specifications. The op: prefix doesn't need a
user-visible namespace because it's not intended that the functions should
be user-visible.

Constructor functions such as xs:date() must be provided by every
implementation. I would expect them to be very widely used.
