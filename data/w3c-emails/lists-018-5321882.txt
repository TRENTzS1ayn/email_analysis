[AM] Adding functions for these selectors analogous to the op: functions
is an interesting idea but there is a great deal of resistance to adding
yet more functions to the F&O.

[AM] These prefixes are bound to namespaces.  See section 1.7 of the
F&O.

[AM] The conformance issues for the F&O have still to be dealt with.  We
will keep your suggestions in mind.
