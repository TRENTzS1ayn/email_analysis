Thanks for the comment.

XSLT is a functional language designed to be side-effect-free. It therefore
relies heavily on recursion rather than iteration to implement such
algorithms. You will find that many complex graph-based algorithms have been
implemented in XSLT: look for example for Dimitre Novatchev's FXSL library.

If you have problems coding particular algorithms in XSLT, you can usually
get help from the xsl-list at www.mulberrytech.com.

XSLT 2.0 contains many features which make complex algorithms easier to
write than in XSLT 1.0 (for example, through the introduction of sequences
in the data model), but we don't intend to change the fact that it remains a
pure functional language.
