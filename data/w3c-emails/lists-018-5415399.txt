*untypedAtomic values are cast to string 



Just for comparison or also in the result? 

 

Good question. Since the most likely scenario is that if any values are
untyped, then all values are untyped, it probably makes most sense to leave
them as untyped in the result.

I think the rules for fn:distinct-values should be: 

* untypedAtomic values are cast to string 
* non-comparable values are allowed, and treated as distinct
