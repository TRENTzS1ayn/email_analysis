Namespaces are not about disambiguating the semantics of names, just
names as such and their ownership.  The fact that given a name in a
namespace per XML Namespaces 1.0 you can't even tell whether it names
an element, and attribute, an ID or all three already makes that
clear.

This is not a bug, it's a feature -- as Michael Kay says,
interpretation is always context-bound, that's in the nature of names.
