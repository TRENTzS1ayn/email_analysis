The definition of the fn:tokenize() function says:

 "If the supplied $pattern matches a zero-length string, the
  fn:tokenize() function breaks the string into its component
  characters. The nth character in the $input string becomes the nth
  string in the result sequence; each string in the result sequence
  has a string length of one."

In the example above, the pattern ".?" is a pattern that matches a
zero-length string; therefore, the fn:tokenize() function breaks the
string into its component characters. You would get the same behaviour
from any pattern that matches a zero-length string, such as "" or
".*".

Does that explain the example sufficiently?

Cheers,

Jeni
