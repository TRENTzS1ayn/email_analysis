Hi Ashok

I see (there are a lot of specs to read ...).

1.

I think the example in the spec can confuse.

Why use
  fn:tokenize("abba", ".?") returns ("a", "b", "b", "a")
and not (add)
  fn:tokenize("abba", "") returns ("a", "b", "b", "a")
?

2.

What should
  fn:tokenize("abba", ".")
return?
(Not sure if it's ("","","","",""))
Perhaps it would be a useful example.

3.

You also might want to consider adding an example where the pattern 
matches something in the input and an empty sequence is returned, if 
there are such cases.
