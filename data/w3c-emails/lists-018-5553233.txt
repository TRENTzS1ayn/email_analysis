It is indeed my favourite language, I recommend to try it out :)
As anything else it has it's pros/cons, but it's fun to work with.

But I just used it to illustrate stuff, and also to show what I would 
expected (stating it would be "commonly expected regex behaviour" was 
indeed quite speculative, sorry).

I know that the F/O WG chose different behaviour/semantics; I hope it 
will prove to be useful in everyday work. (I'm not sure about the 
usefulness of all those zero-length strings in the result sequence for 
example)

Happy to be of help.

I appreciate your work on all this!

So far I've experienced great joy but also bad headaches while working 
with XSLT 2.
