Pick away! That's the only way we'll all understand things the same (and

That is my interpretation...that that first sentence was meant as a 
high-level summary of what the function is supposed to do, not a "rule" 
that gives the detailed semantics.

I see your point. My interpretation --- that the sentence you quoted is 
not a "rule", but a "summary" --- would not dictate the sort of addition 
you propose. Other interpretations (that the sentence is a normative 
"rule") would require such an addition/clarification.

Now you're talking about something substantive! I think you said that 
the intended semantics are too confusing and that a pattern like "b?" 
should match "b" in preference to the zero-length string. (That is, if 
there is one or more instances of "b" in the input string, then match 
it/them and match the zero-length string only if there are no instances 
of "b".) Is that a proper interpretation of your statement?

I *personally* have no preference about this. I have a very strong 
preference of not violating the principle of least astonishment, though. 
But I must yield to the educated opinions of others who are familiar 
with various regular expression-using languages. The issue is certainly 
on the table as a result of the comment and I'm positive that the F&O 
Task Force will discuss it in some depth.

Many thanks,
