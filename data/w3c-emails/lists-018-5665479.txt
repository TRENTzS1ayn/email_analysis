"The regular expression syntax and semantics for these functions are 
identical to those defined in [XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes] with the 
following additions:
[...]
Two meta-characters, ^ and $ are added. In string mode, the 
metacharacter ^ matches the start of the entire string, while $ matches 
the end of the entire string.
