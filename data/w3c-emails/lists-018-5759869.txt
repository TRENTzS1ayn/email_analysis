Section 3.7.1.3 "Content" of the new XQuery draft does not say what 
happens to namespace nodes in the content of a direct element 
constructor.  There are two choices:

(1) They are allowed, and treated as in the context expression of a 
Computed Element Constructor.  I.e. they must precede attributes which 
must precede other content.

(2) They are not allowed, in which case the specification should say 
that, as it does for document nodes.

I think (1) is more consistent.  Otherwise, why can the content of a 
direct element constructor allow attributes but not namespaces, while 
the content of a computed constructor allows both?

An alternative is to dis-allow *both* attributes and namespace nodes in 
direct element constructors, since you can create attributes using both 
literal attributes as well as attribute nodes in enclosed content, and 
that's arguably a bit of a weird hack.  Since we have computed element 
constructors, we don't need this special handling.
