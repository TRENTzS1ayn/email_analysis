The new 'local' predefined namespace prefix hints at the possibility of 
module-location definitions, but isn't quite there.  But only a few 
minor changes would be needed:

To: "The names of all variables and functions declared in a library 
module must be explicitly qualified by the target namespace prefix"
(in 4.1) add "or the predefined 'local" namespace prefix."

To section 4.7 Module Import add somewhere somethinga like: "Any 
variable or functions declarations using the prefix 'local' in the 
module to be imported are not imported.  Such definitions are only 
visible within the library module, and never confict with definitions in 
other modules."
