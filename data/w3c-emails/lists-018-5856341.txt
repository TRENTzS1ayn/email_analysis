This is an excellent observation - I like this idea, and I will raise it in 
the Working Group.

One word of warning: there's a pretty strong feeling that we want to be 
done with XQuery as soon as we can, and there's some resistance to adding 
anything not essential at this point. But if we wanted to go this route, we 
would need to do it in XQuery 1.0.
