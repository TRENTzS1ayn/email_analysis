I'm having trouble figuring out how to respond to your comment below
from
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jul/0106.html

Could you please provide some guidance?

[82] 7.4.11 normalize-unicode: 'full normalization' needs a defition of
the
     relevant constructs. For strings, the string itself is most
     conveniently the relevant construct, but this should be said
     explicitly.


All the best, Ashok
