Another example of this error in the Xquery (and Xpath) spec

3.5.1


  If $book1 does not have exactly one author subelement, a type error is raised.[err:XP0004][err:XP0006]

  $book1/author eq "Kennedy"


I believe that if static typing is enabled, it is not enough that $book1
only has one author child, it must have been schema typed so that only
one author child is possible in any instance, otherwise the static type
of the lhs of eq is going to be a sequence not a single string (or
single untyped value).
