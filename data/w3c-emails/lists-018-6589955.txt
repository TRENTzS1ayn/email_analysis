Hi Per,

Element constructors use the syntax of XML, which does not require 
namespace declaration attributes to occur before other attributes. If we 
made the change you suggest, suppose that a user wants to write a query by 
cutting existing XML text and pasting it into a query, adding dynamic 
content - this user would have to make sure that all namespace declaration 
attributes occur first, which means editing the text everywhere that this 
is not the case.

To me, this seems like an ease-of-use versus ease-of-implementation issue, 
and the implementation is not all that difficult.
