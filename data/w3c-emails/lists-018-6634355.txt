Regarding Schema Mapping, the last case where:

[minOccurs="n" maxOccurs="m"]occurs
==
*

In my opinion, since neither n nor m can be zero, this really
should be + and not * since * can be zero.

Also, the conditions for n and m are written as:

where n >= m > 1

Shouldn't that be:

where m >= n > 1

?
