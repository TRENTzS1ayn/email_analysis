Because someone might want to (say) generate a report or a file
as a text (non-html) file, and it is useful to have a standard for this.

E.g. given some numbers, I might want to produce a "report" like:

   The max is 99 and the min is 5.

A user expect to be able to write:

   "The max is ",max($vals)," and the min is ",min($vals),"."

or:

   concat("The max is ",max($vals)," and the min is ",min($vals),".")

depending on what the standard specifies wrt to whitespace.  But it is
useful for the standard to specify a specific result so I know what
output to expect for a given program.

True most of the time.  But sometimes one wants to be able to generate
simple non-HTML output.  I think this is a useful feature, and I think
people will expect portable results.

Perhaps the "text output model" sufficies for these applications - but
unfortunately there appears to be no standard way to set serialization
parameters in an XQuery program, like you can for XSLT.  Also, it seems
less intuitive to have to write:

   <result>The max is {max($vals)} and the min is {min($vals)}.</result>

only to want the <result></result> to disappear.
