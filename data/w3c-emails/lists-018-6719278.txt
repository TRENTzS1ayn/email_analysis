[Michael Rys] I am sure that there will be enough other differences to
make the code to run on all systems problematic. There are enough
implementation variations that you get by implementing arithmetic for
example on different platforms, that you will have to deal with that. 


[Dimitre Novatchev] It is not a good practice to justify one bad design
decision on the basis that anyway there are a lot more (problems stemming
from other) questionable design decisions. In this way we can justify
almost everything and there's no sense in discussing problems at all.

I would like to see David's concern addressed more seriously and not
simply turned away without giving it any consideration at all.

Or is it the official position of the WG that no attention will be paid to
problems of portability?

Thank you,

Dimitre Novatchev.
