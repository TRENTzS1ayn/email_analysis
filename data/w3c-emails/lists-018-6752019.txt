Of course, but this is accepted and anyway most queries are not doing
large scale numerical calculations one would hope.

But there is a vast difference between differences in numerical results
and differences that mean that the majority of queries written will fail
to even complile on some conforming implementations.

For Xquery this is perhaps a sustainable view but for Xpath find it
surprising that you are not even concened that the majority opinion in
XPath implemntors appear to be that the interoperability problems and
general typing complexity is so great that the implementations (and
therefore one assumes, the users) should stick with XPath 1.

I think that the case for having an optional component of XPath that
completely destroys any chance of interoperability just has not been
made.
