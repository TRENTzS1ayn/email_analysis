Note that I am arguing from an XQuery point of view (given that this is
the topic of the subject line). I am not sure how you are planning on
using XPath in an interoperable way, since there is no conformance
requirement for XPath itself (it is given by the host language such as
XSLT). But I agree that many (but not all) XPath standalone uses
probably are less likely to use conservative static typing. 

Best regards
Michael
