Sarah:
Thank you for your comment.  The rule is that the op: functions that
back up operators should not accept the empty sequence since the empty
sequence is handled at the language level and the function never sees
it.  Thus, 
op:subtract-dates
op:subtract-times 
should not accept the empty sequence.

The F&O Taskforce agreed to make this change on the 12/2 telcon.

All the best, Ashok

Subject: [F&O] subtracting date/time with empty sequence


I'm curious why the subtract functions on date/time were changed to 
take the empty sequence but the ones on durations were not. Is this a 
bug or is there a decision behind it?

The ones that can take the empty sequence are:
op:subtract-dates
fn:subtract-dateTimes-yielding-dayTimeDuration
fn:subtract-dateTimes-yielding-yearMonthDuration
op:subtract-times

The ones that cannot are:
op:subtract-dayTimeDuration-from-date
op:subtract-dayTimeDuration-from-dateTime
op:subtract-dayTimeDuration-from-time
op:subtract-dayTimeDurations
op:subtract-yearMonthDuration-from-date
op:subtract-yearMonthDuration-from-dateTime
op:subtract-yearMonthDurations
