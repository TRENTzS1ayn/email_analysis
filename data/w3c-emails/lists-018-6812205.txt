I think that the language would be better without this in the core, and
users would benefit from being given a complete definition in the
appendix that they could tune to their own needs, however in either
case, I think that if you want to ignore comments the rule should be
for elements, if it has no element children, compare the _string value_
this will get rid of the anomalous text node slitting due to comments
and pis.
