Thanks for your observation about the fact that we aren't ignoring the
existence of comments and PIs. Solving this isn't easy.

If there are no element children, comparing the typed value makes sense. But
mixed content is tricky. We could specify in prose that comments and PIs are
(completely) ignored, but it's not so easy to specify in XPath code. (It
could be done in XQuery or XSLT by constructing  new trees with the comments
and PIs removed, and then comparing the new trees).

I also think we should ignore whitespace-only text nodes in element-only
content.
