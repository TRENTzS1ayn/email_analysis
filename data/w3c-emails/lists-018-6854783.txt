If you are trying to do this in XSLT or XPath, I suggest you raise the
question on the xsl-list at www.mulberrytech.com
<http://www.mulberrytech.com> . Please be explicit about the form of your
input and desired output.

Subject: Date Format!


Hi!
 
I am facing a problem on date format.  I want to know is there is any way to
add days to a date.
Currently, I retrieve the date value from the XML using substring.
But that is not recognized as a date format.
Therefore, when I add a value to it, say for example 3 + $deliveryDate, it
won't be able to produce the exact result.
I saw a lot of article written about the xalan or exslt in processiong the
date format.
However, I would like to know whether there is any general way to implement
it.
 
Please help.
Your help is really appreciated!
