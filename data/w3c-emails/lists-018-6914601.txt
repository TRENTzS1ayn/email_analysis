"2.4 Predicates
An axis is either a forward axis or a reverse axis. An axis that only ever
contains the context node or nodes that are after the context node in
document order is a forward axis. An axis that only ever contains the
context node or nodes that are before the context node in document order
is a reverse axis. Thus, the ancestor, ancestor-or-self, preceding, and
preceding-sibling axes are reverse axes; all other axes are forward axes.
Since the self axis always contains at most one node, it makes no
difference whether it is a forward or reverse axis. The proximity position
of a member of a node-set with respect to an axis is defined to be the
position of the node in the node-set ordered in document order if the axis
is a forward axis and ordered in reverse document order if the axis is a
reverse axis. The first position is 1."

This is the first paragraph of section 2.4 Predicates. It deals
exclusively with axes and its place is in section 2.2 Axes.


Thanks,
