Dimitre:
My apologies!  Re. the example in 15.1.8.1, $seq is defined at the start
of 15.1 before 15.1.1.  The wording now says that $seq is non-empty. 

All the best, Ashok

Ashok,

Thanks for considering my comment.

I am one of your users. How many other users did you contact and got
their
feedback that this change in the name wouldn't benefit them? If other
users were not contacted then what is the model of a user the WG has, on
the basis of which your conclusion was made?

This does not address the second part of my original comment, which
treated the correctness of example 15.1.8.1


Thanks,

Dimitre Novatchev.
