I am not insisting on changing the names, but was interested to understand
the logic behind these names.

I also thought that the fact that the following expression is an identity
(the constant true()):

  not(empty($seq)) = exists($seq)

would be easier to understand with these names:

 not(empty($seq)) = non-empty($seq)

and the user would have to remember one name less.


Thanks to your clarification I understand that brevity was preferred over
logic in this case.


Thank you,
