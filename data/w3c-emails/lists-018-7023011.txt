but neither the xml rec nor infoset give any authorisation to call such
text nodes insignificamt and drop them It's also mightly inconvenient
for users when the spaces between words vanish just because words are
marked up (marking up words in documents being the main point of xml
after all)

The ony reason that the current behaviour in IE might be considered
conformant is that it would be conformant for XSLT1 to take every input
document as <x>hello world</x> and ignore any xml file, the mapping from
input XML  to initial tree is sufficiently lax. XSLT2 here it is stated that
you are suppoised to parse the document and build an infoset, having done
that where does this magic "insignificant" white space come from?

It applies equally (perhaps more so) to the implicit initial input as
well as documents loaded via doc(unment).
