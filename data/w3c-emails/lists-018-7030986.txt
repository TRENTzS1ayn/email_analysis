We have seen the data model generation as an application that
understands xml:space="default" and "preserve" and have furthermore
decided that it is up to the upper-specs and implementation to define
what the "default" behaviour is.

I find this logical and consistent. If you want to get the upper-specs
to mandate options to provide both skip and preserve as options, then
please indicate where and how. We will certainly look at this.

Thanks
Michael (speaking for myself, but trying to avoid unraveling the specs
at the wrong place)
