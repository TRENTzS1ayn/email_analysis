Just a note (as the originator of the original comment, but not of this
sub-thread) to say that I'm perfectly happy to wait. having been on the
other side of this process several times now with MathML, I know how
long it takes to decide on responses (and coordinate getting feedback
back to the original reviewers).

I also appreciate getting personal feedback from WG members (even when I
don't agree with it:-) so long as it is clearly marked as not a final WG
position I think it's helpful to understand how the spec gets into a
certain state. (Michael, Michael, and Ashok are particularly to be noted
for making speedy replies.)

David
