Thanks for the comment. Unofficial interim response: 

We had some debate on this question and I think the results were somewhat
inconclusive. We need to sort this out.

The danger is that if we specify that the stylesheet is a DM document,
rather than serial XML, then that's one more place for little
interoperability problems to creep in. But we do tend to describe the
semantics of instructions on the assumption that they are nodes in a tree,
so I think it makes sense to go down that route.
