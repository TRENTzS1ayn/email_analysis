OK, thanks, I did miss that (and now I am wondering how), but 19.2.2 says
"Validation is never applied to temporary trees, nor to document nodes created
using xsl:message, even if the default-validation attribute of the containing
xsl:stylesheet element requests validation."

Does this intend to say that a temporary tree's element & attribute nodes
actually can be validated individually as they are created, but that a
temporary tree's document node cannot be validated at any time?
