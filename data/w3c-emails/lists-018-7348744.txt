> 16.1 Multiple Source Documents
has the reference

     As described in 2.3 Initiating a Transformation, the media type is
     available as part of the evaluation context for a transformation.


Which confused me as I couldn't see anything in 2.3 of relevance.

I think this is supposed to be a link to
5.3.2 Initializing the Dynamic Context
specifically, its last paragraph.



16.1 has several comments such as


    then the fragment identifier is interpreted according to the rules
    for the media type of the resource identified by the URI,

    [ERR XT1190] It is a non-recoverable dynamic error if a resource
    contains octets

which are slightly problematical as (not wanting to start a www-tag
style thread on the semantics of uris) Resources are not returned, only
representations of resources and the media type is attached to
the representation that is returned, not the resource itself. In
particular several different representations, with different media
types, can be returned for the same uri depending on what media types
you say you can accept in your (typically http) request.

However I think that the paragraph in 5.3.2 (once I'd found it:-)
addresses that as it indicates that as far as the processor is concerned
each uri is either unkown or will have a private mapping that will
specify one representation with one media type. But perhaps a slight
re-wording here would help.
