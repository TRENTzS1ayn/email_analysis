Nothing seems to be specified about the number of digits that
should be generated when casting from double or float to string.

whether the absolute value is within or without the range of 1e-6 to 1e6
the problem is the same: "the" canonical lexical representation,
  as defined in [XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes] doesn't precise it.
