I think it's probably wishful thinking to imagine that we can pin everything
like this down in the specs. The XML spec, for example, says that attribute
order isn't significant, but it nowhere states that element order *is*
significant. Equally, I don't think we say anywhere that 2+2 is 4. But since
a product that produces 5 is going to lose market share quite rapidly, I'm
not too concerned.
