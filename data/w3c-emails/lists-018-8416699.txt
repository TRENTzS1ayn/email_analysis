Well, that depends on whose definition of "worthwhile" you're using.

Most people involved in, say, the food industry would think that the 
duration of "1 hour 30 minutes" would be important without regard to a 
specific dateTime, as in "cook at 200?C for 1 hour 30 minutes".  Similarly, 
a courier service whose business depends on their guarantee that "we'll 
deliver anywhere in the same country within 18 hours" would certainly like 
to be able to prove the truth of that statement automatically (which means 
they need to represent it in their original XML documents).

You might not think these are "worthwhile use cases", but a lot of real 
users out there in the community will certainly think so.  What about 
somebody who wants to find out how long in advance of a party --- any 
party, on any day --- they have to start preparing food, when they have 
only a single oven and 4 dishes that require the use of that oven...to be 
processes serially.  Surely they'll want to add together all of those 
durations, even though they haven't decided whether to hold the party on 
Friday, Saturday, Christmas, or 3 years from now.

This is an astonishing statement.  What about "do I have time to cook 
dinner between the time my wife phones me to say she's leaving work and the 
time she gets home --- even though I do not yet know when she'll be phoning 
me?"  All I care about in that comparison is knowing whether the meal 
preparation time is less than, greater than, or the same as my wife's 
travel time.

Any dateTime that I might use in performing such comparisons is entirely 
arbitrary and doesn't really have anything to do with the problem I'm 
solving.  As a poor husband trying to get dinner ready for his family, I 
don't want to have to remember to slip in an unnecessary date (e.g., 
January 1 at noon) just to compare the length of time it takes for me to 
prepare a meal with the length of time it takes for my wife to drive home.

Sorry to be so strong in my disagreement, but I do feel very strongly that 
durations exist, and should be manipulable, in the absence of specific 
dateTimes.

Hope this helps,
