Hi Mike (Luu),

To me, this looks like a programming question rather than a comment on our 
specification. Would you agree that it does not need to be entered as a 
public comment, or do you think there is an issue with the XQuery language 
that needs to be tracked?

If you post programming questions to www-ql@w3.org, that will help simplify 
our tracking of issues.
