My apologies - I found the values for the variables in the example, I hadn't backtraced far enough. 
I would suggest a  link be added, so that backwards scanning isn't necessary.

In the examples section for fn:number the values for $item1 and $item2 are missing. 


14.1.4.1 Examples 


*fn:number($item1/quantity) returns 5. 

*fn:number($item2) returns NaN.
