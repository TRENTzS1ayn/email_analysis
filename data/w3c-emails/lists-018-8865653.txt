Dear workgroup:

I am looking for information on XML industry standards within the Search
market.  More specifically, are pure XML data feeds the industry standard or
are different formats most commonly used?  Is there a group looking at this?

Any direction or answers are greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Liz Laub
Sr. Product Manager
