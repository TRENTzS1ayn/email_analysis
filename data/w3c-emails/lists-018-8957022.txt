The data model document says:
   Document, element, and processing-instruction nodes have a
   base-uri property. If that property is non-empty, its value
   is returned.

   If the accessor is called on a node that does not have a base-uri
   property, or whose base-uri property is empty, the base-uri of that
   node's parent is returned. If the node has no parent, an error is
   raised.

The functions and operators document says:

   For document and element nodes, this function returns the value of
   the base-uri property. For other kinds of node, it returns the empty
   sequence.

So if T is a text node that has a parent:
   dm:base-uri(T) returns dm:base-uri(dm:parent(T)).
   fn:base-uri(T) returns ().

If this is correct, perhaps it is worth a clarifying note.
