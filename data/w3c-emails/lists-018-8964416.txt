XSLT 2.0 section 20.3 says:

  The html output method should not perform escaping for the content of
  the script and style elements.

According to HTML 4.01 section B.3.2, "</" within the content of a
SCRIPT or STYLE slement should be escaped.

It also indicates that unencodable characters appearing in a SCRIPT or
STYLE element "must" be escaped according to the conventions of the
script or style language's syntax -- they cannot be written as character
references. This is a bit unreasonable to impose on an XSLT processor;
nevertheless, it should be acknowledged. Processors should be given the
option of performing such escaping, and a fallback behavior (of emitting
a character reference anyway, I presume) should be defined.
