I think I would like to move (as we have done recently with the XML
indenting rules) to a more prescriptive statement of exactly where an HTML
indenter may add whitespace, rather than describing it in terms of the
effect on visual appearance.

The rules, I think, are:

(a) whitespace must only be added before or after an element, or adjacent to
an existing whitespace character

(b) whitespace must not be added adjacent to an inline element, the inline
elements being those included in the %inline category in the HTML DTD

(c) whitespace must not be added inside a formatted element, the formatted
elements being pre, script, style, and textarea

and as you point out, "whitespace" in the above should mean "white space as
defined in HTML 4.01 section 9.1.
