That sounds good.

Those are the rules we're following in 4Suite, and they seem to result in
safely indented output. However, there's one exception in our implementation: 
since Netscape 4.x wrongly fails to ignore certain instances of whitespace
appearing between td and tr tags, we have added 'TD' to the set of inline
elments.

I doubt you really want to mention that exception in the spec, but I was
thinking it would be nice to have an annotated version of the spec(s) for
implementers and users alike, so people could share knowledge like this. Tim
Bray's annotated XML spec [1] was, and still is, a huge help to me -- and
others, I'm sure. I am thinking that a more modern version would work like the
very successful PHP docs [2]: split up the spec into separate sections, each
with its own little moderated message board below it.

Hooray! Now I can add all those zero-width spaces and form feeds ;)
