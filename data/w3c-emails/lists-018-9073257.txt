It would be an option, with pros and cons; the current behaviour would 
still be available, and would be the default, and could also be the 
default for XHTML output. No one would miss anything.

Neither do I.
I can't see what part of my post suggested to do that.

If all elements of the whole doc/file are in the XHTML namespace, then 
it seems to be quite a faithful representation to add one default 
namespace declaration on the root element thus qualifying all elements.

No! Sorry for the confusion. (The null namespace mention was an 
unnecessary and confusing addition; please delete it from your memory :)

I need XHTML output with a single namespace declaration, on the root 
element. And I need a way to specify that, so that I can rely on it, 
100%. (I can not manually check each output file)

single-ns-decl="yes" or "no" seems to be one way to offer this assurance.
