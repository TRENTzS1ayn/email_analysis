Thanks for the examples, I see now what you are getting at. Your
"multi-decl" example has a completely redundant namespace declaration on the
"body" element. I 

The current rules don't prohibit a serializer from outputting redundant
namespace declarations, but I had always assumed that no half-decent XSLT
processor would do this! Because the namespace declaration is redundant, of
course, there is no problem asking the serializer not to output it.

I'm happy to add a note to the XHTML serialization description advising
implementors that outputting redundant namespace declarations is a bad idea.

Regards,

Michael Kay

http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines is not normative, and could not 
be. So each developer has to find the best compromise for each scenario 
with its specific set of requirements. Some of these solutions to achive 
maximum backwards- and forwards- compatibility include one namespace 
declaration.

BTW, the example in Appendix C http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines
has a single one :
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
