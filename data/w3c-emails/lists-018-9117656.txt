Note that the "accessors" tables in the data model spec (for example
in section 4.8.3 in the November draft) say that the base-uri of
text (for example) is ().

The table for dm:base-uri for Processing-intruction also lists (),
but eariler it states  "Document, element, and processing-instruction
nodes have a base-uri property."
