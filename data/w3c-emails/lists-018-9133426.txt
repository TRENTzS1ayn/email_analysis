We provide the user with the option to include or exclude the XML
declaration using the omit-xml-declaration attribute. I'm happy to add a
reference pointing readers to this section of the XHTML spec for advice on
how to set this option.

Thanks for pointing it out.

"C.1. Processing Instructions and the XML Declaration

Be aware that processing instructions are rendered on some user agents. 
Also, some user agents interpret the XML declaration to mean that the 
document is unrecognized XML rather than HTML, and therefore may not 
render the document as expected. For compatibility with these types of 
legacy browsers, you may want to avoid using processing instructions and 
XML declarations. Remember, however, that when the XML declaration is 
not included in a document, the document can only use the default 
character encodings UTF-8 or UTF-16."

I have no preference, neither for in- nor exclusion of the XML prolog, but I
need consistent results across XSLT processors.

Perhaps it would make sense to specify in
   http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#xhtml-output
that the XML prolog must be included, or omitted.
