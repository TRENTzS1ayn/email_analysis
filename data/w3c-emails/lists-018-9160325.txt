At the risk of stating the obvious (or what I assume to be the obvious) could 
it be made clear in title of the next WD for the following documents,

http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlquery-full-text-requirements/
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlquery-full-text-use-cases

that they apply to XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0? Assuming that is, in fact, the 
case.

Corresponding mention of version numbers might also be useful somewhere in 
the introductory text of each document too.
