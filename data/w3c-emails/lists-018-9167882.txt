At first sight it seems to me that the Requirements document has confused 
terminology. It is certainly confusing to me - although it is late in the 
evening.

Have the terms for MAY and SHOULD and their corresponding defintions been 
reversed? They don't correspond, for example, to the definitions in the XML 
Query 1.0 Requirements document.

If so, is there any easy way to tell which should be disregarded in the text 
for the Full-Text Searching Requirements document?

Or would it be simpler to issue a corrected version?
