The definition of SCORE seems to be pretty wooly. I tend to be suspicious of 
definitions which include the word "reflect".

I assume that the authors of the document have a particular context and 
meaning in mind. It would be useful to modify the definition and/or provide a 
link so that the reader could be clearer about the author's intent.
