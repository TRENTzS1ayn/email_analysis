Michael,

Thanks for the reply.

I used the term "apply to" not "are part of".

In my (casual?) approach the unqualified term "XPath" refers to XPath 1.0. In 
the WG's casual approach is something different intended by the unqualified 
term XPath? Presumably it is.

Am I correct in assuming that the full-text search material does *not*, for 
example, apply to XPath 1.0 and is not usable with XPath 1.0? Should that not 
be made clearer?
