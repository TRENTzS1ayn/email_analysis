Dear Todd

 

Thanks for your comment. The requirement document does not say that the
fulltext system has to always do stopword elimination. What the
requirement says is that the full text language component of XQuery must
have the ability to provide support for stopword elimination.

 

Does this clarify this requirement?

 

Best regards

Michael
