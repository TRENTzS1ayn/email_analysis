You question how different corpuses can be supported given the following
requirement:

 

  XQuery/XPath Full-Text MUST NOT require an explicit definition of the
global 
  corpus statistics (statistics, such as word frequency, used in
calculating SCORE). 

 

The point of this requirement is that this area should be left to
implementations to provide what they consider the most appropriate
statistics. It also does not preclude implementations to provide in the
environment of XQuery or via implementation extensions to provide a
parameterization of such information. It was felt that requiring the
standard to provide for that parameterization and explicit definition
would go beyond the scope of defining the first version of Fulltext
search in XQuery....

 

I hope this addresses your comment.

 

Best regards

Michael
