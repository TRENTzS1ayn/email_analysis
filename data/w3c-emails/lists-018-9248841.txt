Hi,

I need some clarification on the namespaces used for constructors and 
datatypes.

In the F&O spec, section 1.5 it says:

The URIs of the namespaces are:
  * http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes for constructors 
  * http://www.w3.org/2002/11/xquery-operators for operators
  * http://www.w3.org/2002/11/xquery-functions for functions.

Which implies that constructors are in the 
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes namespace

In XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes section 3.1 (Namespace Considerations) 

  The ?built-in? datatypes defined by this specification are designed to be 
  used with the XML Schema definition language as well as other XML 
  specifications. To facilitate usage within the XML Schema definition 
  language, the ?built-in? datatypes in this specification have the 
  namespace name: 

  http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema

  To facilitate usage in specifications other than the XML Schema definition 
  language, such as those that do not want to know anything about aspects of 
  the XML Schema definition language other than the datatypes, each 
  ?built-in? datatype is also defined in the namespace whose URI is: 

  http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes


Does this mean that either namespace can be used, even in the case of 
construction?

Thanks for any clarification,
