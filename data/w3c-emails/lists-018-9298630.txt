Subject: fn:codepoints-to-string clarification


Hi,

The current Functions and Operators spec 
(http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-operators/#func-codepoints-to-string) does 
not specify what should happen if fn:codepoints-to-string(integer*) is 
given an integer that is out of range or one that is negative.

Thanks,
