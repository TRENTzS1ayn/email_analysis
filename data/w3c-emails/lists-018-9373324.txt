I could buy that -- they both mean the same thing, just that form (2)
would need to do an extra static type check (and could throw a static
type error).

And are you saying that

element bar of type xs:integer

would be a static error if element bar was globally defined to be of
type xs:decimal, even though xs:integer is a subtype?  (I think this
makes the most sense to me, but still begs the question -- why allow
this syntax at all?)

Another way to look at this is to say that (1) has a default type - the 
type found in the global bar element declaration. Then and (2) have the 
same semantics - they both match an item if the item's element name and
the 
type correspond to the name and type of the SequenceType.

Is that a bridge we could sell you?
