   Hello!

   XSLT 1.0 forbids using of disable-output-escaping to generate value of 
   comment, processing instruction or attribute node. XSLT 2.0 WD states the 
   same. What's the reason behind this restriction?


I'm not on the WG but at least for PIs and comments d-o-e isn't really
appropriate as there is no escaping to be disabled. & isn't special
there, 

<x>
<?a &< ?>
<!-- &< -->
</x>

is well formed despite the unescaped &s and <s. Thus a & or < appearing in the
value of these nodes already has to be output by the XSLT serialiser
as if doe was set.
