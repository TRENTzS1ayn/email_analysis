In 5.2 it is indicated that detailed definitions of the semantics of subtype 
substitution and type promotion are to be found in Appendix B of XQuery 1.0.

In Appendix B the description of subtype substitution seems to be principally 
by example, rather than any detailed definition. I suggest that this be 
reviewed with a view to making the definition of subtype substitution in 
Appendix B more comprehensive.
