In the definition of the typed-value accessor it is stated that the typed 
value of a node is "a sequence of zero or more atomic values".

I can visualise the scenario when the sequence consists of zero or one atomic 
values. However, I am having difficulty in understanding precisely what the 
typed value of a node might be when the sequence contains more than one 
atomic value.

The mention of the typed-value accessor being similar to the string-value 
accessor doesn't help to clarify that scenario ... at least for me.
