In the Introduction in XQuery 1.0 it is stated, "The XQuery data model 
defines the information in an XML document that is available to an XQuery 
processor.".

Since the data model allows a document node to have more than one element 
node children (Data Model 4.2.1) it seems to me that the XQuery data model 
defines something in addition to the information available in an XML 
document.

It seems to me that some qualifying text should be added in the relevant part 
of XQuery 1.0 Introduction.
