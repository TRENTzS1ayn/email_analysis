In Data Model 4.2.1 it is stated that the XQuery 1.0 document node is 
"essentially identical" to an XPath 1.0 root node. I am dubious about that 
statement.

My understanding of an XPath 1.0 root node is that it was limited to having 
only one element node child, which is not the case for the XQuery 1.0 
document node. So they are not identical.

I suggest that the WG consider revising the statement in 4.2.1.

In addition in numbered points 2, 3 and 4 I suggest that "document" be 
replaced by "document node". This will avoid confusion when the reader then 
reads about a "well-formed document" (not a node) immediately afterwards.
