This section has recently been rewritten. But you're probably right.
Typed value should return zero or one atomic values, I think.

/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In the definition of the typed-value accessor it is stated that the typed 
| value of a node is "a sequence of zero or more atomic values".
|
| I can visualise the scenario when the sequence consists of zero or one atomic 
| values. However, I am having difficulty in understanding precisely what the 
| typed value of a node might be when the sequence contains more than one 
| atomic value.
|
| The mention of the typed-value accessor being similar to the string-value 
| accessor doesn't help to clarify that scenario ... at least for me.
