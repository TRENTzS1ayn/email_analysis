/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| My understanding of an XPath 1.0 root node is that it was limited to having 
| only one element node child, which is not the case for the XQuery 1.0 
| document node. So they are not identical.

That is not the case. Document nodes in XSLT 1.0 can have multiple
children. (They can be external parsed entities.)

| In addition in numbered points 2, 3 and 4 I suggest that "document" be 
| replaced by "document node". This will avoid confusion when the reader then 
| reads about a "well-formed document" (not a node) immediately afterwards.

I'm not sure what draft you're reading. The removal of constructors has had
substantial changes in the introduction of each node type.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
