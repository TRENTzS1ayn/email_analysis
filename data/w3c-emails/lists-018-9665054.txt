I don't think that's accurate. I would have gladly done that if the Working 
Group had asked me to. At the time, we had decided not to support 
cross-document references or to use the => operator in XQuery, and the WG 
had also decided that we didn't like the structure of the data or find the 
particular set of queries realistic. We felt that a better set of use cases 
for references would be desirable.

Developing this set of use cases, however, was beyond what there was time for.

I don't think the old use case REF was a good illustration of user problems 
that need to be solved. It wasn't realistic enough to be useful. And that's 
one of the things that axed it as a use case. Perhaps we should have waited 
until we had a better set of use cases before killing the old one...
