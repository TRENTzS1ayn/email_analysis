We're publishing the full test build with every draft.  Follow the link
from the XQuery public page that reads "XQuery 1.0 Grammar Test Page" (I'm
not sure if there is a stable URL for the latest).  xpath-grammar.xml
itself is at
http://www.w3.org/2002/11/xquery-xpath-applets/xpath-grammar.xml (or just
follow the link from the test page).

Thanks for your other bug discoveries.  Fixes are in process!
