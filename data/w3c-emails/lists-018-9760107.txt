By my reading of http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/HTML4.decl, HTML 4.0 not
only forbids the use of the characters that are forbidden in XML, it also
forbids characters #x7F-#x9F. Should the HTML output method enforce this?

At its meeting on 9th Jan 2003, the XSL WG decided to close this issue
(issue 159) by stating that it is an error to serialize a result tree
containing these characters using the HTML output method, but that the
serializer is not required to report this error.

This closes the issue as far as XSLT 2.0 is concerned. The question also
affects XSLT 1.0. We have no immediate plans to issue any further errata for
XSLT 1.0, but if we ever do so, this clarification will be added.

Thanks for making the comment.
