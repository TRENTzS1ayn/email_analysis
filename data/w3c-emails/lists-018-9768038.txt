In a comment on the last draft I queried the result of this function in
the case that the entity had no PUBLIC id.
In your reply you suggested that the text should have an "issue" and that
perhaps () rather than "" should be returned.

I think that the text is unchanged in this draft and I don't see a
specific issue in the document.

At its meeting on 9th January, the XSL WG decided to close this issue (issue
158) by specifying that in the case of an unparsed entity with no public
identifier, the function unparsed-entity-public-id would return a
zero-length string.


Thanks for making the comment.
