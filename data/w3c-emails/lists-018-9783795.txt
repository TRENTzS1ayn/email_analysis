We're trying hard to make sure all grammar assertions are validated, that
it is a functional grammar without ambiguities, and that it can be
processed by traditional parser compilers.  We're building up a reasonable
test suite of expressions, and also add all expressions appearing in the
drafts, and regression test with every pub.

It's an evolving process... we're not done.  The reason we that we provide
intermediate drafts is so we can get feedback, but we don't claim that any
intermediate draft is perfect.  Hopefully they are improving.

I don't know how correct your implementation is, or what techniques you
used.  Our goal is to prove you can implement a LL(1) grammar.  Without
parse time lookahead, the states as shown are the best we could do in
JavaCC (though, like I said, there were production problems in the last
draft... so the tables are worse than the source).   If you have ideas for
simplification, please do be specific, though it might be better to wait
until the actual grammar has fully stabilized.

We don't mean to imply an implementation strategy... we just want to make
sure we're not missing necessary information.

No, we need the information to be abstract.  If the tables don't contain
information above the grammar and basic lexical description, then, yes,
they should probably be removed.
