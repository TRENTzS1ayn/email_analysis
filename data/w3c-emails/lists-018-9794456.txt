Fair enough.  I'm often too critical of these intermediate drafts.

However, my last comment on publishing a program (in pseudo-code, say) still
holds.  When you can illustrate an algorithm clearly, precisely, and
completely using pseudo-code in less space than a prose description, I think
it merits consideration.  But then, I'm a big fan of Dijkstra. :-)
