/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| It seems to me that the prose "The pseudo-code syntax defines functions to 
| construct values, called constructors; and functions to access parts of 
| values, called accessors" could be better written as "The pseudo-code syntax 
| defines functions, called constructors, to construct values and functions, 
| called accessors, to access parts of values".
|
| It seems to me that the terms constructor and accessor are applied to the 
| functions, rather than to the values.

Most of this pseudo code has been discarded. I think this comment has been
overtaken by events.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
