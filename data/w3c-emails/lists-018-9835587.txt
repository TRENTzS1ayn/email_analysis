/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In the list of infoitems, for consistency with the XML Infoset REC consider 
| renaming "unexpanded entity item" as "unexpanded entity reference item".

Done.

| Was the omission of an accessor for this kind of information item in the 
| paragraph which follows deliberate?

Yes, they never occur in the data model.

                                        Be seeing you,
