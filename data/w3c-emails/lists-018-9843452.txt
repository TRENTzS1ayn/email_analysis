/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In the Abstract of the Data Model WD no mention is made XPath 2.0 in the list 
| of specifications which depend on the Data Model.
|
| I suggest that XPath 2.0 be explicitly mentioned in the Abstract, to minimise 
| the impression that XPath 2.0 is the poor relation in the emerging 
| specification documents.

Fixed.

| Also, the specificity of the reference to [XPath] later in the Abstract would 
| benefit by being expressed as [XPath 1.0], there and elsewhere in the 
| specifications.

Good point.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
