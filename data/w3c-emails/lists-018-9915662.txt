Logically, you're probably right. However, the spec is trying to make it
clear to readers that you can't use xsl:attribute to create namespace
declarations. If this were moved elsewhere, people looking up the spec of
xsl:attribute would be likely to miss it. This is essentially an editorial
judgement - we try to balance being formal and logical with being helpful to
the reader.

Actually, the selection of a prefix for element and attribute names is
effectively done as part of the namespace fixup process, not as part of
serialization. The fixup process generates namespace nodes (i.e. prefix=uri
pairs) for all required namespace URIs. The serializer is free to select a
prefix if there is more than one available, but it can't dream up new ones.
This has changed since XSLT 1.0, and is necessary because result trees (in
the guise of temporary trees) are now visible to the application.

We generally take the position that it should not be possible to create a
result tree that cannot be serialized as well-formed XML. This is why, for
example, we don't allow a comment node to contain "--", and why we don't
allow two attributes on the same element to have the same name.
