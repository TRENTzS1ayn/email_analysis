The original namespaces spec said the opposite: "the prefix xmlns is not
bound to any namespace name".

Perhaps when the spec was changed by this "erratum", a corresponding erratum
should have been issued to XPath saying that this change did not imply that
there was a namespace node for "xmlns". Unfortunately, errata issued by one
WG are not reviewed by other WGs, as they probably should be.

No, it shouldn't. The prefix "xmlns" is not an inscope namespace in the
normal sense - it cannot be used in the prefix of element or attribute names
or (I believe) in QNames-in-content.

The XPath 2.0 data model gives implementors (or higher-level specs)
discretion over which namespace nodes will be present. In XSLT, the
intention is to have no change from 1.0 in this respect - which means there
is a namespace node for "xml", there is none for "xmlns". In XQuery, the
namespace axis is not exposed so it doesn't make too much difference, but
once we have sorted out all the other namespace issues in XQuery we probably
need to check that the specs are clear on this point.

Yes, I think this has already been picked up.
