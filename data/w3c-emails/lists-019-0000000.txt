Hi

just some wishes/suggestions:

1.
It would be useful to have a diff version ("HTML with revision 
markings") for
http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/
and
http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-operators/
(ideally for all changed specs),
as exists for
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/ .

2.
It would be handy to have versions consisting of chunked (X)HTML, also 
offered as .tar.gz or .zip, with relative links (pic urls in CSS, links 
to CSS, pic urls in (X)HTML). Chunked HTML would be much easier on the 
UA, especially when three and more cross-referenced specs are read as one.

3.
The links
"HTML without revision markings"
on
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xslt20-20030502/
and the link
"HTML with revision markings"
on
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xslt20-20030502/Overview-diff.html
each point to the page they are on, but that's not very clear. Perhaps 
they could be omitted.

Tobi
