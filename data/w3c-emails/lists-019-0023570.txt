David,

I was a little surprised to see the term "root node" used in the above quote 
from 3.2. Isn't XPath 1.0 "root node" now "document node" in XPath 2.0?

Or is "root node" in XPath 2.0 now being used to mean both document node and 
whatever other node type fn:root() can return (cf F&O 14.1.9)?
