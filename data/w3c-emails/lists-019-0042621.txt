The third para starts

  Character mapping is applied to the characters that actually appear in
  a text or attribute node in the data model, before any other
  serialization operations such as escaping or Unicode normalization are
  applied 

The 6th para (just after the Note) says

  Character mapping is applied to the characters that actually appear in
  a text or attribute node in the data model, before any other
  serialization operations such as escaping or Unicode normalization are
  applied.

which doesn't say anything very new:-)


The section should probably say something about what the sets of
replacements should look like. In particular whether it is an error to
list the same character with two replacement texts, and if so whether
recovery is allowed.
