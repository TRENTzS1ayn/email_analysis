In multiple places in the Serialization document and in Chapter 20 of XSLT 
2.0 the term "sequence" is used in phrases such as "sequence of octets", with 
a meaning different from the meaning when "sequence" is used elsewhere in the 
collection of specifications.

I wonder if a term like "succession", "chain" or "series" when referring to 
the serialization process might reduce the potential for ambiguity and 
confusion.
