Good reading :-)

The sentence in XPath Chapter 2 is basically trying to say that

$a is ((), $a) 

which does not imply that a sequence has identity but that a singleton
can be treated like a singleton list.

I think some editorial rewording may solve it. What about:

An item $x is identical to a singleton sequence containing that item in
the sense that $x = ((), $x).

?

Best regards
Michael
