Michael,

If the phrase "is identical" (which for me is an absolute term) was replaced 
then the seeming inconsistency would, I think, be resolved.

In your suggested solution replacing "is identical" with "is equivalent" (or 
something similar) would satisfy me. I am happy to leave it to the WG to tidy 
this up.

Regards

Andrew Watt
