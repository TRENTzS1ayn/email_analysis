The May draft is unclear about whether there can be more
than one library module with the same target namespace.
The description of ModuleImport implies that the import
is from *a* library module.  However, the write-up of
ModuleDecl just says the URI "serves as the target namespace
of the module."

It is a lot easier for an implementor if there is at most
one module for a given URL.  I assume that is the intention,
but I think it should be made unambiguous.
