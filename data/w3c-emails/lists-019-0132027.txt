In looking at 3.2 in Data Model there is a description of document order in 
*documents* and mention of free-standing nodes. But there appears to be no 
mention of document order in fragments.

It seems to me that fragments may have document order. 

Was it a conscious choice not to discuss this in the Data Model 
specification? Or is it intended that the document order which is specified 
for *documents* is also intended to apply to fragments?

I have a supplementary question on fragments which I will send in a few 
minutes. It may impact on this question.
