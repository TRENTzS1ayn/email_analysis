In 3.3 of Data model mention is made of "sequences of fragments and sequences 
of documents". I assume that the intention is to refer to sequences of "root 
nodes" and sequences of "document nodes"?

I think I know what is intended but the way it is phrased opens the 
possibility of sequences of things other than atomic values and nodes. Some 
rephrasing seems desirable.
