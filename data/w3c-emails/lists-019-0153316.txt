In the penultimate sentence of 3.3 of Data Model mention is made of 
serialization via the infoset.

However, the infoset is not mentioned anywhere in the new Serialization WD, 
as far as I can see.

Two suggestions:
1. There should, perhaps, be a cross reference from Data Model to 
Serialization
2. The descriptions of serialization might better be more clearly aligned 
between the documents.
