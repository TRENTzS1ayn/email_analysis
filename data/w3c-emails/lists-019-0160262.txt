In 4 of Data Model mention is made of fragments which, it is stated, don't 
have a document node as "root node".

Which other node types can be a "root node"? It isn't stated. Can all 6 other 
node kinds be a "root node"? If so it should be stated, if not then that too 
should be made clear.

Can, as an edge case, a "tree" have a "root item" i.e. an atomic value? Not 
much of a tree, I admit. :)

In a Note in 4.2.1 it is stated that document nodes and XPath 1.0 root nodes 
are essentially identical. It seems a little perverse, to me at least, to use 
the term "root node" in XPath 2.0 to contrast with "document node" (as in 4) 
while recognising that a document node and an XPath 1.0 root node are very 
similar.

As a final point re 4, the term "root" (unqualified) and the term "root node" 
are both used in the same section. Are they synonymous? Or is some 
distinction intended?
