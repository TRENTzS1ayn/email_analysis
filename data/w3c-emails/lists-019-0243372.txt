In the XPath 2.0 data model, any node can be parentless, and any parentless
node is considered to be the root of a tree, whether or not it is a document
node.

David,

I was a little surprised to see the term "root node" used in the above quote
from 3.2. Isn't XPath 1.0 "root node" now "document node" in XPath 2.0?

Or is "root node" in XPath 2.0 now being used to mean both document node and
whatever other node type fn:root() can return (cf F&O 14.1.9)?
