  In the XPath 2.0 data model, any node can be parentless, and any parentless
  node is considered to be the root of a tree, whether or not it is a document
  node.
 

"root of the tree" is OK but I think Andrew is correct that the
document ought not to say "root node of the tree" as "root node"
even though it doesn't have a meaning in Xpath2 means something
completely different in Xpath1 and confusion between root nodes and
"root elements" (document elements) is already a major source of
confusion and FAQ's: parentless elements are not exactly going to
simplify the situation and so trying to minimise overloading of the term
root and especially of "root node" would be good I think.
