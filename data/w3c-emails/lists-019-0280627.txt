I am having problems in finding in the specs a clear description of what 
XPath 1.0 Compatibility mode actually is.

XPath 1.0 compatibility mode is mentioned as one aspect of the static 
context.

Several sections in XPath 2.0 mention XPath 1.0 compatibility mode in 
specific situations but I can't find an overall definition. Is the "best" 
description of XPath 1.0 compatibility mode to be gleaned by scrolling around 
the spec and piecing the parts together?

Appendix F seems to provide some information but is stated to be 
non-normative. There is also a non-normative Appendix B in F&O.

Am I missing a good normative description?

It seems that 3.6 in XSLT 2.0 specifies a host language way to switch on 
XPath 1.0 compatibility mode, but a clearer description of what precisely is 
being turned on would be useful.
