In the diagram in 1.2 of Functions & Operators the visual appearance is that 
the xdt:anyAtomicType type is in the same hierarchy as the W3C XML Schema 
built-in derived and primitive types.

XPath chapter 2 indicates that an atomic type is not a list type.

Three types in the F&O diagram - xsd:NMTOKENS, xsd:IDREFS and xsd:ENTITIES 
are list types, and therefore if I understand the XPath 2.0 definition 
correctly not atomic types. Therefore they cannot be derived by restriction 
of xdt:anyAtomicType.

It seems to me that the diagram in F&O 1.2 is in error.
