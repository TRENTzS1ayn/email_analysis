Note this is not a response from the WG, but I believe that assumption is
incorrect (I hope it is incorrect;-)

No, Xpath 3.1.4 Function Calls
has

2. Each item in the atomic sequence that is of type xdt:untypedAtomic is
   cast to the expected atomic type.



So I think this means that If you use a date function on a string
extracted from an untyped input doc, it will be coerced to a date type
before calling the function.
