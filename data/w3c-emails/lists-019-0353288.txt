Please review the re-issued XML Query Requirements document that clearly
states that our work in this area is not done:

"- One query language syntax MUST be convenient for humans to read and
write.

 Status: this requirement has been partially met. XQueryX was last
published in June 2001. This has been captured in issue 152 ( W3C
members only)"

> Or will a future XQueryX WD appear when the XQuery WDs are changing
less

new

Answers to these questions will depend on how the WG resolves Issue 152
and therefore are not yet available.
