Yes, no doubt.

Above I said that the function should be available to the developer, 
without him being required to write it.

But instead of suggesting that it be moved to a (to be created ?) 
standard library, you said that "deep-equality ought to be
moved to the user-defined examples appendix".

I'd be OK with moving the function to a standard library of functions, 
if this stdlib will be part of a W3C rec. [1]

(or does it (standard library of functions spec or section) exist 
already? I didn't yet read all the ten specs.)
