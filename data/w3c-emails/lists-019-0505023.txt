Actually, the November draft was confused on the subject. The value space
for dates and times, as defined in XML Schema, does not retain the timezone,
so the result shown in the example was not achievable without some special
magic.

Timezones, I'm afraid, are always going to generate surprises, whatever we
do.

To get the hours component in the original timezone, I believe that what you
have to do is:

get-hours-from-dateTime(adjust-dateTime-to-timezone($dt, ()))

This might not be very intuitive, but it's not very onerous once you know
what you're doing.

More possibilities were considered than some of us care to remember...
