Hi Tobi,

Now that we have sequence construction in XSLT 2.0 (rather than just
in XPath 2.0), there's no longer a technical requirement for
<xsl:result> -- the same effect can be achieved using <xsl:sequence>.
In addition, we don't have an <xsl:result> in template definitions, so
it seemed consistent to remove it from function definitions as well.

Cheers,

Jeni
