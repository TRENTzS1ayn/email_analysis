Yes I know (already updated my XSLTs). I just miss the expressive 
clarity: When reading a func def, one could look for the xsl:result 
element to see which result the function returns.

You could just as well have added xsl:result to templates as well :)
(except for backwards compatibility)

Anyways: It's just a minor point regarding readability of code, not one 
regarding functionality.
