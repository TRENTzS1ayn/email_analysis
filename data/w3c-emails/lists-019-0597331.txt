I suspect that I know what the "initial input sequence" is, but the 
description in XSLT 2.3 and the associated material in F&O 15.4.6 somehow 
never seems, to me at least, to get to the point and to clearly state what 
the initial input sequence is.

Perhaps all that is needed is a sentence in 2.3 making clear the relationship 
between the initial input sequence and the documents to be transformed.
