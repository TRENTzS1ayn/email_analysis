3.7 Comments, Processing Instructions, and Whitespace
Although the data model is able to represent comments, processing
instructions, and insignificant whitespace, preservation of this information
may be unnecessary and onerous for some applications.

An instance of the data model can be constructed from an Infoset, a PSVI, or
from some other data source entirely. Different applications may or may not
choose to construct nodes in the data model to represent comments,
processing instructions, and insignificant white space. These decisions are
considered outside the scope of the data model. Consequently the data model
makes no attempt to control or identify the sort of processing in this
regard that an application uses to construct a data model instance.

I am concerned about the 'may' in the first para, wrt XSLT applications.

I'd hope they would be required to be processed in an xslt application;
If such an application is using this data model, then how can that be
enforced?

E.g. I'd hope that the determination of the significance of white space is
the choice of the end user. 

Hence I disagree with this being outside the scope of this data model.
