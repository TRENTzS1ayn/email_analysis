Ashok,

It's great to have prompt responses to comments but I notice that you remove 
the document name (F&O in these cases) before responding. That breaks the 
threading of posts in the archives, which will make it unnecessarily hard to 
follow at a later date.

I guess all these recent points are easily dealt with and unlikely to be 
revisited but since public-qt-comments archives are threaded it seems to me 
to be useful to avoid breaking that threading, unless there is a good reason 
to do so.

Regards

Andrew Watt
