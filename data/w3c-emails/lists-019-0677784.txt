I am concerned at the use of the word "document" in the Data Model document.

The term "document" seems to be used for at least three purposes, as far as I 
can see.

In 4.1.4 we read, "A tree whose root node is a document node is a document". 
Well, no it isn't, not really.

It seems to me that some distinct term ... "document tree"? ... should be 
used where the sense of 4.1.4 is intended,  to avoid confusion with XML 
documents and with document nodes.

In 4.2 we find a heading "Documents" which I think is an informal shorthand 
for document nodes. Or is the 4.1.4 "document tree" sense intended in parts?

In 4.2, we have ".... XML documents. Documents have the following properties 
....". I assume that by "Documents" it is intended to refer to "document 
nodes"? XML documents qua XML documents certainly don't have the stated 
properties.

It is disappointing to see these ambiguities persisting in the Data Model 
document. I seem to recall raising this issue some time ago. In a formal 
specification document I think it ought to be tidier and that a greater level 
of precision and consistency should be aimed for and achieved. Not least when 
the specification is deemed to be in Last Call.
