Ashok,

If you look at 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003May/ and compare 
my posts with your response you will see that the F&O is stripped off.

If you look at 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003May/subject.html 
you will see that the threading is broken.

Could, by any chance, your mail reader strip off all and any characters 
before a colon character? 

I am routinely using a colon to separate document name from specific point as 
in
"F&O: Some specific comment" in headers to make identification of document 
involved easier.
