In 3.3 it is claimed that the data model supports "sequences of documents". 
As far as I am aware it doesn't.

I assume that what was intended was "sequences of document nodes".

If, however, the above was intended to convey the notion that a sequence may 
consists of nodes, atomic values and documents then other parts of the DM 
document need to be brought into line. I assume that simply adding "nodes" 
solves the seeming inconsistency.
