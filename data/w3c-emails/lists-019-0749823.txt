Hi Paul,

I think there are a few more comments already in the pipeline with a : in it. 
I will switch to using square brackets and hope that Outlook will be happier 
with that. :)

Unless I hear to the contrary I will continue using the document names in 
comments, since it seems to me to help the various editors pick out comments 
on documents for which they are directly responsible.

Regards

Andrew Watt
