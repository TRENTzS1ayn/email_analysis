I am having problems deciphering the following sentence in 3.6:

"If a PSVI is not available, then the data model is constructed from the 
Infoset in a manner that is compatible with the expectations of well-formed 
or DTD-validated parsing of an XML document."

Whose expectations are being referred to?

What are the expectations?

The sentence seems to be saying something like, "The data model will be 
constructed the way you expect for well-formed or DTD-validated XML 
documents.". But that seems to second guess what I expect which may not be 
what you assume I expect.

Something more precise in terms of wording would aid comprehension, I think.
