For some reason Outlook removes the leading "F&O:" from the subject
field when we use it to Reply to messages (I tested this). Maybe it does
it since it does this for "FW:" and "RE:" so you don't get messages with
"RE: RE: RE:" at the beginning of the subject field.? 

Andrew:? Maybe it would be better if you put the document reference in
square brackets e.g "[F&O]" in your subject fields to avoid this
problem.


Hi Paul,

I think there are a few more comments already in the pipeline with a : in it. I will switch to using square brackets and hope that Outlook will be happier with that. :)

Unless I hear to the contrary I will continue using the document names in comments, since it seems to me to help the various editors pick out comments on documents for which they are directly responsible.
