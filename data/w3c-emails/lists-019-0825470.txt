DM 4.5.2 and G.4 say that dm:parent of a namespace node
is "the parent element node".  It does not define
what this means.

However, none of the namespace nodes in D Example
show a value for dm:parent, though dm:parent is
shown for other nodes.

Should there be a constraint in 4.3.1 and/or 4.5.1 that
is a namespace node has a parent, then it should be among
the namespace of its parent?  The converse constraint would
prohibit sharing of namespace nodes, as in D example.
The issue should at least be mentioned.

One solution is to just define dm:parent of a namespace as ().
