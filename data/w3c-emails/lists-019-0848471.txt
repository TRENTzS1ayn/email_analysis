I like the change of name from insert to insert-before.  However, the
rec currently says:

"The value returned by the function consists of all items of $target
whose index is less than or equal to N, followed by all items of
$inserts, followed by the remaining elements of $target, in that
sequence."

Shouldn't that say just "less than N" rather than "less than or equal to
N"?  It seems the way it is worded, it should be named insert-after.

Also, it starts talking about "N" without introducing it in any way.  I
think this could be addressed by saying "...inserted at the position
N...." (i.e. adding the "N") in the first paragraph.

Thanks,
Priscilla
