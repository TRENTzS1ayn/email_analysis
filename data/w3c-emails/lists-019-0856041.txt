In the description of the idref function, the rec says:

"Each string in $srcval is parsed as if it were of lexically of type
xs:ID, that is, $srcval is treated as a space-separated sequence of
tokens, each acting as an ID. "

Shouldn't that say something like "...lexically of a type that is a list
of xs:ID"?  Something that is lexically of type xs:ID would never be a
space-separated list.  

Thanks,
Priscilla
