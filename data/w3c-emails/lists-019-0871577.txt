A few comments on the simple type definitions of yearMonthDuration and
dayTimeDuration:

1.  The simple type definitions use prefixed names ("xdt:...") in the
name attribute of the simpleType element.  This is not valid - the name
takes its namespace from the targetNamespace of the schema.

2.  The pattern for xdt:dayTimeDuration has line breaks and spaces in it
to format it.   This implies that those line breaks and spaces are
allowed in the pattern, which they aren't.  Even though it makes it even
less readable, I think the white space should be removed from the
pattern.

3. The sentence "In this [XML Schema Part 1: Structures] fragment, the
value of attributeFormDefault is unqualified." appears before each
simple type definition.  What does this mean?  No attributes are
declared in the example, so the attributeFormDefault of the schema
fragment is irrelevant.  Is it an explanation of why the attributes used
in the example (name, base, value) are unqualified?  If so, I don't
think that really needs an explanation.  That is the rule for _all_
schema fragments.

Thanks,
Priscilla
