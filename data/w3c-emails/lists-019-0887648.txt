On the distinct-values function:

1. Why does it matter if two values of the same type have a total order,
as long as they can be compared using eq?  For example, QNames do not
have total order but you should be able to pick out distinct ones using
the eq/ne operators.  

2.  It says that the order of the values returned is
implementation-dependent. However, it's not just the _order_ of the
values, but which values.  In the example given,

fn:distinct-values(1, 2.0, 3, 2) returns (1, 3, 2.0).

The fact that it returns 2.0 rather than 2 is implementation dependent,
regardless of the order.  I think this should be clarified.

Thanks,
Priscilla
