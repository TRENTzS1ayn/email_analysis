The intention is that the model is the same as the XPath 1.0 model, i.e.
there is a one-to-many relationship between element nodes and namespace
nodes, this relationship is called "dm:namespaces" in one direction and
"dm:parent" in the other.

You are right that this isn't clearly expressed in the current document.
