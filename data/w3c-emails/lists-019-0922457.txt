[AM] Perhaps it needs to be clarified that the target namespace of the
schema that contains these fragments is referred to by the prefix "xdt".

[AM] I'll see what we can do to fix this.

[AM] We added this text because there was a comment from a reader who
found it confusing.  If it's redundant I'm not too worried.  If it's an
error it should be fixed.
