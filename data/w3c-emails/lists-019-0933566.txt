Hi Ashok,

[PW]  But you would still need to take out the prefix.  The "name"
attribute of simpleType can only contain an NCName, not a QName.

[PW] Personally, I think it's more confusing to have it in there.  All
XML Schemas have unqualified attribute names - it's just part of the XML
Schema syntax.  If a reader isn't familiar enough with XML Schema to
know that, I'm sure they aren't going to know what attributeFormDefault
does.  If you must have an explanation, I would say something like "The
attributes in this schema fragment are not qualified, in accordance with
[XML Schema Part 1: Structures]."  or something like that. 


Thanks,
Priscilla
