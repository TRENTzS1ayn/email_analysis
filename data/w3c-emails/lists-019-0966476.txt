The name of the fn:get-local-name-from-QName function echoes the possibility 
for confusion that the XPath 1.0 local-name() function introduced. There is 
no such thing as a "local name", as far as I am aware.

It seems to me that it would be better to name the function in 10.2.2 
get-local-part-from-QName() function, since that is what it does.

I guess we may not get rid of the local-name() function as a historical relic 
but I think introducing more confusion in naming functions should be avoided.
