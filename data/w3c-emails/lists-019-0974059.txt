I would like to suggest that the function in 14.1.2 which is named 
local-name() be more correctly named as local-part().

Two possibilities occur to me. Either a straight renaming, correcting the 
potential for confusion arising from naming as local-name() in XPath 1.0 or 
allowing both local-name() (for XPath 1.0 compatibility) and local-part() in 
XPath 2.0. The idea of the latter suggestion would be to deprecate 
local-name() and signal local-part() as the function's name going forward.
