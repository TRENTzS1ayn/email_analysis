To:"Kay, Michael"<Michael.Kay@softwareag.com>,"Michael Rys"<mrys@microsoft.com>,<public-qt-comments@w3.org>

The WGs discussed your suggestions on 9/16/2003 and agreed that:

 

-          xdt:untypedAtomic values are compared as xs:string

-          the original type is retained in the result

-          incomparable values are treated as distinct.

 

These changes will appear in the next version of the document.

All the best, Ashok

I think the rules for fn:distinct-values should be: 

* untypedAtomic values are cast to string 
* non-comparable values are allowed, and treated as distinct
