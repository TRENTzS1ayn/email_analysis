Great, thanks.

I'm not sure if I understand you correctly. In order to split a string 
to it's characters the pattern that specifies the separator must match 
the zero-length string (those that are inside the word), no?

My suggestion was to add

  fn:tokenize("abba", "") returns ("a", "b", "b", "a")

... or would that return ("", "a", "b", "b", "a", "") ?
