This was discussed by the WGs and it was decided that no change was
needed.  fn:collection accepts an empty sequence and returns an empty
sequence.  It's return type is node()*.  It also accepts a zero-length
string and treats it as a relative-uri and resolves it against the
base-uri property in the static context.

 

All the best, Ashok
