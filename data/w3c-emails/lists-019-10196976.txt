Thank you for your comment.  This was discussed by the WGs and it was
decided not to include this functionality in Version 1 of XQuery.  There
has been some support for adding this functionality and it will be
considered as a requirement for future versions.

 

All the best, Ashok

Functions and Operators, Section 15.4.5 fn:collection 


It would be nice if there were some way, using fn:collection, to get
metadata (eg document name) alongside nodes, probably in a sequence of
tuples or a tuple of sequences.
