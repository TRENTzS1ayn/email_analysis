It is a function, the same way as randomize-node-set() (from FXSL) is a
function, the same way as random-sequence() is a function.

Really, this is a rather strange function and I suspect that we could talk
about it having kinda side effect because it gives some hint to the
processor, which is in fact interacting with the outside world.

Probably I'm wrong, as there is no obvious change of states or sequencing.

Probably, it would not seem so weird if there was a function

  optimizer()

and "unordered" was a possible value of one of its parameters.
