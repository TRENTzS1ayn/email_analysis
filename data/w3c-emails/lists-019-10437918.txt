How is overflow to be handled during the computation of arithmetic
functions?

For example, on implementations that choose to limit the precision of
xs:integer to (signed) 64 bit integers, should

let $max_int := xs:integer("9223372036854775807")
return avg(($max_int, $max_int))

succeed and return $max_int, fail with overflow, or is the behavior
implementation-dependent/defined?
