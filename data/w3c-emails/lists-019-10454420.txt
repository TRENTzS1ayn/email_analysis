There is a difference though.

Fn:unorder() is a function since the semantics of it has no side-effect.
It takes a sequence and returns it in a non-deterministic order. So it
is a non-deterministic function.

That an optimizer can choose to recognize the function and perform some
optimizations is just an implementation detail that does not affect the
semantics (even though it is the reason why this function exists).
