You may be right. However, all my experience as a software developer is that
if you want to ship a product with both timeliness and quality, then when
you get into the final phases you have to be prepared to throw out features
that are proving troublesome from a requirements/design point of view. We
haven't succeeded in producing a design here that keeps everyone happy, and
I think the right thing is to pull the feature rather than ship something
where half the users think we have designed it wrong.
