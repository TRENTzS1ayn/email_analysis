I'm asking about builtin functions like avg().  6.2 just addresses the
built-in operators like +, and nothing in the standard says that fn:sum()
uses the same semantics as op:add().  (Although avg() is defined to be sum()
div count().)
 
Also, I'm asking whether overflow occurs, not how the implementation is
required to handle it when it does.
On an implementation that chooses limited precision, is ($max_int +
$max_int)/2 allowed to return $max_int or must it overflow?  If 6.2 answers
this, it's not obvious.
 
 
It's ok, it's not an important question.

This is explained in section 6.2 of the Functions & Operators specification.
