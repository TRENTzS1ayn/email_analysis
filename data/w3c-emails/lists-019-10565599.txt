This can also be achieved with string-join with an empty separator.

However, for the sake of regularity and convenience I feel that concat could also
accept a string sequence in each argument (i.e. replace string? by string* in the
  prototype).

Since concat is a special function (with unlimited # of arguments)
we just have to rewrite:

     concat(s1, s2 ...sN)
as
     concat( (s1, s2 ...sN) )

and then we can treat concat and string-join similarly,
without additional complexity.
