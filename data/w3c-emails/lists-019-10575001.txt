Steve:

Thank you for your comment.  This was discussed by the WGs on 9/18/2003
and it was decided that the function was not sufficiently useful to be
included in the F&O.  If you could provide usecases perhaps you could
persuade the WGs to change  their mind.

All the best, Ashok

Functions and Operators, Section 7.4.16 fn:escape-uri 


It would be useful (and symmetrical) to define fn:unescape-uri
