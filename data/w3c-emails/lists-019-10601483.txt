It might deliver an order-of-magnitude increase in performance.

Yes, perhaps!

While XQuery implementors are definitely pursuing the need to run queries
against terabyte-sized XML databases, where optimizing by selecting the
right indexes is of paramount importance, there are also people who want to
run XSLT stylesheets directly against such databases. Since it's no burden
on the implementor to provide this function (it can be implemented as a
no-op) there would be no advantage in making it the only function in the
whole library that XSLT doesn't support.
