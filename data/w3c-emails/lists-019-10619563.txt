The WGs discussed your comment [113] in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jul/0106.html
.
that requested an additional signature for fn:resolve-uri with a node as
the second argument.  The WGs felt that such an additional signature was
not necessary because there is a function, fn:namespace-uri, that can be
used to get the base-uri of a node and pass it to resolve-uri.

All the best, Ashok
