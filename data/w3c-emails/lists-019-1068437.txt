I guess it depends what you mean by "accepts".  As I understand it the
base-uri function _accepts_ those node types, it just isn't very useful
for them since it returns the empty sequence.  

While we're on the subject, I think the current wording for the base-uri
function is confusing.  At the end of the first paragraph, it says "The
base-uri of all other node types is the empty sequence", "other" meaning
not document, element or PI nodes.   

Someone not reading this closely might interpret that as saying that the
base-uri function returns the empty sequence for those "other" node
types.   This is not true of text and comment nodes that have parents,
as explained in the next paragraph.  I think that sentence can be
removed.

Thanks,
Priscilla
