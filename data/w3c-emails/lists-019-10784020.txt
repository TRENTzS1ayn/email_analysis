Thank you for your comment.  The behaviour of the function is described
incorrectly in the current document.  For this and related functions
that check containment of one string within another, the collation first
divides the strings into collation units.  If this is done then the
issue you pointed out does not arise.  Please check the description in
the next version of the document and see if it allays your concerns.

All the best, Ashok
