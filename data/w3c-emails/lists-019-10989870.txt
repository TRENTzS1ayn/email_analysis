Above states, quote
If no initial context node is supplied, then the context item, context
position, and context size will initially be unset,  ....

It fails to state how an initial context node is supplied.
It also fails to state how a named template or node are supplied.

Guessing this might be along the lines of a parameter, then how it gets
into the stylesheet is implementation dependent.
 
How are these specified within the stylesheet?
That should not be implementation dependent, 
since subsequent processing may well depend on the selected initial context
node.

If an initial mode is supplied, the WD appears not to state how the
context node is determined.


We know how to get hold of parameters, Is this similar?
