     Thank you for submitting your comment.

     The XSL Working Group discussed your comment.  The working group 
decide not to make any change to XSLT 2.0. The working group felt that 
this sort of information about variants wouldn't be appropriate in XSLT 
2.0, but would be more appropriate in a specification that is a successor 
to RFC 3066.

     May I ask you to confirm that this is an acceptable response to your 
comment?

Thanks,

Henry
