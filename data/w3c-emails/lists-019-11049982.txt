/ Stephen Buxton <Stephen.Buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| SECTION : No particular section
|
| The typographical convention of embedding (formal) definitions
| within paragraphs, enclosed in square brackets, and introduced by
| "Definition:" seems insufficiently attention-getting. Setting each
| definition in a paragraph of its own would draw readers' attention
| to it more readily. If this is viewed as inappropriate, then we
| suggest that the introductory characters "Definition:" be
| typographically highlighted, perhaps by setting them in boldface or
| in a slightly greater point size.
|
| (Incidentally, this comment applies to several of the XQuery documents.) 

I'd like to leave them as they are. I don't think there's any
significant benefit in breaking up the flow of the document to
highlight these definitions. In fact, were it not for accessibility
issues, I'd be in favor of an even subtler presentation.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
