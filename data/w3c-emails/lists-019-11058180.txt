/ Sandy Gao <sandygao@ca.ibm.com> was heard to say:
| 2.6 "--" in comments
|
| In section 6.6.1
|
| "2. The string "--" must not occur within the content."
|
| But it's possible to have "--" in the content of comments using
| entity/character references.
|
| Proposed fix: to remove this constraint.

Entity and character references are not expanded in comments. "--" is not
allowed in a comment.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
