Hello,

     The following is a comment from IBM on the Last Call working draft of 
Formal Semantics.


Section 2.1.3

Some inference rules are written as if the order of the premises is 
significant, using terms like "first", "second", "then" (see last 
paragraph of section 2.1.5, for example).  If the order is signficant, 
that should be stated here.  Otherwise, those inferences should not be 
written as if the order was significant.

Thanks,

Henry (on behalf of IBM)
