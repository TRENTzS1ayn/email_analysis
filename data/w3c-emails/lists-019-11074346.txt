Hello,

     The following is a comment from IBM on the Last Call working draft of 
Formal Semantics.


Section 2.4.1

The second paragraph before the last numbered list states, "Notice that 
the separation of logical processing into phases is not meant to imply 
that implementations must separate the static analysis phase from the 
dynamic evaluation phase; processors may choose to perform all phases 
simultaneously at evaluation-time and may even mix the phases in their 
internal implementations."

This sentence should be further clarified.  If the static typing feature 
is in effect, and an error was detected by that subphase, the dynamic 
evaluation phase must not occur.

Thanks,

Henry (on behalf of IBM)
