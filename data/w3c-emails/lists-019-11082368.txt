Hello,

     The following is a comment from IBM on the Last Call working draft of 
Formal Semantics.


Section 3.1.2

The penultimate paragraph refers to the "fs" namespace, and indicates that 
it is a static error to define a variable in that namespace.  However, 
section 2.5.1 indicates that the "fs:" prefix is a notational device, and 
that there is no namespace that corresponds to it.

Thanks,

Henry (on behalf of IBM)
