Hello,

     The following is a comment from IBM on the Last Call working draft of 
Formal Semantics.


Section 6.2.6

The paragraph between the two inference rules for fn:sum indicates, "The 
second form of fn:sum takes one argument, with an implicit second argument 
of the integer value 0.  In this case, the result type is the union of 
target type T and xs:integer."  However, F&O section 15.3.5 states "If the 
converted sequence is empty, then the single-argument form of the function 
returns the xs:double value 0.0e0."

The inference rule here needs to be made consistent with the description 
in F&O.

Thanks,

Henry (on behalf of IBM)
