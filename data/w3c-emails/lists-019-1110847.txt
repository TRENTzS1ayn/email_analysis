From section 5.
quote.
The value space of the atomic values is the union of the value spaces of the
nineteen primitive XML Schema types.
unquote.

Does this imply that no types (or at least atomic types) from
any other source are valid within this data model? 

Is this lockout for anything other than XML schema types or
some direct derivation?

Or more specifically, lockin to XML schema types?
