/ XML Query <xmlquery@us.ibm.com> was heard to say:
| Data Model Appendices E, F, and G are very long and completely redundant 
| to material that has already been presented elsewhere. I think these 
| appendices should be deleted. Deleting them will eliminate 16 pages (out 
| of 78 total) without any loss of content.

I am strongly opposed to this suggestion. These appendixes are
generated automatically, so there is no danger that they will be out
of sync with the rest of the specification. I feel that they provide
concise and useful summary information. Note, in particular, that the
"seven kinds" links in Section 5 are pointers directly into appendix
E. Without that appendix, there would be no concise summary of what
the accessors return.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
