/ Michael Rys <mrys@microsoft.com> was heard to say:
| Section 6.3.4 Construction from a PSVI
| Editorial
|
| "Infoset-only processing does not apply to subtrees that are "skip"
| validated": Shouldn't this be "Infoset-only processing does apply to
| subtrees that are "skip" validated"?

I don't think so. We don't apply infoset-only processing to any
document that has been schema validated. (If we did, you could get
weird inconsistencies due to the mixture of DTD-based attribute types
and schema-based attribute types, I think.)

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
