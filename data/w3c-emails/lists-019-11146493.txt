/ Michael Rys <mrys@microsoft.com> was heard to say:
| Section 6.2.3 Construction from Infoset
| Editorial
|
| Enumerate all special attributes and not only a few.

I'd rather not. As it's worded now, it will apply equally well if
someone adds a new "special" attribute in the future.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
