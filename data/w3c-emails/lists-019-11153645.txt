/ Michael Rys <mrys@microsoft.com> was heard to say:
| Section 6.1.2 Doc Nodes 
| Editorial
|
| Entity properties are only useful if DTD processing is being done. Make
| clear that last para in 6.1.1 refers to these two properties.

I don't understand this comment. The last para reads:

  Implementations that support DTD processing and access to the
  unparsed entity accessors use the unparsed-entities property to
  associate information about an unordered collection of unparsed
  entities with a Document Node.

which refers explicitly to the 'unparsed-entities' property. To which
(other?) two properties do you refer?

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
