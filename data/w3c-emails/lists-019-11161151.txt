The XSL WG discussed this proposal today and decided not to accept it.

The WG at present is disinclined at this stage of the game to include new
features that expand the scope of the language yet further. While the ideas
in the proposal are powerful and have a certain appeal, we need to know when
to stop. As someone commented, if we extend xsl:analyze-string to be a
complete lexical analyser, the next step will be to turn xsl:for-each-group
into a complete syntax analyser...

So the answer is: sorry; perhaps in version 3.
