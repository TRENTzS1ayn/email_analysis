I agree,  but I think it could be good idea to mention that string after
second tag-separator
could be used in implementation defined way.
 I guess that at least Java processors would use the sting  the same way
which is to
 map to the variant.

     Thank you for submitting your comment.

     The XSL Working Group discussed your comment.  The working group
decide not to make any change to XSLT 2.0. The working group felt that this
sort of information about variants wouldn't be appropriate in XSLT 2.0, but
would be more appropriate in a specification that is a successor to RFC
3066.

     May I ask you to confirm that this is an acceptable response to your
comment?

Thanks,

Henry
