/ "C. M. Sperberg-McQueen" <cmsmcq@acm.org> was heard to say:
| 2.2. Node identity
|
|     Sections 3.1 and 3.2 raise the question of node identity and stable
|     ordering.
|     Does a node maintain its identity on being modified? on being added to
|     another tree? If so, wouldn't its ordering change?

Nodes in the data model are not modified or moved. They must be copied.
Therefore their neither their identity nor their ordering can ever change.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
