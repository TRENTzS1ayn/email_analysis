This draft contains:

<xsl:copy-of
  select = expression
  copy-namespaces = "yes" | "no"
  validation = "strict" | "lax" | "preserve" | "strip"
  type = qname />


In the previous draft the separator attribute was present.

In generating a pipe separated list in XSLT with text method output,
I found that attribute very useful.

What alternative replaces it please?
If none,
  what was the justification for its removal?
