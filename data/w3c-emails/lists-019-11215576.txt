Yes and you could have tried to think about it. How would you solve the
"dangling else" problem?

Such a question would be incorrect. Any "if then else" construct has the
dangling else problem. The designers of XSLT took a correct decision,
which eliminates this problem.

Because you don't understand the real issues -- see above.

Because the designers of the language made a correct decision.

Because the respected designers of the language do not want to create
intentional problems in this well-thought and elegant language.
