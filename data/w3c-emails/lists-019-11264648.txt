But these languages are not with xml syntax. One of the goals of having
xml syntax is that the structure must make understanding the meaning quite
easy -- not to rely on other, less intuitive and visual rules.

This is how I understand the question of Mike Kay:

"How would you associate the <xsl:else> with the <xsl:if>? Perhaps by
wrapping both of them in an <xsl:choose>?"

If this were often the case, I'd use exclusively xsl:when and not xsl:if

As or the inconvenience of rewriting xsl:if to xsl:chose with an xsl:when
child, this is certainly so. As is writing code in any programming
language without the support of a good IDE.

I was surprised that my message might be referred to as hostile and I
deeply apologize if someone could think so. The use and existence of
xsl:if and xsl:choose is something very basic in XSLT. My personal
expectations from this list and the work of the WG is to see discussions
of really new and useful features of XSLT 2.0. For me a discussion about
adding an xsl:else certainly does not fall into that category.
