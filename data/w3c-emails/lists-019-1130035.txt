Issue-0004: Schema/DTD says:

Date: Oct-2000

Raised by: Datamodel Editors

Description: A document may refer to a DTD and have an associated schema.
Currently, content model from the DTD is ignored, as are unique IDs from the
schema. A coherent priority or merging strategy is needed.

Any strategy developed must also address the issue of types derived from
xs:ID.

Resolution: Infoset-only processing is performed if and only if schema
processing was not.

So how does this align with 

15.4.2 fn:id
fn:id($srcval as xs:string*) as element* 
Returns the sequence of element nodes with ID values matching the values of
one or more of the IDREF values supplied in $srcval. Each string in $srcval
is parsed as if it were of type xs:IDREFS, that is, $srcval is treated as a
space-separated sequence of tokens, each acting as an IDREF. These tokens
are then included in the list of candidate IDREFs. 


The data model implies I've lost the id attributes of type ID,
the function implies all params of fn:id() are id values of type IDREF?

Is this a contradiction?

More importantly,
  Two documents:
   Second identical to the first, except that it is well formed only.
  the first defines id values as being of type ID.

With 1.0
In the first I can use the id() function.
In the second the function effectively fails.

What's the position with 2.0 for these two cases?
