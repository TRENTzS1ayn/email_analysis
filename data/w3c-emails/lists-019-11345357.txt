Henry,
Thanks for your response. I understand why the working group has chosen 
not to provide this feature in XQuery Version 1, and I do not intend to 
pursue this issue further at this time.
Regards,

Don,

     In [1] you submitted the following comment on the serialization 
draft:

     Thank you for submitting this comment.

     The XSL and XQuery working groups considered your comment and related 
comments.  There was general agreement that there is some need for a 
mechanism for serializing arbitrary sequences that preserves most or all 
of the properties of the items in an arbitrary sequence that is being 
serialized.

     However, the working groups decided that precisely defining all of 
the requirements for such a mechanism at this stage would be difficult, 
and would likely lead to a solution that would not satisfy real user 
requirements.  Therefore, the working groups decided to consider such a 
feature for a future revision of the recommendations, and close this 
comment without any changes to the specifications.

     May I ask you to confirm that this resolution is acceptable?

Thanks,

Henry
