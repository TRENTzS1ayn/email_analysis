Don,

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working 
Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization:

XML Query wrote on 2004-02-02 07:15:26 PM:>

     Thank you for your comment.

     The XSL and XQuery Working Groups discussed your comment and decided 
that the note was intended to indicate that if the user would like type 
annotations to be preserved, the user should ensure the data model that 
the sequence that is input to the serialization process uses xsi:type and 
xsi:schemaLocation attributes.  The note wasn't intended to grant a 
license to the serialization process to manufacture such attributes.

     In order to clarify this, the working groups decided to replace the 
note in the bullet 5 of section 4 with the following:

<<
Note: In order to influence the type annotations in the data model that 
would result from processing a serialized XML document, the author of the 
XSLT stylesheet, XQuery expression or other process may wish to create the 
data model that is input to the serialization process so that it makes use 
of mechanisms provided by [XML Schema], such as xsi:type and 
xsi:schemaLocation attributes.  The serialization process will not 
automatically create such attributes in the serialized document if those 
attributes were not part of the result tree that is to be serialized.
>>

     As you were present when this decision was made, I will take it that 
the decision is acceptable to you.

Thanks,

Henry
