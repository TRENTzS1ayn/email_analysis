Don,

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working 
Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization:

> The Serialization document says nothing about how the "nilled" 
> property of an element node is serialized. Does this property always
> result in an xsi:nil attribute on the generated element? Does this 
> process depend on anything (for example, the type of the element 
> and/or whether it is "nillable")? 

     Thank you for your comment.

     The XSL and XQuery working groups discussed your comment and decided 
that it could happen that an element has the nilled property with the 
value true, but has no xsi:nil attribute.  The working groups decided to 
add a note stating that, in such cases, the serialization process will not 
create an xsi:nil attribute for the element.

     As you were present when this decision was made, I will take it that 
the decision is acceptable to you.

Thanks,

Henry
