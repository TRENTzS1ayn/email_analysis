15.4.4 fn:doc
fn:doc($uri as xs:string?) as document? 


No mention of the current 1.0 practice, fn:doc('')
retrieving the current stylesheet.

Please add that back in if its been removed.
If its still available, please document it.
If its been replaced please annotate to locate it.


I regret the change from document() to doc().
An unnecessary change from an xslt perspective,
requiring work which is not necessary
when migrating from 1.0 to 2.0

What was the justification for the name change?
