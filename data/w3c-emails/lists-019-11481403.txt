Mary,

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working 
Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization on behalf of the XML Schema 
Working Group.

> [I] [Section 4.3: XML Output Method: the indent Parameter] licenses the
> addition of additional whitespace; this is not called out as permitted 
under
> the rules in section 4, however.

     Thanks to you and the XML Schema Working Group for this comment.

     The XSL and XQuery Working Groups discussed the comment, and agreed. 
The following item will be added to the bulleted list in section 4 to 
address this comment:

<<
o Additional text nodes consisting of whitespace characters may be present 
in the new tree and some text nodes in the new tree may contain additional 
whitespace characters that were not present in the original tree if the 
indent parameter has the value yes, as described in 4.3 XML Output Method: 
the indent Parameter.
>>

     May I ask you to confirm that this response is acceptable to the XML 
Schema Working Group?

Thanks,

Henry
