Steve,

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working 
Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization.

> SECTION 4: XML output method
> 
> Setting the indent parameter to yes may introduce additional
> whitespace in the output.  Reparsing the output value may 
> retain this additional whitespace, for example, if it is added
> to an element of mixed content.  This exception is not listed.
> (You have an exception for the character expansion phase, but
> the indent parameter is processed by the Markup generation 
> phase, so the exception for character expansion does not 
> cover the action of the indent parameter.)

     Thank you for your comment.

     The XSL and XQuery working groups discussed your comment, and agreed 
with your analysis.  The following item will be added to the bulleted list 
in section 4 to address this comment:

<<
o Additional text nodes consisting of whitespace characters may be present 
in the new tree and some text nodes in the new tree may contain additional 
whitespace characters that were not present in the original tree if the 
indent parameter has the value yes, as described in 4.3 XML Output Method: 
the indent Parameter.
>>

     As you were present when this decision was made, I will take it that 
the decision is acceptable to you.

Thanks,

Henry
