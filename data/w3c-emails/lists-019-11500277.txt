Steve,

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working 
Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization.

> SECTION 4: XML output method
> 
> Final bullet says "Additional nodes may be present in the new tree
> .. due to the character expansion phase of serialization."
> Could you please give an example of how character expansion can
> cause new nodes?  I don't see how any of the four kinds of
> character expansion (URI escaping, CDATA sections, character
> mapping, special character references) can cause a new node.
> While these character expansions might change the physical 
> presentation of a text node, I don't see how they can cause one
> text node to become two text nodes, for example.

     Thank you for your comment.

     The XSL and XQuery working groups discussed your comment, and decided 
to add a note to clarify the situation.  I would like to add the following 
note to the final bullet of the bulleted list in section 4.

<<
Note:  The use-character-maps parameter can cause arbitrary characters to 
be inserted into the serialized XML document in an unescaped form, 
including characters that would be considered part of XML markup.  Such 
characters could result in arbitrary new element nodes, attribute nodes, 
and so on, in the new tree that results from processing the serialized XML 
document.
>>

     As you were present when this decision was made, I will take it that 
the decision is acceptable to you.

Thanks,

Henry
