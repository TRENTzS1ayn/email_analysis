Mary,

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working 
Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization on behalf of the XML Schema 
Working Group.

> [H] [Section 4: XML Output Method] The exception to the 
round-trippability
> of the serialization is unclear: "Additional nodes may be present in the 
new
> tree, and the values of attribute nodes and text nodes in the new tree 
may

expansion

>

this

in

     Thanks to Mary and the XML Schema Working Group for this comment.

     The XSL and XQuery Working Groups discussed the comment, and decided 
to add a note to clarify the situation.  I would like to add the following 
note to the final bullet of the bulleted list in section 4.

<<
Note:  The use-character-maps parameter can cause arbitrary characters to 
be inserted into the serialized XML document in an unescaped form, 
including characters that would be considered part of XML markup.  Such 
characters could result in arbitrary new element nodes, attribute nodes, 
and so on, in the new tree that results from processing the serialized XML 
document.
>>

     May I ask you to confirm that this response is acceptable to the XML 
Schema Working Group?

Thanks,

Henry
