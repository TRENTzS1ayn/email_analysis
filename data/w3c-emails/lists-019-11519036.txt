Don,

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working 
Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization.

> Serialization Section 4, "XML Output Method": Bullet 7 says that 
> "Additional nodes may be present in the new tree" due to character 
> expansion. Please explain how character expansion could result in 
> new nodes and provide an example. 

     Thank you for your comment.

     The XSL and XQuery working groups discussed your comment, and decided 
to add a note to clarify the situation.  I would like to add the following 
note to the final bullet of the bulleted list in section 4.

<<
Note:  The use-character-maps parameter can cause arbitrary characters to 
be inserted into the serialized XML document in an unescaped form, 
including characters that would be considered part of XML markup.  Such 
characters could result in arbitrary new element nodes, attribute nodes, 
and so on, in the new tree that results from processing the serialized XML 
document.
>>

     As you were present when this decision was made, I will take it that 
the decision is acceptable to you.

Thanks,

Henry
