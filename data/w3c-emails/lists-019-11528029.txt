Hello,

     In [1], Martin Duerst submitted the following comment on the Last 
Call Working Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization on behalf of 
the I18N Working Group.

> [24] Cases of creation of non-wellformed XML where the processor is not
>    required to signal an error: It would be good to have an option to
>    request well-formedness checking even if Character Maps are used.

     Thanks to Martin and the I18N Working Group for this comment.

     The XSL and XQuery Working Groups discussed the comment, and 
concluded that, although such a mechanism might be useful, an XML parser 
would be capable of performing the same well-formedness checking.  On 
those grounds, the working groups decided it was not necessary to 
duplicate that functionality in Serialization.

     May I ask the working group to confirm that this response is 
acceptable?

Thanks,

Henry [On behalf of the XSL and XQuery Working Groups.]
