Deborah,

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working 
Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization.

     Thank you for your comment.

     The XSL and XQuery Working groups discussed your comment.  As 
originally written, XML 1.0 required an XML declaration or a text 
declaration if the encoding of the document or external general parsed 
entity was anything other than UTF-8 or UTF-16.  XSLT 1.0 enforced that 
requirement in its serialization mechanism.  The draft of Serialization 
inherited that behaviour from XSLT 1.0.  However, an erratum to XML 1.0 
removed that requirement.

     In response to your comment, the working groups decided to require 
the XML declaration or text declaration to be omitted, regardless of the 
setting of the encoding parameter.  Serialization will permit an XML 
declaration or text declaration to be omitted in precisely those 
circumstances in which it can be omitted according to XML 1.0 and XML 1.1. 
 This would affect both the xml and xhtml output methods.

     As that is the change you requested, I believe that decision will be 
acceptable to you.   May I ask you to confirm that it is?

Thanks,

Henry [On behalf of the XSL and XQuery Working Groups.]
