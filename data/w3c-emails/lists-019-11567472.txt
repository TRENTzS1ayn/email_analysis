Hi,

a question dealing with the function fs:convert-operand as described in http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xquery-semantics-20040220/#sec_convert_operand <http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xquery-semantics-20040220/#sec_convert_operand> .

When having statEnv <http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xquery-semantics-20040220/> .xpath1.0_compatibility <http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xquery-semantics-20040220/>  = false, type($actual) = String and type($expected) = Integer no conversion is done, right? 

Considering a general comparison of a string and an integer value. According to the formal semantics of the general comparison, convert-operand would be called for both values but no conversion would take place actually. So I end up with a comparison of a string and an integer that is not defined (no overloaded comparison function exists taken these two types). That would force me to throw a XP0004 or XP0006 error due top the incompatible types, right?

Thanks & Cheers
Daniel
