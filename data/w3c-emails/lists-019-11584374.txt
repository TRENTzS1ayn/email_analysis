Hello,

     In [1], Martin Duerst submitted the following comment on the Last 
Call Working Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization on behalf of 
the I18N Working Group.

> [4] This only defines serialization into bytes. In some contexts
>    (e.g. Databases, in-program,...), serialization into a stream
>    of characters is also important. The spec should specify how
>    this is done.

     Thanks to Martin and the I18N Working Group for this comment.

     The XSL and XQuery Working Groups discussed the comment.  The working 
groups noted that there is an analogy in parsing XML documents.  XML 1.0 
and XML 1.1 parsed entities are defined as sequences of character code 
points, each in some encoding.  Though it is common practice to parse XML 
documents that have already been decoded into a sequence of characters, 
the XML 1.0 and XML 1.1 Recommendations do not describe the actions of an 
XML processor in those terms.

     Based on this analogy, the working groups decided that it was not 
appropriate for Serialization to specify normatively how to serialize into 
a stream of characters.  The working groups did decide to add a note to 
Section 3 of Serialization indicating that a processor could provide an 
option that would permit the fourth phase of serialization (Encoding) to 
be skipped.

     May I ask the I18N Working Group to confirm that this response is 
acceptabe?

Thanks,

Henry [On behalf of the XSL and XQuery Working Groups.]
