quote. The location and format of the trace data set are ?implementation
defined?.
unquote.

So we may have this 'debug' information
a) Added to the serialised output.
b) Output to an error file
c) Output to a terminal screen.
 And any one could be selected by an XSLT implementation?
Which screws portability nicely?


For XSLT I'd request the output 'location' (If I understand that term
correctly)
be defined. I.e. to follow the content of xsl:message.
