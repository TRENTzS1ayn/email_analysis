Hello,

     In [1], Martin Duerst submitted the following comment on the Last 
Call Working Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization on behalf of 
the I18N Working Group.

> [20] 6.4 HTML Output Method: Writing Character Data: "Certain 
characters,
>    specifically the control characters #x7F-#x9F, are legal in XML but
>    not in HTML. ... The processor may signal the error, but is not
>    required to do so.": Please change this to require the processor
>    to produce an error.

     In [2], Michael Kay responded:

> I worry that we will get many complaints from users who are misusing
> these codepoints if we do this. Their code will stop working, and it may
> be quite difficult for them to fix it. (Though it's a good use case for
> character maps...)

     Thanks to Martin and the I18N Working Group for this comment.

     The XSL and XQuery Working Groups discussed the comment, and decided 
to endorse Michael Kay's response without any change to the Serialization 
specification.

     May I ask the I18N Working Group to confirm that this response is 
acceptable?

Thanks,

Henry [On behalf of the XSL and XQuery Working Groups.]
