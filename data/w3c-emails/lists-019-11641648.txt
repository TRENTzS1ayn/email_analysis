/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
|   I'll take that as a "no" vote then, shall I ? :-)
|
|   I realize this has been discussed before, and has been consistently
| labelled "maybe V2".
|   But nested sequences - or at the very least, the ability to
| manipulate sequences of tuples -
|   is so useful in so many cases that I think it's worth raising again,
| if only to get it towards the top
|   of the list of things to consider for V2.

At the f2f meeting today, the working group resolved not to make this
change.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
