http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/ 16.1 seems to half answer this,
or contradict it.

quote. The effect of these rules is that unless XML entities or xml:base are
used, document("") refers to the document node of the containing stylesheet
module. The XML resource containing the stylesheet module is processed
exactly as if it were any other XML document, for example there is no
special recognition of xsl:text elements, and no special treatment of
comments and processing instructions. unquote.

Impact on users:
  If I want to use xml:base, I can't access the filesheet using
document("")?

I find this unacceptable. 
Many people utilise data within the stylesheet as a lookup.



2. Is there another out of sync issue here?
xslt 2 says:

document($uri-sequence as item()*, $base-node as node()) as node()*

which is missing from the former reference?
