Dear Michael

The following is an official response to your comment:

"Section 2.4.4.3 & 2.4.4.4 & 3.2.1.2
Technical

Users expect that the sequence type expression element(name) means
element(name,*). Please redefine element(name) to be the same as
element(name,*) and introduce a special syntax for ISSD lookup and
substitution group inclusion. An example would be to use / in the schema
context path such as element(/name)"

The WG groups have reviewed your request and have accepted a new
refactoring of the sequence type production for elements and attributes
that will make a distinction between node name and type test and ISSD
lookup test which should address your comment and concerns. 

The refactoring will be included in the next version of the document.

Please let me know if you are satisfied with this response.

Best regards
Michael
