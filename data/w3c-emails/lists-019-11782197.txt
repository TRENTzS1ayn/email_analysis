The following mails will contain the first of Microsoft's comments on
the Formal Semantics Last Call document. Due to the size of the document
and other time constraints on the reviewer, we have not finished the
document review yet. We assume that it will take us into May until we
have finished it. The final comment will note this.

Unlike in previous reviews, where we sent one comment by email, we will
send multiple editorial comments per mail and will only send individual
mail for not purely editorial comments. Every comment will be numbered
with a number starting with MS-FS-LC1-.

Tonight, we will send out our comments on the first 3 sections.

Enjoy
Michael
