Section 3.1.1
Editorial

Replace "expaned " with "expanded "

MS-FS-LC1-038
Section 3.1.1
Editorial

"in-scope type definitions": Do we need to change this name as we did
for "static in-scope namespaces"?

[Note this comment has been addressed at the F2F and is submitted for
completeness reasons.]

MS-FS-LC1-040
Section 3.1.1
Editorial

typeDefn, attrDecl, elemDecl: Mention that they are containing the
imported schema components.

MS-FS-LC1-041
Section 3.1.1
Editorial

Default collation should be a member of the collation environment.

MS-FS-LC1-042
Section 3.1.1
Editorial

Replace "corresopnds " with "corresponds "

MS-FS-LC1-043
Section 3.1.1
Editorial

Please rename " fs:get_ns_from_items" to " fs:get_static_ns_from_items"
to avoid confusion with dynamic in-scope namespaces

MS-FS-LC1-046
Section 3.1.2
Editorial

$fs:dot can be referred to by the user using the XPath expression ".".
Please add.

MS-FS-LC1-049
Section 3.4.1
Editorial

There are still references to xdt:untypedAny. Should be replaced with
xdt:untyped.

MS-FS-LC1-050
Section 3.4.1
Editorial

"derived derived " -> "derived "

MS-FS-LC1-051
Section 3.4.1
Editorial

The definition of fs:numerics seems broken. Also, do we really need to
make it a type or can we just do the explosion into all the possible
types?

MS-FS-LC1-052
Section 3.4.3
Editorial

"SequenceTypes can be used in [XPath/XQuery] to refer to a type imported
from a schema ": Obviously it can refer to other types such as comment
or element(a, b) that are not imported from a schema!

MS-FS-LC1-054
Section 3.4.4
Editorial

Also show NCName rule (not only string) for pi or do it in mapping to
the Core syntax!
