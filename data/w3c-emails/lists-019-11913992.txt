Section 3.1.2
Technical

Please replace "It is a static error to define a variable in the "fs"
namespace." with "Since there is no namespace URI associated to the fs
prefix, users cannot refer to such variables"

Note that a user should be allowed to define a prefix called fs with any
namespace he/she chooses. The point of not associating a namespace with
the definitional prefixes is that there will be no need to check for a
clash or disallow them.
