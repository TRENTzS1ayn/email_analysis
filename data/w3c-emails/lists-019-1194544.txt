Since you're using the text output method, and thus only interested in
generating text nodes, the <xsl:value-of> element should give you what
you want:

  <xsl:value-of select="$sequence" separator="|" />

In all other cases, you can use exactly the same code as you can in
XSLT 1.0, namely:

  <xsl:for-each select="$sequence">
    <xsl:copy-of select="." />
    <xsl:if test="position() != last()">|</xsl:if>
  </xsl:for-each>

We removed the separator attribute from <xsl:copy-of> mainly because
it doesn't play well with the fact that <xsl:copy-of> can now generate
sequences of atomic values.
  
Cheers,

Jeni
