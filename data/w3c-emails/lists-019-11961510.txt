Hi,

  Some XSLT 2.0 constructs like xsl:for-each allow xsl:sort* in their
content model, it is however defined that no other xsl:* elements may
precede xsl:sort in these cases. It happens that you want to use sort
expression later in the body of the respective construct and would thus
like to assign it to a variable,

  <xsl:for-each ...>
    <xsl:variable ... />
    <xsl:sort ... />
    ...

which is not allowed, which is rather counter-intuitive. Please allow
xsl:variable to precede xsl:sort in xsl:for-each and xsl:for-each-group
(maybe others I did not check whether it makes sense anywhere else too).

regards.
