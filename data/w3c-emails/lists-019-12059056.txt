Dear Liam:
Thank you for your comment.  The Joint WGs discussed this on 4/13/2004
and decided not to add the functionality requested.  See also Mike Kay's
response
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Mar/0066.html

I trust this is satisfactory.


All the best, Ashok

Subject: [F&O] LQ-FO-002 - file exists


There's no easy way right now to check for the existance of a
local file except by trying to parse (and possibly validate) it
with document().

For example, consider using XML Query to generate an XHTML
Web page with embedded images.  One might not want to
include an image if the file isn't there, but there's no
way to test for a non-XML file in F&O today.

I suggest adding
    file-exists($fname as XS:string)

An alternative I shall propose in a separate comment is to
provide more access to an implementation's underlying
URI resolver library.

Liam
