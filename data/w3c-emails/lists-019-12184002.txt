I'm glad to hear that.

That would be useful, but why just concat? Why shouldn't _all_ functions
taking string arguments convert their arguments to strings? What's
different about the concat function. (It's not very different from
string-join for example)

I'm not surprised by that:-)

If that was the final decision (I accept that yours was a personal
response not a formal group one) I'd be happy to accept that
resolution. The current type system modified as in (2) would still be a
long way from my preferred type system (which would be closer to Xpath
1:-) but given where we are now, it would I think remove many of the
more severe usability problems with the current system.
