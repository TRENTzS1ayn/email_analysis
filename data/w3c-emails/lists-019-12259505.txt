as a follow-up of discussion on www-ql@w3.org 
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ql/>
about syntax issues:

I suggest, if it is not too late, the following change:

-  make optional the separator ';' between prolog declarations.

(unless this creates a real lexical issue but it doesn't seem to
be the case.)

Though the semicolon can improve readability in some
cases,  it is both heavy, ugly and unnecessary
after functions or variable initializations.
