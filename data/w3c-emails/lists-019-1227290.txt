[I assume by 1.1 you mean 1.0?]

A na?ve implementation certainly is very wasteful. Even implementations that
create the nodes on demand (as I suspect most XPath 1.0 implementations do)
can incur considerable costs. This is why we have deprecated the namespace
axis: this means that an XPath 2.0 implementation never needs to expose
namespace nodes to the application, which in turn means that questions about
their identity and parentage are somewhat academic. Having deprecated the
namespace axis, it made sense to decide that where it is supported, it
should be supported with exactly the XPath 1.0 semantics.

It looks as if the appendix needs to be fixed.
