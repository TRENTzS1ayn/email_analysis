Please consider the attached a formal request from Mark Logic 
Corporation to remove the need for semicolons.

Which is more important, making parser writing easier or making coding 
XQuery easier?  I believe coding XQuery, because we're going to have 
just some dozen XQuery parsers in the world but thousands or tens of 
thousands of XQuery coders.  The easier we make the language, the more 
coders we'll have.

Empirical evidence shows that the May 2003 syntax is readily parsable (I 
can point to you engines that parse it without ambiguity) so why push an 
unnecessarily nastier syntax down to the thousands of future XQuery coders?

I recognize it's tricky in a WG consisting almost entirely of 
implementors (it was 100% vendors in the meeting I attended) to think of 
what's best for XQuery coders.  The best solution would be to get more 
coders involved, but in lieu of that, we should at least listen up when 
a coder like Mark asks the vendors to make his life easier by 
simplifying the syntax.
