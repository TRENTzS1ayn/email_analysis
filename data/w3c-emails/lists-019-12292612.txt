Section 7 of XSLT 2.0

The first bullet in this section states that "If it is not a node, there 
will be no context node: that is, the value of self::node() will be an 
empty sequence."  However, the third paragraph of section 3.2.1 of XPath 
2.0 states that, for an axis step, "If the context item is not a node, a 
type error is raised.[err:XP0020]"

The text in XSLT should be amended to indicate that self::node() will 
raise a type error in the situation described.

Thanks,

Henry
