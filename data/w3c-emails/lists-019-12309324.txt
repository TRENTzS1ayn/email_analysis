To me, making them optional is the worst possible approach - XQuery 
processors would still need to be able to parse the language with or 
without the semicolons. If we were to do that, it would be better to 
simply remove the semicolons so everybody writes queries with the same 
syntax.

But the semicolons do make error reporting easier, and simplify parsing 
of the language. More importantly, they also make it more likely that 
future versions of XQuery will have the flexibility they need to extend 
the language.
