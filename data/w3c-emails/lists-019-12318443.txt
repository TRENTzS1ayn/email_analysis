Hi Jason,

I still believe that we should keep semicolons as is, because

1. Semicolons at the end of declarations simplify parsing of the 
language - not only for recognition, but also for error detection, 
making it possible to give good error messages.

2. Semicolons at the end of declarations give us more flexibility in 
extending the langauge. For instance, if you look at variable 
declaration syntax in the Nov 2003 WD, you will see that we had to 
require {} for the value of variables in the prolog because at the time 
we added that syntax we did not have semicolons. Before we added 
semicolons, we spent way too much time trying to devise a syntax for 
each kind declaration so that it could be parsed without semicolons - 
and that hurt the user-friendliness of the language.

3. Users get used to ending declarations with semicolons rather quickly, 
if my XQuery workshops are any indication.

Incidentally, I prefer a simple rule ("a declaration ends with a 
semicolon") to any rule that has exceptions ("a declaration ends with a 
semicolon except if it is a function declaration...)
