Hi Mark. Do you have a concrete suggestion for an alternative?  As I think 
Mike Kay pointed out, we have considered quite a few other delimiters, and 
have indeed taken into consideration a survey of existing languages.  But 
if you have an alternative that you feel is clearly better, I would be 
interested (I have my own gripes with Smilies).  But nothing with slashes 
or stars please.
