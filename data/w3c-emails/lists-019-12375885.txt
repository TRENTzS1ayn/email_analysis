My suggestion is to not worry about multi-line comment delimiters and just
ignore everything starting with # to the end of the line.  I think several
scripting languages use this convention.

XPath expressions are often written as the values of XML attributes, where
end-of-line is a pretty meaningless concept because XML parsers are required
to normalize a newline to a space.
