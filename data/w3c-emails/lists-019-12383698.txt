3.2 Construction from an Infoset
An instance of the data model can be constructed from an [Infoset]
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xpath-datamodel-20031112/> . A data model
can only be constructed from infosets that satisfy the following general
constraints:
*All general and external parsed entities must be fully expanded.
The Infoset must not contain any unexpanded entity reference information
items.
*The infoset must provide all of the properties identified as
"required" in this document. The properties identified as "optional" may
be used, if they are present. All other properties are ignored.
Constructing and instance of the data model from an information set must
be consistent with the description provided for each node type.
I believe that the second word of the last sentence should be "an" (not
"and").
