Hello,

     In [1], Martin Duerst submitted the following comment on the Last 
Call Working Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization on behalf of 
the I18N Working Group:

> [5] Section 2, point 3: "each separated by a single space":
>    Inserting a space may not be the right thing, in particular for
>    Chinese, Japanese, Thai,... which don't have spaces between words.
>    This has to be checked very carefully.

     Thanks to Martin and the working group for this comment.

     The XSL and XML Query Working Groups discussed the comment, and 
decided that no change to the Serialization specification is required. The 
reason for separating each pair of string values by a single space is not 
to achieve any kind of linguistic separation of words, but to separate 
values in a way that would be consistent with the requirements for an XML 
Schema type derived by list, for instance.

     May I ask the I18N Working Group to confirm that this response is 
acceptable?

Thanks,

Henry [On behalf of the XSL and XML Query Working Groups]
