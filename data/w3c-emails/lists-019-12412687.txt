Mary,

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working 
Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization on behalf of the XML Schema 
Working Group:

> [C] [Section 2: Serializing Arbitrary Data Models] Saying the process 
fails
> for sequences containing xs:QName or xs:NOTATION nodes seems unhelpful. 
What
> happens if I have such a sequence? This appears to be a serialization 
error
> because processor is unable to cast an atomic value to string. 
Suggestion:
> replace 'process will fail' statement with 'serialization error'.

     Thanks to you and the working group for this comment.

     The XSL and XML Query Working Groups discussed the comment, and 
agreed that the description should indicate that this is a serialization 
error.  In fact, the second and sixth items in the numbered list in 
Section 2 already normatively indicate that fact.  For clarity, the note 
in Section 2 will be changed to use the term "serialization error" as 
well.

     As that is the change the XML Schema Working Group recommended, I 
trust it will be acceptable.  May I ask you to confirm that the working 
group finds the response acceptable?

Thanks,

Henry [On behalf of the XSL and XML Query Working Groups]
