Mary,

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working 
Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization on behalf of the XML Schema 
Working Group:

is a

     Thanks to you and to the working group for this comment.

     The XSL and XML Query Working Groups discussed the comment, and 
agreed that the description should indicate that Section 2 of 
Serialization should refer to a normative definition of casting to string. 
 The working groups decided the normative definition should be that found 
in the Functions and Operators draft.[3]

     May I ask you to confirm that the working group finds the response 
acceptable?

Thanks,

Henry [On behalf of the XSL and XML Query Working Groups]
