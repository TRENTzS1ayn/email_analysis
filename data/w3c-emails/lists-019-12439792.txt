Don,

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working 
Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization:

> Serialization Section 4, "XML Output Method": This section should 
> specify the rules for serializing namespace nodes in the form of 
> namespace declaration attributes. Does every namespace node attached
> to an element node result in an xmlns-attribute in that element's 
> start-tag? Can the xmlns-attribute be omitted if it is present in 
> the start-tag of a parent element?

     Thank you for your comment.

     The XSL and XML Query Working Groups discussed your comment, and 
concluded that any output that satisfies the round-tripping requirement 
for the XML output method can be used in serializing namespace nodes.  The 
responses to your specific questions are "No, the serialized start-tag for 
an element node does not have to have an xmlns-attribute for every 
namespace node," and "Yes, if an element node has a namespace node, the 
xmlns-attribute can be omitted if the start-tag for an ancestor element 
declares the namespace, subject to the usual constraints imposed by 
namespace undeclaration or changes in binding."  No change to the 
serialization specification is required.

     As you were present when this decision was made, I will assume the 
response is acceptable to you.

Thanks,

Henry [On behalf of the XSL and XML Query Working Groups]
