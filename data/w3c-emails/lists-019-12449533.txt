Dear Asir,
Thank you for your comments posted at 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Nov/0014.html. 
In reference to Comment no. 4 in this posting, the Query and XSL working 
groups have discussed your comment and agreed to make the changes you 
suggest. The next version of the XPath 2.0 specification will include a 
glossary entry defining the substitution group headed by a given element 
and containing a reference to XML Schema Part 1, Section 2.2.2.2.
Best regards,
--Don Chamberlin
