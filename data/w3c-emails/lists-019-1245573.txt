Dave, I think you are misreading Michael Rys' comments about XSLT. I think
that all he is saying is that he doesn't know what's in the XSLT
specification because he is not on the XSL Working Group and hasn't studied
it in detail.

The XSLT specification does have a few additional things to say about the
data model (in section 3), though this section has become a lot smaller in
recent drafts.

It's not clear to me what point you are trying to make.

Michael Kay
