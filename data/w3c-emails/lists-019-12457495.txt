This comment was raised by IBM at:

The XSL Working Group discussed the comment over a number of meetings and
decided that the one area where the rules for import precedence could be
made more consistent (without backwards compatibility problems) was in the
handling of xsl:decimal-format. This will be changed to adopt the same rules
as xsl:output. Specifically, for each property of a decimal format, the
value will be taken from the highest-precedence xsl:decimal-format
declaration that specifies that property.

I would be grateful if you could confirm that this response is acceptable.
