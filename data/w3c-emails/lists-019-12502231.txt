I enthusiastically endorse Jonathan's statement below.

We have a significant amount of work to do that deals with getting the 
language semantics "right" (and in merely figuring out what "right" means 
in some cases).  I think the time for beauty contests such as what 
punctuation to use here and there has passed and I encourage us to thank 
the authors of comments for taking an interest, but declining to repeatedly 
revisit decisions already taken on such minor matters.

Mark, this is not a tirade directed at you; it's really to me and the rest 
of the WG, encouraging (as Jonathan said) us to focus on really important 
things.  That probably means that well-intentioned comments such as yours 
will not result in language changes, but that's sometimes the price we pay 
for progress.  I do thank you for your interest and hope that you will 
continue to help us find and correct serious errors in our specs.

Hope this helps,
    Jim
