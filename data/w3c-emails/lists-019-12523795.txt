 I'd guess it will be hard to make the case that including the semicolon
makes writing XQuery parsers significantly easier. 
 
As I think we've explained several times, the semicolons are not there to
make writing parsers easier. They are there to give you better error
diagnostics when you get the syntax wrong.
