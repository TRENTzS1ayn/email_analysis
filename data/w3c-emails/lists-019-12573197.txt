Okay, I remember that being said before, but it's not obvious to me why
that's the case.
Why is it difficult to provide good error diagnostics if function defintions
only have to be terminated by "}" instead of "};"?

 I'd guess it will be hard to make the case that including the semicolon
makes writing XQuery parsers significantly easier. 
 
As I think we've explained several times, the semicolons are not there to
make writing parsers easier. They are there to give you better error
diagnostics when you get the syntax wrong.
