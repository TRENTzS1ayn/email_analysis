I agree with Mike - if I have an existing XSLT 1.0 stylesheet, and I 
want to know what I have to make it work with XSLT 2.0, this list of 
incompatibilities tells me precisely what to watch out for. A global 
statement that "these are two different languages" does not tell me what 
I need to change. And of course it would be good to have the languages 
be the same, but there have been specific reasons for each change.

I'm classifying this as substantive, but I am not sure if you have 
specific requests for greater compatibility - if so, listing them would 
be helpful.
