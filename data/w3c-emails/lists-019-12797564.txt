I think that there is a much larger use case for allowing to query typed
data. So I am reluctant to bind the output typing to the input typing of
data.

If you only mean the syntactic schema import part and allow
implementations to use external means to populate the in-scope schema
definitions for providing the type information for the input data, I
could live with that, although I think that would minimize the
portability if users cannot write the import schema statement to
indicate that they have imported that information (even if it was
already imported by the implementation).

Best regards
Michael
