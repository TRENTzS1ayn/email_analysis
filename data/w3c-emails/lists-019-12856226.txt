By default, this would mean that a constructed element "foo" would not 
match element(foo). I'm not at all sure that's a good idea.

I think this flies in the face of usage in documents governed by XML 
Schema. Most elements are locally declared. When we did a serious count, 
it was about 80% in the schemas we examined - we did this count 
specifically to determine if this feature was needed. For an invoice, do 
you really want to make it impossible to specify a customer element or a 
product element as a function parameter? That's the kind of problem you 
would get if you did this.

I think tying it to schema import makes sense.
