[Michael Rys] First, why is that a requirement?

Second, if we actually define element(foo) to mean any element with that
name (and use something like element(global foo) to refer to elements in
the  schema context), then we could solve this problem in a more
consistent and understandable way.

[Michael Rys] I think for most of these cases, it is sufficient to know
the name and the content type. So all you need is to use a named type
(the element does not need to be globally declared). Educating people to
write such schemata should not be a problem...

[Michael Rys] As I pointed out earlier: I do not think so.
