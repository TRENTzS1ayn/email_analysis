The format and destination of the output of xsl:message have always been
implementation-defined. I would expect most XSLT implementors to send the
output of fn:trace() to the same destination as the output of xsl:message,
but I don't see any need to constrain them to do so. Once we make things
implementation-defined, I think we should make them completely
implementation-defined.
