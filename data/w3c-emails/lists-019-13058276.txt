Section 4.8 Variable Declaration
Technical

"If the value provided by the external environment is not compatible
with the declared type of the variable, a type error is
raised.[err:XP0006]": A static typing implementation cannot do this
check at runtime. Therefore, an implementation will need to guarantee
that this is an axiomatic constraint. Therefore, we request that this is
formulated as a constraint.
