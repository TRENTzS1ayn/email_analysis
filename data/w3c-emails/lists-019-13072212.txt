Section 4.11 Default Collation Declaration
Technical

"The default collation applies to all functions that require a
collation, except the following functions: fn:contains, fn:starts-with,
fn:ends-with, fn:substring-before, and fn:substring-after. If one of
these functions is called without an explicit collation parameter, it
uses the Unicode codepoint collation rather than the default
collation.": Why are these functions treated differently. We think that
this is more confusing than helpful and request to not special-case them
and have them take the default collation as well.
