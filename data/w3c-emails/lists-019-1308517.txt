I have reviewed it, and I'm copying this to the public comments list.

I would like to see the Infoset-only model nevertheless process xsi:type
attributes as a special case.  This would make it possible for a process
to serialize information about element types, at least, directly into
an XML document.

In addition, an xdt:attributeTypes attribute would be a Good Thing:
this would have list-of-QName type, and would alternate an attribute name
with its type.

Adopting these very slight modifications of Infoset-only rules would
allow upstream processes to specify type information (which is AFAICT
the main contribution of the PSVI to the data model) without the overhead
of a full PSVI.
