Thanks for affirming and clarifying this.  Perhaps it would be useful
to add wording similar to that in XPath 1.0 (that each element has
a complete set of non-shared namespace nodes), but with the note
that this only applies to implementations that wish to offer
XPath 1.0 compatibility.  I don't see any such explicit statement
about what namespace nodes exist (in such an implementatation).
