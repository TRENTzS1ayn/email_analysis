  What is the rationale for supporting functionality beyond
  the Infoset: e.g. documents with empty content, with multiple
  element children, etc ?

As Michael Kay has said, backward compatibility concerns should mean
that removing this functionality is not even under consideration,
however this feature is not only there for backward compatibility. It is
a useful (and much used) feature. There is a requirement on XSLT (and any
reasonable XML transformation language) to be able to construct 
external parsed entities as well as complete documents.
Xpath models these using the same model of a root node (Xpath 1)
(Document node in Xpath 2) but without the constraint that there need be
exactly one element child, and it similarly merges concepts of an xml
declaration on a document and a text declaration on an external parsed
entity, and models them both in the same way ie, doesn't  model them at
all in the data model and generates them based on the same parameters to
the serialisation.
