Query Lang [2.6.6, 3.1.6, Appendix A] Comments and pragmas

The overlap in syntax of pragmas and comments, as well as the nesting of
comments creates difficulties and questions about corner cases that are not 
clear from the text:

(1) (: is this a comment? ::)
(2) (: can I comment out a (:: pragma ::) like this? :)
(3) (: is this a comment? ::) or an error? :)
(4) (: what about a partial (:: pragma? :)
(5) (:: pragma with a comment (: is this ok? :) or not ::)
(6) (:: pragma with a comment (: is this a comment? ::) or an error? :) ::)
(7) (:: pragma with a comment (: what about a partial (:: pragma? :) ::)
(8) (: commenting out a (: comment :) is confusing :)
(9) let $string := "this is just a string :)"
(10) (: let $string := "this is just a string :)" :)
(11) let $another := "this is another string (:"
(12) (: let $another := "this is another string (:" :)

Suggest (a) making clear that comments are not allowed inside pragmas and (b)
removing nesting of comments.
