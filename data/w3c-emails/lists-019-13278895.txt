Query Lang [3.1.6, Appendix A] Line-oriented comment syntax

Assume the expression: "This is fun :)". How do you comment it out?  It is an
area loaded with problems, and nesting of comments should be removed . If the
goal of nesting comments is to allow the commenting out of large code blocks,
it is possible to add back in the # line-oriented commenting mechanism.  
Modern text editors make it easy to #-mark many lines in a row.
