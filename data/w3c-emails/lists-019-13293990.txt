[General] Input sources

There should be a standard mechanism to obtain a vendor-specified "input
sequence".  For document-oriented repositories this would be something like a
list of all documents in the database so input()//foo[bar="x"] would apply the
XPath to every document in the database.  It could be a specially named
variable instead, but since doc() and collection() are functions, it'd be more
consistent to use input().  Using a standard mechanism helps query
portability.
