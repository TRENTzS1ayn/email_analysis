SECTION 2.2.5 : Consistency constraints

second para, definition: "...For a given node in the data model..."
But the data model is an abstraction, and it is not particular to the
run-time environment in which an expression is evaluated.
A node, on the other hand, is a data value, found in the run-time
environment.  Thus "in" can not mean any kind of physical or 
logical containment in the phrase "node in the data model".
What you probably mean is "node, as defined by the Data Model
specification."  But there is no need to qualify
every occurrence of "node" with such a phrase, because the only
data that XQuery considers is data that conforms to the Data
Model specification.  Thus this sentence reduces to just "for a given 
node".
