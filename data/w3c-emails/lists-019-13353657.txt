F&O 7.4.3

Making the positional parameters to fn:substring be xs:double instead of
xs:integer adds complexity and confusion for no obvious benefit. If the
rationale is to take advantage of the automatic promotion rules, it is
difficult to come up with realistic use cases involving mathematic expressions
on substring positions that would lead to values requiring such promotion.
Request that if there is no sound justification, change the signatures to use
xs:integer instead.
