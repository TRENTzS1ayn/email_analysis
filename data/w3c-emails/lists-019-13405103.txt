SECTION 2.4.4.3 : Matching an ElementTest and an Element Node

List item 2)b) says
"...if the given element node has the nilled property...".
This condition is always true; every element node has a 
nilled property (though the value of the nilled property may be false).  
What is meant is "...if the nilled property of the element node 
is true...".
