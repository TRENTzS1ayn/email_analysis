Thanks for the clarification.
Is this one more case where the needs of xquery and xslt+xpath
are 'slightly different'?

As the detail comes out, the number of places where this is occurring
appears to grow.

Does anyone on the WG have a count of these differences,
where the commonality of requirements do not fit?
  I would like a response to this question please.



I'll repeat my request.
  I would like to see the common items common, not nearly common.
Then xquery could go do its typed thing to its hearts content.
