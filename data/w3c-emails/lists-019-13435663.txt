SECTION 2.6.6 : must-understand extensions

Definition, last sentence: "A must-understand extension may be 
used anywhere that ignorable whitespace is allowed." 
This does not belong in a definition.
A definition tells how to recognize when something is present,
or how to construct it, but
not where it is permitted to be present.  This is like saying
"[Definition: a human being is a talking biped.  A human
being may be in Antarctica.]"
