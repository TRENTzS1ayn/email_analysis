SECTION 3: Expressions

Third para: "a query may consist..."  The term "query" is not
defined.  Perhaps this sentence is (part of) the definition.
But in that case "may" seems like the wrong word.  The 
definition of "query" might be something like 
"[Definition: a query consists of one or more modules.]"
