SECTION 3.1.6: Comments

This section appears to be misplaced, since it says that 
"Comments may be used anywhere ignorable whitespace is allowed."
I assume this means they can be used in the prolog as well
as in expressions.  In that case, this section is broader in 
scope than just expressions, so it does not belong as a 
subsection of section 3 "Expressions" or (worse) 3.1 "Primary 
Expressions".  On the other hand, direct
element constructors are part of the expression syntax, yet
ExprComments are not allowed in them.  Thus the connection 
between ExprComments and expressions is a non-connection in
both directions: you can have comments outside expressions,
and sometimes you can't have comments within expressions.
