SECTION 3.7.3.1: computed element constructor

The sentence after rule [100] says "The name expression of a 
computed element expression is processed as follows...".
Just looking at this section, it seems that 
the term "name expression" is not defined.  Actually, it is
defined, in section 3.7.3 "Computed constructors".  Providing 
a hot link to the definition of name expression would be useful.
Likewise for content expression later in this section,
and similarly for the other kinds of computed constructors.
