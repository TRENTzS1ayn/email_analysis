SECTION A.2.1: white space rules

It would be helpful to state in Rule "ws: explicit" 
that comments, pragmas and must-know extensions are not 
whitespace, as the term is understood for any rule marked with
this annotation.  The only thing that is meant by whitespace
for the sake of this rule is S, which does not include comments,
pragmas or must-know extensions.
