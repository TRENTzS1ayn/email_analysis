SECTION 2.6.2: static typing feature

First sentence: "[Definition: An XQuery implementation that does 
not support the Static Typing Feature is not required to raise 
type errors during the static analysis phase.]"  This 
would read better if stated positively: "An XQuery implementation 
that supports the Static Typing Feature is required to raise 
type errors during the static analysis phase."
