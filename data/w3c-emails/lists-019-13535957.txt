SECTION 2.6.2: static typing feature

Second sentence: "However, non-type-related static errors must 
be detected and raised during the static analysis phase."
It is unclear whether this applies only to implementations that 
support the static typing 
feature, or to all implementations.  I think you mean the latter
(if not, this sentence belongs within the Definition).
In that case, it would read better as: "All XQuery implementations
must detect and raise non-type-related static errors during the 
static analysis phase."
