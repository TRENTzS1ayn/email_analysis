SECTION 2.1.1: Static context

The definition of "default collation" is followed immediately by
the sentence "for exceptions to this rule...".  To me, a 
definition should be something that has no exceptions.  One 
way to fix this would be to move the exceptions into the definition.
Thus, "Default collation.  This collation is used ... except as
specified in 4.11 Default Collation Declaration."
