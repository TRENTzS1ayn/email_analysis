SECTION A.2.2: lexical rules

Second para, second sentence: "Each table corresponds to a 
lexical state and shows that the tokens listed are recognized
when in that state."  It would help to state that any unlisted
tokens are lexical errors.  For the reader who misses this
sentence entirely, it might help if each table had a last 
row whose "Pattern" is "any other token" and whose "Transition
to state" was "lexical error".
