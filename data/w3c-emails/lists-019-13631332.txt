SECTION 2.1.2: Dynamic context

It says that the type of the implicit timezone in the dynamic
context is xdt:dayTimeDuration.  However, appendix C.2 says that 
this component is merely "overwriteable" as opposed to the current
date and time, which are "must be initialized by implementation".
F&O section 16.7 "fn:implicit-timezone" says that fn:implicit-timezone() returns type "xdt:dayTimeDuration?", which appears to be the correct
type of the implicit timezone (ie, with a "?" quantifier).
