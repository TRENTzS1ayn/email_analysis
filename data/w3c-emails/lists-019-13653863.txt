SECTION : No particular section

The typographical convention of embedding (formal) definitions within paragraphs, enclosed in square brackets, and introduced by "Definition:" seems insufficiently attention-getting.  Setting each definition in a paragraph of its own would draw readers' attention to it more readily. If this is viewed as inappropriate, then we suggest that the introductory characters "Definition:" be typographically highlighted, perhaps by setting them in boldface or in a slightly greater point size.

(Incidentally, this comment applies to several of the XQuery documents.)
