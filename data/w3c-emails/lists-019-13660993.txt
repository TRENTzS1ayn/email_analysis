SECTION 1, et seq: Introduction, et seq

The contents of this document are written in a mixture of first person plural active voice (such as "we provide..."), which is more appopriate for formal papers (e.g., research papers) than for specifications, impersonal voice (such as "the implementation provides" or "the term...is defined"), which seems more appropriate for such specifications as this, and second person active voice ("For...see..."), which is also reasonably appropriate. 

We suggest that the voice be consolidated into the second and third forms (impersonal voice and second person active voice).  While we recognize that making this change should not hold up further advancement of the specification, it seems appropriate to remove the use of first person grammar on an opportunistic basis and on a gradual, but deliberate, schedule.
