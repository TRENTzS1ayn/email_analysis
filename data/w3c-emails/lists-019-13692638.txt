I remember reading somewhere that the mandatory parts of a definition
are

(a) a statement of what class of things X belongs to

(b) a statement of how X is distinguished from other members of the
class

Many of the "definitions" in XSLT fall lamentably short of this
standard. I think the main reason is that a sentence gets tagged as a
definition in order to make it the target of a hyperlink, not because it
actually defines the term in question. In fact the word "definition"
gets added by the stylesheet, it's not actually present in the text that
the editor wrote.
