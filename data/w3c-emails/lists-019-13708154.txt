SECTION 2.4: document order

First sentence: "A document order is defined among all the nodes 
used during a given query or transformation."  Good sentence;
you have not equated
the data model with a particular realization of it. 
Third sentence: "Informally, document order is the order returned 
by an in-order, depth-first traversal of the data model."  wrong!
What you mean is "traversal of the trees in an instance of the data model."
