SECTION 6.2.2 : Accessors (in 6.2 Element nodes)

dm:string-value(): it says "If the element type is xs:dateTime,
xs:date or xs:time, returns the original lexical representation
of the typed value recovered as follows...".  If it returns
the "original" lexical representation, why do you need to 
specify a way to "recover" it?  There is only one "original"
lexical representation, and the only way to get it back is to
save it so that it is available for this accessor.  But that
does not seem to be the intent.  In that case, don't call it
the "original" lexical represntation; call it something else,
or avoid calling it anything, just say "here's what you do...".
