SECTION 1: Introduction

In paragraph 5, the spec stated,
"Every value in the data model is a sequence of zero or more items."
It went on to discuss "node" and "atomic value" in paragraph 6 and 7.

Paragraph 6: "Every node is one of the seven kinds defined in 6 Nodes..."

Paragraph 7: "An atomic value encapsulates an XML Schema atomic type and a corresponding value of that type..."

A sentence should be appended in paragraph 5 to clarify what is an item, say ", and an item may be a node or an atomic value". This would bridge the current conceptual gap between sequence and node/atomic value.
