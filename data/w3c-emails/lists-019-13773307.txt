SECTION 1.2: Function signatures and descriptions

The description of the pseudotype "numeric" gives an example 
showing how to expand into four actual types.  This example is
followed by the sentence "Similarly, for return types".
This sentence is not at all clear.  You cannot mean

fn:numeric-function(...) as numeric

is equivalent to four signatures

fn:numeric-function(...) as xs:integer, etc., because that would
be ambiguous when it comes to determining the static type of the
function.  What I suspect you mean is

fn:numeric-function($arg as numeric) as numeric

expands into four signatures, each of which has the same type 
for the $arg and the return type.  If this is what you mean, please
say so.  Note that you must also deal with the case where there
is more than one argument.
