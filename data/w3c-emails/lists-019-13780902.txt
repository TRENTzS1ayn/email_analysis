SECTION 1.2: function signatures and descriptions

It says "some functions accept the empty sequence as an argument
and some may return the empty sequence.  This is indicated...
with a question mark: "?"..."  Actually, it may also be indicated
by an asterisk "*", for example, fn:codepoints-to-string or
fn:string-to-codepoints.  
Since you discuss asterisk in a 
subsequent paragraph, you might consider rearranging the order
of these paragraphs.  Another solution is to change the 
first sentence of this paragraph to more accurately represent
what a question mark does.  Yet another solution would be to say
that the type notations follow the syntax and semantics of 
SequenceType.
