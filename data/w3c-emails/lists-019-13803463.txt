SECTION 1.6: xs:dateTime, xs:date, xs:time

You define a normalized value and a localized value, and give 
two examples.  Each example uses the phrase "...has a value...".
Are these examples of normalized value or
localized value?  Whichever, please also state what the other value
is as well.

- Steve B.
