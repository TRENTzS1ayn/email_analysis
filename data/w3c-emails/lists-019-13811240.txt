SECTION 17.1: casting from primitive types to primitive types

The first sentence claims that "This section defines casting 
between the 19 primitive types...as well as xdt:untypedAtomic
and the two derived types xdt:yearMonthDuration and 
xdt:dayTimeDuration."  Actually, all this section does is 
classify whether such casting is possible, impossible, or 
maybe possible.  The rules for how to do it when it is possible
are not present in this section.  It would be better if the 
first sentence read "This section summarizes when it is permitted
to cast between ...".  Or the first sentence would become true
if you moved sections 17.2 through the end of 17 into
subsections of 17.1
