SECTION 17.9: casting to duration types

The introductory paragraph says that this section applies
"when a value of any primitive type is cast to xs:duration,
xdt:yearMonthDuration or xdt:dayTimeDuration".  The fourth
bullet talks about "When ST is xdt:yearMonthDuration or
xdt:dayTimeDuration...".  But this case cannot arise, based 
on the introductory paragraph, because such an ST would not be
a primitive type.
