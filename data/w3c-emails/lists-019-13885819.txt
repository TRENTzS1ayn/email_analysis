SECTION 17.10: casting to date and time types

Step number 1 defines CTZ as the current time zone.
This quantity is never used in any subsequent step and so its
definition can be deleted.  Its use would be to default the
timezone, but in fact the timezone is always defaulted from
the timezone of the source value.
