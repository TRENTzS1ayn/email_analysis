SECTION 17.10: casting to date and time

Rules 2 and following do not have "otherwise" cases, which 
presumably would raise an error.  You need these "otherwise"
rules to specify which error.  This might be averted by 
refering to the table in 17.1 prior to all existing rules,
and saying that whenever there
is an N in that table, then such-and-such an error is raised.
