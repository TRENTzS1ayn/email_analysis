SECTION D: Error summary (nonnormative)

The title says this section is nonnormative.  However, in the 
normative part of the text, errors are not listed with both the 
QName and the mnemonic text.  See for example 5.1
"Constructor functions for XML Schema built-in types", which
has an error [invalid value for constructor]. If this section is 
not normative, where is the normative list of correspondences 
between QNames and mnemonic texts for errors?  Note that in the
XQuery language specification, this appendix is not labelled
non-normative.
