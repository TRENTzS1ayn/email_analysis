SECTION Annex D: Error Summary

Some error codes (e.g., FOAR0001, division by zero) are accompanied by a natural language explanation of the code (the circumstances under which the error is raised, done informally).  However, most of them are not. 

Consistency is highly desirable, and it seems most useful to readers to achieve consistency by adding such explanations for all codes that do not have them yet.
