SECTION 15.2.2: op:union

"Summary: Constructs a sequence containing every node that occurs in the values of either $parameter1 or $parameter2, eliminating duplicate nodes. Nodes are returned in document order. "
If $parameter1 is empty sequence and $parameter2 has duplicate nodes and is not in document order, should we just return $parameter2 as it is, or normalize $parameter2 first, i.e. eliminating duplicate nodes and sorting in document order?

op:intersect and op:except need clarification too.
