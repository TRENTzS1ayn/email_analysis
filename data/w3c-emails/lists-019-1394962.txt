I guess that at least several of the members of the WGs are aware of 
discussions ongoing on XML-Dev and on XSL-List.

One question which I would like to pose to the WGs is, "What would break if 
we abolished the xdt types and just allowed xsd:string in those places where 
xdt types are currently proposed?".

I guess I could embellish the question with lots of further questions and 
comment but it would help me, and possibly others, to understand what might 
happen with that possible change.
