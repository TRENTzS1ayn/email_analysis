SECTION 7.5.1 : fn:contains

Second paragraph, second sentence: "If the specified collation 
is unsuitable...".  What is unsuitable?  Probably what you are
getting at is that the collation must support collation units.
If that is the criterion, the sentence would be more specific if
it said "If the specified collation does not support collation
units...".
