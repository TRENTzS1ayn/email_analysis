Dear WG,

Section 4 of the F&O last call draft states that the ordering of output
from invocations of the fn:trace() function is implementation defined.

Generally, this ordering (and whether the function is invoked at all)
will depend on query optimizations.  For an implementator to specify
this order would mean that all optimizations and the exact circumstances
in which they are applied would have to be specified in detail.  To me,
this seems too much burden on the implementor for a negligable benefit
to the user.

I suggest that the output ordering be implementation dependent instead.
