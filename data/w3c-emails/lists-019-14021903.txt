SECTION 2.4: fn:base-uri

In Section 2.4, "fnd:base-uri", we find the statement "as defined by the accessor function dm:base-uri for that kind of node in Section 6.1 base-uri Accessor."  The text "Section 6.1 base-uri Accessor" is a link. 

However, when the link is followed, it takes one to Section 5.1, "base-uri Accessor" in the Data Model document. 

The correction is obvious: replace "6.1" with "5.1".  However, this raises concerns that other references to the Data Model may be similarly incorrect.
