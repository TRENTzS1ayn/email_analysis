SECTION 2.5: fn:document-uri

In Section 2.5, "fnd:document-uri", we find the text "as defined by the accessor function dm:document-uri in Section 6.1 base-uri Accessor."  It seems obvious that this is a typographical error, since the Functions & Operators section is named "document-uri"; we believe that the intent was to reference a section in the Data Model document dealing with dm:document-uri. 

However, there is no section at all in the Data Model document whose title is "base-uri Accessor"!  In fact, the only uses of the term "document-uri" in the Data Model occur in Section 6.1.2, "Accessors", in which dm:document-uri appears as the third of "Three additional accessors". 

Perhaps the wording in F&O should be changed to read "as defined by the accessor function dm:document-uri in Section 6.1.2 Accessors." or perhaps to "...Section 6.1, Document Nodes". 

This is slightly more than the editorial comment that we have filed on F&O Section 2.5, "fn:base-uri", but it also raises the same concerns that additional references to the Data Model document may be incorrect.
