SECTION 1.7: Namespaces and prefixes

This section describes three namespaces, which have distinct URIs,
prefixes and purposes.  It would be great to have a table that 
summarizes all of this.  As it is right now, in the middle of the 
section you have a bulleted list that pulls together two out of 
three of these ingredients (the namespace URI and the purpose) but
not the prefix.  The correct prefixes are certainly deducible from
other material in this section, but why not just put all the 
information together in one convenient table?
