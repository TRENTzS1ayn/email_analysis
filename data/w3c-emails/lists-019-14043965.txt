SECTION 1.7 : Namespaces and prefixes

There are several forward references to the namespaces defined in
this section.  This is avoidable, by simply moving this
section prior to the first use of any namespaces, which I believe
would place it prior to section 1.4 "Type hierarchy".  You might also consider combining this section with section
1.3 "Namespace terminology".
