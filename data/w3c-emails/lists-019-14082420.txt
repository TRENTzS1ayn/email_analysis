SECTION 3: Serialization parameters

It is not clear what the scope of phase 1, "Markup generation", is.
It says that this phase "produces the representation of start
and end tags for elements, and other constructs such as ...".
The use of "such as..." is non-specific.  It would be better to
provide a complete list of what is included.  Even the phrase
"representation of start and end tags for elements" is not very
clear -- does this include the attributes and namespace declarations
within the start tag?
