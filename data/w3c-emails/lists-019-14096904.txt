SECTION 4: XML output method

Second para: "In all other circumstances, the serialized form must
comply with the requirements described for the xml output method."
It is not clear what "all other circumstances" is constrasting
itself with.  One naturally looks back to the first paragraph
to see what conditions it lays out.  The only condition in that
paragraph appears to be "unless the processor is unable to 
satisfy those rules...".  Thus the logical structure appears to
be:

test if the processor is able to satisfy such-and-such rules
  if yes, the beginning of the first paragraph appies
  if no, the second paragraph applies.

But this seems unlikely to be your intent.
