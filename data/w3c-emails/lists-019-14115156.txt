SECTION 4: XML output method

Setting the indent parameter to yes may introduce additional
whitespace in the output.  Reparsing the output value may 
retain this additional whitespace, for example, if it is added
to an element of mixed content.  This exception is not listed.
(You have an exception for the character expansion phase, but
the indent parameter is processed by the Markup generation 
phase, so the exception for character expansion does not 
cover the action of the indent parameter.)
