SECTION 3: Serialization parameters

The parameter "version" is said to be "the version of the output
method".  Viewing an output method as a deliverable product,
or component of a deliverable product,
the version of the output method is not subject to
change from invocation to invocation, and hence is not a 
parameter in the usual meaning of the term, being rather a 
descriptive identifier about the output method, just the same as
the name of the vendor selling the output method is not a 
parameter, it is a descriptive identifier.  Perhaps what is meant
is the version of XML to be generated.  This is corroborated by
section 4.1 "XML output method: the version parameter".
