This appears to be a misunderstanding of RFC2396,
section 5.2 "Resolving Relative References to Absolute
Form", which states:

This occurs without any reference to a base URI,
whether specified in the document using xml:base
or via any other method.  This specific example
is the first one in section C.2 of the RFC.

As Dave Pawson desires, the relative URI ""
should be guaranteed to refer to the current
document, regardless of any xml:base setting.
