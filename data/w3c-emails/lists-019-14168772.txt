SECTION 4: XML output method

Sixth open circle bullet: "Additional namespace nodes may be 
present in the new tree if the serialization process undeclared
namespaces...".  On first reading, this sentence seemed 
ungrammatical.  The problem was that it felt like "the 
serialization" was the subject, and "process" was the verb,
which should either be "processes" or "processed", and then
"undeclared namespaces" would be the direct object.
Rewording it as "Additional namespace nodes may be 
present in the new tree if the serialization process undeclared
one or more namespaces..." might help.
