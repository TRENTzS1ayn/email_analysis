SECTION 4: XML output method

Sixth bullet, "Additional namespace nodes may be present in the 
new tree if the serialization process undeclared namespaces."
This seems to be a misstatement of what you intend.  Given a
document node D with an element node E1 with a child E2 with fewer
inscope namespaces than its parent E1, then there are four scenarios
to consider, forming a two-by-two matrix: The output method may
undeclare namespaces, or it may not; and the parse of the output
may be an XML 1.0 parser or an XML 1.1 parser.  The analysis of
the four cases is:

undeclare, reparse with XML 1.0: this will generate an error 
during the reparse, since undeclaring is not a feature of XML 1.0.

undeclare, reparse with XML 1.1: this will restore the original
value.

no undeclare, reparse with XML 1.0: no error during the reparse
step (at least for namespace undeclarations), so the resulting
document node will have more namespace nodes in the regenerated
E2 than it should have.

no undeclare, reparse with XML 1.1: same analysis as preceeding case.

Thus the correct statement is that additional namespaces nodes 
may be present in the new tree if the serialization process did
not undeclare namespaces.

That is replace "undeclared" with "did not undeclare".
