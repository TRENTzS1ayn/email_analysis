I believe this issue is editorial and I propose to fix it as follows.

(a) In 6.5 Modes:

change "its value must be a space-separated list of tokens"

to say whitespace-separated.

(b) In ERR0710, change space-separated to say whitespace-separated

(c) In 11.2, xsl:element, change "The <elcode>xsl:element</elcode>
element may have a
<code>use-attribute-sets</code> attribute, whose value is a
space-separated list of QNames" to say "whitespace-separated".

(d) Ditto in 11.8.1, xsl:copy

(e) In 20.1 Serialization change "The cdata-section-elements attribute
is a space-separated list of QNames" to say "whitespace-separated"

The other place where space-separated appears it is correct.

Can you please confirm that this resolution is acceptable?

Thank you for pointing out this error,
