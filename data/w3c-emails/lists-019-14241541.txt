Thank you for this comment. I believe the comment is editorial, and I
propose to resolve it by adding the following entry to the list of new
features in the non-normative Appendix K.2.2:

<p>The <elcode>xsl:template</elcode> declaration can now declare a
template rule that applies to several different modes; and the
<elcode>xsl:apply-templates</elcode> instruction can cause processing to
continue in the current mode.</p>

I would be grateful if you could confirm that this resolution is
acceptable.

Thank you for pointing out the omission.
