Michael,

already casting strings to Qname uses the in-scope namespaces,
in a scope-dependent manner.

Do you think making the casting in the other direction working in the
same way is unacceptable ? Just pick randomly a prefix from the inscope
namespaces with the given URI (if any) or invent one in an 
implementation
dependent manner.

We can leave the task to make sure that the right NS is in scope in the 
place
where the string is used to the user in V1.

I know it is not 100% acceptable, but it would allow us to write 
queries that
we cannot for the moment.

In the meantime, I would ask XML Schema to support the Clark's notation.

Best regards,
Dana
