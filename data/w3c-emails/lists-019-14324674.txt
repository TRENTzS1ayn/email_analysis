I believe that this comment (and others along the same lines) can be
addressed editorially by adding an explanatory cross-reference from
section 5.3.2 to section 2.5.2 (Additional Context Variables).

The wording I propose is:

XSLT extends the XPath function library with a number of additional
functions, specifically: current, current-group, current-grouping-key,
regex-group, document, unparsed-text, key, format-number, format-date,
format-time, format-dateTime, unparsed-entity-uri,
unparsed-entity-public-id, generate-id, system-property,
function-available, element-available. Some of these functions rely on
the availability of additional context information beyond that in the
standard XPath static and dynamic context. This additional context
information is described in [2.5.2].

I also propose to accept your suggestion to refer to the parts of the
context as "components" rather than "variables".

I propose to add to section 2.5.2 the additional context information
implied by the above list, some of which is static context information:
namely the set of keys, the set of decimal formats, the set of system
properties, the set of available instructions, the additional
information (media types) used by the document function, and the set of
available unparsed text resources.

I believe this would close this comment, and also:
  ORA-XS-384-B: Current Group missing in XPath Context
  ORA-XS-364-B: Current Group Key missing in XPath Context
  ORA-XS-365-B: Current Captured Substrings missing in XPath Context
  ORA-XS-319-C: Stylesheet Evaluation Context Clarification
    
Would this be an acceptable resolution of these five comments?

The detailed text, of course, will be subject to WG review.

Thank you for these comments.
