I can't really comment on this because I don't know what system you
are using behind the scenes. But I'm not exactly sure that having
to look at a third document will make things easier.
And I'm also not sure about 'too much effort at this stage'.
We are only at last call. And ideally, this should just be
a few tweaks to a stylesheet, or shouldn't it? And it should
be possible to do it even between PR and CR, and CR and REC,
if you don't manage to do it before CR.
