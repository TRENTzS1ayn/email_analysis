Since the W3C produces recommendations that need to be validated by
interoperable implementations, I doubt that you can find two
interoperable APIs for different implementation environment where you
can test such assertions.

I think that the error codes should be recommendations (in the English
meaning) but that different APIs and embeddings of XQuery specify how
such error codes are being mapped into the appropriate environment.

Best regards
Michael
