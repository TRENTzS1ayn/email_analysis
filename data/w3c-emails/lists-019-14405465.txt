[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]
[Speaking on behalf of reviewers from IBM, not just personally.]

Section 2.5

In speaking of types, the first paragraph mentions built-in types defined 
by XML Schema Part 2 and user-defined types.  It also needs to mention the 
types in the xdt namespace, and point to their definitions in Section 7.1.

Thanks,

Henry
