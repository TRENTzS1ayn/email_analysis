[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 2.5

In the second paragraph, it is unclear how long the implementation-defined 
anonymous type name must persist.  For instance, if the same query or 
transformation is evaluated twice, with the same static context each time, 
must the names used to identify the same anonymous types in each 
evaluation be consistent.

Thanks,

Henry
