[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 3.3.3

This indicates the timezone in a date, time or dateTime value is 
represented as a duration.  It might not be obvious to the reader why that 
is, so it would probably be worthwhile explaining that it's treated as an 
offset from UTC.

Thanks,

Henry
