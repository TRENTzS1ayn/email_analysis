[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 6.1.2

The last paragraph indicates that all document nodes in a collection have 
the same base URI.  We don't believe that is really a requirement of 
fn:collection.

If there is no such requirement, "even though each has the same 
dm:base-uri" should be changed to "even if each has the same dm:base-uri". 
 If such a requirement does exist, it should be described in the 
definition of fn:collection in F&O.

Thanks,

Henry
