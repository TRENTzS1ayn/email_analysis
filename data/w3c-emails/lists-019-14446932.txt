[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 6.2.2 and 6.3.2

The penultimate bullet in the description of dm:string-value indicates 
that "If the element type is xs:dateTime, xs:date, or xs:time, returns the 
original lexical representation of the typed value, recovered as follows:"

The process described actually sounds as if it is operating on the typed 
value, and the conversion back to a lexical value might not yield the 
original lexical representation - for instance, the three strings 
"2004-01-22T24:00:00+05:00", "2004-01-23T00:00:00+05:00" and 
"2004-01-23T00:00:00.000+05:00" all represent the same xs:dateTime value. 
If this process must yield the original lexical representation, the 
description of the procedure needs to be corrected; otherwise, it should 
make it explicit that the original lexical representation might not 
result.

Thanks,

Henry
