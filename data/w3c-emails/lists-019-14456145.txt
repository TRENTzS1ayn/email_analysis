[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 6.2.4

The description of how the children property of the element node is 
constructed from PSVI indicates that if the [schema normalized value] 
property exists, and the processor chooses to use that means of setting 
the property, the order of nodes in the sequence is implementation 
defined.

This should be phrased to indicate that only the text node will be in some 
implementation-dependent position relative to the PI and comment children, 
but the order of the PI's and comments themselves is the same as in the 
[children] property.

Thanks,

Henry
