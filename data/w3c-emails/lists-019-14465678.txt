[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 6.4.2

The description of the dm:typed-value accessor should provide some 
rationale as to why the typed value of a namespace node is 
xdt:untypedAtomic, as opposed to xs:string or xs:anyURI.  This also 
applies to other dm:typed-value accessor definitions.  Otherwise, the 
types might seem as if they were selected randomly.

Thanks,

Henry
