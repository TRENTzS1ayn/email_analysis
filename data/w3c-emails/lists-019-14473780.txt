[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2

The first paragraphs of 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 describe xdt:untypedAny and 
xdt:untypedAtomic as abstract types.  Section 2.4.1 of XPath describes 
these as concrete types.  The description in XPath is correct.  The 
sentences in these sections need to be corrected.

Thanks,

Henry
