[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 1.5

The first paragraphs of 1.5.2 and 1.5.3 describe xdt:untypedAny and 
xdt:untypedAtomic as abstract types.  Section 2.4.1 of XPath describes 
these as concrete types.  The description in XPath is correct.  The 
sentences in these sections need to be corrected.

Thanks,

Henry
