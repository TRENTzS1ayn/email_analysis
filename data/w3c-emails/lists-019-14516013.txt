[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 3

The second paragraph indicates that errors are identified by xs:QNames in 
the namespace identified by the xdt prefix.  However, the list of errors 
that appears in appendix D uses a prefix of err, which is the same prefix 
used by XPath, and which is not in any namespace.

If these errors really are in a namespace, a single consistent prefix 
needs to be used.

Thanks,

Henry
