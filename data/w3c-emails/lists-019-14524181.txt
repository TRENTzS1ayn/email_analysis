[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 7.3

The seventh paragraph of this section states that "the static context is 
not required to have a default collation specified."  It is not at all 
clear in the definition of the static context that the default collation 
could be unspecified. If that is the case, the definition of the static 
context should be clarified; if not, this text should be corrected.

If the default collation can be unspecified in the static context, this 
"system defined default" collation should be part of the dynamic context.

Thanks,

Henry
