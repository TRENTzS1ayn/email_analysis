We discussed your question at a meeting today and I was asked to convey
the results of our discussions to you.

In addition to the technical reasons given in my previous response [1],
it was pointed out that the design you suggested would delay the
checking of your first parameter (e.g. item to be extracted) to runtime.
The current design has the advantage of generating a static error if the
user uses the wrong function name (e.g. mistypes it).

For the reasons given in [1] and here we believe that the current design
is technically better and are not going to change the design as you have
suggested.

Please let us know if you are not satisfied with this rationale and
response.
