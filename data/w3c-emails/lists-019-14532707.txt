[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 7.3

The numbered list in this section indicates that the collation that is 
used for a function like fn:compare is:  any collation specified as an 
argument to the function; if none is specified, the default collation from 
the static context; or if there is no default collation in the static 
context, the Unicode code-point collation.

However, the paragraph preceding this list admits the possibility of a 
"system defined default" collation.  That possibility needs to be included 
in this list.

Thanks,

Henry
