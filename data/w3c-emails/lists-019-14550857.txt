[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 7.6.1.1

In the last bulleted list, the first bullet describes the concept of 
captured substrings and how they are identified numerically, with the 
entire string matched being identified by the number zero.  The second 
bullet in the list describes the syntax for back references, used to refer 
to previously captured substrings within the regular expression.

Neither this bullet nor the syntax for back references defined in [23] and 
[23a] appears to prohibit \0 from appearing as a back reference within the 
regular expression, but clearly that would make no sense.  This 
restriction needs to be stated explicitly, or production [23a] needs to be 
modified to prevent \0 from being a syntactically correct back reference.

Thanks,

Henry
