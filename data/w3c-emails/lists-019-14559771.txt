[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 9.7.1

According to the first paragraph, "first the duration is calculated as the 
value of an xdt:dayTimeDuration in seconds. Then, starting from $arg2, the 
maximum number of months in the duration are calculated.  If there is a 
remaining number of days, they are discarded."

This description is not sufficiently precise.  Is the maximum number of 
months computed using the number of actual complete calendar months 
beginning from $arg2, or is it the maximum number of months that could be 
accommodated in that computed number of seconds, regardless of the 
starting point?  Or does month here refer to the time interval between a 
dateTime value and the dateTime value that would result from adding the 
duration P1M to it, as described in Section E.1 of XML Schema:  Datatypes?

Thanks,

Henry
