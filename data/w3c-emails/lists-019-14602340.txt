[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Hello,

     Following are comments on Serialization that we believe to be 
editorial in nature.


------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 2

The last sentence states that xs:NOTATION cannot be converted to 
xs:string.  That's no longer true.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 3

In the second bullet (cdata-section-elements), the value should be a list 
of expanded QNames rather than names.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 3

In the second bullet (cdata-section-elements), the clause "no elements 
will be treated specially" appears.  The meaning of "treated specially" is 
not clear - the statement should be made more clear.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 3

In the penultimate bullet (use-character-maps), the word "provides" is 
vague.  This should use the word "specifies", as do other bullets.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 3

In the penultimate bullet (use-character-maps), the name of the parameter 
is not entirely accurate.  In fact, there is just one mapping, though it 
may map many characters to strings.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 4.4

The last bullet refers to the xml:space attribute.  A reference to the 
definition of that attribute would be appropriate.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 4.4

In the last bullet, the style used to describe the value of the xml:space 
attribute isn't appropriate.  Change 'xml:space="preserve" attribute' to 
"xml:space attribute with the value 'preserve'".

------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 4.5

The last sentence describes circumstances in which the 
omit-xml-declaration parameter should be ignored.  Rather than saying it's 
ignored, it might be easier to understand if this indicated it's treated 
as if the value was "no".

------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 5

In the note in the fifth bullet, "in in" should be "in".

------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 5

Suggest replacing the note in the fifth bullet with the following:

<<
NOTE: Where the process used to construct the input data model does not 
provide complete control over the prefix (or lack thereof) used for an 
element name in the data model, implementors are encouraged to produce 
namepace syntax appropriate to the kind of document being serialized (when 
possible). For example, when serializing a document as XHTML it is 
preferable to bind "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" as the default namespace 
(no prefix), like so: 

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> ... </html> 

for best compatability with pre-XHTML applications.
>>

------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 5

The sixth bullet states, "The content type should be set to the value 
given for the media-type parameter; the default value for XHTML is 
text/html. The value application/xhtml+xml, registered in [RFC3236], may 
also be used."  It is not clear whether this means that a processor has 
two choices of media-type to use as the default, or "may also be used" 
refers to what the client of the serialization process may specify as the 
value of the parameter.  That needs to be clearly specified.  If the 
latter, it also needs to be clearly specified whether those are the only 
two values permitted.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Appendix A

Add references to XML 1.1 and Namespaces in XML 1.1.

Thanks,
