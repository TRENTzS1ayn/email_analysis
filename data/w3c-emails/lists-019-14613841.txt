[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 7.4.7 and 7.4.8

The definitions of the fn:upper-case and fn:lower-case functions refer 
normatively to Unicode Case Mappings.  In Unicode 4.0, Unicode Case 
Mappings is specified in the "Case Mapping" subsection of section 4.2 of 
[1].  That document seems to admit several variations of case mapping.

F&O needs to clearly specify which level of case mapping is required, or 
whether it is implementation-defined.  If a case mapping that is 
locale-dependent was intended, F&O also needs to clearly specify how the 
locale is determined.
