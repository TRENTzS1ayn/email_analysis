You are correct and we will fix this error.

If we remove the line breaks and white space then the pattern value will
not format correctly.  Therefore we agreed to add an editorial note to
explain that the line breaks and spaces are NOT significant.

Please let us know if you are not satisfied with this solution to your
problems.

We will remove the erroneous sentence.

Thank you for your corrections and comments.
