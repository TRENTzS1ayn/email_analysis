[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 2.2.3.2

The first paragraph following the definition of "the dynamic evaluation 
phase" states, "If the Static Typing Feature is not in effect, an 
implementation is allowed to raise type-related warnings during the static 
analysis phase, but it must proceed with the dynamic evaluation phase 
despite these warnings."

However, in Formal Semantics Section 2.4.1, the second paragraph following 
the second numbered list states that "Dynamically typed implementations 
are required to find and report type errors during evaluation, but are 
permitted to report them during static analysis."

XPath explicitly prohibits dynamically typed implementations from raising 
type errors during static analysis, while Formal Semantics explicitly 
permits it.  The two specifications need to be made consistent.

Thanks,

Henry
