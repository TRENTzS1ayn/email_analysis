[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 2.4.2

The second example in list item 3 refers to "xs:IDREFS, which is a list 
datatype derived from the atomic datatype xs:IDREF."  In the terminology 
of XML Schema, xs:IDREFS is derived by restriction from xs:anySimpleType. 
This should instead say, "xs:IDREFS, which is a list datatype whose item 
type is the atomic datatype xs:IDREF."

Thanks,

Henry
