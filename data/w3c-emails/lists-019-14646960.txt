[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the Last 
Call comment period.]

Sections 2.4.4 and 3.1.5

In section 2.4.4, the second paragraph beneath the first note refers to 
"the module in which the given type is encountered."  In addition, in 
section 3.1.5, the third bullet under the definition of "function 
conversion rules" speaks of the module in which a function call takes 
place, and the module in which a function is defined.

The term "module" is only defined for XQuery, not for XPath, and must not 
be used in these two places.

Thanks,

Henry
