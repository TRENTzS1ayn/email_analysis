Hi, 
i want ask you to add next feature in XSLT 2.0 spec.,
I want to use xsl:parameter in select attribute of (xsl:value-of, xsl:apply-template etc...) 
 where xPath expression described in xsl:parameter.
For example something like this
<xsl:parameter name="xPath">/rootnode/childnode[@a='111']/etc</xsl:parameter>
<xsl:value-of select="GenerateXPathFromParameter($xPath)" /> 

I want to xsl:value-of in this situation works as 
<xsl:value-of select="/rootnode/childnode[@a='111']/etc" /> 

Please answer me, what do you think about.

Sorry for my english,


PS:
It's needed for next situation: for example 
i have some configuration file, in which
some references to another xml document are presented, i want in xslt 
using configuraton file get nodes from xml, using xPath references described in Config.xml file.
