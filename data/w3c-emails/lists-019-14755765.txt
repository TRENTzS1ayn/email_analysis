Thank you for the comment. If I read it correctly, you are asking for
something similar to the dyn:evaluate() extension in EXSLT (see
www.exslt.org) or the similar facilities in Saxon and Xalan. Perhaps you
can confirm this?

The XSL WG decided in the past not to include this feature in XSLT 2.0.
I think the main concerns were (a) from people developing XSLT compilers
and processors designed to execute in a very small footprint, that they
didn't want to have an XPath interpreter around at run-time, and (b)
that it would be difficult to define the evaluation context in detail
(for example, namespaces, access to variables, and so on). 

Since you have raised this as a last call comment on the specification,
we will review our decision to exclude this feature.

Regards,

Michael Kay

P.S.: the mail software garbled your name, which was presumably encoded
in Cyrillic characters. Can you tell us who you are, please?
