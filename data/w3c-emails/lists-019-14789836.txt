4.5 XML Output Method: the omit-xml-declaration Parameter 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xslt-xquery-serialization-20031112/#N105F3 

This says: "The omit-xml-declaration parameter must be ignored if the 
standalone parameter is present, or if the encoding parameter specifies 
a value other than UTF-8 or UTF-16." 
 
I would like to control the output of the omit-xml-declaration parameter, where the encoding parameter specifies a value other than UTF-8 or UTF-16. I often don't use Unicode. I would like the option to output with non-standard encoding as XHTML. The XHTML standard (http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/) specifies that "an XML declaration is not required in all XML documents"; it is often desirable to omit it, given that it is known that there are unexpected results with some user agents.
 
Thanks
 
Deborah
