You appear to be quoting a message that is two years old, I wonder if
you have checked the situation in the current specs?

This is now covered by section 6.4 of the serialization spec

http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-xquery-serialization

which states:

Entity references and character references should be used only where the
character is not present in the selected encoding, or where the visual
representation of the character is unclear (as with &nbsp;, for
example).

I suspect this sentence was added in response to the original comment in
2002.

Could you confirm whether this meets your requirement, or do you still
have a problem?

Michael Kay
