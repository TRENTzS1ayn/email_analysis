XQuery:  editorial


Section 2.1 as written can lead to misunderstandings.
I think we should reword it a little bit by making clear
the following two points, and correcting an error.

(a) The information in the static context of an expression
  is also used for the evaluation phase.

(error: as consequence of this, first paragraph in 2.1.1 should mention 
that this
information can also decide if the expression has a dynamic error)

(b) Each subexpression of an expression can have a different static and
dynamic context during the entire lifetime of that expression: parsing,
static analysis and evaluation.

Best regards,
Dana
