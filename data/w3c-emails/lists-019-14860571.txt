David,

I am not sure I understand your answer.

Please let me concentrate on the issue that I think
will cause more trouble for the future: relaxing the
constraints associated with the document node.

According to this point I only see backwards compatibility issues,
not real requirements (XSLT could very easily enforce that
documents nodes have to obey Infoset rules).

With this respect we are in a dilemma: we are either
backwards compatibility with XSLT 1.0 or in compatibility
with XML itself and Infoset.

We did choose XSLT 1.0 and ignored XML itself and Infoset.

That's a strange choice, with unfortunate long term consequences.

Best regards,
Dana
