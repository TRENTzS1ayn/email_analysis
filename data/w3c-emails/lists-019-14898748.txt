Please, think and do not allow this.

It is harmful to allow producing incorrect results in the name of "better
performance".

In fact, the best speed for producing wrong results should be as close to
zero as possible. We should always do whatever is possible to decrease the
speed of producing wrong results.

Is it necessary to provide references to wise people, who said that
without correct results speed is meaningless?

Best regards,
