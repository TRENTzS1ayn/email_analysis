According to the discussion in [1], there seems to be a problem with the
type that the preserve validation mode assigns to the new wrapper
element.

 

The type associated with a newly constructed element that contains
information that has preserved its previous type should not be
xdt:untypedAny, since this type guarantees that any of its descendent
children, atributes and values are also untyped. If you preserve the
type information, you are obviously violating that type safety
assumption. The solution (pending approval of action item TAMPA-02) is
to instead type such elements as being of type xs:anyType (or whatever
dynamic type name will be chosen during resolution of action item
TAMPA-02 to indicate a partially validated element content).

 

Best regards

Michael
