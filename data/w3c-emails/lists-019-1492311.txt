We discussed this comment today.  We have decided to consistently use
the phrase "local name" and to add a definition of this term that it is
equivalent to the "Namespaces in XML" term "local part".  In addition we
will add a definition of our "namespace URI" term.

Therefore we have agreed to change the second entry in this table to use
the term "local name". 

> In 10.2.1 the term "local-name part" is used when what is intended is

And we agreed to change "local-name parts" to "local names".

Please let us know if you are not satisfied with the resolution of this
comment.

Replace "local-name part" to "local names".
