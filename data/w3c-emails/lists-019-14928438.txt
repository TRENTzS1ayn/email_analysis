Obviously, there's a bug in my code because I forgot to use a namespace 
in the element constructor. I think my point still stands.

You argue in terms of what is "most intuitive for the user". Well, I 
have taught a LOT of XQuery workshops, and my users seem to have a 
different intuition if they are thinking mainly about function 
signatures (where they expect type safety) than if they are thinking 
mainly about path expressions (where they expect element(foo) to match 
any element named foo). But SequenceType is there primarily for function 
signatures, so that should take precedence. In function signatures, I 
think the current definition is what users expect, and we do not need 
one more way to declare "any element whose name is 'invoice', no matter 
what that element contains".

"Globally declared" and "valid" are two completely different things. 
Your syntax conflates them.

And in a function signature, if I have imported the definition of an 
element, and declared a parameter to be that kind of element, I still 
think that users expect the function argument to match the element 
definition. So we seem to have different intuitions about user's 
expectations. Both of us have talked to a lot of users, I expect they 
may be different users.

Please explain how "global"  or "/" means "valid according to the ISSD". 
I don't find this intuitive at all. When we use 'global' in the 
validation context it means 'global'.

If we adopted your change, how would you want us to match "a valid 
instance of the locally declared element customer, which is found inside 
an invoice element"? Would you say:

    element( global invoice/customer )

If so, I find that even more confusing.
