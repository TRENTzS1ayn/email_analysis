Dear Mr. Chamberlin,
On Feb. 18, 2004, the Query Working Group considered your suggestion 
(attached) and agreed that an XQuery implementation may selectively 
support the optional axes, raising static errors for those optional axes 
that it does not support. The XQuery specification will be revised 
accordingly.

Please let us know whether you are satisfied with this resolution of the 
issue.

[XQuery] IBM-XQ-005: Selective implementation of axes







(IBM-XQ-005) Section 2.6.3 (Full Axis Feature): The phrase "raises a 
static error" should be changed to "may raise a static error", to denote 
that an implementation may selectively implement some of the reverse axes 
of XPath even though it does not claim to support the Full Axis Feature.
