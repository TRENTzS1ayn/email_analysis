I don't want to introduce more incompatibilities between 1.0 and 2.0. If
2.0 is incompatible with 1.0, BCM can help to ease the pain, but it
cannot solve the problem.  It's much better not to introduce the problem
in the first place.

A vast amount of code would have to change if "" no longer has an EBV of
false.
