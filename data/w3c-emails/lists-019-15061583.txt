Dear Daniela,
The following sentence has been added to XQuery Section 3.7.1:
"If no Base URI is defined in the static context, the Base URIs of the 
constructed and copied nodes are set to the empty sequence."

Similiar sentences have been added to Sections 3.7.3.1 and 3.7.3.3.

Please let us know whether you are satisfied with this resolution of your 
issue.
Regards,
--Don Chamberlin

[XQuery] BEA_028







XQuery: incomplete specification

Section 3.7.1 and 3.7.3 discuss the base-uri property of the new nodes
but does not say what should happen when
the static context has no base uri defined.
