If the parameters are the only way to influence serialization behaviour, 
then this should be clarified.  Section 3 now starts "There are a number 
of parameters that influence...", which doesn't seem to claim to 
exhaustiveness.

The current text does not say that, it says that one sequence of white 
can be replaced by another if HTML user agents consider the latter as 
whitespace (presumably in the XML sense).  But HTML user agents need to 
distinguish line breaks from other whitespace, for the reasons hinted to 
by Martin. See list item 9 in 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xhtml-modularization-20010410/conformance.html#s_conform_user_agent 
for the gory details.
