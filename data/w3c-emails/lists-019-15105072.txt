SECTION 2.2.3.2: Dynamic Evaluation Phase

The first sentence states 
"An implementation is free to use any strategy or algorithm whose result conforms to these specifications."

In the 2nd paragragh the statement "The dynamic evaluation phase can occur only if no errors were detected during the static analysis phase." implies that any static errors must cause the whole process to stop. 

Should the implementation processing models be restricted as long as the output is the same.
