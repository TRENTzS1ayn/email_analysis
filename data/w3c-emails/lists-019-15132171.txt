SECTION 3.1.1: Literals

The 2nd note states: "If a string literal is used in an XPath expression contained within the value of an XML attribute, the characters used to delimit the literal must be different from the characters that are used to delimit the attribute."

Aren't the only characters this pertains to are ' and "? If so shouldn't the spec be explicit?
