SECTION 2.4.4: SequenceType Maching

The note statement
"In this specification, the word "type", when used without modification, represents a type that can be expressed using the SequenceType production. When we refer specifically to W3C XML Schema simple or complex types, appropriate modifiers are used to make this clear."

This is normative and should be moved to the beginning of the document.
