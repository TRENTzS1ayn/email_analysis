SECTION H.1: Incompatibilities when Compatibility Mode is true

Number 8. states "In XPath 1.0, the < and > operators, when applied to two strings, attempted to convert both the strings to numbers and then made a numeric comparison between the results. In XPath 2.0, these operators perform a string comparison using the default collating sequence. (If either value is numeric, however, the results are compatible with XPath 1.0)"

The last sentence in #8 is not true for special cases defined in #6 as this would result in 5e0>4 becoming NaN>4.
