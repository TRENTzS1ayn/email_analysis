SECTION 2.4.3: SequenceType Syntax

The first definition:
"[Definition: When it is necessary to refer to a type in an XPath expression, the SequenceType syntax is used. The name SequenceType suggests that this syntax is used to describe the type of an XPath value, which is always a sequence.]"

While this describes the use of SequenceType it does not define it as it purports.
