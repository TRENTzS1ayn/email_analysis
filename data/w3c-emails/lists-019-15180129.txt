SECTION 2: Serializing arbitrary data models

Step 2 says "If the data model instance contains any atomic
values, or sequences that contain atomic values, ...".
But the input to the normalization process is a single sequence,
and sequences do not nest, so what does it mean to say that
a sequence contains a sequence?  Perhaps you mean the second 
sequence to be a subsequence of the input sequence.  But there
is no need for this case, since if a subsequence contains an
atomic value, the input sequence also contains an atomic value.
The phrase "or sequences that contain atomic values" can be
deleted.
