SECTION 4: XML output method

The first four words of this section are "The xml output method".
The specification is non-constructive and non-deterministic.  
This is a good thing, but it means that there is more than one
acceptable algorithm for an xml output method.  Consequently
calling it "the xml output method" is misleading.  It would be
better to say explicitly that the specification is non-constructive
and non-deterministic, and talk about the requirements on 
"an xml output method" rather than "the xml output method".
Similarly, the title might be "XML output methods" rather than
the singular.
