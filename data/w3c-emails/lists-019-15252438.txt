SECTION 2: Serializing arbitrary data models

The use of the term "data models" in the title is incorrect.
A data model is an abstract specification of what values are
permissible within a system.  You are not talking about 
serializing arbitrary abstract specifications.
What you mean here is "serializing arbitrary sequences".
This abuse of the term "data model" is persistent throughout
the entire specification.  It would be a good idea to scan
the entire specification for "data model" and use the proper
terminology for those so-called "data models" that are 
really values.
