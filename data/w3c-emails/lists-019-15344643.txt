In this case it would be consistent to change the definition of the
zero-argument base-uri() function in F+O so that if no base URI is
defined in the static context, an empty sequence is returned.

Dear Daniela, 
The following sentence has been added to XQuery Section 3.7.1: 
"If no Base URI is defined in the static context, the Base URIs of the
constructed and copied nodes are set to the empty sequence." 

Similiar sentences have been added to Sections 3.7.3.1 and 3.7.3.3. 

Please let us know whether you are satisfied with this resolution of
your issue. 
Regards,
--Don Chamberlin

XQuery: incomplete specification

Section 3.7.1 and 3.7.3 discuss the base-uri property of the new nodes
but does not say what should happen when
the static context has no base uri defined.
