Even better suggestion: make the statement normative and make it true.

At the moment it's blatantly not true, for example section 2.4.4.3
starts "[Definition: An ElementTest is used to match an element node by
its name and/or type.] In fact sections 2.4.4.3 and 2.4.4.4 consistently
use "type" to mean "schema-defined simple or complex type".

I am generally using the phrase "schema type" to describe the set of
things that can appear as type annotations on nodes, and I commend this
usage to the editors...
