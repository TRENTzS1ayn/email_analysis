[With apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the 
Last Call comment period.]

Section 2.6

The last sentence of the last paragraph states, "Under these circumstances 
the processor may report any errors in an xsl:output or xsl:character-map 
declaration, but is not required to do so."  However, the last sentence of 
section 21.3 states, "A processor that does not claim conformance with the 
serialization feature must not signal an error merely because the 
stylesheet contains xsl:output or xsl:character-map declarations; these 
declarations should be ignored."

The text in 21.3 might be taken to mean that these declarations should not 
be checked for errors at all.  We believe what was really intended was 
that these declarations have no effect, but that the processor may still 
check them for errors.  If that is the case, the text in 21.3 should be 
clarified. 

Thanks,

Henry
