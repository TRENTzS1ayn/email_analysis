You'll have to explain exactly what you mean by node equality. There are a
great many possible definitions. We have provided "eq" and "fn:deep-equal()"
to support two possible definitions; it's not clear that there are other
definitions of node equality that are sufficiently widely accepted that they
should be in the core library. You can always write your own comparison
function.

Yes, this internal function is designed to support the "is" operator. It's
not a well-chosen name, but the name will never be seen by users.
