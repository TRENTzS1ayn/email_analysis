[With apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the 
Last Call comment period.]

Section 4.3

The second note in this section describes a potentional optimization.  In 
fact, the optimization described can only apply if the various 
transformations all specify the same sets of NameTests in their 
xsl:strip-space and xsl:preserve-space declarations.

We would suggest that this note be removed, as it raises more questions 
than it answers.

Thanks,

Henry
