[With apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the 
Last Call comment period.]

Section 4.4

The second paragraph states, "In general, creating type annotations based 
on DTD attribute types is likely to create some backwards compatibility 
problems."  In reality, the backwards compatibility issues are caused by 
the fact that XSLT accesses typed data, rather than being caused by DTD's. 
 This should be rephrased to correctly characterize the source of the 
problem.

Thanks,

Henry
