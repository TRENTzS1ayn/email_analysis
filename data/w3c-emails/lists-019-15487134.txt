[With apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the 
Last Call comment period.]

Section 10.1.1

The first note in this section states, in part, "In this situation, the 
computed value of the parameter will be validated and/or converted twice."

Was it really the intent that the consequence of using the as attribute 
would be anything other than to invoke the function conversion rules? What 
is implied by the terms "validated and/or converted", which don't seem to 
be well-defined?  Converted might refer to the function conversion rules, 
but what of validated?

Thanks,

Henry
