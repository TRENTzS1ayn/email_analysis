[With apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the 
Last Call comment period.]

Section 11.1.2

The last sentence of the first note states, "In practice, it makes no 
difference whether the namespace nodes come before or after the 
attributes."  The meaning of this statement is not clear. It seems to 
imply that namespace nodes for an element could follow attribute nodes for 
that same element in document order, and that that would make no 
difference - which is false per the Data Model.

Thanks,

Henry
