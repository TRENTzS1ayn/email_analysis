[With apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the 
Last Call comment period.]

Section 11.1.4

The second bulleted list reads as follows:

<<
When a literal result element is processed, its namespace nodes are 
handled as follows:

o A namespace node whose string value is a literal namespace URI is
  not copied to the result tree.

o A namespace node whose string value is a target namespace URI is
  copied to the result tree, whether or not the URI identifies an
  excluded namespace.
>>

This seems to be a change from XSLT 1.0.  In XSLT 1.0, a namespace node 
whose string value was declared to be an alias for another resulted in a 
namespace node in the result tree whose string value was the correspond 
URI.  The text quoted above indicates that no such translation will occur 
in XSLT 2.0.  If this change in semantics was not intended, the quoted 
text could be replaced with the following:

<<
A namespace node whose string value is a literal namespace URI will not be 
copied to the result tree; instead a namespace node whose string value is 
the corresponding target namespace URI will be produced
>>

Thanks,
