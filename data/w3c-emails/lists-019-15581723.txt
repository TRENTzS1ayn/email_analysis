[With apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the 
Last Call comment period.]

Section 19.1

Error XT1490 indicates that it is a non-recoverable dynamic error for two 
or more result trees to have the same URI.  However, there could be other 
illegal combinations that should be considered dynamic errors, though 
there might be no way for an implementation to report the error or to 
recover in any useful fashion. For instance, if distinct URI's specified 
on different xsl:result-document instructions refer to the same physical 
resource.

Similarly, if xsl:result-document specifies a particular URI, and a 
reference to fn:doc actually identifies the same resource created by the 
xsl:result-document instruction, a dynamic error should result, though an 
implementation might not be able to detect it. 

<xsl:result-document href="file:///example">
  <xsl:copy-of select="fn:doc('file:///example')"/>
</xsl:result-document>
