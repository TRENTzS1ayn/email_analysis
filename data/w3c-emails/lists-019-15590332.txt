[With apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the 
Last Call comment period.]

Section 20

The paragraph before the final bulleted list in this section states, "The 
default output method is used if there are no xsl:output elements or if 
none of the xsl:output elements specifies a value for the method 
attribute."

This needs to be rephrased to refer to the output definition - only the 
output definition that is being used to serialize the result tree is 
relevant here.  The fact that xsl:output elements associated with other 
output definitions specified values for the method attribute is 
irrelevant.

Thanks,

Henry
