[With apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the 
Last Call comment period.]

Section 20

The paragraph before the final bulleted list in this section states, "The 
default output method is used if there are no xsl:output elements or if 
none of the xsl:output elements specifies a value for the method 
attribute."

It might not be clear to the reader that the default that is selected only 
applies to the particular result tree that is being serialized.  In other 
words, if two xsl:result-document instructions use the same output 
definition, and that definition has no method specified, each result 
document could use a different default method.

Thanks,

Henry
