[With apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the 
Last Call comment period.]

Section K

The way this section is laid out is confusing.  For instance, K.1.2 
indicates that it describes incompatibilities that occur when BC is not 
enabled, but many of the items in the list in that subsection apply when 
BC is enabled as well.

Perhaps subsections organized similarly to XPath's compatibility appendix 
(BC is true, BC is false, in presence of schema) could be used instead.

Thanks,

Henry
