Thank you for this commnet, which I have classified as a request for
clarification.

I propose to respond by changing the sentence (in the Note) from:

In practice, it makes no difference whether the namespace nodes come
before or after the attributes.

to:

Although the above rules place namespace nodes before attributes, this
is not strictly necessary, because the rules in 5.6.1 Constructing
Complex Content allow the namespaces and attributes to appear in any
order so long as both come before other kinds of node. The order of
namespace nodes and attribute nodes in the sequence has no effect on the
relative position of the nodes in document order once they are added to
a tree.

Is this clearer?

Regards,
