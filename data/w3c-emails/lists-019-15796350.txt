Thanks for pointing out the need to clarify this.

I intend:

(a) to add a sentence explaining that there is always an unnamed output
definition, which in the absence of an <xsl:output> element with no name
attribute is equivalent to specifying an <xsl:output> declaration having
no attributes;

(b) to amend the sentence you refer to, to say "The default output
method is used if the selected output definition does not include a
[method] attribute".

Please confirm if this resolution of the issue is OK.

Regards,

Michael Kay
