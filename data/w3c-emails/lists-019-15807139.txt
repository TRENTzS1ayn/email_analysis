I have classified this comment as a request for clarification.

I propose to fix it by changing the sentence:

"The default for the method attribute is chosen as follows:"

to read:

"The default for the method attribute depends on the contents of the
tree being serialized, and is chosen as follows:"

Please confirm that this resolution is OK.
