SECTION C.1: Static Context Components

The dynamic context today includes the context item. However, the static context does not include a static type for the context item. This must be included for doing reasonable static type checking. 

The table in C.1 - Static Context components could include the following item - 

 Component: Context item -
 Predefined value: none 
 Overwritable by implementation: Overwritable and Augmentable
 Overwritable by query: -- ??
 Scope - Global
 Consistency rules - Only one context item from the outside environment
