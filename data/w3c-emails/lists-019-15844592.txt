SECTION 3.8: FLWR Expressions

Currently, the tuple is defined for the FLWR and order by clauses as containing a set of bound variables. It might help to formalize the tuple notion so that a lot of trivial operations that are possible in languages like SQL (and quite cumbersome to do in XQuery) can be made easy. 

Example:
i) If we map any external related set of values (example an SQL row or an XML file in a file system along with some metadata like author etc..) into XQuery, since there is no notion of a tuple, we have to wrap the XML values in another XML element. This causes issues, since node identities, document boundaries etc.. are lost.

ii) When returning values as well, without the notion of tuples, related values either have to be enclosed in an XML element or streamed as siblings in the sequence. This also leads to the same problems as (i). 

Example - I want to return a Resume XML document and a computed score for the resume. Either we have to return a sequence that has the resume document followed by it's score or create a new XML element and stuff the two in there - the latter will lose the resume document's node identity and typing.

ii) Performing duplicate elimination is quite a challenge without tuples. (See G.5)

iii) Performing grouping operations is also hard.

Suggestion:
 Formalize the tuple as something in between an item and a sequence - A sequence consists of tuples which consists of items. Or maybe introduce a notion of a tuple-sequence as different from a regular sequence.
