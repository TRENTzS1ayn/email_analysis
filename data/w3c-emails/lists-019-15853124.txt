SECTION 2: Basics

The language should allow for nested sequences. Nested sequences (a.k.a sequences of sequences) will help in returning a set of related values easily. The current mechanism requires one to put those values inside an XML element which removes node identities, typing etc. 

 Allowing nested sequence in later versions might be quite hard because of implicit rules governing atomization, normalization and concatenation of sequences.
