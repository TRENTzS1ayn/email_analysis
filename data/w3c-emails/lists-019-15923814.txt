Actually, allowing nested sequences isn't impossible to graft on. You
can do it by defining a third kind of item: a sequence-reference. Then
you just need a pair of functions to create a reference to a sequence
and to dereference a seqref; and of course you need to review all the
existing functions and operators to say what they do when they encounter
a seqref; and of course you need some enhancements to the type system.
Which means that it's probably worth allocating a couple of years to the
task.
