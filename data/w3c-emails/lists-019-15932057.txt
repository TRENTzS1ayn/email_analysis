The XSL Working Group agreed in principle to add this feature, and asked
me to put forward a detailed specification.

This is what I propose:

The <xsl:sort> element gets a new optional attribute, stable, whose
permitted values are "yes" and "no". Like other sort attributes, it can
be an AVT.

This attribute is permitted only on the first xsl:sort element within a
"sort key specification" [i.e. of a sequence of sibling xsl:sort
elements]. A new static error condition is defined if the attribute is
present on any element after the first.

The default value is "yes".

We define that a sort specification is stable unless stable="no" is
specified on its first sort key.

The sentence:

<old>
If all the sort key values compare equal, then A will precede B in the
sorted sequence if and only if A preceded B in the initial sequence.
</old>

changes to:

<new>
If all the sort key values compare equal, then:

 * if the sort specification is stable then A will precede B in the
sorted sequence if and only if A preceded B in the initial sequence;
 
 * if the sort specification is not stable then the relative order of A
and B in the sorted sequence is implementation-dependent.
</new>

We also need to adjust the Note that follows this sentence.
