It would be nice if deprecated attributes, such as disable-output-escaping, were 
set off in some way, say with italics or bold italics, in the spec.

For example:

<!-- Category: instruction -->
<xsl:value-of
   select? = expression
   separator? = { string }
   disable-output-escaping? = "yes" | "no">      <== BOLD ITALICS HERE
   <!-- Content: sequence-constructor -->
</xsl:value-of>

or even something like <span style="color:gray">...</span> or some such.
