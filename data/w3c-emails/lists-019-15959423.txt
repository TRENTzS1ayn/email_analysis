I like how required attributes are bold; I also like the addition of ? in XSLT 
2.0 for optional attributes. Some sort of typographical mechanism, such as 
italics or a special color, for deprecated and backward compatible attributes 
would be a sight for sore eyes (sore from reading so many specs, that is).
