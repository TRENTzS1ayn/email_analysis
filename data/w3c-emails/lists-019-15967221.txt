This makes sense to explore in future versions of XQuery, but I think it 
is way beyond what we should attempt in XQuery 1.0.

Either we have to return a sequence that has the resume document followed by it's score or create a new XML element and stuff the two in there - the latter will lose the resume document's node identity and typing.
