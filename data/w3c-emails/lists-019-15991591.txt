If you can suggest a better wording, please do. I don't quite follow
what you're saying about "the source of the problem". 

I have to say I'm not comfortable with section 4.4. I think the section
is basically passing the buck to the implementor. I think we need to
look at this again and see if we can do better. It's tricky because of
our decision that we don't define how trees get constructed, but I think
we should have a defined mapping of DTD-validated documents to the data
model that we at least recommend to implementors, rather than "merely
pointing out some of the consequences of the decision".
