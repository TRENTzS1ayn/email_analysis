Steve,

we are sympathetic to the goal. However, the main problem is not 
generated by those
operators but by the implicit sorting by document order and duplicate 
elimination embedded
in the semantics of path expressions. As a result of those implicit 
operations the simple path
expressions also require node identifiers.

Best regards,
Dana
