Thank you for clarifying this.
 
To confirm, with XSLT 2.0, I will not have to use any processor-specific extension, such as 'saxon:character-representation="native"' (with a standards-compliant processor) in order to output 'native' characters.  However, should I desire to output with a different character representation (though I can't think of a specific purpose), I would use the processor-specific extension where available? I think my confusion was in expecting a character-representation attribute in the new XSLT 2.0 specification, rather than a change in the (default) behaviour of a XSLT 2.0 standard-compliant processor.
 
Deborah

You appear to be quoting a message that is two years old, I wonder if 
you have checked the situation in the current specs? 

This is now covered by section 6.4 of the serialization spec 

http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-xquery-serialization 

which states: 

Entity references and character references should be used only where the 
character is not present in the selected encoding, or where the visual 
representation of the character is unclear (as with &nbsp;, for 
example). 

I suspect this sentence was added in response to the original comment in 
2002. 

Could you confirm whether this meets your requirement, or do you still 
have a problem? 

Michael Kay
