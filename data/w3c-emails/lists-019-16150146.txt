dm:typed-value of element is not clearly specified in case of element with property [nilled] set to true.
Does it returns empty sequence? (which in my opinion should)
Schema spec states, that [schema normalized value] is 'absent' in this case - it is not clear, that it maps to empty sequence.
Additional bullet in definition of dm:typed-value would remove doubts.

Please also accept my apologies for passing end date
and possibly posting issues raised by somebody else durning last weeks.
