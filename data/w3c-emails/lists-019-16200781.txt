Dear Colleagues,

This comment pertains to the 12 November 2003 internal WD of 
XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language [1].

Please accept our sincere apologies on being past-due with this
submission.

Regards,
David Ezell (on behalf of the XML Schema WG)

XSCH-QL-001 Section 2 Basics

Section 2, third paragraph, says, "some kinds of nodes have typed
values, string values, and names, which can be extracted from the
node".  Although technically this is correct, it would be better to
refer to section 2.4.2, where it explains that all (not just some) 
have typed values and string values, though not all allow access to 
the values.

It can be made more precise by saying something like:

  "All nodes have typed values and string values, some of which can be
  extracted from the node.  Some kinds of nodes also have names, 
  which can be extracted from the node.  For details on how these values
  are determined and on their availability for various node types
  please see section 2.4.2."
