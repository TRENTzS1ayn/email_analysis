Dear Colleagues,

This comment pertains to the 12 November 2003 internal WD of 
XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language [1].

Please accept our sincere apologies on being past-due with this
submission.

Regards,
David Ezell (on behalf of the XML Schema WG)

XSCH-QL-002 Section 3.4 Arithmetic expressions

The unary arithmetic operations are defined as:

  [65] UnaryExpr ::= ("-" | "+")* UnionExpr

Allowing multiple unary operations to be concatenated together is
different than normal practice in most other languages.  A rationale 
or clarification would be welcomed here.
