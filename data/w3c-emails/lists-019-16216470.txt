Dear Colleagues,

This comment pertains to the 12 November 2003 internal WD of 
XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language [1].

Please accept our sincere apologies on being past-due with this
submission.

Regards,
David Ezell (on behalf of the XML Schema WG)

XSCH-QL-003 Section 3.7.3.2 Computed Attribute Constructors

The last paragraph in this section says, "the computed attribute
constructor must not be a namespace declaration attribute--that is,
its name must not be xmlns or a QName with prefix xmlns."

In the Namespace 1.1 Recommendation at [2], the following definition
appears in section 3 "Declaring Namespaces":

[Definition: A namespace (or more precisely, a namespace binding) is 
declared using a family of reserved attributes. Such an attribute's 
name must either be xmlns or begin xmlns:. These attributes, like 
any other XML attributes, may be provided directly or by default. ]

Note that the term prefix is not used.

Suggested text:
   --that is, the QName must not be xmlns and must not begin xmlns:.

(N.B. in the rec both "xmlns" and "xmlns:" appear in bold).
