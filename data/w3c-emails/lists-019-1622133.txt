One more break with xslt 1.0 Michael?
More stylesheet changes if someone wants to move to 2.0?

Yes, as was the case in 1.0.
People didn't use it.

as a look up. 

I can't see how a temporary tree will help there?

I dislike this change.

E.g. when moving from a workstation development to a server,

Yes, it can be worked round. The elegance of document('') is now
well known and of great utility.

Seems a bad decision to change it.
