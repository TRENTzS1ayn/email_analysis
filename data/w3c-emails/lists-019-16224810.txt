Dear Colleagues,

This comment pertains to the 12 November 2003 internal WD of 
XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language [1].

Please accept our sincere apologies on being past-due with this
submission.

Regards,
David Ezell (on behalf of the XML Schema WG)

XSCH-QL-004 Section 3.7.1.5  Type of a Constructed Element

Bullet point 2 for the case of "strict" validation. The search for a
type definition is described as "the in-scope element declarations are
searched for an element declaration whose unique name matches the name
of the constructed element."

This description is not complete: it should also mention that the 
presence of "xsi:type" in the constructed element can also be used.  
Further, that "xsi:type" will take precedence over in-scope element 
declarations.
