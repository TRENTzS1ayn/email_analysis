Dear Colleagues,

This comment pertains to the 12 November 2003 internal WD of 
XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language [1].

Please accept our sincere apologies on being past-due with this
submission.

Regards,
David Ezell (on behalf of the XML Schema WG)

XSCH-QL-005 Section 2.4.4 SequenceType Matching

In the definition of the function 'type-matches', phrases like

  type-matches(ET, AT) returns true if:
    1.AT is a known type, and is the same as ET, or is derived by one
     or more steps of restriction or extension from ET, or
    2.AT is an unknown type, and an implementation-dependent mechanism
     is able to determine that AT is derived by restriction from ET.

might be better stated as

       "validly derived from ET according to the XML Schema 
       specification rules"

instead of

       "derived by one or more steps of restriction or extension 
       from ET"
