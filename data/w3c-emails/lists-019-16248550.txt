Dear Colleagues,

This comment pertains to the 12 November 2003 internal WD of 
XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language [1].

Please accept our sincere apologies on being past-due with this
submission.

Regards,
David Ezell (on behalf of the XML Schema WG)

XSCH-QL-006 Section 2.4.4 SequenceType Matching

In the definition of the function 'type-matches' it would be helpful 
to describe some reasons why derivation by extension for unknown 
actual type is not treated by the spec as base for a positive result 
of type-matches(ET, AT).  A brief description of the reason for 
the difference would be helpful.
