Dear Colleagues,

This comment pertains to the 12 November 2003 internal WD of 
XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language [1].

Please accept our sincere apologies on being past-due with this
submission.

Regards,
David Ezell (on behalf of the XML Schema WG)

XSCH-QL-008 Section 3.2.2 Predicates.

A left-to-right order of applying of predicates is not specified but 
such order is implied by samples and other definition in the section. 
Explicit wording about order of applying of predicates would avoid 
misreading.
