Dear Colleagues,

This comment pertains to the 12 November 2003 internal WD of 
XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language [1].

Please accept our sincere apologies on being past-due with this
submission.

Regards,
David Ezell (on behalf of the XML Schema WG)

XSCH-QL-011 Section 3.7.1 Direct Element Constructors

There is a seeming contradiction between definitions of "direct element 
constructor"

    If the name, attributes, and content of the element are all constants,
    the element constructor is based on standard XML notation and is called
    a direct element constructor.

and later

    In a direct element constructor, curly braces { } delimit enclosed
    expressions, distinguishing them from literal text.

This contradiction could be remedied by modifying the first definition as
    
    One form of a direct element constructor is where the name, attributes, 
    and content are all constants in standard XML notation.
