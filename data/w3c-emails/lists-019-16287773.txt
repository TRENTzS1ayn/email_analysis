Dear Colleagues,

This comment pertains to the 12 November 2003 internal WD of 
XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language [1].

Please accept our sincere apologies on being past-due with this
submission.

Regards,
David Ezell (on behalf of the XML Schema WG)

XSCH-QL-012 Section 3.7.2 Other Direct Constructors

    A CDATA section constructor constructs a text node whose content is the
    same as the content of the constructor.

Since the term "content of CDATA section constructor" was not defined seems 
better to use more precise wording

    A CDATA section constructor constructs a text node whose content is the
    sequence of characters placed between starting and ending delimiters of 
    the CDATA section constructor.
