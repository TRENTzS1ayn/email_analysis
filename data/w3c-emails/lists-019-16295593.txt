Dear Colleagues,

This comment pertains to the 12 November 2003 internal WD of 
XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language [1].

Please accept our sincere apologies on being past-due with this
submission.

Regards,
David Ezell (on behalf of the XML Schema WG)

XSCH-QL-013 Section 3.7.3.1 Computed Element Constructors

    The content expression of a computed element constructor is processed as
    follows:

    1. For each node ...

       Any sequence of adjacent text nodes in the content sequence is merged
       into a single text node.

Suggest adding the phrase:

    "by concatenating their contents, with no intervening blanks"

to be precise as bullet 4 in "3.7.1.3 Content".
