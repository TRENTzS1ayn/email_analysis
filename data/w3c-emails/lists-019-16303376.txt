Dear Colleagues,

This comment pertains to the 12 November 2003 internal WD of 
XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language [1].

Please accept our sincere apologies on being past-due with this
submission.

Regards,
David Ezell (on behalf of the XML Schema WG)

XSCH-QL-014 Section 3.12.2 Typeswitch

    A case or default clause may optionally specify a variable name. Within
    the return expression of the case or default clause, this variable name
    is bound to the value of the operand expression, and its static type is
    considered to be the SequenceType named in the case or default clause.

There are no SequenceType components in the default clause according to the 
Grammar, so perhaps static type for variable should be defined in another way.
