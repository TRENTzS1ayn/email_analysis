Dear Colleagues,

This comment pertains to the 12 November 2003 internal WD of 
XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language [1].

Please accept our sincere apologies on being past-due with this
submission.

Regards,
David Ezell (on behalf of the XML Schema WG)

XSCH-QL-015 Section 3.12.3 Cast

Needs to define a rule for determining static type of a cast expression.
The type specified after the "as" word is expected to be the static type 
similar to the definition in "3.12.6 Treat" but the 3.12.3 section lacks 
such definition.
