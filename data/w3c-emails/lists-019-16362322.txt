this list is for formal review comments on the XSLT2 and Xquery 1 draft
specifications, not a help list, you want

http://www.mulberrytech.com/xsl/xsl-list

However it's a requirement of XML that a well formed document has
exactly one top level element, so if you try to have two it will not
parse as XML and so can't be input to your stylesheet.
