Basically I have feeling, that both fn:substring-before and
fn:substring-after
should return same value when called with zero-length string
- either zero-length string or unchanged first argument.

Returning first argument is little bit more natural for me.
But it's only feeling, I don't have any strong arguments for any of above.

Maybe small one, (but contrary to my previous suggestion): other string
functions returns
zero-length string, when called with empty-sequence as parameter, so maybe
fn:substring-after should do the same.

Anyway I don't think, that logic of having 'virtual' empty string at
beginning or end
of every string should be determinant here.
