4.1.5 Function Calls / Dynamic Evaluation

The first rule contains the premise:

dynEnvDefault = ( Variable1 => Value1'; ...; Variablen => Valuen') ] |- 
Expr => Value

I think this is wrong.

First, I think the notation is wrong.
Shouldn't it be:

dynEnvDefault+varValue( Variable1 => Value1'; ...; Variablen => Valuen') 
] |- Expr => Value

Second, dynEnvDefault is wrong since it doesn't include the prolog
declarations, as far as I can understand.

Perhaps the Dynamic Context needs a new environment, which is the
varValue componet after prolog processing?
