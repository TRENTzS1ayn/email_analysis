Various places in the FS assume that library modules
may not import each other.  This contradicts the latest
public XQuery draft which states that "Two modules may
import each other".  Can I assume that this statement is
no longer operative, and the situation is now "two modules
may not directly or indirectly import each other"?

To provide meaningful feedback I need to know if this has
changed; otherwise there are major problems with the FS.

A related question is confusion between a module as a single
LibraryModule "source file", or if it is a set of definitions
that have the same namespace URI.  This is not a problem if
there can only be a single LibraryModule with a given URI,
but Michael Kay and others have suggested there may be
multiple LibraryModules with the same URI.  If so, I think
there may be some further problems.
