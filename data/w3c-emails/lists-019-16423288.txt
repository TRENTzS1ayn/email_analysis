If you consider fn:substring-before('xxxxxxx','x') and
fn:substring-after('xxxxxxx','x') you wouldn't expect them to
return the same.
(Of course, otherwise we wouldn't need two different functions)

I think it is important, and even more, it is logical and conistent.

Let fn:substring-after($a,$b) return $c
Let fn:contains($b,$bb) return true
Then I do expect that fn:contains(fn:substring-after($a,$bb), $c) is true.
Don't you?

In other words: if $c follows $b and $bb is in $b then $c follows $bb.
So we would have to argue whether fn:contains($a,'') should return true.
I think it should.
