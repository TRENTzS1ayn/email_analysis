/ Daniela Florescu <danielaf@bea.com> was heard to say:
| Data Model: editorial, minor
|
| Fifth paragraph of section 2.5 refers to the Formal Semantics for the
| semantics
| of SequenceType Matching.
|
| If I remember correctly, the normative definition of it is in the
| XQuery specification.
| Please redirect the reference to the normative document.

The normative definition can't be in XQuery because it's shared by XPath.

I believe the normative text is in Section "3.4.4 SequenceType Matching"[1]
in the Formal Semantics.

The syntax of SequenceTypes is in the XPath document.

Please let us know if this explanation is satisfactory.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
