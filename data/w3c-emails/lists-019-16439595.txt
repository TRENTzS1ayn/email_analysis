/ Daniela Florescu <danielaf@bea.com> was heard to say:
| Data Model: editorial, minor
|
| Last paragraph before section 6.4. talks about xs:anySimpleType.
| It should be replaced by xdt:untypedAtomic

Thank you. This has been fixed.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
