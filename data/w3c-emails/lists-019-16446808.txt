/ Daniela Florescu <danielaf@bea.com> was heard to say:
| Data Model: editorial
|
| The specification does not specify what is the type value of an
| Infoset only processed attribute.

The dm:typed-value accessor is described as follows:

dm:typed-value

    Returns the value calculated as follows:

        * If the attribute has a type of xdt:untypedAtomic, returns
          the string value of the node as an instance of
          xdt:untypedAtomic.

        * If the attribute has a simple type, returns a sequence of
          zero or more atomic values derived from the string-value of
          the node and its type in a way that is consistent with XML
          Schema validation.

          For xs:dateTime, xs:date and xs:time, the typed value is the
          atomic value that is determined from its tuple
          representation as described in 3.3.4 Retreiving the Typed
          Value of xs:dateTime, xs:date, and xs:time Values.

From section 6.3.3, the type of an attribute constructed from an infoset
is defined as:

type

   * If the [attribute type] property has one of the following
     values: ID, IDREF, IDREFS, ENTITY, ENTITIES, NMTOKEN, or
     NMTOKENS, an xs:QName with the [attribute type] as the local
     name and "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" as the namespace
     name.

   * Otherwise, xdt:untypedAtomic.

This appears complete to me, what do you think is missing?

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
