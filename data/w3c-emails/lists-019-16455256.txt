/ Michael Rys <mrys@microsoft.com> was heard to say:
| There are outside requirements to support XQuery on a document node that
| may contain more than one element besides XSLT. The SQL-2003 XML
| Datatype follows that model. 
|
| Restricting a document node now would not satisfy their requirements
| either.

In summary:

- XML 1.0 defines external parsed entities which have multiple root elements.
- XSLT 1.0 backwards compatibility requires them.
- SQL-2003 requires them.

I believe this represents compelling evidence in favor of keeping the
existing functionality.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
