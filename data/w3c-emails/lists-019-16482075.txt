Thank you for your suggestion.  I have forwarded your email to the
Full-Text Task Force and we will get back to you when we have considered
your proposed use case.

Return

> Description
> -----------
> 
> Find all books with parts about usability testing.
> 
> This query finds all the books that contains parts about usability
> testing. If a part does not concern usability testing, e.g. it does
> not contain the phrase "usability testing", the part element is not
> included in the result.

> * Operands: "usability testing"
> * Functionality: phrase query, implementation-defined scoring,
>   filters on scores, conditional query
> * Context: books//content
> * Return: books/book
> * Comments: This use case is almost like 16.2.5 with scores, but
>   the set of conditionally returned elements (content) is fixed. Each
part
>   element is returned either as a whole or as a summarized version
only
>   containing the title element. This query type is especially useful
when
>   dealing with large, volume-sized XML documents consisting of several
>   journals each with several articles. The expected results include
the
>   full-text of the most relevant articles only, and the other articles
are
>   shortened. The operands can be words instead of phrases.
