SECTION 1.4: type hierarchy

The tables do not stick to the strict indenting rule you have
described for some of the deeply derived numeric types.
You have stacked up xs:short beneath xs:int, for example.
At first I thought it was because you wanted to keep it all 
inside a printout width, but then I noticed that you did 
correctly indent xs:NCName and its subtypes, even though this
overflowed my printer's page width.
