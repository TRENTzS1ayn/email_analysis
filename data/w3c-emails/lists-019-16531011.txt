Subject: ORA-FO-198-E: missing comma


SECTION 17.10: casting to date and time types

First para, last sentence: "...converting an xs:integer year value
requires converting to xs:string with 
four or more characters preceded by a minus sign if the value
is negative."  The scope of "if the value is negative" is not
clear.  For correctness, it must apply only to the phrase
"preceded by a minus sign", not to "with four or more characters..."
or "to xs:string ..." or "converting an xs:integer year...".
To fix this, insert a comma after "four or more characters".
