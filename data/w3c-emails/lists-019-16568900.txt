I believe IEEE 754 lets you return NaN or +/- INF.  See quote below.

"7.2 Division by Zero.  If the divisor is zero and the dividend is a
finite nonzero number, then the division by zero exception shall be
signaled.  The result, when no trap occurs, shall be a correctly signed
INF (the spec has an infinity sign). (6.3)" 

All the best, Ashok

I am passing this on from one of my users, who pointed out that Saxon's
behavior differs from the spec. I believe that Saxon is correct and the
spec is wrong.

The referenced statement in the spec is: "For xs:float and xs:double
operands, floating point division is performed as specified in [IEEE
754-1985] and INF or -INF is returned if the divisor is zero."

But I believe that according to IEEE 754, dividing zero by zero gives
NaN.

It would be better not to make normative statements that attempt to
precis IEEE 754: it would be much safer if such things were said in
notes, so that it is clear the IEEE definition is the normative one.

Consider this example:

   <xsl:value-of select="xs:double(0) div 0"/>

This operates a floating-point division. With Saxon 7.8, this returns
NaN, but the spec does specify that INF and -INF are returned in the
case of a division by zero:

http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#func-numeric-divide

Is this a bug in Saxon, a bug or imprecision in the spec, or is this
implicitly covered by [IEEE 754-1985]?
