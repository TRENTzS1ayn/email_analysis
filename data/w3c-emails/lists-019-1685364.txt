I'm sorry if this has already been discussed, but I couldn't find a 
discussion of how client-side transformation of multiple 
result-documents will be handled (in web browsers, for example).

Mozilla currently uses XSLT(1) transoformations to display web content. 
However, if multiple result-documents are returned, the browser needs a 
way to choose an initial result

For example, I will pose a hypothetical docbook transformation that 
separates the transformation results into a TOC, a page for each 
chapter, and an index. These pages will need to link together in various 
ways.

1) is there a mechanism for a browser to know which result-document is 
the "default"?

2) is there a URI by which each result can be accessed individually?

3) is there a method that can link from one result-document to another?

It seems that these would be a necessity if XSLT2 is to be used in any 
interactive client-side situation.

If this has not been resolved, I would propose a URI scheme to handle 
this situation:

xlst:source-xml!transformation!result-document

source-xml = relative or absolute URI (exclamation marks must be 
escaped; relative to linking document)

transformation = relative or absolute URI (exclamation marks must be 
escaped; relative to source-xml, may be left empty for default 
stylesheet specified by <?xml-stylesheet?> or other mechanisms)

result-document = relative or absolute URI (exclamation marks must be 
escaped; relative to source-xml)

Examples:
xslt:http://www.abc.123/docbook.xml!http://www.docbook.org/docbook.xslt2!index.html
   retrieves the source http://www.abc.123/docbook.xml
   transforms it using http://www.docbook.org/docbook.xslt2
   displays the result-document http://www.abc.123/index.html

xslt:http://www.abc.123/docbook.xml!!index.html
   retrieves the source http://www.abc.123/docbook.xml
   transforms it using the default stylesheet
   displays the result-document http://www.abc.123/index.html
