[A formal comment, since no one seems to have paid
attention to my previous message on this topic.]

Section 11.1 of "XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Functions
and Operators" (F&O), describing fn:resolve-uri,
states that the function "resolves the relative URI
$relative against the base-uri $base and returns
the resulting absolute URI".  It does not give
an algorithm for doing so.  Since RFC 2396 is
cited as a normative reference in section A.1,
it would seem that the algorithm given there in
section 5.2, "Resolving Relative References to
Absolute Form", is the appropriate one for executing
this function.

That algorithm states, in part:

For each URI reference, the following steps are performed in order:

    1) The URI reference is parsed into the potential four
       components and fragment identifier, as described in
       Section 4.3.

    2) If the path component is empty and the scheme, authority, and
       query components are undefined, then it is a reference to the
       current document and we are done.  Otherwise, [...]

In Appendix C of that RFC, "Examples of Resolving Relative
URI References", Section C.2, "Abnormal Examples", states
explicitly:

     An empty reference refers to the start of the current document.
          <>            =  (current document)

Both of these appear to be in conflict with the last paragraph
of F&O section 11.1 (before the Note), which states:

    If the $relativeURI is the zero-length string, returns the
    value of the base-uri property from the static context in
    the first form and $base in the second form.

Section 2.1.1 of "XML Path Language (XPath) 2.0" does not
provide for the current document's URI in the static
context, only an environment-specified base URI.

There appear to be two alternatives:

1) Add text to section 11.1 stating that the URI resolution
algorithm to be used differs from that in RFC 2396 in the
case of a zero-length string $relativeURI, and that the
base URI is the result instead of the current document's
URI.

2) Add the current document URI, when available, to the
static context and return it instead of the base URI if
$relativeURI is the zero-length string.

In either case, additional text highlighting the
zero-length relative URI string case should be added to
sections 7.3, 15.4.4, and 15.4.5, which each mention
resolution of relative URIs with respect to base URIs.

Finally, a typo: section 15.4.4 of F&O specifies
"fn:doc($uri as xs:string?) as document?", but its
third paragraph begins "If $srcval is the empty
sequence".  This should be replaced with "If $uri
is the empty sequence".
