If your previous message is in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003May/0180.html

then it only arrived yesterday! 

The XML Query and XSL WGs are meeting F2F this week and while we did
process a lot of public Last Call comments at a meeting on Tuesday we
did not get to your comment since it arrived during our meeting.   You
should not assume that we have "not paid attention" to your message.  We
will certainly get to it.

Thank you for your follow up.
