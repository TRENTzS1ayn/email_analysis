Declaring a global variable containing the lookup data is much more flexible
and performant than using document("") to read XML lookup data from the
stylesheet.

But we haven't changed it! Calling document("") in XSLT 2.0 works exactly
the way it always did. You now have the option to set the base URI to
something other than the XML entity containing the stylesheet - but you
don't have to use that facility if it gets in your way.
