After further reading, I now understand that the href specified in 
result-document is relative to an implementation-defined URI. And that 
the nature of this URI is outside the scope of the XSLT spec.

However, I still feel that a standardized protocol for (absolute URI) 
linking to result-documents would be a significant aid, even if these 
links were transformed internally by browser implementations to other 
formats. Is there a WG to consider the xslt: URI scheme as a separate spec?
