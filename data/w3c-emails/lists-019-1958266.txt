The fn:document() function has been replaced by a much simpler function
called fn:doc().

Quote.
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/  16.1

It [document()] has now been replaced in the core function library by the
much simpler doc function. The original document function therefore moves
back into the XSLT specification,


Confusing for the reader?
Assuming the document title is correct, 
"XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Functions and Operators,"
then I guess the doc() function will be available in xpath 2.0?
So users will have two functions 'nearly' doing the same thing.

I still think its a bad decision.
