Perhaps to bring it closer to the WG's sphere of interest,
using the document function, in 1.0, produces quite a variety of 
results; with minimal consistancy.
http://www.dpawson.co.uk/xsl/rfc2396/ shows the lack of consistancy.

One of the authors of the rfc states that the update is currently being
worked.
  It does leave a mess behind, even if out of scope of the wg.
http://www.w3.org/Addressing/rfc1738.txt may be an improvement, I don't
know.

The reference from the current wd's is definately within your remit,
especially after the comments on this thread.

are there alternatives?
