Dave,

We (perhaps obviously) did not expect that readers would be confused by the 
current wording, saying that doc() replaced document() in the *joint* XPath 
2.0 and XQuery 1.0 F&O spec, while the doc() function that is not going to 
be available in XQuery will be published in the XSLT 2.0 spec, where it 
will be available.

Are you requesting a different explanation of this choice?  Or are you 
requesting that all XSLT-specific functions be specified in the joint F&O 
spec with some sort of flag indicating that the function is unavailable in 
XQuery (and, presumably, all non-XSLT-available functions used by XQuery 
similarly specified in F&O with such a flag)?  Or are you simply objecting 
to provision of a new function with semantics that XQuery users want and 
need?  I don't think that you're suggesting that we choose exactly one of 
the two functions and jettison the other, because there are real users that 
need each of them; similarly, I think you'd be more unhappy if we chose to 
jettison your favorite function function!

I apologize for not understanding your intent, so any help in improving my 
understanding will be appreciated.

Hope this helps,
    Jim
