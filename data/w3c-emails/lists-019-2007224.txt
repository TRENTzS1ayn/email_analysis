Hence my (possibly pedantic) comment. The document title implies
it is valid for xquery and xpath.
That would imply its content is true for both.
 Mikes statement is that document() is *not* replaced by doc()
for xslt (and its implicit xpath). 

Since its a specification, I think clarity is desirable.

Is that a typo? I assumed document() will be in xslt 2,
and not available in query?
  {confusion already?}

Your choices appear made.
The near duplication of function with one exception I find
confused, or with my apparently biassed view, another 
case where the merger of query and xslt was a bad decision.

Its a spec, not a language. 
  If the WG must duplicate. Please isolate functions to their home
spec and don't mention them in others.
E.g. document() in xslt 
doc() in xquery.

I have never made any requests or objections to what is needed/
wanted or proposed for xquery. Do as you see fit.

As they are documented currently? Yes I do.
If you wish to separate them into their respective specs then duplicate
away.

I would hope so.

that's a view.

If this isn't clear please let me know.
