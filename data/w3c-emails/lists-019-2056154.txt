I found the following (editorial) errors in the May 2 F&O draft.  Some of
these may exist only in the summaries or only in the main text; I didn't
cross-reference.

Not all type names were properly updated.  Perform a global search & replace
for the following:
xs:dayTimeDuration -> xdt:dayTimeDuration
xs:yearMonthDuration -> xdt:yearMonthDuration
xs:anyAtomicType -> xdt:anyAtomicType

adjust-time-to-timezone, second form (with optional timezone) has the wrong
return type, should be xs:time
resolve-uri, second form (with optional base), second parameter should be
xs:anyURI, not just anyURI.
round-half-to-even, second form (with optional precision), second parameter
should be xs:integer, not just integer



Cheers,

Michael Brundage
