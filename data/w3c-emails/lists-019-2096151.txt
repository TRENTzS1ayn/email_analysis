Thanks, this is now fixed.
 
Generally, the (semi-) mechanical marking up of the words "may", "must", and
"should" has revealed a few anomalies which need to be tidied up. We are
working through these.

In examples in 14.4 there is a <may/> element used which I assume was not
intended to be an element.

I suggest this be reviewed.
