The fact that it is and has been very useful for XSLT users makes
it not an item to be considered in terms of backwards compatibility only.

>The doc() function will be available in all three languages, XPath 2.0,
XSLT
>2.0, and XQuery 1.0.

So the xslt users get 'the baggage' of duplicate functions
from xquery then? 
  Sounds pretty biassed to me.

I'd request that the WG resolve this anomoly.
