Unfortunately, in a client-side implementation this assumption is 
incorrect. A browser uses security checks based on the URI to determine 
whether a page (a result-tree in this case) may link images, frames, and 
scripts, whether cookies are available to a page, etc.

I don't think this matters for the spec, because this security checking 
is really an implementation detail. But it would almost certainly 
require that any absolute-URI-result-tree be rejected for security 
reasons out of hand (as is allowed by the spec).

In addition, if relative URI's are used, the transformation has the 
potential to "shadow" other content, which is another security issue 
(also by the implementation).
