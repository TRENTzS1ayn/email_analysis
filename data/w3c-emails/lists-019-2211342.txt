I make no recommendations for xquery.
My solution for xslt+xpath would be not to introduce
doc() function. Its redundant. document() clearly meets the needs of
users within that group.

I don't understand that. Its' been there since 1.0 AFAIK,
(but I take xslt+xpath as one beast as you are probably aware).

 If doc or a modified document function is needed, perhaps
it could be introduced into xquery? Your interpretation appears to be
that it is not 'common' to xslt+xpath and xquery.

I guess that you prefer the redundancy then Mike?
It appears to me to be two functions; 
doc() requested by xquery,
a nominal variant on document() from xslt+xpath, hence newly created.
  I don't believe it to be an unnecessary incompatibility

That's a view.
