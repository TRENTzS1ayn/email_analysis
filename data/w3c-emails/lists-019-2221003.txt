There appears to be an inconsistancy between 
the use of implementation-defined and same, without the hyphenation.
I think the functions document uses it without hyphenation, others
are more consistant.

Rather more worryingly, a v.quick count of that string produces:

In serialisation - 9
In data model -2
In functions - 20
In xpath 19
in xslt 50+ 

instances of one or the other.
  Is it really that fluid/up to the implementor.
