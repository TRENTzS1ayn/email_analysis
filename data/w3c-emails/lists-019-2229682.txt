/ Tobias Reif <tobiasreif@pinkjuice.com> was heard to say:
| It would be handy to have versions consisting of chunked (X)HTML, also
| offered as .tar.gz or .zip, with relative links (pic urls in CSS,
| links to CSS, pic urls in (X)HTML). Chunked HTML would be much easier
| on the UA, especially when three and more cross-referenced specs are
| read as one.

As the specs become more stable, I expect that the WGs are going to
work towards more and better cross-document links. That makes chunking
less useful.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
