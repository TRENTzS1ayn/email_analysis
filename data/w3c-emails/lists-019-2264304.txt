I'm fine with separating serialisation from XSLT, but as the xslt2 spec 
is more concrete on errors, it should give hints on where the 
serialisation module might bail. I couldn't find any hint on 
failure-to-write in the serialisation spec, btw.

I could imagine a xpointer scheme serving good for this. Something like
foo.xml#xslt-result-doc(part2/chapter5.html)id('target'), maybe 
xslt:result-doc?
This has the downside that links between result documents look different 
when you view the result in a browser (or any other implementation that 
doesn't serialise) as opposed to when you serialize them.
Having an xpointer scheme gives the chance to both specify the result 
document while still being able to identify fragments in the result doc.
Not sure who'd do the work to actually propose such a scheme, but if we 
had it, something like this might give a good hint to implementations:

Implementations that don't support serialisation MAY facilitate the 
XPointer scheme xslt-result-doc to expose result documents in their API.

This would make result documents reside "inside" the source document and 
resolve all security issues in a non-serialized environment. Of course, 
serialising implementations may throw errors for any effective output 
URI, so the spec should mention both the error and that the 
implementation should define when it throws the error.
(Didn't realise in my first answer that this problem is at least as 
prominent in implementations that do serialize as in those that don't.)
