/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In 3.4 it is stated that dm:type, in the absence of type information, returns 
| xs:anyType or xs:anySimpleType. However in 4.1.7 it states that the type 
| returned in such a circumstance will be unique and implementation-defined.
|
| On the face of it the statements are inconsistent.

The distinction is between items that do not have a type (they were
skip validated or come from a well formed, non-validated document, for
example) and those that have a type that is declared locally in the
schema.

The former return anyType/anySimpleType. The latter return an
anonymous type name.

Does that distinction help? (I will naturally attempt to clarify the text as well.)

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
