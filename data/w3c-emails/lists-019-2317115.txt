With the complexity of 2.0 I doubt there will be many implementations
to choose from Norm.

No.

</programlisting>

To me this should be an end user decision.
I want the white space to be retained when I output this in html.
<pre>
  pcdata
   <b>This instruction</b>
</pre>

Am I wrong?

Thanks for the explanation.
  I made a comment yesterday (apparently too general to be
responded to), that there are a worrying number of implementor
dependent options for this to be rightly called a specification.
Too many options is really going to screw interop.
  Is this another one?
