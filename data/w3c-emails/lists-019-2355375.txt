Dave, XSLT 1.0 stated quite clearly in its conformance rules that
implementations could construct the data model any way they wanted; XSLT
itself was only concerned with the transformation of that data model into
another data model. XSLT 1.0 therefore offered no guarantee that two
implementations would parse the same XML document in the same way to create
the same data model. And in practice, there have been variations: notable
examples are one product that strips whitespace by default, and another that
expands XInclude statements by default.

So we haven't really changed the rules, we have just stated them more
explicitly, so that everyone is clear where the boundaries are.

There is no doubt that these variations harm interoperability, and there is
no doubt that as XML is used in a wider variety of configurations, the
variations will increase. However, vendors come under market pressure to "do
the right thing" whatever the conformance rules say: you can't legislate for
everything, and if you make the conformance rules too tight, then vendors
who need to support unusual processing scenarios are simply going to choose
not to conform. 

Sometimes the gap can be filled by supplementary specifications, for example
one can imagine a spec that defines "a standard way to create an XPath data
model from a source XML document", and vendors could choose whether or not
to conform to that specification.

In the end it's up to the user. If you need a product that can handle
comments appearing in the middle of an integer, and if there are enough
people like you to create a market, then there will be vendors who provide
that capability. If, on the other hand, some vendors choose to get an extra
ounce of performance by discarding such a comment, then you have the right
to treat their products with the contempt they deserve: just because it is
conformant doesn't mean you have to buy it.
