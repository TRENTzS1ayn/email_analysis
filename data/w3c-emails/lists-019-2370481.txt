Actually, fn:document() was not in XPath 1.0, and is not in XPath 2.0 now.

We have no plans to deprecate fn:document() in XSLT. It does no harm, it is
merely redundant, and redundancy is not good enough reason for deprecation.

We have considered deprecating features that are harmful, such as
disable-output-escaping, but decided for the time being that we had no
formal definition of "deprecation" and it was too much trouble to create
one.
