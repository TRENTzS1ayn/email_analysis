MK, please pass on to the WG a 'customer' position.
As an XSLT+XPATH *user* I don't care which spec they are in.
Saxon and all other implementations implement them together.

W3C chose to split them, quite possibly for good reason, but
please don't expect users to support/understnad the refined separation.

I'd appreciate a re-affirmation of that as a WG position please,
noting the *we* in this mail?

<grin/> I'd go for that deprecation.
  ?More trouble than its worth?
