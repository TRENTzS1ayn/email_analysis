I recall that this issue was discussed some time ago on XML-Dev.

As far as I can see in the May 2003 XSLT 2.0 WD there is no documentation 
element in the XSLT namespace.

In case the previous request didn't get on the official feature radar, I 
would like formally to request that an xsl:documentation element be added to 
the XSLT 2.0 specification.
