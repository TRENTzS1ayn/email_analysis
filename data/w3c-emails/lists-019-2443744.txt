I can find references to typeswitch, but no such function Michael?
Where is it please?

You can use the instance of and typeswitch expressions to inspect the type.

Exposing the type name is a feature of the debugger in my opinion and not a
language feature.

Subject: [XSLT 2.0] Is it possible to display the type of a node / value /
variable?

Having spent a great deal of time today trying to work out where a typing
problem was going wrong (my coding, Saxon 7.5 support of what I wanted to
do, etc) I would really have liked to be able to display the type of (in my
case) a variable at various points in the code - in order to see what was
and what wasn't working.

Is there a function to do that? As far as I can see the data() function
which is said to return the "typed value" doesn't actually return the type,
at least not in a form that I could serialize, which I would need to do in
this debugging scenario.

If not, it seems to me that a function to display the type of a node, an
atomic value and a variable would be useful for debugging XSLT 2.0
stylesheets as people grapple with the "interesting" aspects of typing in
XSLT 2.0 not behaving quite as expected.
