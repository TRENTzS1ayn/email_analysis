[Michael Rys] Well, I see people that want to have as little difference
among the shared functionality as possible. And in this case, a way to
deprecate an XSLT functionality that they considered too complex.

Note that fn:doc() was not forced on the XPath/XSLT community by XQuery.
It was decided in the XPath gremium (jointly-owned by XSLT and XQuery)
that it is a good function to have in XPATH (not XQuery).

[Michael Rys] On the evidence of several thousand users of different
XSLT engines.

[Michael Rys] Can you please stop these ad hominem attacks? If not, I
will stop answering your posts, since I do not feel I can have a dialog
with somebody that only insults and demands, but seems to be unable to
listen.

Every product and standard will want to deprecate functionality over
time that has proven to be too complex for the user value it delivers. I
think the approach of adding a simpler version early and recommend the
simpler version and SLOWLY, OVER TIME start to deprecate the old
functionality is a good approach. You seem to disagree, so I ask you,
how many standards did you develop that went beyond their v1? How many
products?
