Hi

In a user forum of an XSLT processor, it was asked if allowing AVTs 
inside regexen should be disallowed because coders could forget to 
escape curly braces that aren't meant to delimit AVTs, eg quantifier 
delimiters.

I just wanted to say that I think that you should continue to allow AVTs 
inside regexen. This offers flexibility, and coders can be expected to 
remember escaping [note].

'Note:
Because the regex attribute is an attribute value template, curly braces 
within the regular expression must be doubled. For example, to match a 
sequence of one to five characters followed by whitespace, write 
regex=".{{1,5}}\s".'
