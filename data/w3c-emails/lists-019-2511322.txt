Hi Tobi,

> Where can I find the definition of the eq operator?

The eq operator is defined in Section 3.5.1 Value Comparisons in the
XPath 2.0 WD at:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/#id-value-comparisons

The way in which eq works for a particular data type is defined in the
F&O WD at:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions

Most data types that you can compare for equality have a op:X-equal()
operator defined in the F&O WD, where X is the name of the data type.
For example, if you want to find out how two dateTimes are compared,
look up op:dateTime-equal() at:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#func-dateTime-equal

The exception is that xs:string values are compared using fn:compare()
as defined at:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#func-compare
  
A complete list of the possible comparisons and the relevant
operators/functions from the F&O WD are given in Appendix B.2 Operator
Mapping in XPath 2.0 at:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/#mapping

Cheers,

Jeni
