Hi Jeni

[... thanks for all the pointers and explanations ...]

Somehow I hit the same walls as before:
Why does op:node-equal test for identity, not for equality?
If there is eq and op:node-equal, why is there no fn:node-equal? (or 
fn:shallow-equal)

Those questions have been replied to already, I'm just still not 
satisfied. But I guess no spec (not even ten related ones :) can satisfy 
everyone ... perhaps EXSLT will design a sandard lib?
