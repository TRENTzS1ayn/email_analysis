Thanks for the comment. We have had some discussion on this in the working
group. We are looking for a way to retain the current functionality while
avoiding the current "gotcha" where the user obtains wrong results if they
forget to double the braces. It might be that the problem can be solved
adequately with a warning from the compiler - we'll see.
