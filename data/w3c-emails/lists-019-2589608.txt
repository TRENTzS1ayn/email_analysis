Perhaps the WXS spec will one day include this feature.

Ruby has backreferences in regexen [1], also Perl [2], Python [3], and 
Java [4]. If a modern language (eg XSLT 2, WXS, etc) doesn't currently 
have this feature, then it should implement it IMHO.

The PCRE lib [6] provides this feature [7] for C++ etc; it can be used 
to implement regexen in many languages and apps.
