The proposal was actually made as a public comment, and we discussed it and
decided not to do anything. We felt that there are adequate facilities
already for documenting a stylesheet without adding any new elements for the
purpose.

Subject: [XSLT 2.0] Request for an xsl:documentation element


I recall that this issue was discussed some time ago on XML-Dev.

As far as I can see in the May 2003 XSLT 2.0 WD there is no documentation
element in the XSLT namespace.

In case the previous request didn't get on the official feature radar, I
would like formally to request that an xsl:documentation element be added to
the XSLT 2.0 specification.
