The one interesting private part of the charter is the projected date, 
which is not public. I think that's a good thing - it's more important to 
get things right than to hit the date, and we don't want to have to deal 
with the press if the date moves back.

Pretty much everything else is reflected in other publicly available 
documents. A lot of the document essentially says we follow the W3C Process 
Model, spelling it out point by point.
