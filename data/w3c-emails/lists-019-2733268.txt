The most recent (July 2002) XML Query WG Charter is public and is
available at [1].  The dates in the charter reflect the thinking when it
was adopted and have not been updated.  The overall XML Activity charter
is available at [2] and it references [1].  Sorry if that is hard to
find - I will try to get our public home page updated with a direct link
to the charter.

 

The XSL WG charter [3] is somewhat older but it is also publicly
accessible.

At the risk of huge groans from members of the WGs is there a publicly
available Charter or Activity Statement for the XSLT 2.0 / XPath 2.0 /
XQuery 1.0 triumvirate?

I assume that at least a Charter exists. Is that correct? Is there
anything that hinders it being made public?
