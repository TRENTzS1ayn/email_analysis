It seems to me that the definition of the normalize-space() function is 
ambiguous.

Sequences of more than one whitespace character are replaced by a single 
space. However, I don't think it is clear what happens if a single non-space 
whitespace character is encountered.

I assume that it is intended that a single non-space whitespace character 
will be replaced by a space character. If so, I suggest that that needs to be 
stated more clearly.
