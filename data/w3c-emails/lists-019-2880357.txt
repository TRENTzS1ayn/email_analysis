Hi

I think F&O is lacking function for reversing sequence order.
Something like this would be useful:

fn:reverse($sourceSeq as item*) as item* 

It can be written as recursive function of course,
but if there are functions like fn:exist in F&O,
function like above could be added for clarity
and possibilily of high optimization.
