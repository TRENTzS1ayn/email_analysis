Andre:

Thank you for your comment.  The F&O task force discussed this in the
telcon this afternoon and decided to change the wording for
fn:normalize-space function to say "replacing sequences of one or more
than one whitespace character with a single space, #x20.

All the best, Ashok

It seems to me that the definition of the normalize-space() function is
ambiguous.

Sequences of more than one whitespace character are replaced by a single
space. However, I don't think it is clear what happens if a single
non-space whitespace character is encountered.

I assume that it is intended that a single non-space whitespace
character will be replaced by a space character. If so, I suggest that
that needs to be stated more clearly.
