Definition for fn:context-item, fn:last, fn:position states:
'Returns the empty sequence if the context is the empty sequence'.

It should be rather 'if there is no context item' as in other parts of spec
Context *is* item and could not be empty.
Also there is no precise definition of term 'there is no context item'.

Definition of dynamic context states:
'If evaluation of an expression relies on some part of the dynamic context
that has not been assigned a value, a dynamic error is raised.'
but functions above 'relies' on context item to check if it is not defined
and aren't raising error, so it is not the case.
