We find that it is very useful to be able to incorporate XQuery 
expressions within full-text searching expressions and propose that the 
attached use case be added to the XQuery and XPath Full-Text Use Cases.

Use Case: Nested XQuery expression 


Description
--------------

Find all the books published after 2001 that share a subject with a
book on "Improving Web Site Usability".

This query finds words in an element. It uses an XQuery expression
for specifying the words to search.

* Operands "Improving Web Site Usability"
* Functionality: word query, and query, nested xquery expression
* Context: books/book/metadata//@shortTitle, 
   books/book/metadata//subject
* Return: books/book/metadata/title, books/book/metadata/author
* Comments: This query returns a book if its date of publishing or of 
            last revision is after 2001 and one of its subjects 
contains the words from a subject of the book whose title 
is "Improving Web Site Usability". This query uses an 
XQuery expression to dynamically (at query time) find the 
subjects of this book.
