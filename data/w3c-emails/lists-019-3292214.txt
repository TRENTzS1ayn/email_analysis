The statement in 4.1.4 (now in the introduction) is a definition.
That's what "document" means in this specification. I renamed the
section title in 4.2 (now 7.1) and the other corresponding sections to
remove the ambiguity you note. As to whether documents have the
properties ascribed or not, I think they do: they're part of what
makes a document a document.

In any event, the spec has been extensively redrafted and I believe
that these points are now clearer. Please let me know if you disagree.

/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| I am concerned at the use of the word "document" in the Data Model document.
|
| The term "document" seems to be used for at least three purposes, as far as I 
| can see.
|
| In 4.1.4 we read, "A tree whose root node is a document node is a document". 
| Well, no it isn't, not really.
|
| It seems to me that some distinct term ... "document tree"? ... should be 
| used where the sense of 4.1.4 is intended,  to avoid confusion with XML 
| documents and with document nodes.
|
| In 4.2 we find a heading "Documents" which I think is an informal shorthand 
| for document nodes. Or is the 4.1.4 "document tree" sense intended in parts?
|
| In 4.2, we have ".... XML documents. Documents have the following properties 
| ....". I assume that by "Documents" it is intended to refer to "document 
| nodes"? XML documents qua XML documents certainly don't have the stated 
| properties.
|
| It is disappointing to see these ambiguities persisting in the Data Model 
| document. I seem to recall raising this issue some time ago. In a formal 
| specification document I think it ought to be tidier and that a greater level 
| of precision and consistency should be aimed for and achieved. Not least when 
| the specification is deemed to be in Last Call.
