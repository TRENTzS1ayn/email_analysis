Chavdar,

I believe the use case you sent would be a valuable addition to the Full
Text Use Cases. I will ask to have it added to a future task force
agenda for consideration.

We find that it is very useful to be able to incorporate XQuery 
expressions within full-text searching expressions and propose that the 
attached use case be added to the XQuery and XPath Full-Text Use Cases.


Best regards,
