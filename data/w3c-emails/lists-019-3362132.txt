Noe,

Thank you for your input on "XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0
Functions and Operators" (last call working draft of 2 May
2003).

This problem has now been fixed.  The function fn:context-item
no longer exists; fn:last and fn:position now both say
"If the context item is undefined, an error is raised."

The changes will appear in the next release of the F&O
document.


> Definition for fn:context-item, fn:last, fn:position states:
> `Returns the empty sequence if the context is the empty sequence'.
> 
> It should be rather `if there is no context item' as in other parts of spec
> Context *is* item and could not be empty.
> Also there is no precise definition of term `there is no context item'.
> 
> Definition of dynamic context states:
> `If evaluation of an expression relies on some part of the dynamic context
> that has not been assigned a value, a dynamic error is raised.'
> but functions above `relies' on context item to check if it is not defined
> and aren't raising error, so it is not the case.
