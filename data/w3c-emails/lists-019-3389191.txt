I think there are two differences

(a) there is an indirection: the binding of the prefix to the URI can be
changed at any time, in one place

(b) there is a convenience; the syntactic notation of prefix:local-name is
familiar and people are comfortable with it.

I agree with that. We aren't talking about expressive power here, we are
talking about usability considerations.
