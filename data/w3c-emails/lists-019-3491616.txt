It seems for every direct constructor there is a computed constructor 
-- except for CDATA sections. Since the WG has allowed CDATA direct 
constructors at all, there should be full support including computed 
constructors. I can understand if the CDATA sections were only to ease 
creating/viewing files that would otherwise require many entities, but 
since they also may be serialized by implementors it is limiting to not 
to have this functionality.

Proposed rule:
CompCdataConstructor ::= "cdata" "{" Expr? "}"
