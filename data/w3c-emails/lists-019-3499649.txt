Hi Sarah,

What is it that you would like to do with such a computed constructor that 
you can't do without it? Can you think of any scenarios where the following 
two expressions could have different results?

1. <foo>{ cdata{ $a } }</foo>
2. <foo>{ $a }</foo>

For literal CDATA sections, it is useful to have direct support just so 
people can cut and paste from XML into XQuery.
