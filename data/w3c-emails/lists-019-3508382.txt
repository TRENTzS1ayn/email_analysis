Yes. If the implementor has decided to retain CDATA sections and $a is 
"<", then
1. <foo><![CDATA[<]]></foo>
2. <foo>&lt;</foo>

Although these are semantically identical, it may be important to the 
user to provide such hints for serialization. Other applications may 
depend on this information being retained (for example, creating a 
document for an app that parses CDATA sections differently -- or for 
that matter scrapes them out).
