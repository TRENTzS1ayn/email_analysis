But according to the spec, CDATA is not just for the need of 
non-entitizing: "An implementation may choose to serialize text that 
was constructed using a CDATA section constructor by means of a CDATA 
section in the serialized output, but it is not obliged to do so." I 
realize that it doesn't exist in the data model, but it should be up to 
the implementor to define whether or not the information is retained, 
as the spec suggests.

Yes, I have. It defines that the content of elements with certain names 
is to be output as CDATA, but not specific elements, the way someone 
might with a computed CDATA constructor.

We could, but it seems overzealous for something that seems like it 
belongs in the spec. It is frustrating to see function names and 
parameters be continuously changed but useful, low 
overhead/implementation features not adopted.
