XSLT users do occasionally grumble that they can't retain CDATA sections
through a transformation. They also grumble (rather more frequently, and in
my view with greater justification) about the inability to preserve entity
references through a transformation. As far as I know, no XSLT vendor has
attempted to respond to these grumbles by adding features which would
require fundamental changes to the data model, and I can't see any intrinsic
reason why the situation with XQuery should be any different.
