Hi everyone.

Apologies if this is a FAQ.  Though I had a look through some archives
and didn't see anything relevant, I have a suspicion it would've been
asked before.

Has the XSL working group given thought to specifying incremental XSLT
processors in the recommendations, or have some sort of support for it?
By "incremental" I mean something like this[1], where a processor will
automatically update the output document as modifications to the source
document are made.

I can imagine situations where this would be useful.  For example, if an
XML document and a stylesheet are served to a browser, which converts the
document to XHTML to display, script in the XHTML could be used to do
manipulations of the higher level XML document and have the changes
propagated to the XHTML.

Thanks,

Cameron
