Would it be possible to define special picture parameters for the date and time formatting methods such as "long" "medium" "short". The XSL processor can use this in combination with the language and country parameters to produce a localized format for a particular locale.

An example of this is the java class java.util.text.DateFormat which can produce DateFormats based on the styles DateFormat.LONG, DateFormat.MEDIUM, DateFormat.SHORT and a java.util.Locale which can be constructed from the language and country.

Another example is C#'s String.Format with D,d,T,t,F,f for long and short date, time, date and time.

Another example is in vb with DateFormat Enumeration's vbLongDate, vbShortDate, vbLongTime and vbShortTime.

This will allow authors of style sheets to format dates and times based on a users preferred formats and not have to hard code formats in style sheets.

If the implementation does not have the ability to determine a localized format then it could fall back to a predefined one.

A similar thing could be done with number formats.
