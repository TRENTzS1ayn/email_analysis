Thanks for the comment. We will register this as a last call comment on XSLT
2.0, and you will get a response from the working group in due course.

If you have further last call comments, it would be helpful if you include
[XSLT2.0] (if that's the document you are commenting on) in the subject
line, and ideally a reference number so we can easily identify the comment
in the archives.

> Would it be possible to define special picture parameters for

> "short". The XSL processor can use this in combination with

> An example of this is the java class 
> java.util.text.DateFormat which can produce DateFormats based 
> on the styles DateFormat.LONG, DateFormat.MEDIUM, 
> DateFormat.SHORT and a java.util.Locale which can be 
> constructed from the language and country.
> 
> Another example is C#'s String.Format with D,d,T,t,F,f for 
> long and short date, time, date and time.
> 
> Another example is in vb with DateFormat Enumeration's 
> vbLongDate, vbShortDate, vbLongTime and vbShortTime.
> 
> This will allow authors of style sheets to format dates and 
> times based on a users preferred formats and not have to hard 
> code formats in style sheets.

> A similar thing could be done with number formats.
