Yes, I agree.

If it is more natural depends on context. Hour sounds better in singular,
but second and minute sometimes
indeed are better in plural. My argument is that many existing APIs and
languages uses singular forms,
such as SQL or MFC libraries.

And I think it will be nice to differentiate functions operating on duration
and date/time, by using plural
(quantity of seconds, minutes, hours in duration) and singular (value of
component).

I rethinked this. Now I agree that complex behavior of document() can be
undesirable in XQuery
