/ Per Bothner <per@bothner.com> was heard to say:
| There may be an editorial typo in the specification
| of the one-argument base-uri.  The result is that it
| is unclear where the base-uri of a text node
| be non-empty.  I think the intent is "yes",
| in which case I think this one-word fix will help.  Change
| "The base-uri of all other node types is the empty sequence."
| to
| "The base-uri property of all other node types is the empty sequence."
|  From the context, that appears to have been the intent.
|
| Both the Functions and Operators and the Data Model documents have
| the same problem.

I believe this has been clarified in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
