/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In looking at 3.2 in Data Model there is a description of document order in 
| *documents* and mention of free-standing nodes. But there appears to be no 
| mention of document order in fragments.
|
| It seems to me that fragments may have document order. 
|
| Was it a conscious choice not to discuss this in the Data Model 
| specification? Or is it intended that the document order which is specified 
| for *documents* is also intended to apply to fragments?

I believe I've corrected that oversight in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
