/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| On reading the Data Model document it seems to me that the term "fragment" is 
| used in a way which is ambiguous and potentially confusing.
|
| In 4 it is stated that "A tree whose root node [is not a document node] is a 
| fragment.".
|
| However in 4.2.3 it is stated, "When a data model fragment is created from 
| the PSVI, a document information item is mapped to a document node.". I take 
| that to indicate that a "fragment" acquires a document node. But, if I 
| understand 4 correctly, it is then by definition not a fragment.
|
| I am not sure if the intention is that "fragment" and "data model fragment" 
| are intended to have different meanings (if so that should be clarified) or 
| if they have the same meaning and the descriptions in 4 and 4.2.3 are 
| inconsistent.

I've reworded the text to use the term 'fragment' consistently in the
12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
