/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In 3.3 of Data model mention is made of "sequences of fragments and sequences 
| of documents". I assume that the intention is to refer to sequences of "root 
| nodes" and sequences of "document nodes"?
|
| I think I know what is intended but the way it is phrased opens the 
| possibility of sequences of things other than atomic values and nodes. Some 
| rephrasing seems desirable.

I've changed the wording to avoid that ambiguity in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
