/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In the penultimate sentence of 3.3 of Data Model mention is made of 
| serialization via the infoset.
|
| However, the infoset is not mentioned anywhere in the new Serialization WD, 
| as far as I can see.
|
| Two suggestions:
| 1. There should, perhaps, be a cross reference from Data Model to 
| Serialization
| 2. The descriptions of serialization might better be more clearly aligned 
| between the documents.

The serialization spec is now explicitly referenced in the 12 Nov draft.
I think the relationship between serialization and the data model is clearer.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
