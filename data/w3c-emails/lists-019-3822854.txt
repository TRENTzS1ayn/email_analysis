/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In 4 of Data Model mention is made of fragments which, it is stated, don't 
| have a document node as "root node".
|
| Which other node types can be a "root node"? It isn't stated. Can all 6 other 
| node kinds be a "root node"? If so it should be stated, if not then that too 
| should be made clear.
|
| Can, as an edge case, a "tree" have a "root item" i.e. an atomic value? Not 
| much of a tree, I admit. :)
|
| In a Note in 4.2.1 it is stated that document nodes and XPath 1.0 root nodes 
| are essentially identical. It seems a little perverse, to me at least, to use 
| the term "root node" in XPath 2.0 to contrast with "document node" (as in 4) 
| while recognising that a document node and an XPath 1.0 root node are very 
| similar.
|
| As a final point re 4, the term "root" (unqualified) and the term "root node" 
| are both used in the same section. Are they synonymous? Or is some 
| distinction intended?

All seven kinds of nodes can be roots, I believe that has been
clarified in the 12 Nov draft.

I believe the spec has also made it clear that an atomic value cannot
be the root of a tree. The spec has also been clarified to use the
term 'root node' consistently.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
