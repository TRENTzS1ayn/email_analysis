/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In XPath Chapter 2 it is stated, "Each node has a unique node identity."
|
| In Data Model Chapter 6 it is stated, "A sequence has no identity".
|
| In XPath Chapter 2 it is stated, "An item is identical to a singleton 
| sequence containing that item."
|
| However, if the item in a singleton sequence is a node then it seems that the 
| sequence with a single node has no identity. However if the node exists "on 
| its own", as it were, it does have identity. ... If you see what I mean. :)
|
| Is there an inconsistency? Or have I missed a caveat somewhere?
|
| Perhaps the seeming problem can be solved by adding some judicious qualifying 
| phrase in an appropriate place?

Reworded:

"Equality comparison of sequences is performed by comparing the
items of the sequences. Whereas you can compare the identity of two nodes,
you cannot compare the identity of two sequences; you can only determine
whether or not they contain the same members."

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
