/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In 4.1.1 of Data Model, in line 1, reference is made to a "uri reference". 
| Should that be "URI reference"?

Yes, that has been fixed in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
