/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In 4.1.3 of Data Model, in the first bullet point, the term "qualified name" 
| is used. I think you may have intended to use "expanded-QName" which would 
| seem to correspond better to the returned xsd:QName type.

You are correct. I have corrected that in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
