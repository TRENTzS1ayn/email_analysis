/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| Can a root node which is not a document node be a parent node?
|
| The last sentence in 4 implies that a fragment has a "root node" which is not 
| a document node. Can such a "root node" have child nodes or, more precisely, 
| be a parent node?

The answer is yes, and I'm not sure how the confusion arises. That a
node is a root is independent of its other accessors. In any event,
the sections on both the parent accessor and on root nodes have been
reworded in the 12 Nov draft. Is the new wording clear?

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
