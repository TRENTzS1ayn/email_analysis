/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In the second line of paragraph 2 of 4.2.3 reference is made to "Element, 
| Processing Instruction, Comment and Text nodes". Since dm:node-kind() returns 
| node kinds with lower case initial letters should that not be reflected here?

That section no longer exists.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
