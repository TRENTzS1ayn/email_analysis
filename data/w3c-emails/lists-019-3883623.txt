/ Elliotte Rusty Harold <elharo@metalab.unc.edu> was heard to say:
| Section 4.3.3. of the Data Model draft states:
|
|      If the [validity] property exists and is "valid" and the
| [attributes] property contains an attribute with the local-name "nil"
| and the namespace URI "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance",
| then "true", otherwise "false".
|
| I do not see why validity should be required for an element to be nil.
| The mere presence of the xsi:nil="true" attribute should be
| sufficient. Or just maybe it should also be required that the element
| be empty. However, there's no reason it needs to be valid. I have
| profitably used xsi:nil in documents without any schema or DTD.
|
| I suggest deleting the phrase "the [validity] property exists and is
| "valid" and "

The reference to the xsi:nil attribute was an error, it is the PSVI property
that is interrogated. That has been fixed in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
