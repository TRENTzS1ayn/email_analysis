|>From section 5.
| quote.
| The value space of the atomic values is the union of the value spaces of the
| nineteen primitive XML Schema types.
| unquote.
|
| Does this imply that no types (or at least atomic types) from
| any other source are valid within this data model? 
|
| Is this lockout for anything other than XML schema types or
| some direct derivation?
|
| Or more specifically, lockin to XML schema types?

No. The spec has been updated to reflect that implementors may extend
the set of types available. This change is reflected in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
