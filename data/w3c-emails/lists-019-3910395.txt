/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| There are similar ambiguities/inconsistencies in the use of the term 
| "element" to those which I pointed out re the use of "document".
|
| For example, in 4.3 the heading is "Elements", I assume that what is intended 
| is "Element Nodes".
|
| In 4.3.1 we read "... XML elements. Elements have the following properties 
| ..."
|
| But elements simply don't have the properties stated. Element nodes may. If 
| that is the term which was intended it should be used.

Corrected in the 12 Nov draft as per DM-LC1-0017[1].

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
