/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In 3.3 it is claimed that the data model supports "sequences of documents". 
| As far as I am aware it doesn't.
|
| I assume that what was intended was "sequences of document nodes".
|
| If, however, the above was intended to convey the notion that a sequence may 
| consists of nodes, atomic values and documents then other parts of the DM 
| document need to be brought into line. I assume that simply adding "nodes" 
| solves the seeming inconsistency.

Okay. Fixed in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
