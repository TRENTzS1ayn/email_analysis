/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In 3.3 of DM how is an "inconsistent data model" defined? If they are 
| forbidden it seems sensible to have a clear definition what is being referred 
| to.

I removed that sentence in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
