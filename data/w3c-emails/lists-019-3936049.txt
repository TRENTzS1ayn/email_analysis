/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In 3.4 it is stated that dm:type, in the absence of type information, returns 
| xs:anyType or xs:anySimpleType. However in 4.1.7 it states that the type 
| returned in such a circumstance will be unique and implementation-defined.
|
| On the face of it the statements are inconsistent.

This has been reworded in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
