/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| I am having problems deciphering the following sentence in 3.6:
|
| "If a PSVI is not available, then the data model is constructed from the 
| Infoset in a manner that is compatible with the expectations of well-formed 
| or DTD-validated parsing of an XML document."
|
| Whose expectations are being referred to?
|
| What are the expectations?
|
| The sentence seems to be saying something like, "The data model will be 
| constructed the way you expect for well-formed or DTD-validated XML 
| documents.". But that seems to second guess what I expect which may not be 
| what you assume I expect.
|
| Something more precise in terms of wording would aid comprehension, I think.

This has been reworded in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
