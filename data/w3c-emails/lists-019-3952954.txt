/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In the first bullet point in 4.1.3 it is stated that a "qualified name" is 
| returned. As the term is used in Namespaces in XML, I don't think that is 
| correct.
|
| I think you may have intended to say "expanded-QName".

Yes. Fixed in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
