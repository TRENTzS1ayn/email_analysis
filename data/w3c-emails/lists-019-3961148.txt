/ Svgdeveloper@aol.com was heard to say:
| In the second bullet point of 4.1.3 it is stated that a processing 
| instruction returns an xs:QName but it has no namespace URI.
|
| It seems to me that something that has no namespace URI may not be consistent 
| with the definition of xsd:QName in W3C XML Schema. What is described in 
| 4.1.3 is half a tuple.

An empty namespace name was intended. That's been clarified in the 12 Nov
draft, I believe.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
