/ Per Bothner <per@bothner.com> was heard to say:
| DM 4.5.2 and G.4 say that dm:parent of a namespace node
| is "the parent element node".  It does not define
| what this means.
|
| However, none of the namespace nodes in D Example
| show a value for dm:parent, though dm:parent is
| shown for other nodes.
|
| Should there be a constraint in 4.3.1 and/or 4.5.1 that
| is a namespace node has a parent, then it should be among
| the namespace of its parent?  The converse constraint would
| prohibit sharing of namespace nodes, as in D example.
| The issue should at least be mentioned.
|
| One solution is to just define dm:parent of a namespace as ().

I've clarified the 12 Nov spec and added a note to the example
to explain the lack of parents on the namespace nodes.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
