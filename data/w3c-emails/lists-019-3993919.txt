| In the Data Model spec, section 4.5.4, The table lists [prefix] as "An

| I can't seem to find that description.

This comment has been overtaken by events: the data model to
infoset mapping sections no longer exist in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
