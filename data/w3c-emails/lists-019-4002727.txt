|
| I have reviewed it, and I'm copying this to the public comments list.
|
| I would like to see the Infoset-only model nevertheless process xsi:type
| attributes as a special case.  This would make it possible for a process
| to serialize information about element types, at least, directly into
| an XML document.
|
| In addition, an xdt:attributeTypes attribute would be a Good Thing:
| this would have list-of-QName type, and would alternate an attribute name
| with its type.
|
| Adopting these very slight modifications of Infoset-only rules would
| allow upstream processes to specify type information (which is AFAICT
| the main contribution of the PSVI to the data model) without the overhead
| of a full PSVI.

The working groups decided not to pursue this course.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
