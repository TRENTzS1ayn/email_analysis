/ Peter Coppens <Peter.Coppens@datadirect-technologies.com> was heard to say:
| In http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/
| <http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/> , section 4.3.3 PSVI to Data Model
| Mapping, contains
|
| parent 
|
| The value of the [parent] property.
|
| I wonder whether this is correct, as I assume the [parent] property is an
| infoset item.

This has been clarified in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
