/ Xan Gregg <xan@tibco.com> was heard to say:
| Introducing a new structure, datetime tuples, to capture the info you
| want for datetime types is a good idea, but why not use a real, named
| XML Schema type, as is done for duration?  Of course, it's not
| completely analogous because the value space is expanded by the tuple
| rather than restricted as is the case for the new duration types. The
| tuple seems too magical when there are more transparent options
| available.
|
| Here is a simpleType that captures (a superset of) the value space for
| the tuple.
|
|    <xs:simpleType name="datetimeTZ">
|      <xs:annotation>
|        <xs:documentation>
|          A "list" of a datetime/duration union with the convention
|          that list always has two items: the first item is a datetime
|          and the second item is a duration.
|        </xs:documentation>
|      </xs:annotation>
|      <xs:list itemType="datetimeORduration"/>
|    </xs:simpleType>
|
|    <xs:simpleType name="datetimeORduration">
|      <xs:union memberTypes="xs:datetime xs:duration"/>
|    </xs:simpleType>
|
| Most datetime F&O functions would operate on xdt:datetimeTZ instead of
| xs:datetime, just as functions operate on xdt:*Duration instead of
| xs:duration.
|
| While there is a lexial representation for datetimeTZ (as a two-value
| list), F&O or FS would define functions/casts to convert datetimeTZ to
| the timezoned datetime lexical representation and back.
|
| I'm sure the WG has been round and round on this issue, but in case
| you have considered the above option, please do.

The working groups decided not to pursue this course.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
