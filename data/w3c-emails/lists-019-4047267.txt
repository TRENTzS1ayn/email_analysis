/ David.Pawson@rnib.org.uk was heard to say:
| There appears to be an inconsistancy between 
| the use of implementation-defined and same, without the hyphenation.
| I think the functions document uses it without hyphenation, others
| are more consistant.

I have made this consistent (without hyphenation) in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
