/ "Kay, Michael" <Michael.Kay@softwareag.com> was heard to say:
| The correct place for a diagrammatic representation of the type hierarchy
| used in the data model would appear to be in the data model book; other
| specifications such as F&O should refer to it rather than repeating it.
|
| There is no good overview of the type hierarchy anywhere, the information is
| completely scattered. In particular, there is no explanation of the fact
| that there are actually two independent but related type hierarchies, one
| for "values" (of expressions) and one for "content" (of nodes). The fact
| that we refer to both these overlapping spaces as having types means we need
| to make it much clearer that there are two different spaces, and to show how
| they are related to each other.

The diagram did not make it into the Data Model document, though a
number of other clarifications have been attempted. Do you still feel
that additional material should appear in the Data Model?

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
