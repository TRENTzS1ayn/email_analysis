/ Oliver Becker <obecker@informatik.hu-berlin.de> was heard to say:
| Hello,
|
| section 3.2 Document Order of the XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model
| uses the term "stable" to characterize orders.
| I do not find any definition in this document what a stable order is.
|
| Do you mean, if two nodes A and B whose order is implementation-dependent
| are in some concrete order then this order doesn't change within this
| model (for the lifetime of this instance; never)?
| Does it have to be the same order between two invocations of an implementation?
|
| Moreover, regarding distinct documents, the specification says
|
|    "The relative order of nodes in distinct documents is 
|    implementation-dependent but stable. In other words, given two 
|    distinct documents A and B, if a node in document A is before a 
|    node in document B, then every node in document A is before every 
|    node in document B."
|
| That sounds as if the second sentence ("In other words, ...") is a
| conclusion or an explanation of the term "stable order", but I can't 
| apply this meaning to attribute or namespace nodes.
|
| I believe this section needs a clarification.

The 12 Nov spec has been clarified.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
