I believe the 12 Nov draft has been updated to address these issues.

/ "Kay, Michael" <Michael.Kay@softwareag.com> was heard to say:
| I agree with you, I think the text is wrong. There should never be a
| namespace node whose string value (namespace URI) is zero-length, as
| namespace nodes always represent the declaration of a namespace and not the
| undeclaration.
|
| I think that it is now possible in XSLT to create a parentless namespace
| node: viz
|
| <xsl:variable name="ns" as="node()">
|   <xsl:namespace name="my">namespace.uri</xsl:namespace>
| </xsl:variable>
|
| Though this probably isn't what was envisaged when the DM spec was written -
| at one time there was an idea that namespace nodes would be "shared" between
| elements in some way.

|> Hello,

|> I would appreciate if the XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model 
|> defines whether a default null namespace is represented by a 
|> namespace node or not.
|> 
|> Section 4.5 Namespaces says in 4.5.1
|> 
|>    2 The namespace prefix may be the empty sequence. If the 
|> URI is the 
|>      zero-length string, the prefix must be the empty sequence.
|>      
|> Hmm, there might exist namespace nodes without prefix and 
|> without URI. Such a node would be created by an xmlns="". 
|> OTOH, I would interpret this as an undeclaration of the 
|> default namespace, 
|> thus it removes an existing namespace node (that would be 
|> present otherwise).
|> 
|> The specification should unambiguously state, under which 
|> circumstances such namespace nodes come into live.
|> 
|> I prefer not to introduce such "null" namespace nodes. There 
|> shouldn't be a 
|> difference between <foo /> and <foo xmlns="" />
|> 
|> One more question:
|> Are situations imaginable that a namespace node doesn't have 
|> a parent? Since the specification thinks so I would like to 
|> see a comment just as for attribute nodes.
