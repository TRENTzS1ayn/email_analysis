/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| Consistency of style, within a document and between documents, is
| important.
|
| For example, in the Data Model document there are two different styles
| of definition. One style is [Definition: here is the definition.] The
| other style is to italicize the defined word - for example, the
| definitions of "document" and "fragment" in section 4 "Nodes" second
| paragraph. Note that elsewhere in the same document, for the most
| part, italics serves other purposes than definition: to indicate
| distinguished values ("valid" "invalid" and "notKnown" in 3.6 "Mapping
| PSV Infoset additions to Types" second paragraph) or emphasis ("If the
| validity property *does not exist*..." later in the same section).
|
| If there is a semantic difference behind the two styles, there should
| be a clear reason why some definitions use the more formal
| "[Definition: here is the definition.]" style, while others just use
| italics. And the document should explain the two conventions and the
| reasons for having both of them.

That was editorial carelessness and has been cleaned up in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
