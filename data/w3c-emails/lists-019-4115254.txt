/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, **Section 1, Introduction. *The distinction between data
| model and value in the second paragraph is good, but I think a third
| concept should also be introduced and given a name. This third concept
| is the set of all values currently under consideration during the
| execution of some processor (XSLT, XQuery, etc.) using the data model.
| A possible name for this concept is "data set". Thus the three
| concepts are:
|
| "data model" - the abstract framework specified by this specification
| "data set" - a concrete realization of the data model at a particular
| point in the execution of a processor
| "value" - a value in a data set.

The paragraph in question doesn't seem to be drawing a distinction
between the data model and values, it merely points out that the data
model serves two purposes. With respect to a term for a concrete
realization, where it's convenient for the spec to refer to one, it
now consistently uses the term "instance of the data model."

Please let me know if you feel additional clarification is required.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
