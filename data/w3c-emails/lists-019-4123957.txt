/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4. Nodes. *It seems that a node is similar to,
| but not exactly the same as, an information item, as found in the
| Infoset recommendation and enhanced with the PSV contributions in the
| XML Schema Part 1 recommendation. It would be helpful to say this
| explicitly, especially since you share the term "property" with the
| Infoset, so it is easy to form the impression that a node is simply an
| information item. The reader who starts with this impression is then
| left wondering where the properties not found in the Infoset came from
| (for example, the document-uri property of the document node).
|
| In addition, it would be helpful to specify your general conventions
| for nodes here at the beginning. For example, each node consists of a
| list of named properties. In the Infoset, a property may be "unknown"
| or "no value", but in this specification, those values are not used,
| and instead you say a property may be "empty", even if it is not a
| collection.
|
| Suggestion: The Data Model document might be well advised to include
| an appendix describing the relationships between Data Model properties
| and the Infoset information items and the PSVI, just as the XPath 1.0
| spec did for its data model
|
| (We are aware of the Processing Model work and its relationship to
| this comment).

The relationship between the data model and the infoset is described
in the introduction. Do you believe that additional explanation is
necessary?

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
