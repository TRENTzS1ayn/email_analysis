/ "Kay, Michael" <Michael.Kay@softwareag.com> was heard to say:
| In most database systems, documents are likely to have properties extraneous
| to the actual XML content of the document, and these properties are often
| useful for retrieval. Examples of such properties include document names,
| URIs, dates of creation and modification, ownership, security levels,
| document size, associated schema, document version, and so on. They may also
| include user-allocated properties, for example the approval status of the
| document in some publication workflow.
|
| Many XML database systems are likely to want to offer other interfaces in
| addition to XQuery. A popular interface for content management systems is
| the WebDAV interface. WebDAV allows a document to have an arbitrary set of
| properties, including properties under the control of the system and
| properties under the control of the user.
|
| Document nodes constructed by a query may also have properties, for example
| the MIME media type, the serialization parameters, and the intended
| destination of the document when serialized.
|
| We think it would be useful to extend the data model to allow a document
| node to have such a set of properties. It should be possible to query these
| properties, and to set them when constructing a document node. It should be
| understood that the properties are accessible to applications but that they
| are not serialized as part of the document content.
|
| A possible (though controversial) design that would meet this requirement is
| to allow a document node to have attributes.

The WGs declined to allow document nodes to have attributes.
Implementations are free to store addtional metadata as they wish.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
