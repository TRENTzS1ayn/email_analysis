/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.2.1* says /"Document nodes and XPath 1.0 root
| nodes are essentially identical."/
| If these terms are identical, why invent another term ?

The note about "essentially identical" has been removed in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
