/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.1.6* says:
|
| /"If the node is an element node with type xs:anyType, then its typed
| value is equal to its string value, as an instance of
| xdt:untypedAtomic."/
|
| But *Data Model, Section 4.3.2* says: /"If the element node's type is
| xs:anyType, the dm:typed-value accessor returns the node's string
| value as xs:anySimpleType"/
|
| This seems to be contradictory.

These parts of the spec have been extensively reworked. I believe this
inconsistency has been addressed in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
