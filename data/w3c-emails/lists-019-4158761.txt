/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 3.4*
| What is the namespace for an anonymous type name ?
| Can it be the result of an expression ?
| Does it need to come from a schema ?
| What is legal in an anonymous type name ?
|
| Michael Rys addressed this question in
|
| http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003May/0305.html
| <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003May/0291.html>
| by saying that "Since the name is not exposed and thus the format used
| by an implementation not testable, any such definition would be
| vacuous and not testable or enforceable."
|
| So, is it the Working Groups position that there are no rules at all
| governing anonymous type names ? If so, please add text to that effect.

I believe the 12 Nov spec is explicit on that point.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
