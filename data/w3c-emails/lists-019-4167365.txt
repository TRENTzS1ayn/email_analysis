/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 3.3* /"Schema-validated documents include
| documents in which some elements or attributes have been validated by
| "lax" or "skip" validation."/
|
| This sentence probably means "a document is considered to be
| Schema-validated if it has been validated against a Schema even if, as
| part of that validation, some elements or attributes have been
| validated by 'lax' or 'skip' validation".
| But it can be read as "if a document has had one element validated
| using 'skip' validation, then that's sufficient for it be treated as a
| 'Schema-validated document' ".

The 12 Nov spec has been clarified.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
