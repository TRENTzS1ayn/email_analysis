/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 3.3* /"The data model supports incompletely
| validated documents, but inconsistent data models are forbidden."/
| The two occurrences of "data model" in this sentence presumably refer
| to different notions. The first is "THE data model", ie, the subject
| of this specification. I don't know what the second "data model" is
| referring to, since presumably this specification is taking pains to
| insure that it is not inconsistent. My best guess is that the second
| "data model" is referring to an instance of the data model.
| Assuming we reword the sentence as "...inconsistent instances of the
| data model are forbidden", we are left with the question of defining
| what makes an instance "inconsistent". Perhaps what is meant is that
| the remainder of the specification contains constraints on the data
| model, and instances are forbidden to violate those constraints. Also,
| since the constraints of XML 1.0 do not necessarily apply (see the
| note at the end of section 4.2.4 "Data model to infoset mapping",
| which says that the document information item is not necessarily
| valid), we can not just assume that the collection of constraints that
| do apply are obvious; there needs to be explicit statement of what the
| constraints are.

This section of the spec has been clarified in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
