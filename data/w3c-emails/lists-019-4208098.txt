/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.1.2* If a fragment is a node (as implied by
| *Data Model, Section 3.3* ), we need a node kind for it here.

Any tree that has a root that isn't a document node is a fragment. I
believe the 12 Nov spec has been clarified on this point.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
