/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.3.1* should mention that a child cannot be the
| child of any other node (of more than one node).

I believe that this is covered by constraint 8.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
