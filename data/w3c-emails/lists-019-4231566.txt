/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| The Data Model specification refers to several namespaces by prefixes
| (xs:, xsi:, xdt:) that are commonly associated with those namespaces.
| Please provide a reference to the specifications where these
| namespaces are defined, preferably early in the Data Model document.

Fixed in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
