/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| The term "fragment" is used inconsistently throughout the Data Model
| specification, appearing sometimes in the phrases "document fragment"
| and "data model fragment".
|
| The authoritative definition appears to be in section 4 "Nodes",
| second para:
| "A tree whose root node is some other kind of node [ie, not a document
| node] is referred to as a fragment".
| In view of this definition, the term "document fragment" appears to be
| an oxymoron.
|
| The phrase "data model fragment" appears to be used to mean something
| more general than this definition of "fragment".
| For example, Appendix A, "XML Information Set Conformance" first para:
| "The following information items must be exposed by the infoset
| producer to construct a data model fragment:...".
| In point of fact, the listed information items are equally necessary
| to support documents and not just fragments (note the definition says
| that fragments and documents are mutually exclusive, not that
| fragments are a superset including documents).
|

I believe this has been clarified in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
