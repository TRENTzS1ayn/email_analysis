/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *
| Data Model, Section 1. Introduction* Second para, last sentence:
| "A language is closed ... if the value of every expression in a
| language...".
| The second occurrence of "language" is meant to refer back to the
| first occurrence.
| Suggested solution: change the second "a language" to either "the
| language" or "that language".
| Alternatively, you can replace the first occurrence of "a language" by
| "a language L" and replace the second occurrence by "L".

Yes, fixed.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
