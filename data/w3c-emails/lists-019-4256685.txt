/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 1. Introduction* this paragraph distinguishes
| "value" from "data model".
| But the remainder of the specification does not continue to maintain
| this distinction.
| I have found the following terms used as synonyms for "value":
| "data model", "data model fragment".

As noted in the response to DM-LC1-0050[1], I don't believe the intent of
the introduction is to establish a firm distinction between data model
and value. Specifically, what it says is that all values can be
expressed in the data model; that the data model is closed.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
