/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 3.2 Document order*
| Assuming that the term 'stable' means 'stable for the life of the
| query', it is not clear that there is any requirement that namespace
| declarations must always appear in the same order, or that attributes
| of an element must always appear in the same order. For documents that
| are dynamically generated, this requirement may be burdensome.

Namespace and attribute nodes must be in a stable order.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
