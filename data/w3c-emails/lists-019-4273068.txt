/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 3.2 Document order* First para, last sentence
| "There is precisely one document order and it satisfies the following
| constraints...". The preceding definition defines "a document order".
| Note the article "a", implying that there can be more than one.
| Indeed, the constraints acknowledge that there is more than one way to
| order namespace declarations or attributes. So what does "there is
| precisely one document order" mean ?
|
| Perhaps you mean "For a particular implementation of this data model,
| and for each document considered by that implementation, there is
| precisely one document order..."

This section has been reworded in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
