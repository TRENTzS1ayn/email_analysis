/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 5* says:
|
| /"The typed value of nodes whose type is unknown (for instance because
| they have not been validated) are labeled with the type
| xs:anySimpleType."/
|
| This should say "... labeled with the type xs:anySimpleType or
| xs:anyType" to be consistent with *Data Model, Section 3.4 6th
| paragraph*

This has been corrected in the 12 Nov draft.
