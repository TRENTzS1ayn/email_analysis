/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 3.2 Document order*
| The first paragraph says that a document order is total.
| The last two paragraphs broaden the discussion to include order
| between nodes in different documents, or not in a document at all.
| Is it intended that the ordering in the latter two paragraphs is
| total? Or could a conforming implementation simply say, "I choose not
| to define an ordering between nodes in different documents, or between
| nodes not in any document. My ordering of these things is the trivial
| ordering, the one which such things simply have no ordering."?
|
| Put another way, is there anything that breaks if an implementation is
| not able to place a collection of free-standing nodes into a stable
| order?

This section has been redrafted to make this clearer in the 12 Nov spec.


                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
