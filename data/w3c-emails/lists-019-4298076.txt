/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 3.3 XML Schemas and the XML Information Set*
| third paragraph, second sentence: "XML documents that are not well
| formed are not XML".
| In that case, how can you begin the sentence by calling them XML
| documents? That's like saying "Chickens that are not birds are not
| chickens" - the sentence is self-contradictory.
|
| Proposed solution: delete the first occurrence of "XML".

Agreed. Fixed in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
