/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 3.3 XML Schemas and the XML Information Set*
| fifth para, third sentence: "The data model also supports values that
| are not nodes. Examples of these are atomic values,...".
| The terms "node" and "atomic value" have not been defined.
| Section 3.1 "Node identity" says that XML documents are
| tree-structured, and consist of "nodes" but does not define what these
| nodes are.
| The term "text node" is in common use regarding XML, referring to a
| maximal sequence of consecutive character information items that are
| children of an element.
| Section 4 "Nodes" does define nodes, and specifically mentions text
| nodes. But a "text node" looks like an "atomic value", so we seem to
| have a contradiction at this point, because it says that an "atomic
| value" is an example of a "value" that is not a "node".
|
| To fix this:
| 1. Section 3.1 "node identity", first para, should state that nodes
| are defined in Section 4, "Nodes".
| 2. "Atomic value" is defined in section 5; add a forward reference to
| that definition here to eliminate the suspicion that a "text node" is
| an "atomic value".

The text has been clarified as you suggest in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
