/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 3.6 Mapping PSV Infoset additions to Types*
| sixth para, second word: why is "type" italicized? You are not
| defining the term, and I don't think you are trying to emphasize it
| either.

Fixed in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
