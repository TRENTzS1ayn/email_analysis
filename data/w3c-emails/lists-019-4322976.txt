/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 3.2 Document order*
| The definition defines "document order" for all nodes in a document,
| but the same notion of order is intended to apply to all trees,
| including fragments.
| This is seen, for example, in section 4.1.8 "children Accessor", where
| it says that "For document and element nodes, it returns the nodes
| that are children of that node in document order". An element in a
| fragment needs to have its children ordered, but the definition of
| "document order" does not currently cover this case since "document
| order" only applies to documents.
|
| One solution would be to change the term from "document order" to
| "tree order". However, the term "document order" seems pretty well
| entrenched, so perhaps a better solution is to keep the term but make
| it apply to all trees, not just documents.

This section has been redrafted in the 12 Nov spec to make this
clearer.
                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
