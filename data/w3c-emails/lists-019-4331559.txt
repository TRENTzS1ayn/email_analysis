/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.1.1 base-uri Accessor*
| third para: "If the base URI property ... is non-empty"
| The Infoset recommendation does not have a notion of a property being
| "empty" or "non-empty".
| It does have the notion of a property being "unknown" or "no value".
| The Infoset recommendation says that "unknown" and "no value" are
| different values, but it does not indicate whether the value of a
| [base URI] property may be either these values or just one of them.
| Anyway, you probably mean these values when you say "empty".
|
| Does "empty" mean "unknown" or "no value" ?
| If so, it may be better to use the terminology in the Infoset
| recommendation.

This section of the document has been extensively redrafted.
I believe your comments have been addressed in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
