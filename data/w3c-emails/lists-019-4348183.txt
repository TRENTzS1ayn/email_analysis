/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4. Nodes*
| The second paragraph introduces the notion of "tree". The relationship
| between "trees" and "sequences" (introduced in section 1
| "Introduction") is not clear.
| Specifically, can a tree be a member of a sequence?
|
| Our understanding is: a data set consists of a set of nodes and atomic
| values. The nodes are organized into trees. The most familiar example
| of a tree is an XML document; however, other trees are permitted.
| Atomic values never participate in trees.

Your understanding is correct and I believe the 12 Nov draft is
clearer on this point.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
