/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.2.1 Overview*
| The document-uri property does not correspond to anything in the
| Infoset recommendation or the XML Schema Part 1 recommendation.
|
| What is it?

That is clearly described in the new section 7.1.2. of the 12
Nov draft. Comments made after LC1 have also questioned the value of
the document-uri() accessor. It may yet disappear.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
