/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.1.4 parent Accessor*
| In the Infoset recommendation, the element information item EII
| containing an attribute information item AII is not referred to as the
| "parent" of AII; instead, there is the [owner element] property which
| may be traversed to go from AII to EII. Based on this, it is not clear
| in this specification whether EII is the 'parent' of AII or not.
|
| The first two paragraphs of Section 4 "Nodes" do not resolve this.
| Section 3.1 "Node identity" does say that you assume all the
| "conventional terminology for trees". This might be construed to mean
| that EII is the parent of AII, but then there is the precedent of the
| Infoset recommendation that it is not. On the other hand, 4.3.1
| "Overview" item 10 says "If an attribute node A has a parent element
| E..." which indicates that attributes do have a 'parent' rather than
| an 'owner element', and 4.4.2 "Accessors" defines that dm:parent of an
| attribute returns "the parent element node".

The sections you identify have been significantly reworded in the 12
Nov draft. The DM clearly states that attribute nodes have a parent.
That parent is directly analogous to the owner in infoset terms, but
the DM design normalizes the notion of parent and owner to simply
"parent".

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
