/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.2.1 Overview*
| The children and unparsed-entities properties are collections and may
| be empty.
| The base-URI is not a collection.
| According to the Infoset recommendation, it may be "unknown" or "no
| value" but not "empty".

The draft has been extensively revised and I believe this point
has been clarified in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
