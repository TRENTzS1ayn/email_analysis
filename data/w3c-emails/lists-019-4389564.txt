/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.2.3 PSVI to data model mapping*
| The mapping does not say how to set all properties of the document node.
| What are the values of the unparsed-entities and document-uri
| properties of the document node?

The 12 Nov draft has been clarified on this point.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
