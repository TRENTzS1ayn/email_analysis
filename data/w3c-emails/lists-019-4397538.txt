/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *
| Data Model, Section 3.2 Document order*
| Is this section about "document order" or is it actually about "order
| of nodes" whether they are in the same document or not?
| The title says it is about "document order", and the only definition
| in this section is called "document order", but the last two
| paragraphs broaden the discussion to include order of nodes in
| multiple documents, or not in a document at all.
|
| Suggested solution: change the title to "Node order" or something similar.

I've attempted to clarify these points in the 12 Nov draft.
Please let me know if you feel additional clarification is required.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
