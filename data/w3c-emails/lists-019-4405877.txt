/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.2.1 Overview*
| Following the numbered list with 7 items, it says "the children of the
| document node must not be empty".
| This sentence is ambiguous.
| It could mean "The [children] property of the document information
| item may not be empty" or it may mean "Each child of the document node
| may not be empty (ie, each child must have children of its own)."
| This shows two things:
| 1. It is good to have special notation, such as the square brackets,
| to mark properties, especially when the name of the property is plural.
| 2. It is good to write universal quantifiers in the singular ("each
| child") rather than the plural ("the children").
|
| Also, we read "the children of the document node must not be empty and
| consist exclusively of element nodes, etc."
| This is ambiguous: does it mean "must not be empty and must not
| consist..." or does it mean "must not be empty and must consist..."

I believe the 12 Nov draft has been clarified on this point.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
