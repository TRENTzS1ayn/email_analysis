/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.3.4 Data Model to Infoset Mapping*
| The mapping to the [attributes], [in-scope namespaces] and [namespace
| attributes] properties says to create sequences.
| However, these properties in the Infoset are unordered sets.

These sections have been removed from the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
