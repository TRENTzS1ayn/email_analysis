/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.3.3 PSVI to data model mapping*
| First bullet under the children property: it says that the order of
| nodes is implementation-defined. Granted that the character nodes will
| be collected into a single text node, should the processing
| instructions and comments retain their relative order?
|
| That is, take the original sequence of [children], delete all the
| character information items, map the remaining information items to
| nodes, retaining the order, and finally insert the text node at an
| implementation-defined point in the sequence of nodes.

For elements with simple content, the WGs were not able to agree that
the relative order of children should be preservered. Implementations
are therefore free to rearrange them.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
