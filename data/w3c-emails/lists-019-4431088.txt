/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.3.4 Data Model to Infoset Mapping*
| In the mapping to the [children] attribute, the final clause does not
| make sense:
| "and that sequence of information items is used as the value for the
| [namespace name] property".

These sections have been removed from the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
