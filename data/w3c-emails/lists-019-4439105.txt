/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 5. Atomic values*
| The bullets in the middle of this section would be better expressed in
| the singular,
| eg, "The value of a node whose type is an XML Schema primitive type
| ... is represented as an atomic value of that type".
| In general, when you have implicit universal quantification, it is a
| better practice to use the singular because it avoids ambiguity.

Agreed. I have attempted to fix these problems in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
