/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.3.4 Data Model to Infoset Mapping*
| The mapping to the [children] attribute is described as creating a
| "sequence".
| However, the term "sequence" has a reserved meaning in this specification.
| It would be better to say that the result is an "ordered list", the
| term found in the Infoset recommendation.
|
| In addition, it should be made explicit that this mapping preserves order.

These sections have been removed from the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
