/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.3.3 PSVI to data model mapping*
| The mapping to the nilled attribute seems to assume that only
| xsi:nil='true' is permitted by XML Schema Part 1.
| XML Schema Part 1, section 3.2.7, second box, says that the xsi:nil
| attribute is type boolean, meaning that its value may be 'false'. Thus
| the mere presence of an xsi:nil attribute does not insure that the
| element has been nilled; you also need to look at the attribute value.

The 12 Nov draft has been clarified on this point.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
