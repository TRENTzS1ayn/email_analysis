| Expanded name terminology
| -------------------------
| [2] The draft uses the term "expanded QName" for namespace name /
| local name pairs.  This is an unfortunate change given that Namespaces
| 1.1 has adopted the term "expanded name" from XPath 1.0.
|
| The draft uses the term "namespace URI" in several places.  "Namespace
| name" is preferable.

The WGs considered this change and rejected it.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
