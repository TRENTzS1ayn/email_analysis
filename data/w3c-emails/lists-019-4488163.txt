/ Paul Grosso <pgrosso@arbortext.com> was heard to say:
| Type mapping list incomplete
| -------------------------
| [3.6] The list defining the type of an element information item is not
| complete.  What happens in the case where [member type definition]
| or [type definition] is present but hase no name property (because
| the type is anonymous)?  Presumably the generated anonymous type
| name is used.

My understanding is that if [member type definition] exists and has no
{name} property then [member type definition anonymous] also exists.
Is that not the case? I believe the revised mapping in 4.3.1 of the 12
Nov draft draft is complete.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
