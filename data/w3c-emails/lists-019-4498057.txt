/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| This section uses a different format for describing its mappings than
| the next section, 4.2.4, Data Model to Infoset mapping.
|
| This section lists each target property in bold with an indented
| paragraph describing how to compute the target property, whereas
| section 4.2.4 arranges the information in a table.
|
| The tabular form seems better, chiefly because the column headings
| "Property" and "value" are of value.
|
| Glancing over the other node types, it appears that you have been
| consistent in this convention, but we would prefer to simply have a
| table for the mappings in either direction.

The mapping sections have been extensively redrafted. I believe
they are now consistent in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
