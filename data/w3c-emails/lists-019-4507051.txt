/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.2.4 Data model to Infoset mapping*
|
| The result of the mapping is supposed to be an instance of the Infoset
| specification. It says that the [children] property in this Infoset is
| a 'sequence'.
| But 'sequence' is a term reserved for an XQuery data model instance,
| not a term for something that occurs in an Infoset.
| The correct term in the world of Infosets is 'ordered list'.
|
| See also dm-mappings-sequence,
| http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jun/0273.html

These sections have been removed from the 12 Nov draft.
