/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.3.1 Overview*
|
| Point 9 says that attributes are not children of their parents.
| Shouldn't this also say that namespaces are not children of their parents?
|
| More generally, the use of "parent" for what the Infoset calls "owner
| element" is probably a mistake.
| It is unduly confusing to say that something is not a child of its parent !

I've updated the draft to note that namespaces are not children
either. The parent:: axis operates consistently with the definitions
used in this document. It may be confusing to speak of the parent of
an attribute when the infoset calls that the owner, but there his
historical precedent in XPath 1.0 for doing so. It is also, in its own
way, more consistent.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
