/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.3.1 Overview*
|
| Point 10 says that if an attribute A has parent element E, then A must
| be an attribute of E.
| Shouldn't this also say that if namespace N has parent element E, then
| N must be a namespace of E?

The section on namespace nodes describes the namespace constraints.
In particular, in XPath 2.0 implementations are not required to expose
the namespace axis and consequently do not have to provide namespaces
with parents.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
