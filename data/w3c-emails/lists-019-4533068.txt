/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.3.2 Accessors*
|
| It says "The accessors dm:namespaces and dm:attributes return the same
| set of namespace and attribute nodes (respectively) associated with
| the element. They are not constrained to return them in any particular
| order."
|  From this one might conclude that these accessors might return nodes
| in different orders on different invocations.
| But Section 3.2 maintains that there is a stable (though
| implementation-defined) order of namespace nodes and attribute nodes.
|
| If these accessors are not bound by that order, does it really make
| sense to say that these nodes are ordered? Probably what is meant by
| this sentence is "These accessors return nodes in document order,
| which is stable but implementation-defined" instead of saying there
| are no constraints on the order at all.

I believe this has been clarified by the redrafting in the 12
Nov spec.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
