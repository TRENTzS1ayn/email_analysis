/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.4.3 PSVI to Data Model mapping*
|
| Under 'string-value' it says "The [schema normalized value] PSVI
| property if that exists, or the [normalized value] property."
| "Otherwise" would be better to use instead of "or", which implies that
| either one is acceptable.

Ok. Fixed in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
