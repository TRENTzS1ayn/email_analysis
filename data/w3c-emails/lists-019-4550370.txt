/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.6.1 Overview*
|
| In the middle of this section it says "Namespace nodes must satisfy
| the following constraints". Presumably what is meant is "Processing
| instruction nodes must satisfy the following constraints".

Yes. Fixed in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
