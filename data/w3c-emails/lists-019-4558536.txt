/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section Appendix A, XML Information Set Conformance*
|
| First para, second sentence uses the undefined term "data model
| fragment". The term "fragment" is defined. However, "fragment" is
| defined to exclude XML documents, and I believe that the material in
| this list is intended to apply to XML documents as well as fragments.
| The encompassing term appears to be "tree". See section 4 "Nodes"
| second para.
|
| (If we do away with the term "fragment" as suggested in
| http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jun/0287.html
| presumably it will be replaced here by "tree" ?)

This section has been redrafted to clarify this point in the 12
Nov spec.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
