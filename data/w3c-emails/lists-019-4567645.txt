/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.1 Accessors*
|
| Suggestion: add a dm:owner accessor, defined for attributes and
| namespace nodes.
|
| This allows dm:parent and dm:children to symmetrical.
|

As mentioned in the response to DM-LC1-0098[1], the WGs feel that the
current use of a parent accessor is consistent and acceptable.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
