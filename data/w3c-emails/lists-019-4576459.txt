/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.1.6 typed-value Accessor*
|
| Should the return type for a comment node be xs:string rather than
| xdt:untypedAtomic ?

Yes. Fixed in the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
