/ Stephen Buxton <stephen.buxton@oracle.com> was heard to say:
| *Data Model, Section 4.1.6 typed-value Accessor*
|
| Should the return type for a namespace node be xs:uri rather than
| xdt:untypedAtomic ?

The WG decided to leave it xdt:untypedAtomic. The F&O
functions that deal with URIs all expect strings, so using
xdt:untypedAtomic allows them to be used more easily with those
functions.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
