/ Ray Whitmer <raydwhitmer@aol.com> was heard to say:
| The DOM Working Group appreciates the attention given to the DOM
| concerns communicated previously.&nbsp; The refactoring of that
| specification to not rely on functional-looking constructors has done a
| lot to make the specification easier for us to understand and integrate
| with DOM concepts.&nbsp; At the previous DOM F2F meeting, I was asked
| to express a number of remaining issues.&nbsp; I will refer to XQuery
| 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model as XPDM2.<br>
| <h2>DOM1</h2>
| The DOM WG appreciates the value of the infoset mapping of the model
| and the work involved in refining it.&nbsp; The DOM WG still finds it
| unfortunate that the XPDM2 cannot rely primarily on an infoset mapping
| (See original issue 1a Different Data Models in W3C).&nbsp; Issues be
| avoided, and there could be other mismatches we have missed in our
| reading of your latest revision.<br>

These sections have been removed from the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
