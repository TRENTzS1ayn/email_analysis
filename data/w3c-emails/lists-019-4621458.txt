| <h2>DOM5</h2>
| When dealing with id/idref, XPDM2 exposes xml schema types, when in
| fact these are dtd types.&nbsp; See:<br>
| <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#ID">http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#ID</a></p>
| <p>see also <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/query-datamodel/#PSVI2Types">http://www.w3.org/TR/query-datamodel/#PSVI2Types</a></p>
| <p>XML 1.0: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#id">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#id</a></p>
| <p>If
| the [attribute type] property exists and has one of the following
| values:
| ID, IDREF, IDREFS, ENTITY, ENTITIES, NMTOKEN, or NMTOKENS, the {target
| namespace}
| is "
| <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema</a>"
| and the {name} is the [attribute type].</p>
| <p>id is different defined in xml schema (ncname) than in dtd (name).
| They are mixing the two</p>
| <p>the target namespace should be dtd instead of xmlschema<br>
| </p>

The data model exists to support languages and applications that
wish to operate on it. While it is true that XML Schema provides
equivalent types but does not replace or reuse the DTD types, there
seems to be no value in preserving that distinction in the data model.
To do so would suggest that applications could find value in
distringuishing between the two flavors. In fact, the opposite is
true, the fact that two flavors exist means that applications need to
test for both kinds of values and act accordingly. By building a
single data model with only a single flavor of these types, we are
providing a significant simplification for all processes that access
the data model.


                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
