/ Ray Whitmer <raydwhitmer@aol.com> was heard to say:
| <h2>DOM6<br>
| </h2>
| In XPDM 4.6.4, [element content whitespace] is purported to be
| false.&nbsp; This is another case like shown in issue DOM2, where there
| might be a more-complete infoset available which knows the real value
| of this information and make it available to various functions, rather
| than forcing the infoset value to be inaccurate.<br>

These sections have been removed from the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
