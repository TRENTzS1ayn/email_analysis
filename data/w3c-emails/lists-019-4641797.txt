/ Ray Whitmer <raydwhitmer@aol.com> was heard to say:
| <h2>DOM3</h2>
| Also in In XPDM2 4.3.4, [namespace attributes] description cited above
| claims that is constructed as a sequence of [namespace] information
| items.&nbsp; This is not possible because a sequence of [namespace]
| information items is not at all the same thing as [namespace
| attributes].<br>

These sections have been removed from the 12 Nov draft.


                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
