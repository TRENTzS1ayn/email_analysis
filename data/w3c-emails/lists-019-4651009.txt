/ Ray Whitmer <raydwhitmer@aol.com> was heard to say:
| <h2>DOM7</h2>
| XPDM2 is often not just an extension of the infoset, but a
| relaxation.&nbsp; A mapping is provided, but no information about what
| happens to the mapping when the model conflicts with the infoset.&nbsp;
| These issues have been raised before.&nbsp; For example, what is the
| infoset mapping when there are more than one element child nodes of the
| document node?&nbsp; This needs to be clearly specified.&nbsp; DOM,
| does not permit this particular violation of infoset.&nbsp; An XPath
| implementation on top of DOM would not be able to represent this sort
| of infoset violation.&nbsp; This may be true wherever the data model is
| more relaxed from the infoset.&nbsp; In any cases where DOM does not
| rigorously guarantee a valid infoset, it reconciles deviations during
| serialization or normalization in a specified way.&nbsp; XPDM2 does not
| seem to do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need some sort of fix in the
| XPath specification, if only to be able to easily refer to
| this sort of infoset relaxation and the inability of some
| implementations to represent it (as well as the inability of such a
| model to be serialized as well-formed XML).<br>

These sections have been removed from the 12 Nov draft.
