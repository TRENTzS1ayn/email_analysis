/ Ray Whitmer <raydwhitmer@aol.com> was heard to say:
| <h2>DOM8</h2>
| The DOM API has used a nodeName accessor since level 1 which was
| further refined as namespace support was incorporated in level 2.&nbsp;
| The XPDM2 specification seems to have a dm:node-name accessor which
| behaves quite differently from the DOM accessor.&nbsp; We believe that
| either the value / behavior should match, or a different name should be
| used to avoid conflict and confusion.<br>

Accessors in the data model are abstract, they are not intended to be exposed
directly in APIs. APIs will use the operators and functions defined in the F&amp;O
document. Therefore no conflict exists.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
