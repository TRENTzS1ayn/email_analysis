/ Paul Grosso <pgrosso@arbortext.com> was heard to say:
| Apologies for the tardiness of this extra comment from
| XML Core WG (mostly by Fran?ois Yergeau).
|
| Missing version property on document nodes
| ------------------------------------------
| [4.2.1] says that Document nodes have only base-uri, children, 
| unparsed-entities and document-uri properties.  But there is at 
| least one function in F&O which will behave differently depending 
| on the XML version (fn:codepoints-to-string raises an error if a 
| code point is not a "legal XML character").  Therefore it would 
| seem that documents also need a version property reflecting the 
| infoset one.

The version of XML is a serialization issue. The data model (and
F&amp;O) operate on any version of XML.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
