This reply addresses editorial issues raised by the I18N LC1 comments

/ Martin Duerst <duerst@w3.org> was heard to say:
[...]
| [1] In general, this is a very extensive and rather boring document.
| Where possible, it should be shortened and compacted, to make it
| easier to get the relevant points.

The document has been extensively redrafted and is considerably shorter.

| [2] There are mappings between the following different things:
| - properties of nodes of the data model
| - the corresponding accessors
| - the mapping from the PSVI (post-schema validation infoset)
|    to the properties
| - the mapping from accessor output to XML infoset properties
| (in the other draft we are reviewing, there are also functions
| corresponding to the accessors).
|
| At least one of these could easily be removed (e.g.
| the properties or the accessors).

The mapping from the data model back to the infoset has been removed.

| [3] 1. Intro: 'stylesheet or query' should be replaced by 'transform or query'

As a purely editorial matter, I disagree. The XSLT specification uses
the term stylesheet almost exclusively.

| [4] 2. expanded-QName: Does this allow to handle special cases such as
|     XSLT that transforms XSLT, or XQuery that queries XQuery,...?

Yes.

| [5] 3.2 Document order: "The relative order of nodes in distinct
| documents is implementation-dependent but stable. In other words,
| given two distinct documents A and B, if a node in document A is
| before a node in document B, then every node in document A is before
| every node in document B.
|     The second sentence sounds like a corollary from the first, but is
|     a non sequitur. It could as well be that an implementation decides
|     to order first all the first nodes from all the documents, then all
|     the second nodes, and so on. If indeed all nodes of one document
|     have to be before all nodes of another document, that should be
|     said explicitly, and not only as 'in other words'.

The section on document order has been redrafted.

| [6] 3.3, markup of [Definition]. Using square brackets for indicating
|     definitions doesn't look good at all. Also, there should not
|     be a period before and after the closing ].

The WAI guidelines suggest the square bracket syntax. If you can
propose an alternate presentation that satisfies the WAI guidelines,
I'd be happy to entertain it.

| [9] 3.3 "The data model supports incompletely validated documents, but
| inconsistent data models are forbidden."
|      What is an inconsistent data model? What actually happens when there
|      is such a model? Does an error get thrown?

This section has been redrafted.

| [10] 3.4 "In either case, the type names must also appear in the
| In-scope Schema Definitions (as defined in [XPath 2.0]) available to
| the processor."
|      'type name' or rather 'type definitions' or 'types'? There are
|      anonymous type names, but it seems strange to say that these
| appear somewhere.

The discussion of anonymous type names has been redrafted.

| [13] 3.6.1, editorial: "Lexical representations that do not have a
| timezone are assumed to be in UTC for the purposes of normalization."
| ->
|     "Lexical representations that do not have a timezone are assumed
| to be in UTC for the purposes of normalization ONLY."

OK.

| [14] 4.1.6 typed-value: It would be good to have some explanation of what
|      the idea/purpose of this accessor is. It seems to be strange that
|      some cases produce errors. Why does mixed content produce a string,
|      but complex content, a subset of mixed content, produce an error?

The accessor sections have been extensively redrafted.

| [15] *** 4.1.8 children Accessor: "The sequence of children will never
| contain adjacent text nodes." (see also 4.2.1)
|      It is good that text nodes are always merged. But this should
|      be stated as a property of the data model, not just mentioned
|      in an accessor description.

The accessor sections have been extensively redrafted.

| 4.2.1 "The children must consist exclusively of element, processing
| instruction, comment, and text nodes if it is not empty. Attribute,
| namespace, and document nodes can never appear as children"
|      [16] - 'if it is not empty' seems irrelevant, obviously an empty document
|        won't contain any nodes of other types either.
|      [17] - There should be a period at the end

The accessor sections have been extensively redrafted.

| [18] 4.2.1, "Implementations that support DTD processing and access to
| the unparsed entity accessors, use the unparsed-entities property to
| associate information about an unordered collection of unparsed
| entities with a document node."
|      spurious comma

OK.

| [22] *** 4.3.1: processing instructions and comments: Is there a way
|      to ignore these (if not in the data model, then in XQuery and XSLT?)
|      Because they are not part of the actual text, ignoring them
|      is often desirable. In that case, the text nodes should merge
|      automatically.

The specification states explicilty that they may be ignored. If they
are ignored adjacent text nodes must be merged.

| [23] 4.3.2 "If the element node's type is xs:anyType, the
| dm:typed-value  accessor returns the node's string value as
| xs:anySimpleType. If the type is a complex type with complex content,
| invoking dm:typed-value raises an error."
|      Doesn't anyType include complex types?

The accessor sections have been extensively redrafted.

| [24] 4.3.2: One additional accessor: Why is this accessor not listed
| in the table?

The accessor sections have been extensively redrafted.

| [25] 4.3.3: Ale xml:base attributes treated as special attributes or like
|      namespace declarations?

The xml:base attributes appear in the data model as normal attributes.

| [26] 4.4.1: "Attribute nodes encapsulate XML attributes": 'represent' may be
|      better than 'encapsulate'.

OK.

| [27] 4.4.2: The details about typed-value are useless duplications. It would
|      be better to specify this very clearly in one single place, and
|      just point to it from other places.

The accessor sections have been extensively redrafted.

| [28] 4.4.3: "The xs:QName IS computed..."

This section has been redrafted.

| [29] 4.4.4: [owner element] -> [parent]

This section has been removed.

| [30] ***4.5.1: uri -> anyURI (or an equivalent explanation)

The URI is property like the others. I think it would seem strange to
suggest a mapping at this point in the spec.

| [31] ***4.8.3: "The string-value is not W3C normalized as described in
| the Character Model for the World Wide Web version 1.0 draft."
|      This may be misunderstood that the string value has to be
|      non-normalized. It should at least be clarified as follows:
|      "The string-value is not necessarily W3C normalized as described
|       in the Character Model for the World Wide Web version 1.0 draft.
|       It is the responsibility of data providers to provide appropriately
|       normalized text, and the responsibility of programmers to make
|       sure that operations do not de-normalize text."
|      Even better clarification, in particular of the first sentence,
|      is highly desirable, to clearly say that this refers to a state,
|      and not an action.

OK.

| [32] 5. "The values of nodes whose type is derived by union from an
| XML Schema primitive type are represented by a sequence of atomic
| values each of whose type is one of the individual types from the
| union. The union type information is lost and only the specific types
| of each individual item is retained."
|      this seems to apply to lists of unions, or maybe unions of lists,
|      but not to simple unions. This should be clarified.

This section has been redrafted.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
