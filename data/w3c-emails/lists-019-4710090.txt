/ Martin Duerst <duerst@w3.org> was heard to say:
| [7] *** 3.3 data model support of values that are not supported
|     by the XML Infoset: What about pcdata with an associated
|     language information? What about document fragments with
|     associated inherited attributes in general? RDF is dealing
|     with such things, and it would be very good if they could be handled.

The WGs have no plans to address these issues beyond the support
already provided by the data model (such as examining the ancestors of
a node to find relevant xml:lang attributes).

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
