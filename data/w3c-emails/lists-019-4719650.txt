/ Martin Duerst <duerst@w3.org> was heard to say:
| [8] *** The handling of inherited attributes in general is an important
|     issue for I18N (because of xml:lang) that wasn't dealt with at
|     all in XSLT 1.0. Apart from what may be needed in the data model,
|     support is also important on a higher level.

The WGs have no plans to provide special support for inherited
attributes beyond the support already provided by the data model
(i.e., examining the ancestors of a node to find relevant attributes).

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
