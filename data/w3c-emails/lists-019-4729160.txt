/ Martin Duerst <duerst@w3.org> was heard to say:
| [11] *** anyType, anySimpleType, anyAtomicType, untypedAtomic, string,
| text nodes:
|      This is a very general concern, but very important for
|      internationalization. There seems to be a proliferation of type
|      variants dealing with the simplest of things in XML, namely simple
|      text. This seems to ruin quite a bit of the benefits of using
|      Unicode; now that we have solved the character encoding problems,
|      we don't want to create arbitrary differences for simple pieces of
|      text. But various specs (e.g. also RDF) seem to come up with
|      additional ways of creating arbitrary differences.
|      anyAtomicType and untypedAtomic seem to be badly explained
|      and justified. We have to make sure that whenever possible, there
|      is no arbitary boundaries in functionality. Rather than treating
|      string, text nodes, and untyped as three completely different
|      things, they should work as much as possible in an overloaded
|      way similar to the number operators.

The WGs have attempted to clarify the reasons why these types are
needed and how they are used. Please let me know if you feel that
further clarification is necessary after reviewing the 12 Nov drafts.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
