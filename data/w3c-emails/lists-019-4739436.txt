/ Martin Duerst <duerst@w3.org> was heard to say:
| [12] *** 3.6.1 date and time mappings: for things with timezones,
| canonicalizing
|      the time zone and then representing the original time zone separately
|      seems to make sense. But for values without a timezone, representing
|      them as if they were in UTC is inherently wrong and will lead to
|      a lot of misunderstandings. (having things with timezones and things
|      without timezones as separate types would have been the better
|      solution originally, and maybe it's still not too late for that)

As you say, it's too late for a number of solutions that would have
avoided this problem. We believe that the current documents reflect a
pragmatic compromise on the many subtleties of this issue.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
