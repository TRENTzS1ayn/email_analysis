/ Ray Whitmer <raydwhitmer@aol.com> was heard to say:
| <h2>DOM2</h2>
| In XPDM2 4.3.4, [namespace attributes] are returned as "the sequence of
| <b>namespace information item</b>s constructed from the nodes that are
| present in the difference between the sequence of nodes returned by the
| <span class="function"><a  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/#dm-namespaces"><span  class="prefix">dm:</span>namespaces</a></span> accessor on this
| element and the sequence of nodes returned by the <span  class="function"><a  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/#dm-namespaces"><span  class="prefix">dm:</span>namespaces</a></span> accessor of this
| element's <span class="function"><a  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-datamodel/#dm-parent"><span  class="prefix">dm:</span>parent</a></span>".<br>
| <br>
| But [namespace attributes] is information which was not accounted for
| in XPDM2.&nbsp; Claiming that this information is always the delta
| seems inaccurate and causes problems.&nbsp; If, for example, the data
| model is built on a model such as DOM which preserves this information,
| this would seem to force a processor to ignore the more-accurate
| available information and rely on false information.&nbsp; This means
| that DOM and XPDM2 cannot be seen as views of a single unified data
| model and may make it quite difficult to produce functions which rely
| on this information which XPath has lost.<br>
| <br>
| For example, let's say the environment containing the XPath
| implementation contains a function which verifies a digital signature
| on a subtree, returning a boolean.&nbsp; In terms of XPath, it is
| impossible to detect whether the signature is correct or not, because
| the signature is different depending upon exactly where the declaration
| is in the infoset, between cases which produce identical XPath
| data.&nbsp; The function could gather the rest of the information
| missing from DOM or some other more-complete infoset representation,
| but XPath's declaration that it possesses the infoset information which
| turns out to be flawed confuses and seems to hide the real accurate
| information that may be required by other infoset operations.<br>
| <br>
| This is a problem seen in other cases in XPDM2, where inaccurate
| information is used in the mapping to cover for information not carried
| by XPDM2.&nbsp; The infoset mapping should not claim to posses this
| infoset information which it does not which interferes if the actual
| information is present.<br>
