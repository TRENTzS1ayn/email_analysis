/ Martin Duerst <duerst@w3.org> was heard to say:
| [19] 4.2.2 typed-value: why does document return the string value, but
|     any of its elements could return an error?

Because document nodes do not have any type so it's simplest to employ
behavior that is backwards compatible with XPath 1.0.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
