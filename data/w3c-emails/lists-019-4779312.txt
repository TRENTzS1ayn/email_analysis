/ Ray Whitmer <raydwhitmer@aol.com> was heard to say:
| <h2>DOM4</h2>
| In XPDM2 4.3.4, it is not clear whether the namespace information is
| even available as namespace nodes, since that is an optional
| presentation of namespace information in XPDM2, which may otherwise be
| available via accessors.<br>

These sections have been removed from the 12 Nov draft.


                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
