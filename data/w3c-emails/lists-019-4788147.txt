/ Martin Duerst <duerst@w3.org> was heard to say:
| [21] *** 4.2.4: [character encoding scheme]: "The values of these
| properties are implementation-defined but must be consistent with the
| rest of the Infoset constructed."
|      What does 'consistent' mean here? There is a dependency between
|      non-ASCII element/attribute/... names and the encoding chosen.
|      But for a data model that produces an infoset that is (not yet)
|      intended for serialization, it almost seems that any specific
|      value would be inappropriate. On the other hand, when actually
|      being written out, at least for XSLT, the property is not
|      implementation-dependent, but determined by the <output>
|      element. So we suggest the following text:
|      "irrelevant during processing, determined by XQuery or XSLT
|      for output"

This section has been removed from the 12 Nov draft.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
