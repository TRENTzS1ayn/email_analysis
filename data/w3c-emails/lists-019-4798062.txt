/ Martin Duerst <duerst@w3.org> was heard to say:
| [20] *** 4.2.2 and many other places: As far as we understand from previous
|     discussions, xs:string is often used instead of xs:anyURI for
|     convenience (to avoid additional casts). It is important in these
|     cases to clearly state that the values actually have to be anyURIs,
|     AND are treated according to anyURI syntax.

The DM doesn't provide any accessors that allow users to set these
values. The values returned will be the ones that the system actually
employed to obtain documents, collections, or what have you. The DM
will return what the application provides, without any additional
checking.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
