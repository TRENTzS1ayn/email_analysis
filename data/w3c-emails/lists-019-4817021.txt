/ Martin Duerst <duerst@w3.org> was heard to say:
| D. Example:
|      [34] *** xml:lang should be used in the instance, not only appear
|        in the schema (and in the schema be allowed higher-up so
|        that it can be inherited)

Ok

|      [35] *** Defining a default currency in the schema is bad design
|        practice. Without the schema, the data is basically useless.
|        Please choose something different for an example of default attribute
|        handling.

I accept that it would be bad practice, but I would prefer not to
change the example.

|      [36] *** The monetaryAmount type works well for some currencies
|        (USD, EUR,...), but does not work for others (Yen,...).
|        Please generalize. The number of fractional digits needed
|        currently is 0, 2, or 3.
|        for details, please see:
| http://www.bsi-global.com/Technical+Information/Publications/_Publications/t
| ig90x.doc

I'm sure it wouldn't work internationally, but I don't feel that the
 illustrative value of the example is diminished by this shortcoming.

|      [37] *** The pop-culture example may make it difficult for non-native
|        readers to understand the example, or to create a reasonable
|        translation.

Removed.

|      [38] - "Literal strings are shown without the xs:string() constructor"
|        this should say that strings are shown in quotes

Fixed.

|      [39] - Why are N1-N5 before P1 and E1?

The order is not significant.

|      [40] - A4: why is typed-value xs:token?

Because the type of the label attribute is xs:token. Or do I not
understand your question?

|      [41] - typed-value of E5: inconsistent.

Fixed.

|      [42] - other inconsistencies include: children(E5)->T2,
|        string-value(A7), (A8), (A9), (A10), (A11) (string and typed
|        values seem out of sync)

Corrected.

|      [43] - Graphic representation of the data model. [large view]: This
|        should be provided in SVG

Yes. Done.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
