/ "C. M. Sperberg-McQueen" <cmsmcq@acm.org> was heard to say:
| 2.1. Time zones
|
|     The [24]query data model construes timezones as significant in the
|     value as well as the lexical forms of xs:dateTime, xs:date, and
|     xs:time. The XML Schema specification does not forbid applications to
|     take timezone information into account; the timezone information is
|     visible in the lexical forms of the post-schema-validation information
|     set. That said, however, the data model's value space for this type is
|     definitely not XML Schema's value space, and the situation is at best
|     confusing for users.
|     We believe that the discrepancy between the XML Query and XML Schema
|     accounts of these types is untenable, because it will place an
|     unacceptable burden on users of the two languages. As a Working Group,
|     we oppose the progression of the Query/XSL specifications while this
|     discrepancy persists.
|     We believe the three Working Groups must discuss this and related
|     questions and reach consensus, and changes must be made either in one
|     of the two type systems or the other, or in both. We are willing to
|     make appropriate changes in XML Schema 1.1 to achieve this
|     harmonization if together we reach consensus that that is what is
|     needed.
|     It may be noted that some members of the Schema WG favored including
|     the timezone in a valuespace tuple in the first place. Others believe
|     that there is a serious problem with any evaluation mechanism which
|     does not realize that "5 p.m. Eastern Time" and "2 p.m. Pacific Time"
|     are different ways of denoting the same moment of time.

Cross-WG discussions are underway. In as much as the WGs may
reach a consensus to make changes, those changes will be reflected in
a future draft of the Data Model.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
