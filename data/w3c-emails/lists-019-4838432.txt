/ "C. M. Sperberg-McQueen" <cmsmcq@acm.org> was heard to say:
| 2.2. The type anyAtomicType
|
|     A type named anyAtomicType is introduced as a subtype of
|     xdt:anySimpleType; the new type is introduced as an ancestor to
|     builtins such as xs:integer. We have some concerns here; they include:
|     (a) this changes the type hierarchy and is incompatible with the
|     simple types as published in XML Schema (because those types
|     explicitly name their base types), and (b) the derivation of
|     anyAtomicType appears to be `magic' and thus outside the scope of
|     derivations expressible in XML Schema 1.0. Several members of the
|     Schema WG believe that does seem to be real need for this type in
|     Query, but it appears to us that some coordination is needed among the
|     responsible Working Groups.
|     Changes of this kind to the type hierarchy create clear
|     interoperability problems because different schema-aware processors
|     will produce different and incompatible results when asked for
|     information about xs:integer or other primitive types. Because this
|     type as defined is necessarily magic, the problems cannot be resolved
|     by providing a conventional declaration for it. The XML Schema Working
|     Group opposes the progression of any Query/XSL-related specification
|     until this incompatibility has been resolved.
|     As with other discrepancies between our type system and your use of
|     it, we are ready to modify our type hierarchy in XML Schema 1.1 if the
|     responsible Working Groups can reach consensus.

The Schema, Query, and XSL WGs are engaged in ongoing discussion of these
issues. The issues have a larger scope than just the Data Model document.
Whatever consensus is achieved will be reflected in future versions of this
document.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
