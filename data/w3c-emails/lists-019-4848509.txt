/ "C. M. Sperberg-McQueen" <cmsmcq@acm.org> was heard to say:
| 2.3. The type untypedAtomic
|
|     The type xdt:untypedAtomic is introduced for untyped nodes "such as
|     text in schemaless documents." The query LC draft says "It has no
|     subtypes". It's not clear whether this type is ever to be used by
|     schema processing, or is only visible in the query system. We believe
|     this raises compatibility issues vis-a-vis XML Schema. It might be
|     argued that versions of XML Schema should assign this type in the PSVI
|     to information items which current receive no type information
|     properties (e.g. because they matched a wildcard with
|     processContents="skip"), as that would seem to maximize compatibility
|     with Query.
|     We believe the three Working Groups should work to achieve consensus
|     on this topic. We believe you should not progress your documents until
|     we do so.

The Schema, Query, and XSL WGs are engaged in ongoing discussion of these
issues. The issues have a larger scope than just the Data Model document.
Whatever consensus is achieved will be reflected in future versions of this
document.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
