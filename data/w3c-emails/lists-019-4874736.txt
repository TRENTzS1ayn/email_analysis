It's been clarified the Data Model document.
However, the description in the Functions and Operators
document is still confusing/wrong.

"Document, element and processing-instruction nodes have a base-uri 
property which may be empty. The base-uri of all other node types is the 
empty sequence."

I think the second sentence should start with "The base-uri property".

Also, the Summary is wrong.  It says "Returns the value of the base-uri 
property" but should say "Returns the value of the base-uri accessor".
Or leave out the word "property" here: "Returns the value of the 
base-uri for $arg as defined by the accessor function dm:base-uri".
