Section 4.8 "Variable Declaration" of the XQuery November specification
says that:
   A variable may appear in the expression part of a variable declaration
   only if that variable is declared or imported earlier in the Prolog
   than the declaration in which it is used.
This is presumably to prevent indeterminacies and cycles.
However, section 4.7 "Module Import" says that:
   Two modules may import each other.

So is there anything to prohibit the following?

module namespace m1 = "M1";
import module namespace m2 = "M2";
declare variable $m1:v { $m2:v };

module namespace m2 = "M2";
import module namespace m1 = "M1";
declare variable $m2:v { $m1:v }
