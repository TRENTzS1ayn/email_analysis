No.

Either:

you are a fully-featured schema validator, and you have the [type
definition] property and (if the type is a union) the [member type
definition property],

... or ...

you are a wimpy schema validator, and you have the [type definition
type], [type definition namespace], [type definition anonymous] and
[type definition name] properties, and (if the type is a union) the
[member type definition namespace], [member type definition anonymous]
and [member type definition name] properties.
