XSLT 1.0 uses these only for extension functions, not for built-in 
functions. Furthermore, for extension functions XSLT does use the 
in-scope namespaces as declared on the elements. Neither of these 
applies here. We're talking about built-in functions in XSLT 
2.0/XQuery, and furthermore the prefix fn is not actually used in 
XSLT stylesheets, XQuery queries, and presumably not in other 
yet-to-be-invented uses of XPath 2.0 either.

I reiterate:

1. The XPath 2.0 built-in functions are not in a namespace.
2. There is nothing in the namespaces specification that in any way 
allows functions to be placed in a namespace.
3. There is nothing in an XSLT 2.0 stylesheet or an XQuery query that 
in any way suggests that the functions are in a namespace.

And therefore, the verbiage in the functions and operators draft 
claiming that these functions are in a namespace is untrue, 
unhelpful, and unnecessary. It should be removed.
