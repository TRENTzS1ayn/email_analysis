"3.7.3.1 Computed Element Constructors"
  
In the part that describes the processing of the content expression I think it 
doesn't say exactly what happens if the "adjacent sequence of one or more 
atomic values" consists of just the empty string.  In that case you clearly 
cannot create a text node, but is an error raised or are such atomic values 
simply removed? And if they are removed does that happen before or after the 
concatenation with intermediate spaces?

Kind regards,
