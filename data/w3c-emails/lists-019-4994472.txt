Actually they are in a namespace that is made the default namespace, but
you can also use the fn: prefix (you can write data() or fn:data()). 

Some reasons why the functions are in the fn: namespace and not in the
no-namespace:

1. user's that write their own local functions in the prolog do most
likely not want to assign namespaces to them.
2. the namespace allows better version management for future versions
(breaking bug fixes etc.).

Your proposal to not but the built-in functions into a namespace
certainly could have been chosen as well. As Michael Kay explained,
there was quite some discussion about this and in my personal opinion,
both approaches are viable...

Best regards
Michael
