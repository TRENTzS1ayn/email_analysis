> If any of the code points in $arg is not a legal XML character,

Have the WGs considered dropping this constraint?
This would of course require relaxing the data model to allow such
characters.

It comes up from time to time on XSL list that people are using XSLT to
query XML documents but generating non-xml using
<xsl:output method="text"/>
and so it might be quite natural to allow non-xml characters in the
output.

James Clark's original xt implemtation had a non-standard nxml output
method to achieve this (using specific elements to represent characters
that were linearised as non-xml characters) but given that the function
codepoints-to-string has been added one could use
<xsl:value-of select="codepoints-to-string(5)"/>
for this. It would of course be a serialisation error to output this
using an xml/xhtml output method.

Actually the example "5" would be legal (presumably) in a data model
based on XML 1.1 as XML 1.1 draft only bans character 0 from the C0
controls, only insisting that the others are linearised using numeric
references.

So even if the constraint is not dropped, the phrase "not a legal XML
character" might need to be clarified with respect to applicable XML
version.
