It may be worth noting that (unfortunately) XML 1.1 is planning to
change the white space rules and add x85 and x2028.
This will mean that XSLT using an XML 1.1
parser on a document containing an x85 will see a x10 which will be
normalised by this function, whereas the same expression in an Xquery
query on the same document will see a non-white space character that
will not be normalised (unless Xquery plans to adopt the XML 1.1 rules).

My preferred solution would be to not change the XML white space rules
(A comment has been sent to the XML editor list) but assuming that XML
1.1 does do this, it may be worth adding a note here as it will likely
to be a cause of apparent incompatibility between xslt and xquery.
