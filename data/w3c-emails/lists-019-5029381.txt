I don't think that newline characters in source documents will be handled
differently by XSLT and XQuery, will they? Both go through XML parsing in
the same way. The only difference is that newlines in an XSLT stylesheet are
handled differently from newlines in an XQuery query. I'm not convinced this
is a problem, except to the extent that the non-XML-ness of a query is a
problem anyway.
