The description (possibly copied from C.2.1 eg:value-union) says
 
" ...in an undefined order."

However both the xslt and xquery implementations given preserve the input
order. Either the phrase should be dropped or fn:unordered() should be
used in the implementations.

The equivalent comment in C.2.1 does not have this problem as there the
implementations use fn:distinct-values() so do return things in an 
an implementation dependent (rather than undefined) order.
