C.4 is missing an XSLT implementation.

C.5 has an Xpath (rather than XSLT) implementation but I think it should
have a full xsl:function implementation.

I would expect to see this appendix becoming available as machine
readable versions (in some common namespace such as exslt) and it would
be easier to specify what should be implemented if all te hfunctions had
full declarations rather than just xpath fragments.
