The new definition for normalize-unicode has replaced the "W3C" 
normalization form with the string "fully-normalized".
However, the description states:

"The effective value of the $normalizationForm is computed by removing 
leading and trailing blanks, if present, and converting to upper case.
[..]

- If the effective value of $normalizationForm is "fully-normalized", then 
the value returned by the function is the value of $arg is the fully 
normalized form."

Now, the effective value of $normalizationForm can never be 
"fully-normalized"; while it can be "FULLY-NORMALIZED", as the string is 
made upper-case.
