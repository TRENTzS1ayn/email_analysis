fn:normalize-unicode contains a normalization form of
"fully-normalized", but it is not at all clear what this means.

charmod at the point that it defines this term says:

  For plain text (no includes, no constructs, no character escapes) in a
  Unicode encoding form, full-normalization and Unicode-normalization are
  equivalent.

The argument of fn:normalize-unicode is a _string_ so is plian text in
the sense of the above, so the requirements of fully-normalized over NFC
do not apply.

Also the definition of fully-normalized in charmod says

   the text is in ___a____ Unicode encoding form, 

Note that it does not specify which form should be used (probably NFC
makes most sense here so should probaby be specified) but then as noted
above there probably wouldn't be any difference between NFC and
fully-normalized for a string argument, except possibly the latter would
add a space at the start of the string (which is a possible difference,
despite the charmod quote that says these are equivalent...)
