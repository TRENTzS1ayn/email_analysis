  This is a far-reaching proposal and the Working Groups felt that its
  consideration should be postponed until after this document was
  published. This note is to alert readers that such a change may appear
  in future versions of this document.


I would like to add my strong support for this proposal.
Section 9 of F&O has always been one of the most contorted parts of
Xpath2, and simplifying this may go some way to making Xpath2 more
usable. 

David
