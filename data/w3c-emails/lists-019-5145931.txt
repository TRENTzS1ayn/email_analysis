Hello!

[Sorry if this issue has been raised already.]

I believe the following words are a bit misleading:

"2.2.4 Serialization

[Definition: Serialization is the process of converting a set of nodes 
from the data model into a sequence of octets (step DM4 in Figure 1.) ]"
[1]

So, only nodes from DM are to be serialized? What about atomic values?
