Thanks for the quick response.
Incidentally I would assume that you could not go to REC with a
normative reference to any working draft version of another W3C
document, so currently charmod is a block on your documents proceeding
past PR. Do you have any inside knowledge of whether charmod is planned
to get to REC before you? (If it is inside knowledge, no need to reply
on the public list, but I just thought I'd mention this before you close
this issue).

David
