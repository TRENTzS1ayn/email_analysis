Did you mean "unclear" ?

We chose not to refer to the Aug version since it states:

"This is a W3C Working Draft published between the second Last Call on
30 April 2002 and a planned Candidate Recommendation. This interim
publication is used to document the progress made on addressing the
comments received during the second Last Call, as well as other
modifications resulting from continuing collaboration with other working
groups. A list of last call comments with their status can be found in
the disposition of comments (public version, Members only version)."

We preferred to keep our reference to the Last Call document since it
was clear to us if the August WD actually had any "official" status.
