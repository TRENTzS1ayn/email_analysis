I'm curious why the subtract functions on date/time were changed to 
take the empty sequence but the ones on durations were not. Is this a 
bug or is there a decision behind it?

The ones that can take the empty sequence are:
op:subtract-dates
fn:subtract-dateTimes-yielding-dayTimeDuration
fn:subtract-dateTimes-yielding-yearMonthDuration
op:subtract-times

The ones that cannot are:
op:subtract-dayTimeDuration-from-date
op:subtract-dayTimeDuration-from-dateTime
op:subtract-dayTimeDuration-from-time
op:subtract-dayTimeDurations
op:subtract-yearMonthDuration-from-date
op:subtract-yearMonthDuration-from-dateTime
op:subtract-yearMonthDurations
