In section 7.6.1.1, it says:

"In string mode, the metacharacter . matches any character whatsoever. In
multiline mode, the metacharacter . matches any character except a newline
(#x0A) character. Suppose the input contains "hello" and "world" on two
lines. This will not be matched by the regular expression "hello.*world" in
multiline mode. "

This appears to be old text, since string mode is no longer defined, and
multiline mode no longer has anything to do with the metacharacter ".".  

Thanks,
