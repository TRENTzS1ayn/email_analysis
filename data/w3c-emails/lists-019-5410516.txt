In section 2.4.3, the XQuery language draft says:

"It is a static error [err:XP0008] to use an ElementName in an ElementTest
if that name is not found in the in-scope element definitions unless a
TypeNameOrWildcard is specified."  

and

"It is a static error [err:XP0008] to use an AttributeName in an
AttributeTest if that name is not found in the in-scope attribute
definitions unless a TypeNameOrWildcard is specified."


But the error description for XP0008 reads:

"It is a static error if an expression refers to a type name, function name,
namespace prefix, or variable name that is not defined in the static
context."

which does not cover element or attribute names.  It seems to me that a new
error should be created for these 2 cases.

Thanks,
