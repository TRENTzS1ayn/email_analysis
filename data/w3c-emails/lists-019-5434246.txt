I think that every place the Data Model draft says "complex content", it
means "element-only content".  I say this because I believe "complex
content" includes both "element-only content" and "mixed content".  For
example, when describing the typed-value accessor of element nodes, it says:

"If the node has a complex type with complex content, raises a type
error..."  

but mixed content was covered by an earlier point.  

Thanks,
Priscilla
