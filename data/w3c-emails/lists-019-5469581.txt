        Subject:        [XQuery] xmlspace declaration applies to attribute 
constructors?



The description of the xmlspace declaration in the xQuery language draft
says that it "controls whether boundary whitespace is preserved by element
and attribute constructors"

It really only applies to element constructors, at least the way boundary
whitespace is currently defined.  To be even more specific, it only 
applies
to direct element constructors, right?. 

Perhaps this could be changed to "controls whether boundary whitespace is
preserved by direct element constructors"

Thanks,
Priscilla
