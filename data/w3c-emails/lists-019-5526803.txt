I would prefer to treat this as a comment on Functions and Operators rather
than as an XSLT comment.

I entirely share your concerns: I would much prefer decimal arithmetic to be
fully interoperable. However, we are starting with the position that (a) XML
Schema does not defined the maximum precision supported by an xs:decimal,
and (b) XML Schema doesn't even say what should happen if your source
document contains more decimal digits than the implementation allows.

Generally speaking (and without wishing to speak for any individual
companies) my perception is that XQuery vendors are willing to sacrifice a
bit of interoperability in this area in return for extra run-time
efficiency.

It would be possible in principle for XSLT to impose stricter rules than
XQuery does, though I'm not sure this would be a popular option among WG
members, and it's difficult because the schema rules themselves are so open.
