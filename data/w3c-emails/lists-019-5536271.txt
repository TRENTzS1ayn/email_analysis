How do they differ between XML 1.0 and 1.1?

 

Best regards

Subject: [XQuery] Normalizing line endings

 

There do not appear to be any rules saying that line endings in XQuery
text are normalized. 

This means that the query: 

<a> 
  gotcha! 
</a> 

will return a different infoset depending on how the text editor used to
prepare the query represents line endings, and it will potentially
produce a different infoset from the one produced by an XML parser when
applied to the same input.

I would recommend that line endings within XQuery input text should be
normalized in the same way as XML line endings. And to avoid having to
change the rules in the future, I would suggest that we use the XML 1.1
rules rather than the XML 1.0 rules.

This rule should not apply to XPath; preprocessing of XPath input is the
job of the host language.
