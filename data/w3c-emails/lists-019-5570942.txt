Subject: [F&O] op:numeric-mod


The description of op:numeric-mod says:

"If $arg2 is zero, then an error is raised [division by zero]."

Shouldn't this say, 

If $arg2 is zero, and the operands are of type xs:integer or xs:decimal,
then an error is raised [division by zero]."

Because, as it says later, if they are float or double, it returns NaN
rather than raising an error.

Or is that sentence intended to be with the previous paragraph, which
appears to cover only the case where the operands are integer/decimal?
If
that's the case, maybe the sentence should be moved up to that
paragraph.


Thanks,
Priscilla
