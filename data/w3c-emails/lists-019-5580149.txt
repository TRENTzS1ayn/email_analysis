Priscilla:
The wording for this function was changed as a result of some discussion
on the QT list.  It now reads...

"This function returns the result rounded to contain only years and
months. The calculation is as follows: first the duration is calculated
as the value of an xdt:dayTimeDuration in seconds. Then, starting from
$arg2, the maximum number of whole months in the duration is calculated
rounding towards zero. If there are a remaining number of days, they are
discarded."

Is this OK?

All the best, Ashok

The description of the fn:subtract-dateTimes-yielding-yearMonthDuration
says
in one place that it "returns the result rounded to contain only years
and
months."  But it also says that "If there is a remaining number of days,
they are discarded." 

These two statements seem to contradict each other.  Does it round or
not?

Thanks,
Priscilla
