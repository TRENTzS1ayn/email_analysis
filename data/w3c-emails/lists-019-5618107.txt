There are two issues with this function:

 1.  The function name does not accurately reflect its semantic ? it does
     not provide an answer if a sequence exists, but if a sequence 
     is non-empty.

Because 
   
     not(empty($seq)) = exists($seq)

     a better name for this function would be notEmpty() or nonEmpty()

 2. The example in 15.1.8.1 is incorrect:

    "fn:exists($seq) returns true."

The above statement is true only if $seq is non-empty and $seq has not
been defined. One can incorrectly deduce that the function returns true
for any sequence.
