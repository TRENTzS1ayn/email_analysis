The problem arises when you are using a system that does (pessimistic)
static type checking. In this case, calling a function whose argument is
declared as element() with the actual argument book/author can give you a
type error even if you know that book/author will return a single element.
Calling the function with exactly-one(book/author) prevents the static type
system giving you an error (in much the same way as a treat expression). If
the type signature of exactly-one were as you suggest, then the function
would not serve its purpose, since the call exactly-one(book/author) would
again give you the static type error.
