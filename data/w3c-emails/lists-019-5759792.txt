  In particular there should be an explicit example somewhere close to
  this point that points out that
  ancestor-or-self::*[1] is the root of the current document and
  (ancestor-or-self::*)[1] is the current node.

sorry about the example which is of course totally wrong, try:

  (ancestor-or-self::node())[1] is the root of the current document and
  ancestor-or-self::node()[1] is the current node.
