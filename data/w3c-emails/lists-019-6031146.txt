I'm not sure if i grasp the meaning of the xpath 2.0 expression below,
but wouldn't this work then (which is virtually the first order
formula expressing "betweenness")

for $here in .
   return
   $here//*[@l='no' and (every  $a in ancestor::* satisfies
       (self::*[@l='yes'] or not descendant-or-self/$here::*))]


cheers & thanks!

Brothers and sisters,

I wanna see a sea of hands out there.

Let me see a sea of hands.

I want everybody to kick up some noise.

I wanna hear some revolution out there, brothers.

I wanna hear a little revolution.

Brothers and sisters, the time has come

for each and every one of you to decide

whether you are gonna be the problem,

or whether you are gonna be the solution.

You must choose, brothers, you must choose.

It takes 5 seconds, 5 seconds of decision.

Five seconds to realize your purpose here on the planet.

It takes 5 seconds to realize that it's time to move.

It's time to get down with it.

Brothers, it's time to testify and I want to know,

Are you ready to testify?

Are you ready? 

I give you a testimonial, the MC5!

----Brother J.C. Crawford
