F&O lists the node comparison operators  op:is-same-node etc as having
parameters of type node().

The formal semantics mappings handle the case where a parameter is ()
but in something like the examples

//book[isbn="1558604820"] is //book[call="QA76.9 C3845"]

//purchase[parcel="28-451"] << //sale[parcel="33-870"]

both from 3.5.3 Node Comparisons
isn't the static type of the arguments node()* rather than node()
and you'd have to use
fn:exactly-one() on both of the arguments if you had a system using the
static typing from the Formal semantics?

I hope I'm mistaken but if so could there be a reference in 3.5.3 to
whatever part of whichever document it is that I missed.
