Erik:
This is in response to your message
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Oct/0072.html

where you asked for a number of functions to be added to the F&O
document. 

We discussed your request at length at the meeting on November 4, 2003.
While there was some support for the
functions you requested, on the balance, it was felt that there were not
strong enough usecases for the functions to
the added, especially at this late stage of the development of the
specifications.

Please let us know if you are satisfied with this response.  If we do
not hear from you we will assume that you are and close the issue. 

All the best, Ashok
