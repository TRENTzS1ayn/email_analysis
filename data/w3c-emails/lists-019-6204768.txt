It isn't clear why body of the Xquery implementation of 
eg:distinct-nodes-stable
does not just use the simple Xpath given on the line above rather than a

for let where construct,
[AM] The F&O taskforce wanted to illustrate two different approaches to
solving the problem.

The current construct uses "isnot" which has been dropped from the
current draft of xquery/xpath.
[AM] Fixed!
