Thanks!  If it's all right with you, I would like to treat these as
editorial suggestions and not open a formal issue.

All the best, Ashok

Looking at the groups of functions in section:

  15 Functions and Operators on Sequences

one can conclude that there are four groups of functions:

    15.2 Equals, Union, Intersection and Except
    These are all functions on sequences of nodes -- it might be better
to
indicate this fact in the title of 15.2:

    15.2 Functions and operators on sequences of nodes: deep-equal,
Union,

         Intersection and Except

    15.3 Aggregate Functions

    15.4 Functions and Operators that Generate Sequences


The first group of functions (15.1) is the largest and consists of
functions and one operator, that act on any sequence.

It seems reasonable  that they be called:

    15.1 Functions and operators on any sequence

or

    15.1 General functions and operators on sequences


Also, it seems to me that the three functions:

        15.1.1 fn:zero-or-one
        15.1.2 fn:one-or-more
        15.1.3 fn:exactly-one
 
form a separate group and should be grouped either under a separate
sub-section or even better -- moved to section 17 Casting.


A last comment is that the function:

        15.1.4 fn:boolean

does not seem sequence-specific, therefore its place in section 15 is
questionable.


Thank you,

Dimitre Novatchev.
