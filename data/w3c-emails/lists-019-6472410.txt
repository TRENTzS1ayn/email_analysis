There is one particular usage quite useful while transforming files.
What if the file need not be transformed but be preserved and transported.
 
Use case:
A binary image file that needs to be transported to another location as one of the multiple
<xsl:result-document/> calls done within an XSLT.
The XSLT could be picking up different/necessary images and sending across to another
location based on the original XML transformations.
 
Currently I did not come across a suitable way to do this in XSLT.
One way to do this is doing the following:
 <xsl:result-document format="binary-output"XXXX/myimage.gif"><xsl:value-of select="unparsed-text('ZZZ/myimage.gif','binary')"/></xsl:result-document>
But note that the encoding type I specificed is "binary" which is not part of the spec.
Is there any other way to do this in XSLT 
or 
can the committee consider:
 
a) either a new function "unparsed-binary(...)"
or
b) give "binary" option for the "unparsed-text(...)" function
or
c) give "binary" option and re-name "unparsed-text(...)" function to "unparsed-document(...)"
