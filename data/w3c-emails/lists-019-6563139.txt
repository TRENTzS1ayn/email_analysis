By that argument it doesn't make sense to have content optional for any 
of the computed constructors. For example, why not write: element a 
{""} instead of allowing element a {}?

Another reason for using computed comment constructors (or any 
constructor for that matter) is to avoid escaping the < or using a 
CDATA section when the XQuery happens to itself be embedded in an XML 
document. For example, if I create (or want to match) an empty comment, 
I (used to) have to write &lt;!----> which is entirely unreadable. I 
realize that it's not a big issue to write comment {""}, but it simply 
adds inconsistency to the language/parser which seems unnecessary.
