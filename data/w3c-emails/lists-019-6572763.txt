Your comment [149] in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jul/0106.html
asks "Why are both cast and constructor syntaxes supported?".  This was
discussed in the Joint WG meeting on 9/18/2003 and the members of the
WGs identified two situations where the casting syntax was required
specifically:

1.If a user defined datatype is in the null namespace and you need
to construct a value of this type.
2.If the argument to the cast may turn out to be the empty
sequence.

Thank you for your comment.

All the best, Ashok
