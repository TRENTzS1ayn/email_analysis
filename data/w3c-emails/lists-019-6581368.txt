Your comment [147] in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jul/0106.html
said
"If no default collation is specified, return the codepoint collation
since this is the default default."
This was discussed in the Joint WG meeting on 9/18/2003 and it was
pointed out that was the current design.
The XQuery document says::
"If a Prolog specifies no default collation, the system provided default
collation is chosen. If the system does not provide a default collation,
the Unicode codepoint collation
(http://www.w3.org/2003/05/xpath-functions/collation/codepoint) is
used."


All the best, Ashok
