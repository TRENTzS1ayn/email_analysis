Comment [111] in your review of the F&O document
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jul/0106.html
said "What about allowing other nodes (e.g. attribute) in second
position for fn:resolve-QName?".

This was discussed by the WGs on 9/18/2003 and it was decided not to
make the change on the basis that this did not add functionality, merely
a bit of user convenience.  The user can always access the relevant
attribute node by ./.


All the best, Ashok
