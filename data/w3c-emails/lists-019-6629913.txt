Here is a suggestion for a supplemental convenience feature
that will hopefully make everybody happy:

get-XXX-from-dateTime accepts an optional second argument 'timezone'
    such that

get-hours-from-dateTime($dt, $tz)

    is equivalent to:

get-hours-from-dateTime(adjust-dateTime-to-timezone($dt, $tz))

This way the following expression returns the normalized UTC component:

get-hours-from-dateTime($dt, 0)

      (Note: using the duration notation proposed by Michael Kay)

while the following expression returns the component as specified initially
(i.e. using the timezone that was specified or implicit when
   the date/time object $dt was created):

get-hours-from-dateTime($dt)

to get the component in the implicit timezone:
(not necessarily the same as above)

get-hours-from-dateTime($dt, implicit-timezone())
