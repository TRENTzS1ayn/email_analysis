Comment [105] in your review of the F&O document
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jul/0106.html
said "Add/subtract duration from date/time have operands in wrong
order." 

This was discussed by the WGs on 9/18/2003 and it was decided not to
make the change on the basis that these are op: functions not directly
callable by the user.  The order of arguments does not impact usability.


All the best, Ashok
