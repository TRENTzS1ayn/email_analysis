Comment [95] in your review of the F&O document
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jul/0106.html
says "Canonical form for dayTimeDuration cannot allow leap seconds." 

This is a misunderstanding caused perhaps by some misleading wording
that has since been corrected.  Leap seconds are an artifact created to
keep calendars accurate.  They have no place in unanchored durations.

All the best, Ashok
