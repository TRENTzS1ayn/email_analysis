Comment [83] in your review of the F&O document
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jul/0106.html
requested facilities to check if a string was normalized. 

This was discussed by the WGs on 9/18/2003 and it was decided this was
not a comment on the F&O but, rather on the language documents or the
Serialization document.  Please submit this comment when you review
those documents.  The Serialization document supports this feature.

All the best, Ashok
