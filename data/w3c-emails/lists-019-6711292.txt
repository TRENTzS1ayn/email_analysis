Hello Ashok,

To the best of my knowledge, there is currently no predefined
URI identifying the Unicode collation algorithm. There is of
course an URI for the spec, http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/
for the newest version, and http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/tr10-9.html
for the current version.

Ideally, such an URI would come from Chris Newman's work.
So for the moment, just using a placeholder should be fine.
You may have to make up (or nail down) an URI for the algorithm
at a later stage, if necessary.

Regards,    Martin.
