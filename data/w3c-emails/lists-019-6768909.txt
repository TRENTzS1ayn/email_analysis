Michael:

Thank you for your comment.  The editors have not been able to find a
typographical style but will continue to investigate.

At the F&O taskforce meeting on 9/11 we agreed to continue the
investigation but close the issue.  This was approved by the joint
meeting of the WGs on 9/15/2003.  If you have a specific suggestion, we
would be glad to entertain it.

All the best, Ashok

Subject: MS-FO-LC1-001: Notation for special static return types

 

Class: Editorial

In section 1.6 Notations it says:

 

"In some cases, the dynamic type returned by a function depends on the
type(s) of its argument(s). These special functions are indicated by
using bold italics for the return type. The semantic rules specifying
the type of the value returned are documented in the function
definition. The rules are described more formally in Section 6.2 of
[XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Formal Semantics]
<http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-operators/#xquery-semantics#xquery-semantic
s> ."

Problem: Bold italics is not as clear to read as it needs to be for
anything of this significance, especially if the font is Courier which
often has no good bold rendering. 

 

Recommendation: Use a combination of a different font, bold and
underline.
