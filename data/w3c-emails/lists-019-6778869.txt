Mike:
Thank you for your comment
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jun/0087.html
This was discussed at the joint WGs meeting in Toronto and after
discussion you were asked to prepare a detailed proposal.  You provided
this in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Sep/0114.html
.

At the F&O taskforce meeting on 9/25/2003 we decided that this
was a far reaching proposal and it would be best to postpone
consideration to the next round of publication.  This was approved by
the joint WGs in the meeting on 10/01/2003. 


All the best, Ashok
