Comment [121] in

says...

[121] 14.1.5: *** fn:lang should return true also if $testlang is ""
     (i.e. matching for any language)

The WGs agreed to allow the zero-length string as argument to fn:lang
but decided on a different semantic than 
the above suggestion.  They decided that "" should match no language and
the function should always return 'false' if
invoked with "".

All the best, Ashok
