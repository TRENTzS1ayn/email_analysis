I think it's well known to all XPath 1.0 users that ./node() means
./child::node() and therefore retrieves only nodes found on the child axis.
It is indeed something that trips up newcomers, but there are now lots of
beginners' guides to XPath 1.0, and the place for such hints and tips is in
the tutorials, not in the spec.
