- the XMP Q11 use case uses the function "deep-equal", but the comment at 
the end of the case has a paragraph on "sequence-deep-equal"

- The R use case has the comment "The following results assume that the 
queries were executed on Jan. 1, 2000." that is wrong, as it gets denied by 
a following note

- the last version of the solution for the SEQ Q5 use case has a user 
function "between"

declare function local:between($seq as node()*, $start as node(), $end as 
node())
  as item()*
{
   let $nodes :=
     for $n in $seq except $start//node()
     where $n >> $start and $n << $e
     return $n
   return $nodes except $nodes//node()
};

but the $e variable used in the body doesn't exist: it should be $end

- the NS Q4 use case has an extra ">" in the body
