It looks like section 17.10 was not updated to reflect changes to the 
accessor functions in 9.4. Specifically, all accessor function now 
return normalized time values, but the timezone is being appended to 
the final cast value. Furthermore, the timezone accessor now returns a 
dayTimeDuration, so its concatenation wouldn't create a valid 
date/time/dateTime.

For example, according to the spec if I had a time 08:23:15-05:00 and 
was converting to a dateTime, it would become 2003-10-08T13:23:15-PT5H, 
which is both semantically and syntactically incorrect.

It seems that because of the normalization all casts should have "Z" 
appended as their timezone.
