Lexical states:
- in the DEFAULT state, there is a AxisNamespace keyword that shouldn't be 
there, as the "namespace::" axis is not supported (it is also not 
translated into the corresponding keywords, so it was supposed to appear 
only in the XPath 2 version of the spec)
- there is a spurious QuerySeperator keyword in both the DEFAULT and 
OPERATOR states, right after the definition of the ';' symbol (that should 
be the correct query separator)
- in the XML_COMMENT state, there is a "maintain state" rule for Char, 
PragmaContents and ExtensionContents; in my opinion, only Char should be 
there (btw, the definition for the other two is Char, so they don't add 
anything)
- in the EXPR_KEY state, QName is listed twice

BNF:
- the new non-terminal for computed comments is called ComputedXmlComment, 
while all the other non-terminals have been changed from ComputedXXXX to 
CompXXX; for consistency, it should be named CompCommConstructor
