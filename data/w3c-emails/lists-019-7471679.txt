I expect some XQuery functions to provide an eval() function. However, I
(and others) have not considered it a feature that all implementations
can or have to provide.

As to fn:data(): the static result type of fn:data() is actually quite
precise (the static type is determined based on the static type of the
input argument).

As to the security issues: There will be XQuery implementations that
will have to worry about that (one of the reason why we should not
require the standard to require this function.

As to the inconsistency argument: I don't quite follow you why the
position on not wanting external variables somehow should be tied to
this discussion. 

Finally, I did not use the argument of it being a burden to
implementers. Although as you should know, there is more to the cost of
implementing than to code it...

Best regards
Michael
