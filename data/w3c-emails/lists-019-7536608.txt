Steve:

Thank you for your comment.  We discussed this on the F&O telcon on
10/14/2003 and decided not to accept your suggestion.

For questions of this type we decided to classify parameters into data
and control parameters.  Data parameters come from the

data model, often as expressions.  They should allow the empty sequence.
Control arguments are part of the query, often specified as literals.
They should not allow the empty sequence.  For fn:replace,  $pattern and
$replacement are control argument and, thus, should not allow the empty
sequence.

 

All the best, Ashok

Functions and Operators, Section 7.5.3: fn:replace should allow
$pattern, $replacement to be empty sequences.
