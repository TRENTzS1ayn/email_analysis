Greetings,

I believe XQuery is missing an important feature; the ability to
serialize a document in URI form, so that the resulting URI may be used
as an argument to the GET method.

Consider the recent TAG finding regarding the use of HTTP GET;

"Use GET if [...] The interaction is more like a question (i.e., it is
a safe operation such as a query, read operation, or lookup)."
 -- http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html

Being able to perform a query via GET requires that a URI serialization
of the query (i.e. the XQuery document) be provided.  Without this, the
only way that querying can be performed interoperably would be via POST.

Thanks!

Mark.
