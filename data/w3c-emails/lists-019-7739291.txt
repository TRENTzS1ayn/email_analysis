Thank you for your comments on the use of collations in the F&O
document: items [45] to [50] from the I18N WG
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jul/0105.html
. and item [2.3] from Schema WG comments:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Aug/0003.html
.

These comments are well taken and we have taken a number of steps to
address them.

-We have added wording in the section that discusses collations
on how different strengths are handled.
-We have put the five functions that use substring matching based
on subdividing strings into collation units into a separate section with
a introduction with additional wording.
-We have improved the description of the five functions.

I trust you will find these changes satisfactory.  Please review the
next version of the document and let us know if you have any remaining
concerns. 

All the best, Ashok
