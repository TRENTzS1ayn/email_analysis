In their review of the F&O document the I18N WG asked that the
references to Unicode be changed to Unicode 4.0.and to change the
reference to case mapping to Annexure #15 of Unicode 4.0 and the
normalization forms defined in Unicode 4.0. See Also

and

The XML Schema WG asked that the references to Unicode be consistent.
See
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Aug/0003.html

This was discussed in the joint WG meeting in Toronto.  There was a
feeling that Unicode was too new and as yet not widely implemented.
There was also the argument for consistency.  Thus, it was decided that
the F&O would refer to the XML standard, since that is what the spec is
based on, and be consistent with it. 

All the best, Ashok
