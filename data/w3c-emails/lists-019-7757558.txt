1.6.4.2 and 1.6.4.5 have the same comma issue.

Also, in 1.6.4.1
expected
<title>Foobar Corporation releases its new line of Foo
products today</title>

but original content is
<title>Foobar Corporation releases its new line of Foo products
    today</title>


In 1.6.4.5 there is a  period at the end of the first two {...} lines 
that shouldn't be there:
<item_summary>
         { $item/title/text() }.
         { $item/date/text() }.
         { string(($item//par)[1]) }
     </item_summary>
