Thanks for your comment.

Note that the XQuery WG only specifies the general language semantics
and syntax and does not specify its binding to different access methods.
Therefore, we consider the interaction with the HTTP protocol (or SOAP
or JDBC or ADO.net) outside of our scope.

Best regards
Michael
