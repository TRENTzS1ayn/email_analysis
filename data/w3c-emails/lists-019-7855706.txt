First: My response is not the official responds (at least not yet :-))
of the WG.

Second: There are many obligations w.r.t. interactions with different
protocols and APIs. We find that if we open up to one, we will bias the
language toward that area and this is not in the interest of the
language design. Also, I feel that people working in the area of these
protocols, APIs and architectures are normally better suited to provide
the syntax and semantics for their interaction. And I think the WG will
be happy to help them (although preferably after we have shipped the
recommendation to not further delay it).

Again, not speaking for the WG...
