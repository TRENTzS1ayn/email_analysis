I think I'd argue that one should test for the units (m for months)
before using the value as a number here, although testing for the
string 3m also seems sensible if it's really what one wants.

There's a grey area between the forgivingness of an untyped
scripting language and the robustness of strong typing...

It might also be that current users of XSLT migt have different
expectations from XQuery users, too, I don't know.

But maybe we should just agree to differ :-)

Best,

Liam
