Hi Xan:
I agree that the %good, %bad is a problem but, rereading the Linking
spec I found that it does not escape the % sign at all.  From 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xlink-20010627/#link-locators

"Some characters are disallowed in URI references, even if they are
allowed in XML; the disallowed characters include all non-ASCII
characters, plus the excluded characters listed in Section 2.4 of [IETF
RFC 2396], except for the number sign (#) and percent sign (%) and the
square bracket characters re-allowed in [IETF RFC 2732]. Disallowed
characters must be escaped as follows:"

So, the Linking spec removes % from the list of disallowed characters
and so does not escape it.

All the best, Ashok
