Hi Mark - I am not sure whether I understand this. Are you simply saying 
you want to be able to write a query to create another query, then use that 
query as an argument to GET?

True, but I think it's also important to keep in mind that:

There are limits to what fits easily on a URI. A 12 page query with 
functions and schema imports probably doesn't naturally fit into this 
framework.
