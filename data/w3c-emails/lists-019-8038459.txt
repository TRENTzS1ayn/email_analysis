No, just to make a URI out of an XQuery query.

(I really should have used "XQuery and URIs" as the subject of my initial
email)

Probably not, no.  But for smaller, perhaps simpler queries, I think it
would be enormously useful.  Where the WG decides to draw this line, I
don't know (FLWR??).  But I also wonder if drawing a line may be more
work than covering the general case, and then letting your customers
(XQuery processor designers and app-developers) decide what's too big to
go in a URI. 8-)  That's totally your call, of course, but anything you
can do in this direction would be progress, I'd say, and would address
my concern.

Thanks.

Mark.
