Hello Ashok,

I'm very sorry that I missed "2.2. Alignment of references" in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Aug/0003.html.

Given the distinction between generic references and specific
versioned references explained in a previous mail, this request
seems to be too general.

If the references in XML Schema and Functions and Operators are
generic, then refering to different versions is only a cosmetic
difference, and insisting on using the same reference will make
this reference less available for users of the new spec.

If in some cases, the reference is specific (I haven't found
such a reference in XML Schema), then the details of this
reference should be discussed, rather than just making general
requests.


Regards,   Martin.
