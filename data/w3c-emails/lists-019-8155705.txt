The Data Model allows trees to be constructed in any way you like so long as
they satisfy the internal constraints defined by the data model
specification itself. It's certainly permitted for some nodes to have
specific type-annotations and for other nodes to have trivial (generic) type
annotations such as xs:anyType.

That's my view, anyway!
