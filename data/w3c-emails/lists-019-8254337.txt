fn:string does not state how it should behave when given a sequence 
containing multiple items. The formal semantics paper does explain that 
as it has an item? parameter it should be passed the first item in the 
sequence when in XPath 1.0 compatability mode. However, nowhere can I 
find how it should behave when it is not in compatability mode.
