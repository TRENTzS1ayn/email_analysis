The terminology we are trying to use is "lexical QName" for the (prefix,
local-name) pair, and "expanded QName" for the (uri, local-name) pair. I
agree that we need to be very careful about the distinction and this isn't
always true of the current drafts.

We have decided to remove this functionality, it will disappear in the next
draft.

There are still a few situations in XQuery where the static namespace
context needs to be retained at run-time. An example is in computed element
constructors where a construct such as the following is permitted:

element { if (b) then "b:name" else "c:name" } {3}
