Sorry, I have to correct myself here. We have removed the ability to cast an
xs:QName to a string, but not the ability to cast a string to an xs:QName.

The differences between the two cases are:

(a) although both involve the need to keep the static namespace context for
use at run-time, in the case of string-to-QName you know statically that you
are going to need this, whereas in the case of QName-to-string you often
don't know statically whether the input will be an xs:QName or not, so you
have to keep the namespace context "just in case".

(b) it is easier to come up with plausible use cases for casting string to
xs:QName, although it's true that it's only a convenience mechanism: since
the query author has to know what the namespace bindings are, they could
have constructed the expanded QName directly from the URI and local name.
