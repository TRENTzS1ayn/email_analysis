this is not a use case. it lacks any argument for the necessity of 
using a (prefix x local-part) combination to designate the universal 
name in stead of using a (uri x local-part) combination. in order to be 
a sufficient use case, it must demonstrate why the same 
encoding/decoding requirements could be met by a language which 
supported (uri x local-part) expressions only.

in light of the complexity, and ultimately the futility, of the 
proposed in-scope namespace mechanism, the requirements for supporting 
the former formulation must be derive from a more essential argument 
than syntactic serendipity.
