Last Call comments from the XML Schema WG (See item [2.8] in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Aug/0003.html
.) and the I18N WG
(See item [69] in See item [2.8]
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jul/0105.html
) asked that the algorithm in fn:escape-uri be harmonized with the
algorithm in the Linking spec (which is the same as the algorithm in the
Character Model document).  In particular, both WGs commented on the
conditional escaping of the '%'.

In response to these comments we decided to change the behaviour so that
the '%' and the '#' are not escaped in the normal case i.e. when
escape-reserved = 'false'.
This is in accordance with the  Linking Spec.   See minutes of the XML
Query WG

uery-157-minutes-draft.htm and the XSL WG
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xsl-wg/2003Oct/0093.html

We thank you for your comments.

All the best, Ashok
