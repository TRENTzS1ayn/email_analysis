I have not finished reading the XQuery specs, but 
here is my understanding of XQuery.

  - Many operators take advantage of simple types
  - Most XQuery queries do not take advantage of complex types, unless 
    they use ElementTest.
  - Thus, simple type assignment is often good enough.

Am I correct?  If this is the case, simple-type-only type-assignment 
might be good enough often.

Cheers,
