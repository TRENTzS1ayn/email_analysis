Where is this standard term defined? The XML Namespaces 1.0 specification
uses the term "universal name" once, in passing, in the introduction. It
neither defines the term, nor does it ever use it again. The XML Namespace
1.1 specification uses the XPath 1.0 term "expanded name" for the concept,
with a formal definition.

We are trying hard to present a coherent set of specifications to the
implementor and user community, as you clearly think we should be doing. We
won't achieve that if we simply announce confrontationally that another WG
was "wrong".
