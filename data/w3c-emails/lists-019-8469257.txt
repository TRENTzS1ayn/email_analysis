that was unfortunate. i did recognize in my earlier note that it did 
use the term "expanded name" in the appendix. to date, i have preferred 
a term in the body of the specification to terms from other documents 
which were inherently contradictory.

given the coherent definition, "expanded name" is the term which should 
be used. it still has the disadvantage, that, it depends on a concept 
which is not intrinsic - namely the expansion process, but at least it 
is not a contradiction in terms.

how else does one cause a shift in terminology than to argue the 
existing terms are not the right ones for the task, because they fail 
to adequately describe the subject matter, and that they should be 
replaced with terms better suited. as soon as namespaces 1.1 becomes a 
recommendation, might a reasonable implementor expect that "expanded 
QName" would be deprecated in favor of "expanded name". is there any 
reason to not do that now?
