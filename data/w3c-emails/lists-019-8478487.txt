>Most XQuery queries

What do you mean by "most XQuery queries"?  

I expect that XQueries of documents that are based on user-defined
complex types will make as heavy use of the user-defined complex types
as the referenced schemas do.

I am not sure how to take this as a "comment" on XQuery.  It appears to
be a fairly subjective statement to me.  Maybe this thread would be
