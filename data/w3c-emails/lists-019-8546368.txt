Thanks for the other fixes. The basic issue with this comma problem 
(and the whitespace mentioned elsewhere), is these oddities make 
extraction from the use cases for testing much more difficult. I 
understand the comma is not text. It seems it should still be there 
because the output is still a sequence; it is not inside another 
element which would make the elements be children.

For example, if the query were
<result>
{
<section_count>{ count(doc("book.xml")//section) }</section_count>,
<figure_count>{ count(doc("book.xml")//figure) }</figure_count>
}
</result>

then I would not expect commas in the result.

Perhaps a separate document should be available that lists the expected 
and actual results in their normative form. The other two sections that 
are basically impossible to extract are the SGML section and the 
relational data section. It seems odd that a query must be written to 
"reconstruct" the xml from the html data tables presented.

Cheers,
