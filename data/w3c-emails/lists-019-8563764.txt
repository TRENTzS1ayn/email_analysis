It should be pointed out that there is no normative serialization of the
results of a query. In cases where the result of the query is a single
document node or element node (which is true of most of the use cases),
results can be compared by serializing and then converting to a canonical
XML form. But if the result is say a sequence of integers, there is no
definitive way of serializing it that all products will adhere to.
