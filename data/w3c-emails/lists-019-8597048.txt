Subject: [F&O] Typo in 5.1 constructor for xs:QName


Section 5.1 declares the constructor:
"xs:anyURI($srcval?as?xdt:anyAtomicType)?as?xs:QName
See 17.14 Casting  to xs:QName for semantics of xs:anyURI."

It should be:
"xs:QName($srcval?as?xdt:anyAtomicType)?as?xs:QName
See 17.14 Casting  to xs:QName for semantics of xs:QName."
