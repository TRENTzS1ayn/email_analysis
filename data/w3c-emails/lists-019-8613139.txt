You can use fn:compare using the Unicode codepoint collation.  This will
give you a "character by character" comparison.

All the best, Ashok

Subject: string equality


Is there a comparison/equality operation in XQuery that allows me to
decide if 
two strings are equal?

Just to be clear, by "equal" I mean here really equal, i.e., without
collation 
or anything like that.
