This list is for comments on the XSLT, XPath, and XQuery language
specifications. If you are looking for advice in how to make effective use
of XSL(T), a good resource is the xsl-list at www.mulberrytech.com

Good luck,

Subject: XSL vs. WORD


I am new to XSL/XML; Now my project is to transform an XML file to a word
document using XSL. I am using WORD 2003 which has a lot XML related
features. I need to detect some page break event in order to apply certain
format (e.g.. if a page break happened, continuation format will be
applied). 
 
Any tip will be much appreciated!
