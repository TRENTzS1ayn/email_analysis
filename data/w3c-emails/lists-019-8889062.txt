Hello Ashok,

Sorry, I answered one of your mails, but forgot the other.

Early Uniform Normalization should assure, as much as possible,
that only normalized strings are reaching the database. So the
wording should not just say "For alignment with", but should
in one way or another say that such collations may be used to
make sure that even those normalization differences that may
remain after the use of Early Uniform Normalization according
to the Character Model are ignored.

Also, collations don't treat strings as if they were normalized,
it's better to say that they treat (otherwise equal) normalized
and unnormalized strings as if they were the same. This only happens
with lower collation strengths, not with the highest collation
strength, where typically binary differences lead to a 'different'
result.

I hope this helps. Please don't hesitate to ask again.

Regards,    Martin.
