Hi Kevin.  Yes, there should be a third category, or maybe two more 
specific categories:

1) required whitespace, i.e. one or more.  In the XML definition of the 
grammar this is <g:requiredSkip show="no"/>
2) optional whitespace.  In the XML definition of the grammar this is 
<g:optionalSkip/>.

I can only explain this with general rules, which is that "words" must be 
separated by requiredSkip, and punctuation can be optionalSkip.  I will 
try and make this more explicit in the next draft.
