Scott,
 
Thanks for the clarification. The general rules that you stated below ( i.e. - "words" must be separated by requiredSkip, and punctuation can be optionalSkip) seem appropriate and work well in practice. The rules even obviate the need for explicit whitespace in productions such as:
 
<"declare"  <http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xquery-20030822/#prod-S> S "variable" "$">
 
The other option would be to add S and S?  explicitly according to the previously stated rules. It would be unambiguous but it would also be messy.
 
regards,
 
Kevin

Hi Kevin.  Yes, there should be a third category, or maybe two more specific categories: 

1) required whitespace, i.e. one or more.  In the XML definition of the grammar this is <g:requiredSkip show="no"/> 
2) optional whitespace.  In the XML definition of the grammar this is <g:optionalSkip/>. 

I can only explain this with general rules, which is that "words" must be separated by requiredSkip, and punctuation can be optionalSkip.  I will try and make this more explicit in the next draft.
