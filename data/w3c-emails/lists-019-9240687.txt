Dear WG,

I think it would be handy to have a flag allowing insignificant 
whitespace inside regexen.

Use case:

Very long regexen.
The longest one in this XSLT
http://www.pinkjuice.com/howto/vimxml/xslt/tinydbk2xhtml/markup_ruby.xslt
(sample output:
http://www.pinkjuice.com/howto/vimxml/setup.xml#jing (scroll down))
is 296 characters long; I'd be happy if I could break it into multiple 
lines (which is even more important when something like this is to be 
listed in books etc).

Tobi

P.S.
IMHO it's not really relevant how many other languages have this feature.
