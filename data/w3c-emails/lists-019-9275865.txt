You wrote (replying to my post) "they allowed freedom of speech in his 
[Shakespeare's] day." which seemed to imply that someone is indeed 
limiting yours or the author's, but if I misunderstood that, please 
accept my apologies.

Why don't you simply say what you *do* think then?

I requested that the sentence be removed from the spec or that the 
source be added to the spec, and you replied with a post that seemed to 
try to justify the inclusion of the sentence.

Apologies accepted.

The whole thing was meant to help the authors and editors to reflect the 
way in which people could receive the wording and the way it might make 
them feel, nothing more.

Feedback such as this could be received in a more constructive way.
