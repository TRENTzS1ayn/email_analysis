I like to think that lawyers, even in the USA, would be well-enough 
educated to know the source of the quotation.

If it is our goal to say nothing offensive to anyone, then we might as well 
say nothing.

I'm sorry if you are personally offended, or if you are concerned that 
somebody else might be offended, by the use of a quotation from 
Shakespeare.  But I do not think it is unreasonable for us to use it.  How 
many other sample pieces of text should be accompanied by references?  Only 
the ones you think might be offensive, or the ones that I think might be 
offensive, or...?  And should the reference be Normative or not?

Feeling that this is a strange conversation,
    Jim
