It could be that I am missing something, but I believe your proposal
is possible in XPath 2.0.
Check out the third item *before* 3.3 Sequence Expression (in reverse
document order ;-) ) for an example.
http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/#id-sequence-expressions

The parse tree for that is a little bit lengthy, but basically you can
reduce a StepExpr -> PrimaryExpr -> ParenthesizedExpr -> ...
-> '(' OrExpr ')' -> ... (many steps using always the first non terminal) ... 
-> '(' UnionExpr ')'
-> ... -> '(' PathExpr '|' PathExpr ')'
There you are!
