I hate to prolong this thread, but I feel I should speak up for Tobias, 
and speak up for myself, for that matter, as a member of the one of the 
WGs producing the spec.  I find the quotation very offensive, and not 
funny.  Anything that uses the term "kill" directed at any person or group 
of persons has no place in a technical specification, even if you had the 
attribution (I assume you would not quote David Duke or Hitler... [Tobias' 
point also], the attribution is irrelevant).  This is not a frivolous 
complaint, nor is it fuzzy territory IMHO.  I think we can find plenty of 
quotes, even non-bland ones, that are not offensive.
