No one said Shakespeare was doing that. But without context, the 
sentence "first we kill the lawyers" is expressing the plan to do so; 
you as editor can't expect all of your readers to know all famous 
Shakespeare quotes. It's a general technical specification after all, 
which should IMHO be suitable for ten year olds and for people who 
didn't pursue what your idea of "studying English literature" is.
