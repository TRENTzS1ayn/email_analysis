I like Shakespeare quotes, and even though I am a pacifist and a Mennonite 
at that, I'm not offended by this one.

But since two people, including one editor, are offended, perhaps we can 
choose among many other Shakespeare quotes? In my current mood, I like "A 
man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king"...
