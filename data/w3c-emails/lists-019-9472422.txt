Hi Sean.  Thanks for the feedback.

Isn't your issue covered by the longest token rule ("When tokenizing, the 
longest possible match that is valid in the current lexical state is 
preferred .")?  I understand that means you can't have a comment opening 
followed immediately by a colon... but I think the only thing to do for 
that is to change the characters used in one of the delimiters.  It's late 
at night and I might be misreading your note, so forgive me if I'm not on 
target.

Makes sense to me.  I would be open to that.
