Are the inference rules for static analysis normative or non-normative?
In other words, are all implementations of static analysis requierd to
follow the static inference rules as specified in the formal semantics
spec?  Suppose that I construct a static inference engine that takes
full advantage of backward axes.  That engine would create types
narrower than those created by the static inference rules in the formal
semantic spec.  Is that engine non-conformant?  This would be very
unforunate.
