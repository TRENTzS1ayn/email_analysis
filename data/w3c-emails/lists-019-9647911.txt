Hi Per,

We decided not to make a change to XQuery on this point.

As you note, in the current XQuery WD, a library module may contain only 
variables and functions defined for the target namespace of the module. We 
are likely to want to have local declarations in a future version of 
XQuery, but we don't want to go there yet.

In the status quo, the 'local' prefix is allowed only in a main module, and 
implies that the function is local to the main module. No information 
hiding is associated with this prefix, but because it can only appear in a 
main module, it does not export anything.
