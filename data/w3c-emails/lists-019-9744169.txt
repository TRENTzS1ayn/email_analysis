"Michael,

Thank you for your prompt answer.

I feel that use of backwards-axes for type inference requires an 
approach significantly different from that of the formal semantics spec.  
Such an approach may sometimes lead to tighter types and sometimes 
lead to looser types.  So, I feel uneasy to have normative rules for 
type inference.
