I think it is intended that XQuery should also allow this. Section 2.1.1
which describes the static context states "Each function is uniquely
identified by its expanded QName and its arity (number of parameters)". 

I think the statement in 4.12 that "A user-declared function is uniquely
identified by its expanded QName." is probably an error; but I might be
mistaken. I'll follow it up.
