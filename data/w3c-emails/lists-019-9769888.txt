The way that multiple modules work in XSLT was established in XSLT 1.0 and
isn't something we can easily change. It is true that the chosen approach
makes it quite difficult to do separate compilation of stylesheet modules.
I'm sure it's not impossible, though, if someone feels that it's
sufficiently important to their users.
