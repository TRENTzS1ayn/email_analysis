I agree that this has always been somewhat of a mystery to me.  As an
implementer, the built-in functions require me to code support for
overloaded functions.  Indeed, I have to do EXTRA work in my function
calling mechanism/compiler to NOT allow overloaded user-defined functions!

I don't see any reason for such a difference. After all,
some predefined functions and operators are overloaded,
so why not user functions ?
