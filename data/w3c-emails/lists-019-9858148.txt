did you mean to ask this on xsl-list? it doesn't appear to be a comment
on the working drafts (the subject of this list).

xslt doesn't update existing trees, only generates new ones so
you can't do what you ask, but there should be no need.

As XSLT has full access to the whole input document before processing
starts there is not really any "later on" you should be able to generate
the correct attribute without needing to update it. Of course you can
use variables and/or parameters to store intermediate results without
writing to the result tree (easier in xslt2)
