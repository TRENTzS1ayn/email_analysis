The text in the first example of boundary whitespace removal in "3.7.1.4
Whitespace in Element Content" (main XQuery 1.0 document) is confusing. It
shows the original "before" XML (<cat> ... </cat>) and talks about the
effects of stripping boundary whitespace, referring to an "after" equivalent
that isn't shown. The four examples following all show "after" snippets and
are quite straightforward and clear by contrast
