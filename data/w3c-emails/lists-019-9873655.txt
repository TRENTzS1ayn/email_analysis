This comment is Section 3.4 of 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Jul/0120.html
.

The comment suggests that the term "more specific" (in reference to a 
type) should be replaced by "derived". This change would not be correct.


The term "more specific" is used exactly once, in Section 2.2.3.2
(Dynamic Evaluation Phase), and repeated in the Glossary. Its usage is
accompanied by a clarifying example in which the type "integer" is
considered to be more specific than "zero or more integers or strings".
Note that this example does not fit the definition of a "derived type".
The intended usage is that Type A is more specific than Type B if all
instances of Type B are instances of Type A, but not vice versa. We
believe that this usage is adequately explained by the existing text and
example.


All the best, Ashok
