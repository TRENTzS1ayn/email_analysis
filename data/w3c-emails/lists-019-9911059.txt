The WGs discussed these comments in the meeting on 9/16/2003 and decided
to remove the function fn:item-at.
This change will appear in the next version of the document.
All the best, Ashok

I agree and would go further.
 
If we are to keep item-at($x, $n) then it should have the same behavior
as $x[$n].
 
And if it has the same behavior, then we might as well drop it.

Functions and Operators, Section 15.1.6 
"If the value of $posParam is ... equal to zero (0), then an error is
raised ". 
This is inconsistent with the way the substring functions work. 
Suggest: each of the string functions should define what they do with
zero and negative values for position and length, and they should be
consistent.


All the best, Ashok
