The WGs discussed these comments in the meeting on 9/16/2003 and decided to
remove the function fn:item-at.
This change will appear in the next version of the document.

I agree and would go further.

If we are to keep item-at($x, $n) then it should have the same behavior as
$x[$n].

And if it has the same behavior, then we might as well drop it.

Functions and Operators, Section 15.1.6
"If the value of $posParam is ... equal to zero (0), then an error is raised
".
This is inconsistent with the way the substring functions work. 
Suggest: each of the string functions should define what they do with zero
and negative values for position and length, and they should be consistent.


All the best, Ashok
