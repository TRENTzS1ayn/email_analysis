(IBM-FO-014) Section 5.2, Constructor Functions for User-Defined Types: In 
the first paragraph, delete "globally-defined". It adds nothing since all 
atomic types are globally-defined. Also delete "by restriction". It adds 
nothing since by restriction is the only way to define a derived atomic 
type. However, you need to note that only atomic types that are in a 
namespace have a constructor function, since every function is required to 
be in a namespace. There are no functions that are in no namespace. For 
this reason, the second paragraph should be deleted becauses it refers to 
functions that cannot exist.

Also, in the last paragraph of this section, "schema that is bound to the 
prefix" should be "namespace that is bound to the prefix".
