Section 5.9 Module Import seems to have lots of little
errors, with wrong or missing subcripts:

In 5.9 Module Import / Static Context Processing:
(a) Should "String =>module_statEnv statEnv"
be "String1 =>module_statEnv statEnv" ?

In 5.9 Module Import / Notation:
(b) Each rule uses an undefined "String".  Should that be "URI" in
the import_variables and import_functions rules, and "String1"
in the final "import module" rule?
(c) The 2nd premise in the first (varValue) rule's use of
"expanded-QName" should be "expanded-QName1".
(d) The rules for import_variables and import_functions have a URI
context, but this doesn't appear in the final "import module" rule.
(e) The 3rd (import module) rule uses "statEnv1" and "statEnv4"
which should presumably be "dynEnv1" and "dynEnv4".
(f) The "dynEnv4" in the 3rd (import module) rule seems "dangling" -
it's not used anywhere except in the first premise.
