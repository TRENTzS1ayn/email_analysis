4.7.3.1 Computed Element Constructors / Dynamic Errors
"Both forms of computed element constructors raise a type error if the
element's content is not a sequence of attributes followed by a
sequence of element, text, comment, and processing-instruction nodes,
or a sequence of atomic values."
But that's not what the formal rule says, which is "a
sequence of element, text, comment, processing-instruction nodes,
or atomic values."
