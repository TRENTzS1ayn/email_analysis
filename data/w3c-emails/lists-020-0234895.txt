3.1.2 Dynamic Context says (2nd to last para):
"Variables with the "fs" namespace prefix are reserved for use in the 
definition of the Formal Semantics.
It is a static error to define a variable in the "fs" namespace."

This is wrong, as there is no "fs namespace".
The "fs" prefix is just in the formal semantics.
See 2.5.1 Namespaces
"These prefixes are always italicized to emphasize that the 
corresponding functions, variables, and types are abstract: they are not 
and cannot be made accessible in the host language."
