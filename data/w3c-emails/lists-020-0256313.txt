4.6 Logical Expressions / Static Type Analysis
"The logical expressions require that each subexpression have type 
xs:boolean."
Isn't this always trivially true, since Expr1 and Expr2 are
post-normalization and so are actually fn:boolean(Expr1}
and fn:boolean(Expr2).

Parhaps adding a parenthetical remark:
(This is always the case after normalization.)
