That's true from the query engines persepctive, but as the author of a
query you can state that you are interested in URIs with a given prefix.
Effectivly stating that it is a namespace. From the engines p.o.v. it can
then do a substring match, RDQL it could be something like

AND ?uri LIKE <http://my.domain/namepsace#%>

with appologies ;)
