Right. Like I said in a subsequent posting, this then falls under the
general use case of regular expression matching of node labels (which
is firmly outside the scope of the RDF MT, albeit justified by what
seems to be an agreed and desirable level of utility).

Still, if the goal is to model vocabularies, then hacks based on
looking into the lexical form of URIs are the wrong way to go, IMO.
