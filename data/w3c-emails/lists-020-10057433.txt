It can, if you're able to work out a mapping from the RDF data model into
the XQuery data model, which is basically the XML Infoset + XML Schema
support + support for multiple documents.

I'm finding myself quite interested in the inverse problem: would it be
possible and useful to be able to map from the XQuery surface language into
an underlying RDF graph-based data model, so that XQuery syntax can be used
to interrogate an RDF data store more or less directly? In other words, can
we swap out XQuery's underlying XML-based data model and slide in an
RDF-based one in its place so that we don't have to do the mapping to XML?
I'll be talking about this after Amsterdam.

I've given a few pointers in my response to Andy's email re SQL-to-XML
mappings for XQuery.

I'm not sure what you mean by the last, Eric. Can you explain a bit more?
