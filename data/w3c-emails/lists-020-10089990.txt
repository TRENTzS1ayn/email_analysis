Jonathan's is the XQuery with Functional Accessor stuff? I saw the
presentation but couldn't find anything else online.

On a different but related topic, since we don't have time allocated for it
on the agenda, would anyone be interested in a BOF for a freeform discussion
on XQuery/RDF on the Thursday evening say (after a nice day of getting to
know one and other and a pleasant dinner)? Personally, I generally get more
questions answered in one hour of face-to-face than in two or three weeks of
email and/or blindly stumbling around the web.
