Unfortunately, I believe that all the lightning talks are scheduled for
Friday, so we won't have a common foundation for discussion on Thursday
night. (Thus my comment earlier that we certainly won't be ready for
language discussions immediately, because we won't have time to actually
discuss them much at the face-to-face.)

If we think this is really important, I suppose we could consider moving
the first round of lightning talks to Thursday, but it seems a bit late
in the process to do this.
