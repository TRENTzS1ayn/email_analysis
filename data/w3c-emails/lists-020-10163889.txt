Aha. I hadn't bothered trying to reconstruct the bottom of his slide #4,
which comes out looking like:

declare namespace rdf = "rdf.tagsalad.org";
for $artist in rdf:subject("c:creates", ()),
$artifact := rdf:object($artist, "c:creates"),
$museum := rdf:subject("c:exhibits", $artifact)
return
<result>
<artist>{ $artist }</artist>
<artifact>{ $artifact }</artifact>
<museum>{ $museum }</museum>
</result>

Very cool. Looks a lot like RDFLib a moi.
