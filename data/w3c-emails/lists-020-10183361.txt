You've done an amazingly good working out of those cases,
especially the "avoiding trafic jam" case :)

Folks,

So, I didn't get as much done as I would have liked -- a few good use
cases didn't make it in because I ran out of gas -- but I think I got
enough done to give us something to sink our teeth into for the f2f
meeting.

I will likely work on the document between now and the f2f, but I
won't check any new versions in. The latest version is 1.24 and is
available at
