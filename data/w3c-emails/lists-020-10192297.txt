OK, I have a better idea of what you mean now. There is a standard mapping
in the sense there's the SQL/XML work I referenced earlier [1]. I'm not a
SQL person, so I don't feel I can speak very authoritatively on the
ramifications of doing that. At a minimum I guess you'd have to not mind
having to implement your RDF store in somebody's SQL db. (Does that parse?)
It's certainly not a general-purpose solution.
