I've been completely unable to find a hotel.

I'll be arriving Wednesday and flying out Friday night.

Anybody have any ideas for hotels with vacancies for Wed+Thurs night?

Anybody interested in letting me pick up their hotel tab in exchange for
splitting a room?

And as a more universally helpful suggestion, is there a map of Leiden
available, with the meeting location clearly marked? Or maybe just GPS
coordinates or something?
