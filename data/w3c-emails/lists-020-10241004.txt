I'll add some travel times tomorrow; meanwhile:

Departing from track 2/Amsterdam RAI

7.43direct train to Leiden
7.56change at Schiphol (track 5)
8.13direct train to Leiden

should all get you there in time with various degrees of slack. See:

http://www.ns.nl/domestic/index.cgi
From:Amsterdam RAI
To:Leiden Centraal

for more. From Schiphol (Track/Platform 6) the times are
7.54*, 8.04, 8.16, 8.24* and 8.34. Those marked '*' take
4 minutes longer.

Dw.
