I'd like volunteers to record the first few sessions on Thursday so that 
we can hit the ground running at 9am sharp.

This will exempt you from recording during the tasty bits on Friday 
afternoon, not to mention the  brownie-points you'll earn.

Taking notes in IRC is usually most convenient for the chair and other 
participants, but if you work much better in a local editor, very well, 
you can mail your notes.

I will edit the notes after the meeting into a record for the WG to 
review and approve.
