[1] http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/UseCases

 

 

ACTION KendallC: best-effort update of UseCases by 15 or 16 April

      "some progress, more text" come to the meeting with the document

      More use cases? Still looking through the archives

No exhaustive, use cases that I really like

Normalize vocabulary for requirements

Rob: question about OWL use case [?]

How to extend RDF with other W3C tech?

Danger: requirements linked to arbitrary examples

Interest: Real world Domains, tools for developers

CONTINUE

 

Bryan Thomson wants to talk about use cases motivating protocol
requirements

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004AprJun/0095.html

is a protocol usecase, opposed to query use cases

 

Eric Prud'hommeaux. When will the "prose" in documents be put in "real"
RDF?

Initial RDF is fixed.

Document: RDF Graphs for a wide audience

Need Query against some triples

Some people have done something about it, no group as a whole

Diagrams, graphs vs raw RDF/XML

 

ACTION EricP: Send mail to public-rdf-dawg about
        http://www.w3.org/2001/11/13-RDF-Query-Rules/ 
DONE
