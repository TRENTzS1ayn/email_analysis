I was asking Jim Hendler why it seemed like the WebOnt use cases
were so much easier to put together (do we just suppress
upleasant memories, or what?) and he reminded me of a format
that seemed to help. I just managed to look it up:

use-case format Guus Schreiber (Friday, 30 November)
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2001Nov/0154.html

We might be past brainstorming stage where that
structure is most useful; it wasn't carried thru to the
eventual publication of the requirements document
