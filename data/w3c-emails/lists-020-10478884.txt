Yes, and that makes me nervous for other reasons, as well. But
-shrug-, I guess.

This week I'm reading and thinking about as many Use Case and
Requirements documents as I can find from W3C working groups. I like
OWL's a lot. It may be that I can convert my 'benefits' stuff into
something like its Design Goals (and, *perhaps*, move the less well
supported tech requirements into an Objectives section -- I think Dan
mentioned something like in Leiden -- especially if the chair suggests
some kind of ranking based on our straw polling, but even if not I'll
try to do some of that).

Anyway, having precedents is very helpful to me in editing. So thanks.

Ah, yes, I'm agreeing with this suggestion, Andy.

Yes, again. It may make sense to have language just like that in our
doc.
