Dear all,

It was very nice meeting you in the ftf meeting.

But I have to apologize you for my old e-mail address (fuku@trl.mei.co.jp)
being printed on my business card.

My current e-mail address is fukushige.yoshio@jp.panasonic.com .

So please send emails to the latter address.

The former is still available for a month or so, but it will be obsolete
after that.

Some of you may know I also have fuku@w3.org as the e-mail address, but in
the DAWG context,
I prefer fukushige.yoshio@jp.panasonic.com in order to clarify that my
participation is from Matsushita.

Sorry for possible confusion.

Best regards,

Yoshio Fukushige
