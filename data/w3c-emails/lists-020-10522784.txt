Dear RDF Data Access WG,

Complementary to the recent work of the RDF Data Access Working Group
[1], 
we have compared six proposals for RDF query languages. 
The report, the use case data, and the queries are available online [2].

It compares the following native RDF query languages: 
- RDQL
- RQL
- SeRQL
- Versa
and the following RDF rule languages, which can be used as query
languages as well:
- Triple
- CWM (Query Language through --filter command line option)

We would be happy to have feedback !

"It IS a long tail, certainly," said Alice, looking
down with wonder at the Mouse's tail; "but why do you
call it sad?" And she kept on puzzling about it while the
Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was
something like this:----"Fury said to
          a mouse, That
                he met in the
                     house, `Let
                         us both go
                            to law: I
                             will prose-
                              cute YOU.--
                             Come, I'll
                            take no de-
                         nial: We
                      must have
                   the trial;
                For really
              this morn-
            ing I've
           nothing
          to do.'
           Said the
            mouse to
              the cur,
                 `Such a
                    trial, dear
                        sir. With
                          no jury
                           or judge,
                             would
                            be wast-
                          ing our
                        breath.'
                     `I'll be
                  judge,
               I'll be
             jury,'
           said
          cun-
          ning
           old
             Fury:
              `I'll
                 try
                   the
                    whole
                     cause,
                      and
                     con-
                   demn
               you to
          death'."
