Dear Rob (and all other DA WG members),

our comparison is neither intended to argue about what a RDF query
language should be nor - by any means - intended to force you to take
notice of our results. We posted it across the various RDF-related
mailing lists, including the public RDF data access group list, to
inform interested parties of our results and get feedback.

The report is by no means complete with respect to all (publicly and
privately) available query languages. Our criteria for inclusion of a
given language was primarily based on whether or not we could get hold
of good documentation and a freely available running prototype. This was
necessary in order to formulate queries and to have a certain confidence
in the Yes/No rating for certain language features. 

The document could be a useful input for the documents that the group
has to produce. We will comment on the documents produced by the group
at their respective public review periods as suggested by W3C process.

Cheers
