Kendall, I just put this blurb atop the doc:

"This draft ($Revision: 1.26 $ of $Date: 2004/04/30 18:52:08 $) is under
discussion in the RDF Data Access WG. It reflects the best effort of the
editor to incorporate input from various members of the WG, but it is
not yet endorsed by the WG as a whole."
