OK, I think this record of the meeting now
has all the essential bits. I propose that
it serve as a true record:

RDF Data Access Working Group Meeting, April 2004 in Amsterdam:
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/ftf1
$Revision: 1.50 $ of $Date: 2004/04/30 21:37:14 $

Please review it and send any comments/corrections.

Even if it looks OK as is, I'd like an explicit second or
two.

By the way... I'd like to add those photos. Any pointers?
Mail them to www-archive if you don't have any place
else to put them, please.
