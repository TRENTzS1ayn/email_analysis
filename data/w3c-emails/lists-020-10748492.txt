p.s. sorry this agenda is a couple hours late. 24hrs in advance
of the scheduled time is 9:30am Monday for me, which is (a)
only 90minutes into my work week, and (b) during another telcon.
I considered sending the agenda on Friday, but (a) didn't manage,
and (b) wasn't sure I wanted to, since folks tend to forget
things over the weekend.
