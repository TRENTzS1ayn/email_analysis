Folks,

I've checked in version 1.31 of the UC&R document. It's my best effort
to address the issues raised before, during, and since our F2F
meeting. I haven't yet finished working through all of the issues on
my TODO list, but I got most of the big ones. (And for some reason
aspell, my Unixy spell checker, doesn't like the document so I've been
unable to spell check it...Sorry.)

I'm suggesting the following publication schedule as way to start
discussing the fulfillment of our obligation to publish by the end of
May:

17 May -- I'll freeze the document
18 May -- discussion of document in telcon
25 May -- final discussion; call the question
26 to 29 May -- if approved, I'll finalize the doc here
30 May -- publish

(By "freeze", I mean I'll be very unlikely to add new material or
significantly reorganize the document on *my own initiative* after
this point.)

Frankly, I think we now have enough use cases: there are two existing
ones I need to polish, modulo new concerns or issues raised by others

Thus, unless I hear from people explicitly, I'm not likely to add more
UCs to the document on my own steam.

Best,
Kendall
