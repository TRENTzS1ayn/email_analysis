OK, great; we've all got something to chew on.

In W3C style, "status of this document" isn't numbered.

Perhaps that's one of the small ones on your TODO list
already...

And I have a suggestion about the Intro...

"Since there are no formal standards for an RDF query language,
developers in industry and in open source projects have created many
query languages for RDF data."

Hmm... I don't think the lack of standards is the reason they
created those languages; they created those languages because
they're useful.

How about:

  1. Introduction

  The W3C's Semantic Web Activity RDF is based on RDF's flexibility as
  a means of representing data. Developers in industry and in
  open source projects have created many query languages for RDF data.
  While there is considerable overlap in functionality,
  it may be only a small exaggeration to say that there are as many
  different methods of accessing remote RDF storage servers as there
  are distinct RDF storage server projects. Even where the basic access
  protocol is a standard?HTTP, SOAP, or XML-RPC?there isn't much common
  ground upon which generic client support to access a wide variety of
  such servers might be developed.
  The existing languages also exhibit a range of extensibility features
  and builtin capabilities, including inferencing, distributed query,
  and domain-specific semantics.

  The use cases below characterize the most important and most common
  motivations behind the development of these query languages and
  protocols. They inform the decisions between requirements, i.e.
  critical features a standard RDF query language and data
  access protocol, and less urgent objectives.
