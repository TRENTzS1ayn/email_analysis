Ah... I see you've done a non-trivial pass over the requirements...
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/UseCases#req

There we find 10 requirements, 4.1 Multi-edged Paths
thru 4.10 Result Limits.

That seems to be a reasonable synthesis of the input from the WG.
In the telcon tomorrow, I'll probably start by considering them
in bulk: without excluding the possibility of adopting 
more requirements, shall we adopt all 10 of those requirements?

I'll understand if I need to split the question, but it'll
save time if I don't.
