Hello, all.

Here's the URI of my homework.

http://www.w3.org/2004/04/21-fuku/addendum1.html

Actually, this was done by 23th Apr. but I only announced the URI on the
irc, sorry.
(I think Kendall has got it)

And FYI, the URI of my additional use case proposal which I mentioned in the
f2f meeting
is
http://www.w3.org/2004/04/21-fuku/usecases.html
, which was also announced on the irc only, sorry.

Cheers,
Yoshio
