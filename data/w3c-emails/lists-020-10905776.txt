"A list of technical requirements has been extracted from the use cases,
a list that describes the critical features a standard RDF query
language and data access protocol should possess."

perhaps that should be reiterated under the "4. Requirements" heading.

Yes.

(I prefer to think of _the_ query language conformant to our
recommendations, at least at this point. We're here to agree
on 1, yes?)

no.

He said "... to move the
rest of the requirements that straw-polled positively in Leiden"; not
to move some of the ones currently in UC&R.

I leave that to other members of the WG to discuss.
