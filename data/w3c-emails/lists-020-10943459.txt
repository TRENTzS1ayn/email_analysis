Hello all,

I have recently joined the RDF DAWG and would like to introduce myself.

My brief bio may be found at:

    http://www.xmleurope.com/2004/bios_in.asp#najmi

Additionally, I am currently co-chair of the Semantic Content Management 
SC (SCM SC) [2] of the OASIS ebXML
Registry TC [1]. In that group we are working to define how our existing 
query mechanisms may be extended
to support inference based upon metadata based on OWL ontologies. It is 
my goal to keep the SCM SC work
aligned with the work of the DAWG as the two proceed in parallel.

I look forward to catching up on the WG works-in-progress and begin 
contributing. Thank you.
