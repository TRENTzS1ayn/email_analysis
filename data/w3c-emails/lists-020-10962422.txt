I believe the schedule matches up reasonably well. The Semantic Content 
Management (SCM)
work is part of ebXML Registry version 4. We do not expect version 4 to be a
Committee Draft (first publicly reviewable working draft) much earlier 
than Jan 2005.

I have already shared the link to the DAWG Requirements document and 
will solicit feedback
in SCM SC and share it with DAWG.

Would it be possible for you to summarize a few bullet points on the 
state of DAWG work
that I can communicate to the SCM SC. Here is what I have so far:

-Formed in February 2004, has one f2f in April 2004

-Charter and history at:
http://www.w3.org/2003/12/swa/dawg-charter
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/#hist

-Current submissions of strawman RDF query language (Are there any?)

-Schedule may be found at: 
http://www.w3.org/2003/12/swa/dawg-charter#schedule

-Currently working on Use Cases and Requirements. Draft available at:
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/UseCases

Anything else I should add? Please clarify question above about whether 
existing strawman RDF query language  submissions have been made.

Thanks.

The ebXML Registry TC web site is lacking this and some other important 
details right now. We will work to get
that sorted out.

Currently the SCM SC is working through Use Cases and Requirements when 
it is a little more stable.

The SCM SC would welcome participation or feedback in our work from DAWG 
and SWA participants. Thanks.
