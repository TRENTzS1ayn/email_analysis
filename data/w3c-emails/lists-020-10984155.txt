which triples?

I don't understand how you come to that conclusion.

Our charter addresses this pretty clearly, no?

"1.8 Derived Graphs

The working group must recognize that RDF graphs are often constructed
by aggregation from multiple sources and through logical inference, and
that sometimes the graphs are never materialized. Such graphs may be
arbitrarily large or infinite."

True, for some forms of inference, the "witness" graph is
not a natural byproduct of the computation, if it exists
at all.

[at this point the chair fails to suppress his frustration
that W3C chose to continue to build more layers of semantic
web technology without a corresponding proof syntax. sigh...]

Fair question.

I recall Janne speaking from implementation experience in Amsterdam.
Hmm... the record only captured

 "Janne: Profium - SIR product"

Janne, care to elaborate?

To each his own.
