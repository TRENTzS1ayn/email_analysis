I have been scanning the list archives wondering how much discussion has 
occurred on having a requirement to support
predicates with boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT).

What I find is that there has been a few postings that talk about 
Negation or Conjunction or Disjunction support as potential use cases or 
requirements.

However, when I read the latest Use Cases and Requirements draft I do 
not believe I see a requirement that focuses explicitly on
supporting multiple predicates in the query syntax that can be combined 
using boolean operators. Is this an explicit omission or
has it just been missed? If explicitly dropped as a requirement can 
anyone explain the rationale for the decision. Thanks for your
help.
