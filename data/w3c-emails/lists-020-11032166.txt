What's your original graph and what's your subgraph, Jos?

I'm offering a graph with two nodes and no edges, plus the fact that an
edge of type either p1 or p2 must exist between the two encoded in some
higher-level semantic language.

I can only see four possible subgraphs of the original graph: one node,
the other node, both nodes, or neither node. None of these options
explicates the answer.
