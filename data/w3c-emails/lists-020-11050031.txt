I'm not sure. In the postings you have seen, is there a particular
phrasing of the requirement that appeals to you?

It's entirely possible that there is a requirement that the WG
would support but nobody has managed to write it down yet.

FYI, the implementations I am familiar with have limited support
for disjunction and negation: limited to comparing
datatype values.

Perhaps some of the implementors would like to relate
their experience?
