I was under the impression that the problem we were solving was one of
querying an RDF graph and potential inferences from that graph. If we
try to solve the problem of communicating higher-level semantics in a
way that naive RDF processors will understand, we'll be busy for a
very long time. Therefor, I am happy to constrain the "fact that an
edge of type either p1 or p2" to be expressible in RDF statements ala
this example from the "OWL Guide" [1]:

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Fruit">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#SweetFruit" />
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#NonSweetFruit" />
  </owl:Class>
and another ground fact:
  <ex:Fruit rdf:about="http://www.WordNet.org/grapefruit" />

Ask a question to which the answer is yes:
ask (<http://www.WordNet.org/grapefruit> owl:Class ex:SweetFruit || 
     <http://www.WordNet.org/grapefruit> owl:Class ex:NonSweetFruit)

and get back the following supporting evidence:
  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Fruit">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#SweetFruit" />
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#NonSweetFruit" />
  </owl:Class>
  <ex:Fruit rdf:about="http://www.WordNet.org/grapefruit" />

If noone has worked out how to express the "fact that an edge of type
either p1 or p2" in RDF, then I'm happy saying we don't define the
answer in a DAWG-QL spec. Variable binding syntaxes from DAWG-QL may
be useful in answering questions on graphs we can't express, but I bet
we'll have a hell of a time defining test suites for them.
