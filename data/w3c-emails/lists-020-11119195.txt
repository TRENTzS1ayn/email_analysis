In the telecon, I took an action to reword requirement 3.1. 

= Proposed wording =

-----------------------------------------------

3.1 Multiple RDF triple matching

The query langauge must include the capability to restrict matches on the
RDF graph by providing more than one RDF triple pattern to be satisified in
one query.

-----------------------------------------------

by using the terminology of the recommendation "RDF Concepts" [3]
particularly "RDF triple" and "RDF graph".  We could flesh out "RDF triple
pattern" now but it would have implications for syntactic sugar [4] of the
eventual query language which I would rather leave open (e.g writing
constraints on literals into the triple pattern or restrictions on
namespaces of properties).

= Background =

I tried to chase down the origin of this item and found it recorded in
minutes [1] as

"""
 * queries with paths of length two or more edges
"""

The original email [2] says:

"""
the situation of users interested in more than just properties within one
hop of a query node is very very common
"""

In the telecon, the feeling was that this could be better expressed in terms
of multiple triple matches, which can be used to form a "path", or in terms
of the RDF graph, not restricted to paths.   Looking at the IRC log for
2004-04-01, the change to more than just paths was mentioned at the time.

= Original Wording =

For reference the original wording in v1.39 is:

[[[
3.1 Multi-edged Paths 

A query language must include the ability to match paths through an RDF
graph where the number of arcs traversed is greater than one, as well as
single one-edge paths. The query language may still only have paths of fixed
length in the query or may cover paths of variable length (e.g. transitive
closures).
