Not so good for me. 

1/ The variables may be implicit due to syntactic sugar and there are
different kinds of variables (not returned, may bind, ...)  I would not talk
about variables.

example (made up syntax): for a graph pattern:

(?x vCard:N-->vCard:familyName "Smith")

is the triple patterns 

(?x vCard:N  ?y)
(?y vCard:familyName "Smith")

and ?y is not a projection (SELECT) variable.

2/ not all the triple patterns may be connected by variables (this may be
bad design for other reasons nothing to do with this requriment).

How about:

  The query language must include the capability to restrict matches
  by graph pattern on the queried graph by providing a graph pattern.
  The graph pattern may consist of one, two or more RDF triple patterns,
  to be satisfied in one query.

That is, introduce graph pattern explicitly and say graph patterns are made
of triple patterns.

Note: graphs need not be connected so graph patterns need not be connected
and one pattern per query is enough for conjunctive queries.


I preferred the original but will put up with the reworded, "variable"
version.  These are requirements and we do not understand their full
implications yet.
