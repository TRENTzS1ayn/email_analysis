This is similar to my concern:

If a query includes some extension function (after 3.3), say a function
that takes a radius and the URIs for two geo-spatial co-ordinate nodes and
returns TRUE if one is in the radius of the other. The complete graph used
to answer that query is not neccesarily known to the query engine -
especailly if the function is implemented at a lower level. Asking
extension functions (for example) to give the triples that it used to
answer the question seems unneccesarily onerous.
