This is better than the 'path' way of talking. It seems to me however 
that all these proposed wordings are hesitating at the edge of what 
needs to be said, which is that a query pattern must be allowed to be 
an RDF graph pattern rather than simply a single triple pattern. A 
graph, in this context, is just a set of triples, recall. There is no 
need to talk explicitly about shared variables: if one allows 
variables to occur in a graph then one would need special conditions 
to avoid shared variables, so not saying anything implicitly allows 
them.

One other point, the phrase 'the RDF graph' here may be too 
restrictive, and in any case isnt clear enough. Some querying 
services might use more than one graph, or might access a constantly 
changing graph. So I'd suggest that we choose a phrase like 'server' 
(or 'source' or 'base' or 'answer' or some such) and use it 
consistently as a name and as a qualifier, as in 'server graph', 
meaning the notional RDF graph used by the server to answer the query.
