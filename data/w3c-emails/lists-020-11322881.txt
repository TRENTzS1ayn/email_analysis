No, it is not intended to include RDF syntax generation in RDF/XML.  It is
intended to create a displayable web page (XHTML) or a SOAP message in XML.
No RDF graph - its not syntax generating, and no (recoverable) variable
bindings.  The use is to feed into something else like a web browser or web
service.
