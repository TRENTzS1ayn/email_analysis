The problem with "server graph" is that we adopted a requirement that
the query language can work w/out network support. Hence my suggested
"queried graph"; "source graph" also seems a credible choice. 

But yr point about "*the* RDF graph", given the possibility of
distributed or federated queries, is a good one. As is the point about
naming and consistent use.
