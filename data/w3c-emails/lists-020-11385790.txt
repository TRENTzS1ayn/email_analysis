I don't think we will be able to write a specification for this
scenario anyays. How will we specify the semantics of query
opperations on data sets that aren't RDF?

Imagine a SQL interface to get the current weather in Chicago. The
part of the SQL spec that says results are some expression of a table
may help us serialize/deserialize the response, but the bulk of the
spec that defines the results in terms of restriction, projection,
union, difference and product on the original data will be useless.
The SQL spec will be useful if the weather data is defined in terms
of a table by some other spec. That's roughly what I'm arguing for,
don't try to define a QL that will handle queries on non-RDF data.
Instead define operator semantics, result sets, test suites in terms
of RDF dataa and leave the projection of rules into RDF for another
specification.

How do we know the client will be as clever as the server? What
happens if the server gives back a result graph (or set of result
graphs) and the client can't see how they answer the query? Not a
problem, I say dismissively. RDF semantics protect the client from
arriving at contradictory results (with some extra think-work for
negation as failure). If the client asked for bindings, the user can
still get his answer. If the client asked only for grpah answers, it
probably had a reason to do this, like it's federating parts of a
query to multiple sources. If it isn't clever enough to follow the
logic of some of the federated sources, the user doens't get that
solution. The user in that case would have done no better if DAWG-QL
didn't have a mechanism for communication results as subgraphs.

I think this is at least a consistent world view. Whether it will
be a popular world view remains to be seen.
