I suggest what I think are small changes:

+ including the term "graph pattern" as is in the suggested text for 3.1.
+ tweaking the title
+ Be neutral to "optional triples" and "may-bind" variables.

------------------------

3.6 Optional Matching

It must be possible to express a query graph pattern that does not fail to
match when some nominated part of the graph pattern fails to match.  Any
such triples matched by this optional part, or variable bindings caused by
this optional part, can be requested in the results.

For reference, the text in v1.39 is:
"""
3.6 Optional Match 
It must be possible to express a query that does not fail when some
nominated part of the query specifying "optional triples" fails to match.
Any such triples matched by this optional part, or variable bindings caused
by this optional part, can be returned in the results, if requested.
