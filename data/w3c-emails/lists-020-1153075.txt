I agree - It seems unecessary to force the processor to ignore the
omit-meta-declaration attribute when the output encoding is ascii.  Any
future processing of the xml produced will have no problem reading the
ascii using the default utf-8 encoding.

I generate XHTML that forms part of a web page put together using JSP.
I use the ascii output method to ensure any character references are
carried through to the output unchanged, which ensures that throughout
the process I only deal with single byte characters (limiting encoding
issues).  

This leaves the xml declaration somewhere in the generated (x)html page,
which requires text processing out.
