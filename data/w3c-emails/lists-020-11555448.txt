That's really my main question to the group: are we designing a language in
which specific and explicit knowledge of graph structure has to be embedded
in the query? It seems to me that we are or should be, but it's not clear to
me that's been decided one way or another by the group. Has this question
been answered to other people's satisfaction, or are we still in a bit of
murky territory here?

I don't see a contradiction in allowing external functions to do things
under the hood and out of sight btw: they provide a needed escape mechanism
for letting clever implementers get around the limits of having to be
triple-wise explicit in the query. In me 'umble at any rate ...
