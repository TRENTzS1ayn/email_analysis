I'm afraid I can't really support this as a requirement, although I
think features which allow this result (albeit not necessary directly)
would almost certainly be extremely useful.

The thing is, "optional bindings" are really nothing more than unions
between independent queries: union the results of the query with the
binding with the results of the query without it. I'd say a more
general-purpose "union" operator is quite a bit more important than this
one particular form, and even then I'm not sure whether it rises to the
level of requirement.
