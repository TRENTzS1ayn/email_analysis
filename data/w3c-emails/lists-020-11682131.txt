Yeah, that's obviously the kind of use case (and it's super prevalent,
near as I can tell, because of the prevalence of the RDF snippets
design pattern) that motivates my suggesting this requirement.

So, in this scenario the aggregated query option is sugar for lots of
queries, and I think it's very helpful sugar. (I think there are lots
of small device, cell phone use cases that motivate this requirement,
too, but I think the RDF Snippets pattern is enough justification.)

I'll also add that I carefully wrote this requirement as a *may*, not
a must, which is to say that conforming implementations can not
implement it.
