I'm a cell phone. I want to look at the RSS 1.0 feeds of all the
people in my FOAF file in order to construct a list of email
addresses. I want to submit one query to my DAWG service and get back
a list of email addresses (in some format... unspecified here). I want
to submit *one* query because my service is often unreliable and
always expensive.

So, instead of requesting one query n times, I want to request
one. Something like:

SELECT...
WHERE...
USING...
IN
   http://foo/foaf.rdf
   http://bar/foaf.rdf
   http://blaz/foaf.rdf

That's what I called aggregated query; but note that it doesn't
require the multiple graphs to be remote. I think there are other use
cases where they are local.

We've approved, at last count, two. That seems pretty short.

Best,
