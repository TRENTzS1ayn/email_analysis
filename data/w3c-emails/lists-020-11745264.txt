Farrukh,

How utterly decent of you. Thanks for saying so publicly.

FWIW, I'm v. interested in yr stuff about using ebXML respositories as
CMSes -- I edited and pub'd a report about XML Europe yesterday on
XML.com in which the author talked about yr presentation.

If you have a PDF or slides of yr talk online some place, I'd love to
know where.

Best,
Kendall Clark
