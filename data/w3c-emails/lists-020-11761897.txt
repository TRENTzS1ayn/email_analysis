Thank you for your interest in the ebXML Registry work.
I would like nothing better than to be able to see it aligned with the 
QL from DAWG
when the dust settles. I realize I have much to learn about RDF and RDF 
Query Language
requirements before being very useful in DAWG.

Here are some ebXML Registry Links. [3] is the paper and slides you 
refered to.

I look forward to any comments or questions
offline (or online if it may be relevant to DAWG).

[1] OASIS ebXML Registry Specifications

http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/regrep/documents/2.5/specs

[2] freebXML Registry a Royalty Free Implementation of ebXML Registry 
Standard

http://ebxmlrr.sourceforge.net/

[3] Web Content Management Using ebXML Registry (Paper for XML 2004)

(ppt)

(Open Office)

(Accompanying paper)

[4] Semantic Content Management SC (work-in-progress)
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2004Jan/att-0091/00-part

BTW I saw a great presentation at recent OASIS Symposium by
Dr. Peter Elkin of Mayo Clinic on managing Medical Vocabularies using 
OWL Ontologies and ebXML Registry.
I am still looking to get a link to that.
