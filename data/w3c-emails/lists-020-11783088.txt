Just what server are you asking to perform this query for you?

What on earth is stopping some independent application from simply
aggregating these graphs for you? It seems to me that such an
application is quite a different beast from a general query answering
service. I can completely understand a standalone RDF repository that
lets you ask about the RDF it contains (because it wishes to offer
knowledge of its contents). It seems far less likely that in order to
offer an RDF query service that same repository needs to be willing to
go and aggregate data for you because the query language says this is
part of performing a query.

Again, how you form your query graph is your problem.

How you get data out of it is a problem for the query language (and
possibly protocol).
