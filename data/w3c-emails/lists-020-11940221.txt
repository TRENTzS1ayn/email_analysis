Right, exactly. In fact there are quite a number of these.

Yes, but lets keep things in perspective. How about only considering 
valid derivations from the basic graph, and maybe even requiring a 
closure relative to some subset of the complete set of rdfs rules: 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-mt-20040210/#RDFSRules

No, but what we could consider is ways for the query to indicate 
which virtual graph it is intended to be aimed at. A server might 
just keep one base graph but treat the query differently if it 
indicates it is aimed at the closure under transitivity of 
rdfs:subClassOf, for example (rules rdfs6 and rdfs9).

Well, up to RDFS at least there is a complete set of rules which are 
pretty transparently related to the formal semantics, if we want to 
use them.

Im sympathetic to this pov, however.
