I've been trying -- partly to be responsive to one of Rob's repeated points
-- to talk about a *requirement* rather than a solution. I'm happy for
others to backfill it with concrete possible solutions.

I'm less happy -- though this isn't directed at you, Pat -- for people to
reject the requirement because one possible design decision responding to it
seems like "too much work", especially where there are modest decisions that
might not be.

Just my two,  meta-process cents.

Yes, which is one reason why I worded my requirement specifically as RDFS
query, in conjunction with the reasoning experts in our lab. :>

As am I, absent obligations to represent what users are asking for. (They
seem to not care at all, as I said in an earlier message, about this
distinction.)
