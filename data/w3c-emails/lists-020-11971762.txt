Right, exactly, and I think its a good separation.

Still, unlike Rob, I think that we could reasonably approach the 
'inference issue' by seeing if we can come up with some way for a 
query to indicate to a server (sorry I keep using this term, I can't 
think of a better one: the engine or entity to which the query is 
directed and which checks it against a graph: do we have a name for 
this?)  WHICH graph it wants the query to be directed to. Since 
'graph' here can be a virtual graph defined partly by inference 
closures (and may in fact be infinite in some cases, eg when thinking 
seriously about datatyped literals), a simple idea like just having a 
URI for each graph, or one graph per server, seems inadequate. So can 
we think of a way for a query to indicate which conceptual/virtual 
graph it is intended to be evaluated with respect to? For example 
(complete straw man) maybe the query could refer to a source listing 
a set of rules which the virtual graph is supposed to be closed 
under, or some such. Or it could be as coarse as just specifying 
plain/rdf/rdfs/datatyped as options, where each of these refers to a 
semantic extension and the graph is supposed to be closed under all 
inferences which are valid wrt that extension.
