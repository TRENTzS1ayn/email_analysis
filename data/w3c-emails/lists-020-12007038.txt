BTw Pat, in one of your earlier mails
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004AprJun/0325.html

intented any difference between 2 kinds of variable ??

Right and that's exactly what I have been experimenting with
i.e. when writing a query like e.g. (...and using N3)

(<a-graph-uri> rdfs:).da:from da:select {?A a s:Publication}.

that rdfs: indicates that we have to perform rdfs namespace
entailment and leaving it out of the da:from argument list
doesn't do that (in our tests, we actually map that rdfs: to
http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2003/03swap/rdfs-rules.n3
and have similar stuff for xsd: owl: etc... but for those we
don't make any completeness nor decidability claims :))
