Query:
[??x rdf:type ex:TheClass .]

(using ?? to flag a must-bind) should get you all the instances that 
are listed in the graph. Whether that is ALL instances is another 
matter altogether:I don't think that it makes sense to ask that as an 
RDF query.

>  all the parents

?Superclasses? If so,

Query:
[ex:TheClass rdfs:subClassOf ??x]

should work, but what you get will certainly not be *all* of them. 
You might be unpleasantly surprised by how many of them there are, 
even if the set of all of them was computable.
