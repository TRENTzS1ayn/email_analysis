maybe. i guess it depends on what is meant by union.

regardless, our goal is not a *minimal* query language
but a useful one. as andy noted, RDQL users have requested
optional triples.

and, implementing optional triples as multiple union
queries could strain the capabilities of query
optimizers. seems like it's more efficient to
make optional triples explicit. SQL has both
union and outer join, for example.
