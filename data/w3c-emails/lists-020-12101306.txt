Peeps,

For the telcon tomorrow, please try to glance at version 1.40, or
higher, of 

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/UseCases

which I have just checked in. Some of the notable changes include
rewording several requirements, including some we seem to have reached
some consensus about recently.

I've also included a more complete Design Objectives section, which
includes 6 or 7 requirements that have some support.

I've also started working on a set of technical terms for our design
space, to be included in an eventual glossary. I don't expect that
will necessarily live in the pub'd draft of UC&R, but I'd like to keep
them there for now as a reminder to myself and to others, as a way of
trying out new terms, and because I don't want to start another doc
just yet. :>

Best,
Kendall Clark

PS--I've been having mail troubles lately (that is, I've go entirely
too much mail!); thus, if you review 1.40 and don't see something you
were expecting to see, the most prudent course of action is to email
me directly with your question, comment, or patch.
