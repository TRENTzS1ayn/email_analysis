Well, those are *titles*, names, really, which means (in my mind, at
least) that shorter is better than longer. I like "Triple" and "RDF
Triple" are exactly equivalent in most cases in this document,
certainly in titles. That is, I prefer the shorter title and don't
consider it out of phase with the text. (But I'm open to being
convinced that this is wrong...)

Hmm, yes, that's more convincing; though I think "Graph Pattern
Matching" ("...by providing a graph pattern...") is better. Any
thoughts on that?
