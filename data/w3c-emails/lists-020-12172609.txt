I don't think this merits adding to our Use Cases document,
but FYI...

In reply to a message about French translations of OWL,
Pat H. asked to be notified if/when they get translated
to Spanish. I explained that the data are kept in RDF,
and I composed a query for "OWL docs in spanish" in N3.
Ivan followed up to note that W3C already offers an
analagous query service using the low-tech
x-www-url-encoded query language:

http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/byTechnology?technology=owl&output=RDF

That reminds me... I gather XForms lets you compose
URIs like that... ah yes...

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-xforms-20031014/slice11.html#serialize-urlencode

Hmm... I'm not sure how relevant that is, but there it is.

That should be straightforward to arrange: the W3C copyright license
requires translators to let us know when they publish a translation.

Charles, are you aware of any efforts to translate OWL to spanish?

Hmm... how to arrange notification when a spanish translation of
an OWL document comes along?

The data are all available as RDF; details:
  http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/Overview.html

I played around a bit and composed this query:

[[[

:target :language "es"; :docGroup "OWL".

{
  :target :language ?LANG; :docGroup ?STITLE.

  ?DOC trans:translationFrom ?ORIG;
   dc:title ?TITLE;
   dc:language ?LANG.

   ?P a rdfs:ContainerMembershipProperty.
  ?GRP recs:shortTitle ?STITLE;
    recs:groupMembers [ ?P ?SERIES ].

  ?ORIG doc:versionOf ?SERIES.
}
 => {
   ?DOC dc:language ?LANG;
     trans:translationFrom ?ORIG
}.

]]] -- excerpted from
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/util/findTrans.n3


It works for "fr" and (correctly) produces no results for "es".

You can use that to poll for spanish OWL translations.

Kind of a nifty RDF Data Access use case, perhaps.
Perhaps I'll forward it.

attached mail follows:
To reinforce what Dan says: translation *intent* as well as announcement of 
publishable translations are to be announced on the translation mailing list of 
W3C: w3c-translators@w3.org. Once an announcement is made, it is my job to make 
some basic tests and to put it into the rdf files that drive 
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Translation/.

Indeed, I do not do any notification at this moment. However, the Spanish office 
is thinking of implementing a local, automatic mechanism on their site that 
could also monitor the changes; details are still in discussion. I would let 
them do this rather than duplicate the work. I have copied this mail to Jose, 
the local manager.

Dan: you can get to an RDF/XML portion on OWL translations by:

http://www.w3.org/2003/03/Translations/byTechnology?technology=owl&output=RDF

No need for extra query. Of course, it is geeky to do it;-)
