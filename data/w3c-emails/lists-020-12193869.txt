Only that we ought to follow the terminology set up in:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-concepts-20040210/#section-Graph-syntax

Which talks of "RDF Triples" and "RDF Graph", especially as an RDF graph
isn't the general graph found in elsewhere graph theory (e.g. graph must
have at least one arc; RDF triples don't have literal subjects or bNodes for
predicates).

"RDF Graph Pattern Matching" is OK.
