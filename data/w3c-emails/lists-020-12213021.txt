My concern with 3.4 is mostly related to the part about "Executing the
query on such a subgraph would yield the same subgraph; if obtaining
variable bindings, the same variable bindings would be obtained."

This seems a bit overly restrictive and effectively rules out some things
we might like, as described in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004AprJun/0276.html
