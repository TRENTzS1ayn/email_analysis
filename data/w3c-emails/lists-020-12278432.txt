No, this UC is meant to motivate requirements that the data access
protocol be able to transport RDF query languages other than the one
we design. That is, the multiple query languages here are some subset
of the 20 or so existing RDF query languages.

Thanks, Farrukh, for the comments. I have used some of yr suggestions,

A new version, 1.48, is now available.
