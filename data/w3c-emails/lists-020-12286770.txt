Farrukh, Steve,

I understood "3.10 Result Limits" to be about having LIMIT in queries, that
is "get a maximum of N results even if there are more", not cursors and
chunking nor OFFSET.  We had the requirement:

""" from the F2F:
The query language/protocol supports limit, offset and ordering of results.
"""

But it didn't get as much support.  It got 5 yes, 3 no: whereas just "limit"
got 9/2.

OFFSET is problematic in RDF (no ordering) and also gets into stability of
the result sets over a period of time which is difficult in a federated, web
environment.  The phrase "fetching it in chunks" still seems to be cursors
to my reading.

Farrukh - Could you say some more about your experience with ebXML Registry
etc?  It is a problem if the results are large - just as if a web page is a
large PDF or a database backed URL generates huge amounts of HTML.  It just
that machine processing makes it worse as they don't hit the "stop" button.

Andy
