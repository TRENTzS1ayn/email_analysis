The low-tech way is to just say your name:

Farrukh says "Farrukh here--" and pauses.
DanC as chair says "Farrukh, go ahead"
and then Farrukh has the floor.

But as you've noticed, we've automated that to some extent...

You may have noticed a pointer in the agenda to
http://www.w3.org/Guide/1998/08/teleconference-calendar#s_1343

if you follow that, and then go up the page, there's a link to
  "More Zakim user instructions"
