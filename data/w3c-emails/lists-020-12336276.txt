I understand an objective to be something like a goal; i.e. the WG
would like to get it done, but the WG is prepared to declare
victory even if we haven't done it.

Optional protocol elements work against interoperability, so I would
like to see more motivation. Do you have any particular topics
in mind for optional protocols?

Is this proposal directed at the use cases & requirements document?
If so, could you be more specific about wording?
