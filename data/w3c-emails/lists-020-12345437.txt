Hello, all

I don't understand what Jose did in requesting the server to  pass the
result ot "an XSLT transformation service."

# Is it appropreate to use the article "an" here?

Did Jose specify the XSLT server?

If not, how does this differ from specifying the disered result format?
How does Jose know that the (original) result need to be processed "by an
XSLT" server?

Could anybody explain it for me?

Cheers,
Yoshio
