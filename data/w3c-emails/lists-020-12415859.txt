Peeps,

The latest version of our doc is 1.56. Some of the changes I made
since the telcon:

* added intra-doc links between UCs and Reqs/DesObjs; this needs to be
  fleshed out but EricP gave me a good start.

* some wordsmithing changes in a few spots

* I changed 4.6 (from RDFS Query to RDFS/OWL Query) a bit to more
  accurately express what my users (and my AC) really want. As with
  most of the Design Objectives, this one is meant to describe an
  *optional* feature, so adding OWL to RDFS imposes no extra burdens
  on anyone necessarily.

* I added a status line to each Req and DO. -- Someone please check to
  make sure I've got the right ones marked approved? I did it from memory.

Some interesting technical discussion today, but I didn't see anything
that would shift consensus.

Best,
Kendall
