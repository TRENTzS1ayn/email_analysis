I appreciate the effort to include OWL in the objectives section, but I
feel the current approach to these other semantic layers is a bit
short-sighted. Some people think RDFS is neat, I think description
logics (and OWL-DL) are pretty spiffy, and others like rules languages
like SWRL. In time people may well come up with other ways of encoding
knowledge. Importantly, only a very few of these languages/technologies
have "structure" that can be sensibly and canonically realized in RDF.

I would simply recommend that we really address the "RDF as data model
for the semantic web" notion on which all these other technologies are
predicated. Some suggested text:

4.6 Additional semantic knowledge
It should be possible for knowledge encoded in other semantic languages,
such as RDFS, OWL, and SWRL to affect the results of queries about RDF
graphs.
