Well...
The later the standardization, the more the adapting cost would be, I think.
And an optional functinality of type (2) in my wording (i.e. those
relatively easy to make standards for, but not suitable to force all
implementations to support) should have enough implementation experience by
now.

If the situation is that there's no functionalities of such kind, then our
discussion ends.
I'm happy with not having those of type (1) in the specification or leave
them just as "desin objectives."
... type(1): those which would require too much time to make standards for

In this case, the server B could answer to the client A
"Sorry, we don't support that feature, will you say it in other words?"
or "Sorry, all we can give you is this (providing its best answer)"
and A shoud be ready for it, for the optional features is labeled OPTIONAL
in the specification.

It's to provide further interoperability among languages that support the
optional functionalties.

It's because optional functionality could be burdonsome for small servers
(and maybe so for some clients, too?).

If we keep some functioality OPTIONAL, providers who want to implement only
the mandatory part of the specification
can provide more compact servers.

In other words, OPTIONAL requirements are the ones to be included in the
future specification
when computational or device costs should be considerably lower than now.

I agree with you on this point.
It should be better.

My consern, however, is that the costs to support each optional features
coud be differ (or couldn't be shared),
and without some theoretical justification, our layering/clustering
functionalities wouldn't get people's support.
"Why should I implement the optional functionality B paying extra cost when
I need only A?"
# In OWL case, we have theoretical justification, don't we?

I want to know other members' opinion on that point.
