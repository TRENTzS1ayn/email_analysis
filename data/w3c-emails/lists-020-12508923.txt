Discussion of the use cases document
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/UseCases

$Id: UseCases.html,v 1.48 2004/05/11 13:24:33 kclark Exp $

Req 3.1 was renamed to "RDF Graph Pattern Matching"

DanC PROPOSED: to adopt 3.1 RDF Graph Pattern Matching as in 1.48
as a requirement.
Vote:
  Abstentions: Rob Shearer
  Objections: none
RESOLVED: adopt 3.1 as a requirement

3. Requirement 3.2 Variable Binding Results

Pat Hayes summarized his OWL-QL experiences as emailed in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004AprJun/0245.html
He outlined three particular things the users (DAML PIs, meeting
attendees) demanded:
1. Total control on the form of the answer, a different pattern
potentially from the query.
2. May bind and must bind
3. Can ask "How many answers?"

Reworded 3.2 to be:
  "It must be possible for queries to return zero or more bindings of
  variables. Each set of bindings is one way that the query can be
  satisfied by the queried graph."
and PROPOSED to adopt it as a requirement
Vote:
  Abstentions: Jos De Roo
  Objections: none
RESOLVED: adopt 3.2 as written above as a requirement.

PROPOSED to adopt requirement 3.7 as written in UseCases CVS 1.48:
[[
  3.7 Limited datatype support
    The query language language must include support for a subset of
    XSD datatypes and operations on those datatypes.
]] -- from UseCases CVS 1.48
Vote:
  Abstentions: none
  Objections: none
RESOLVED: adopt 3.7 as written above (in UseCases CVS 1.48) as a requirement.

The DAWG discussed planning the publication of the UseCases document
as a working draft, given the WWW2004 conference and publishing
moratorium (12-21May) and there was general agreement to publish
early (default action is publish) by setting an imminent cut-off date
in case of problems.

KendallC was happy to accept input till Friday 2004-05-14 at which
point he will email the state of the document to the list and accept
only clear mistakes as changes afterwards while reviewing is being
done.  Kendall described some work he planned to do before Friday
such as adding Use Case <> Requirement links (asking for help).  The
DAWG supported his suggested change to section 3 title to
"Requirements" adding (candidate) or some marker to indicate
unapproved, unconsidered ones.

ACTION AndyS, DanielK, BryanT: Review UseCases as of 2004-05-14
preparing to report to the DAWG at 2004-05-25 telcon.
