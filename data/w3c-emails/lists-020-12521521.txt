Minutes look OK, except one minor quibble, regarding

>2. May bind and must bind
>3. Can ask "How many answers?"

1 and 3 here were demanded by users. 2 was our invention as a 
solution to a technical problem about giving answers in the case 
where a query variable binds to a bnode.

If this is considered a niggling technicality, I'm happy to leave the 
minutes as they stand.
