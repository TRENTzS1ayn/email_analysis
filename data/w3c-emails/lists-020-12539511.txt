Folks,

A few changes to UC&R:

* I added RobS's alternative wording for 4.6, labeled 4.6a
* I added actual RDF-XML, based on Rob's note to the list
* I reworked 2.7 a bit based on Yukio's comments
* I added a few notes to the ghost glossary (mainly links to Pat's
  pointers re: RDF subgraph)

Best,
Kendall Clark
