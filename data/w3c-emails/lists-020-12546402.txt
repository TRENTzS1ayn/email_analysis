Could you (or your AC rep :-) say how this differs from the charter
requriment "1.8 Derived Graphs"?

[[
The working group must recognize that RDF graphs are often constructed by
aggregation from multiple sources and through logical inference, and that
sometimes the graphs are never materialized. Such graphs may be arbitrarily
large or infinite.
]]

I *think* the req is saying that it can be possible to query the non-iferred
relationships explicitly.  Does this have to happen in one query expression?
That is, some parts of the query are affected by inference where other parts
are explicitly not.

Users who use this include people writing editors and browsers.
