+1 : I don't see why the query should need to record the execution but I can
be persuaded by an example.  At the moment, I see it as a protocol matter
concerned more with selecting the service access point.

A "query" is one of Pat's 'familiar abuse of terminology'.  The term is used
for both a recipe (a sequence of symbols in the query language) for
executing requests and the request (execution instance).  A template can be
partially instantiated (the source set, still can be repeated used).  This
multiple use is widespread and so our documents will be read with both
meansings in mind - it isn't something a glossary can help with much.   C.f.
"program" - the file continaing the binary or the one-time execution.

Its this overloading that causes the "bookmarkable query" to be a bit
confusing. It isn't a term invented in this WG; it is a general web arch
thing.

What I think this requirement really says is that the protocol must be able
to be used over HTTP GET as "bookmarkable".  Query is nromally a safe
operation and web caching also works. The requirement says very little about
the query language as x-www-form-urlencoded can be applied, if there is a
concrete syntax, it can be put in a URL.

The charter says "HTTP and/or SOAP-based protocol" so this  makes the HTTP
part a requirement.
