I think this also underlies your objection to 3.5: subgraph results.
What KR can you do in other languages that you can't do in RDF,
however awkwardly?

The presumption when writing the charter was that a large and
practical subset of KR could be reallized as an RDF graph and
querying that graph was the problem we were trying to solve.
I attempted in [1] to pick an example disjunctive query over
an asserted disjunction and show that since it had a canonical
representation in OWL, it was easy to report it as a graph
result. When won't that process work?
