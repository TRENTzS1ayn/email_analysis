explicitly"...?) 

No, it doesn't have to happen in one query expression, but I think
that's ideal; er, as long as by 'query expression' you mean 'one
query'. Err, hmm, what do you mean?

What we'd like is to make it as easy as possible (where easy

I'm not sure we really care too much about how the *req* is worded;

than req is worded. But a language that didn't help our users with
this kind of query would be *very* much less than ideal for them.
