Trying to get more info on your position ...

I think the reason that people have suggested using XPath only in URIs
is that it is effectively a read-only path expression language whereas
XQuery can do construction and create new XML constructs.  

When you say "any query language" are you suggesting that all features
of XQuery including functions, modules, constructions of new XML, the
forth coming update language, etc. must all be supported in URIs?
