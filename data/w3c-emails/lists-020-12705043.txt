Although I was used to put the selection of the RDF source(s)
in the protocol (e.g. as command line arguments) I became more
convinced that putting them in the query expression is also
interesting. For a simple example that asks for the lat/long
coordinates of Chicago or Cambridge, see
http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2004/04test/danQ.n3
i.e.

@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>.
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>.
@prefix da: <http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/euler#>.
@prefix d: <http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2004/04test/danP#>.

(d: owl: rdfs:).da:from da:select
    {{?C d:cityName "Cambridge";
         d:latitude ?LA;
         d:longitude ?LO} => {("Cambridge" ?LA ?LO) a d:Result}},
    {{?C d:cityName "Chicago";
         d:latitude ?LA;
         d:longitude ?LO} => {("Chicago" ?LA ?LO) a d:Result}}.

where that d: is actually one of the RDF sources
and the answer I actually got is

("Cambridge" 42.3 -71.1) a d:Result.
("Chicago" 41.9 -87.6) a d:Result.
