/ Michael Rys <mrys@microsoft.com> was heard to say:
| Section 3.2Construction from an Infoset
| Editorial
|
| Strike the sentence starting "Constructing and". The meaning is unclear.

Accepted. That sentence now reads:

<p>An instance of the data model constructed from an information set
<rfc2119>must</rfc2119> be consistent with the description provided
for each node type.</p>

Please let me know if this resolves the issue to your satisfaction.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
