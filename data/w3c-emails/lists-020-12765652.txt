One possible way a query could be bookmarked as a URI is as a URI to a 
query that is stored in a repository.
The ebXML Registry allows queries to be stored within the server as a 
parameterized query. A client can
invoke the query simply by identifying it with a URI and providing 
parameters to the query. This is similar
in concept to stored queries in a relational database. If the client 
does not provide some parameters then the
ebXML Registry drops the predicates for which parameters are not provided.

The above use case seems to be a combination of:

3.2 Variable Bindings Result, and
3.8 Bookmarkable Queries

Is my interpretation correct?
