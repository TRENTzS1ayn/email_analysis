Having query requests as URLs as two effects:
 * web caching using the existing deployed cache servers
 * recording a query so it can be reused or passed on to another system to
use.

Bookmarking is the second effect.  

Whether caching will be significant, when applied to general queries, I
don't know.  The same query can be written syntactically in many different
ways so just string comparison isn't much help although if it is the same
application running ob different machines it is going to generate the
syntactic forms.

A very smart server could maintain a cache of part of the dataset, if we had
an recommended format but the world of semantic web caches is some way off.


If the query is on the server and just needs some parameters, then isn't
this a case of a normal GET with a query string to provide the paramters?
That is, existing mechanisms apply.  Caching is likely as the parameterized
query has its own URL and the parameters are the HTTP query string.

It would benefit from one thing though - a MIME type or other way of
specifying the form for the results.
