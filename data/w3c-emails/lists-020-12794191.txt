Sound too general to me. For example, one can describe RDF graphs 
using reification, but I wouldnt want to count that as a 'pattern'. 
Suggest instead your first example as a suitable definition of 
pattern.

That would be my definition, not an example.

That should be part of the definition of 'substitute for a variable'. 
It kind of falls out of he way that RDF graphs syntax is defined in 
terms of sets rather than as expressions.

Or think of it as a set of query graph patterns.

True, but we could accommodate that into this definition of pattern 
by allowing 'variables' to be more highly structured things, like 
describing sorted quantification as quantification over sorted 
variables.

Sounds about right to me, though I think we need to be very careful 
to describe those restrictions appropriately. One kind of useful 
restriction might be to a datatype, to constrain literal bindings (?).
