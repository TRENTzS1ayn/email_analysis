Wait, I think I disagree with that last claim. RDFS is entirely 
encoded in RDF very naturally, OWL is encoded into RDF, albeit 
admittedly rather more awkwardly in places, but not impossibly so. 
SWRL admittedly doesnt have an RDF syntax, but SWRL rules apply to 
OWL syntax which has OWL/RDF as its official interchange standard, 
and usually its the results of the rules, rather than the rules 
themselves, which are relevant to query/answer exchange.

Well, strictly speaking there's no way to naturally encode a 
universal quantifier in RDF without ignoring or breaking the RDF 
model theory (as N3 does at that point). But, hey, if we allow 
universal quantifiers in query results then we are doing 
arbitrarily-high-complexity FO inference, which is probably a bad 
thing to tackle for a simple query language.

Yes, and I think we should take this presumption seriously. The world 
doesn't need yet another query language unless that QL is strongly 
related to RDF.
