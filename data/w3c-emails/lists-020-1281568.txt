Hi Paul,

I'd say that any feature which can be used to construct queries should
be able to do so in URI form.  AIUI, that would include functions and
modules, yes.

As for "constructions of new XML" and an "update language", I'm not
familiar with either, but those descriptions don't necessarily rule
them out from being usable in URI form.  What would rule them out would
be if either were used to change the state of any resources, as a SQL
UPDATE would do (as one example).

Mark.
