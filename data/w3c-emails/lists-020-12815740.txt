In the interests of making progress, I'm willing to accept Rob's
version, above, of my original proposal.  In the current UC&R doc,
my original is 4.6 and Rob's variant is 4.6a.

So, I'd be willing to accept a modest reworking of 4.6a:

Additional Semantic Information

It should be possible for knowledged encode din other semantic
languages -- for example: RDFS, OWL, etc. -- to affect the results of
queries about RDF graphs.

In fact, unless someone objects, I'd like to make that the language in
the document and the version which we vote on at some point.

Best,
Kendall Clark
