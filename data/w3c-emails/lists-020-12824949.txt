Hmm... sounds like a use case for RDF data access!

see http://esw.w3.org/topic/PathCross

and nearby http://esw.w3.org/topic/WWW2004
and, for fun, http://esw.w3.org/topic/InstantGig

I'm going, as my homepage and .sig attest, as well as
  http://www.w3.org/2004/05dc-lga/aa-mci-lga.n3
hmm... I've been trying to keep my travel itineraries
connected via an rdfs:seeAlso path from my foaf

  http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/home-smart.rdf
