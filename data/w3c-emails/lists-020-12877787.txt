I'm all for mentioning it, but lets be careful to understand what 
that reference would mean. I don't think it is part of our charter, 
or a rational goal, to expect to get back references to rules 
themselves as responses to queries. That is, I don't think we should 
be querying SWRL rule-sets in the same way we query RDF graphs.  I 
think it does make sense, and could be part of our charter, to expect 
that an engine responding to an RDF query might use SWRL rules to 
help answer the queries, by 'connecting' a query to some RDF data 
source by applying SWRL rules. But since SWRL applies to OWL and OWL 
is interchanged using RDF, this would not require us to consider 
queries about languages which do not have RDF encodings.

I imagine that this distinction lies behind the classification of RDF 
and OWL as 'semantic languages' rather than 'rule languages' (??)
