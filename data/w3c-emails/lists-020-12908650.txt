That's language I can accept, given the way things are for me,
institutionally, as well as some of the semi-tech reasons I mentioned
in back channel mail.

I can equally well ask what is so important about SWRL, which isn't a
standard and doesn't seem to have much behind it (?).

So, I'll try again: I could accept language that replaced "SWRL" with
"or a language that can be used to describe RDF models but which doesn't
have an RDF serialization" -- or words to that effect. That is, that's
my 2nd attempt to get what you say you want from "SWRL" w/out
mentioning SWRL.

I'll point out, as a side note, that *no one in the entire known
universe* will read "and SWRL" to mean the things you want it to
mean. I.e., putting my editorial hat on over my UMD hat, the "and
SWRL" bit doesn't do what you want it to do, IMO, nearly as well as
explicit, generic language.
