Hi Mark,

It's not clear to me whether you want to enter this as a last-call comment 
against the current XQuery documents. These are replies to a thread that 
started in October.

If you do want to enter this as a last call comment, could you please start 
a new thread that clearly says that?

Thanks!

Jonathan
