Ok.  It sounds like 6+ DAWGs, which is great.  I (finally!) have a
copy of the conference schedule and I can suggest some times.  Since
I'm not sure that everyone will be there Tuesday, let me suggest lunch
on WED (12:30-14:00).  I think that there will be a "box lunch" offered
by the conference, but we can also head out for something local.

Let's gather at the conference registration table (since everyone will
know where that is) and depart for lunch by 12:15.

 ----

Here are some alternates (if this does not work out for a bunch of
people:

 - thur lunch (12:30-14:00); or
 - thur dinner (offsite banquet from 19:00-21:00).

My own preference is lunch since I am traveling with my family.
