Folks,

The latest revision of the UC&R doc, 1.84, is public:

    http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/UseCases

Changes I can remember:

 * table of contents is "full"
 * nuked some extraneous stuff floating around in comments
 * fixed all of my XXX: markers
 * replaced the graph diagram with hand-written N3 (someone check this?)
 * various CSS fixes, formatting niceties
 * accounted for all outstanding comments from WG members

Save for any bug fixes or status updates, I'm pretty much happy with
this at 1.84 and consider it freezed to major additions or new
features.

Kendall Clark
