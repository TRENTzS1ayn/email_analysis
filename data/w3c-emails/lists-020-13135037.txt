One of the issues that became clear to me during the recent WWW meeting
in NYC is that we are missing a bridge between the RDF model and XML.
In particular, people who are going to be using the semantic web need
a bridge from the RDF data model to application specific XML
vocabularies (actually, we need one that goes the other way also, but
that is, I think, a seperate question).  Perhaps the most common use
case is querying an RDF resource and using the results to drive an XSL
Transform, which in turn might generate XHTML.

This issue has been more or less discussed in the context of templates,
which did not receive strong support at the first f2f as a requirement
for DAWG.  However I think that NOT having this is going to be a major
stumbling block for adoption of the DAWG recommendation by application
developers and is going to make it very difficult to get at that sense
of loose coupling and content reuse that makes the web so exciting.

I would like to get a sense from people of how a DAWG spec could best
facilitate this.  Do we need to do this ourselves?  Can we expose the
data model query language in such a way that it can be usefully applied
by XSL Transforms?  Should this be considered out of scope for the
charter?

Thanks,
