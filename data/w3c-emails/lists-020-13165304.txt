Got it, thanks.

We only ever had a glossary in HTML comments in the present doc. I
thought it was time to move those terms into a separate document,
which I'm not quite ready to check into CVS yet. But soon.

Agreed.

The "It must be possible..." is vague as between whether the
requirement pertains to the query language, to the data access
protocol, to both, or to some other thing. In some cases the form of
the requirement which we approved pertains specifically to the query
language or to the data access protocol.

I'm not going to harmonize *these* differences away; however, I think
some precision can be gained here, and I've made those changes that
seemed to me appropriate.

Hmm, I'm not terribly worried by this, but I have edited it a bit.

I don't really understand your suggested text; what's the point of the
modal form ("*could feature the news story")?

Do you mean the baseball player Ichiro?

Well, yeah, sorta-kinda. But the earlier version of this UC which did
just that was deemed to be too blue-sky by some. Or at least that was
the impression I got. But now we learned that Acura is doing something
a bit like this in its new version of the RL lux sedan. I may well
change the UC after this draft, but I'm gonna hold off for now till
there's more information.

Thanks, Yoshio, for all the comments. I don't know when the W3C's CVS
will be working again, but I'll check these changes in ASAP. (And, to
think, I just wrote a piece last week trying to convince the Atom
folks to jump to the W3C based, in part, on *superior support and
WG-resources* -- ouch! :>)

Best,
