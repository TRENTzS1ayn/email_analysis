Bryan,

For me, the "Human-friendly Syntax" refers to the query lanaguage.  It makes
no statement about the results format.

We have had discussion about RDF syntaxes for a query lanaguage.  I think it
is important that the WG produce a syntax for the query language that is
oriented towards clear use by application writers.  Maybe some RDF syntax
would be clear, maybe the solution is N3, including formulae, which is
beyond RDF, but the goal is that application writers, maybe power end users,
can write queries in a clear form.  Think SQL - the friendliness is
relative.

No - I would not support that as it mixes two orthogonal issues, Ql syntax
and results syntax.  We could have a result format that is human-friendly,
we could choose not to.  Personally, I don't see a human friendly syntax as
being needed - see my reply to your message "Building a bridge from RDF to
the web?" - there isn't just one such format and it is in the domainof other
systems (e.g. XSLT, XQuery).

From looking at the requirements we have so far, the result formats I see as
necessary are variable bindings (a streaming format and possibly RDF format)
and an RDF extracted subgraph. Ther may be othgers (e.g. squnce of matching
subgraphs).   There isn't a single format that can meet all the
requirements.

That the expected user of the query language is a person, an application
writer.  It is not exclusively machine generated queries.

Note that having an human-friendly syntax does not automatically preclude
other synatxes.  An RDF one would be good but proper handling of variables
while retaining the full RDF semantics is going to be hard.

You might be interested in this tech report by Ian Dickinson on implementing
to the DIG 1.1 specification:
