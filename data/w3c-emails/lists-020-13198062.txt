Variable bindings certainly seem to be a good place to start in order
for the client to be able to avoid posing the query twice - once to
the RDF store and once to the identified sub-graph (and possible using
a different kind of query interface altogether!)

So, can you outline for me how you see that variable bindings exposed
by a DAWG protocol could be exploited by an XML Stylesheet so as to
generate, e.g., an XHTML document?

If that bridge is a way to extract information from RDF models and get
it
into both XHTML (for people) and XML (for people and for web services),
then
I agree with you.  There isn't going to be one such form for presenting
information extracted from RDF so tools such as XSLT and XQuery seem to
be
the toolsets to use.

There has been some work on this: Rob outlined the use of XQuery and OWL
data, and it reminded me of Jonathan Robie's presentation [1] at Cannes
this
year.  The important aspect here is that access is to the abstract
graph,
not the RDF/XML syntax.

Elsewhere, Howard talked about using paths to access the graph and
Treehugger [2] does this by dymanically materialising an XML document
from
the RDF abstract graph.

This is getting stuff out of RDF.  The requirement it places on the WG,
as I
see it, is to produce a format for variable bindings that is easily
digestable by other systems.  That does not automatically mean an XML
format
because it is the output of XQuery functions but an XML format would
work
(it can be made streamable which RDF isn't).

I have also seem people do queries in JSP taglibs to produce HTML and
also
using Velocity to create XHTML from RDF - a standard library to do the
variable bindings to Velocity

IIRC the "Templates" discussion was slightly different.  Its about
constructing new RDF from information pulled from existing RDF.  See the
SeRQL 'construct' [3] operation or "cwm --filter".
