Document is looking very good. Congratulations.

Minor editorial comments follows:

-Section 2.1: Motivates hyper link not resolved

-Section 2.2: User-specifiable Serialization not resolved

Comments on Variants

Prefer 3.4 over 3.4a

-Prefer 4.6a to 4.6 b

-3.6 Optional Match. Neither wording is clear enough for me to 
understand the intent.

-Prefer 3.10a over 3.10. This is not just difference in wording but 
difference in underlying requirements.

-Prefer 4.6a over 4.6b. Is the intent that other semantic languages are 
an RDF dialect? If so we should say it explicitly. If not, then I 
question why it is a requirement for DAWG.

Thanks again for the good work.
