Good morning, Kendall,

Thanks for your consideration to my comments.

Yes. But Matsui is preferred?

Well, ... if the user is intrested in the baseball player Ichiro, the
recorder should
record every sports news featuring baseball.
 (making it to those featuring the team Ichiro belongs would be better, but
I don't know the team name ;)

EPGs may not describe wheter Ichiro is featured or not, 'cause they are
broadcast BEFORE the game.
So it would be safer to record all the sports news once, and check the
description (meta data)
boradcast with the programme to see if Ichiro is really featurede in the
programme or not.

I don't have a car navigation system, but car navigation systems these days
have function to communicate
through the internet. So it is no blue-sky, I think.
# Is it only in Japan?
