Concrete detail is good (well, "fun" at least). I'll make some change here.

In my experience, most nav systems in US cars *don't* have 'net
connections. They typically store all their map data on a set of DVDs
(8gb or so, total), often in the trunk. They have GPS, of course, but
not 'net, AFAIK.

But an Acura model will soon have that for US market. Definitely not
blue-sky.
