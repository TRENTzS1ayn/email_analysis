Isn't this design objective a cursor mechanism as it says "fetching in
chunks" and cursors are out of scope by 2.3 of the charter?

The result limits (3.10) is a more useful requirement in that it allows a
client to limit the results size in case of asking for too much.  This is
different from fetching in chunks.

I think we should rely on the mechanisms that the underlying protocol can
supply even though these can be difficult to control.  e.g. TCP flow
control.  Writing server code that tracks the state of partial client
request can be every limiting; mis-behaving clients can intentional or
unintentionally attack the server.
