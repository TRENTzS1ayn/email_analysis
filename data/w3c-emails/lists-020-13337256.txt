I'm not going to make these changes; the paragraphs in question are
far more readable w/out them, IMO.

Fixed this.

Well, as you know, requirements and design objectives doesn't merely
indicate the diff between mandatory and optional; it also indicates,
at least to us,  the diff between those things that have gotten a lot
of support versus those things that have gotten less support.

While there may be a change here worth making along the lines you
suggest, I think this is too big a change to make at this relatively
late date. Let's revisit this again for the next draft?

Hmm... Not entirely sure what to do here...

I didn't add anything after the vote. The problem is that we voted on
this one *with* the phrase you want to strike, and I can't be sure
that whether that phrase helped someone accept this requirement. I'll
work on a variant and we can see if there is consensus for it.

But I'm unhappy with this in some sense because it weakens the
document. This is an *approved* requirement -- having a variant of it
is not very healthy, IMO.

IIRC, there are only variants of PENDING items, not of ACCEPTED ones.

I'd prefer not to renumber at this point.

Ooh, good.

Hmm, that's interesting... I'll add as a variant.

Propose some language.

Yes, I edited it per editor's prerogative, and since I proposed it to
begin with. I meant "user-specifiable" as a weak form, which would
cover content-negotiation, for example, as an implementation tact.

This points up an ambiguity in MIME/IMT, and I'm not sure I want the
proposal to take a position on this... I'll think about it some more
and I'd like to hear from others about it.

Please send URLs for these. I think XForms is already there; and what
is "XML Stylesheets"?

Hmm, even as HTML comment?  I would have sworn no one had looked at
this, even once! :>

Thanks!
