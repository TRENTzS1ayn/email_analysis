Looks good.

http://www.joseki.org/query-languages.html describes the query languages in
the distribution.  "fetch" which provides a "describe" or "tell me about"
query.  It takes a resource as argument (alternatively, it takes a
property/object pair to find the subject or subjects).  It returns some RDF
depending on server and setup.  Typically the bNode closure from that
resource as subject; it it were FOAF, then the closure might be to resources
of type foaf:Person + the defining foaf:mbox property.

The URI for "fetch" is http://jena.hpl.hp.com/2003/07/query/fetch
(Yes - you can do a GET on that; its not interesting.)

And Joseki only provides HTTP.

All results from a request are RDF graphs - you can ask the RDQL processor
for the result set in RDF form using the vocabulary:

http://www.w3.org/2003/03/rdfqr-tests/recording-query-results.html

This is not the default mode of operation, that is the subgraph match, and
you have to supply an additional parameter to the request ("format=BV")

But note that as the results are graphs, you can't stream process the
results.  There is no guarantee as to the serialization ordering even for
the result set in RDF.

An RDQL query to Jena using jrv:directSubClassOf or jrv:directSubPropertyOf.
jrv is the Jena Reasoner Vocabulary.

It's a feature of the QL, not the protocol although it could be a feature of
which graph you ask.
