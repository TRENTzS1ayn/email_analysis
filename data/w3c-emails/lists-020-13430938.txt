Kendall learned the hard way that our cvs service went
down earlier this week.

We have a mechanism to notify collaborators in cases like
this; for example, notices were sent

  Sun, 23 May 2004 11:00:56 -0400
  Mon, 24 May 2004 09:16:21 -0400

Subscription instructions and an archive are cited from
the guidebook:

  "Keep up to date using the system-notices list"
  -- http://www.w3.org/Guide/#Tools

I just added a pointer to the guidebook from
the bottom of our WG page:

"See also:

      * W3C Process Document
      * The Art of Consensus: A Guidebook for W3C Working Group Chairs
        and other Collaborators"
