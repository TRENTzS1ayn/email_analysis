Agreed and just te be sure, also tested, but then
using a query in the form of
        ?x rdf:type :c2.
or in the form of
        {?x rdf:type :c2} => {?x rdf:type :c2}.
to get the graph returned as
        :a a :c2.

It's indeed more straightforward to just return
RDF graphs (even for bindings e.g. expressed as
        (:a) a :Result.
but that still seems rather meaningless to me
at least without having the query at hand...)
