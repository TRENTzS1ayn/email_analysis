Howdy, I'm going to be replacing Daniel Krech as the MINDLab DAWG 
alternate (we'd love to have three MIND folks on, but the charter 
doesn't allow that).  I'll be using the coming week to catch up on 
where things stand, and hope to join in soon after, I have read the 
current requirements document, and will talk with Kendall (who is the 
principal for our lab) to make sure I understand it before I jump 
into too many controversies.

My full bio, CV and lots of other background can be found on my HTML 
web page [1] (or see my nwer web page which is dynamically-generated 
from an RDF  store [2]).  Most relevant to the DAWG is that I have 
been involved in Sem Web for a pretty long time, sit on the Sem Web 
Coordination Group at W3C, chair(ed) the Web Ontology Working Group, 
and have been working w/URI-based web languages for a long time 
(predating the MCF effort at W3C, in fact).

My group is very interested in what we are calling "Semantic Web 
Application Portals" - end to end portal technology built completely 
on top of the Sem Web languages.  Currently we have several sites 
that are all using the same underlying RDF software for different 
domains [3,4,5], with several more on the way.  We believe that being 
able to have queries which support sites like these, which allows 
them to be linked together, to be built on much larger (distributed) 
RDF graphs, and which allow them to link to other portal technologies 
are important uses of RDF, and we want to be sure such things are 
supported by the DAWG's eventual recommendation
