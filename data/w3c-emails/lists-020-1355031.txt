Personal response: 

I may have misunderstood the intent behind the specification of
xml:lang, but my reading of it is that subcodes after the first can be
anything you like, so long as it is alphabetic: for example, they can be
used for variants.

I'm reluctant to fall out of line with the XML specification here.

I'm also rather dubious of having too many of these mechanisms where we
specify the syntax but say nothing about the semantics. Does it really
improve interoperability?
