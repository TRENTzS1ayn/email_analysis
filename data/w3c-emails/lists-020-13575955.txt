Dan,

I think that joseki is just a poor choice for this evaluation.  It is
essentially a protocol, which I didn't realize when I offered to write
it up.  In order to match joskeki against query language requirements
 you need to write up the query language.

My suggestion is that we refactor our requirements into protocol
and query-language requirementsw and that we evaluate them seperately.
We can then pick and choose combinations as candidates for DAWG.

Just writing up, e.g., joseki + RDQL, is going to hide the fact that
we could have just as easily bundled a completely different query
language with the joseki protocol.

Maybe we can put this on the agenda for today?

Again, could you please pick one design (including query language)
and answer 'yes' or 'no' for this requirement and the others?

If you want to evaluate multiple designs (e.g. joseki with
QL 1, joseki with QL 2, ...), very well; tell
us 'yes' or 'no' for each one; but evaluations of partial
designs like this don't help as much, I don't think.
