Also a result format in N3 or RDF/XML could do this using thier prefix
mechanisms. There is a downside however, if the server is expected to
strip out the namespaces for the URIs then it must store the result set
internally and post process it to ensure that its got all the namespaces
before it starts to send the results (as the namespaces aredeclared at the
top). This increses latency.

The situation where the namespaces are declared after the results is not
much better as the client cant interpret them untill its parsed all the
namespace decls anyway.
