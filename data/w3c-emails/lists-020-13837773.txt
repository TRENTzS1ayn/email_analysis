Annotea uses that feature of Algae2. Algae2, however, no longer uses a
fourth slot for provenance, as I was then tempted to have a 5th and
6th slot for object's data type and language. Instead, key words for
concepts like provenance, literal data type and literal language were
introduced to the constraints.  The syntax is (simplified a bit -- see
[4], [5], [6] for actual grammar):

  decl ::= triple ( '{' expr '}' ) *
  expr ::= ... | internalName '==' expr | ...
  internalName: '%' [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*

I mention this 'cause I think that provenance is only one of several
facets of a triple we currently know we care about. (We may we
discover that we care about still more facets when we deal with
XMLLiterals.) Thus, I caution the working group away from using
positions to designate them.

In a large-ish query:

  ns rdf=<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
  ns a=<http://www.w3.org/2000/10/annotation-ns#>
  ns http=<http://www.w3.org/1999/xx/http#>
  ns dc0=<http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/>
  ns dc1=<http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>
  ask  (<http://foo> rdf:type         a:Annotation {%PROV == <http://bar>}.
        <http://foo> a:annotates      ?annotates.
        ( <http://foo> dc0:creator      ?creator ||
          <http://foo> dc1:creator      ?creator )
        ( <http://foo> dc0:date         ?date || 
          <http://foo> dc1:date         ?date )
        <http://foo> a:body           ?body {%PROV == <http://bar>}.
        ?body        http:Body        ?bodyData.
       )
  collect (?annotation ?body)

It's pretty easy to pick out %PROV, %DATATYPE, %LANG, %ENCODING...
See [7] for an example that uses %LANG and %ENCODING.
