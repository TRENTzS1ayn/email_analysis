Slight IT problems with finding somewhere I can put up a web page for
the f2f meeting; this should be remedied within the next couple of days.

In the meantime:

The Data Access Working Group's second face to face meeting will take
place on the 14th and 15th of July, 2004, in Carlsbad, California. The
venue has not been finalized, but will be near to the Network Inference
office at 5900 Laplace Court:

ry=&searchtab=address&searchtype=address&address=5900+La+Place+Court&cit
y=Carlsbad&state=CA&zipcode=92008&search=++Search++

The expected schedule is from 9AM to 5PM on both days. All DAWG members
are invited to a dinner hosted by Network Inference on the evening of
the 14th (venue to be determined).

The primary contact for logistics will be Rob Shearer, however the
Network Inference office maven Lyndi Sinclair should be available if Rob
is dead or otherwise unavailable:
