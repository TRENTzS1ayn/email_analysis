woohoo!

Hmm... the summary extracted by the W3C Comm team and
hence read by a bzillion homepage visitors is:

"The document outlines use cases for RDF query languages and access
protocols and their requirements, and examines design objectives."

which is true but not very exciting. I would have liked
to see the words "product metadata" and "publishing"
or "syndication" and "photos" bubble up into the widely-read
summary. Let's help them out next time by working them
into the abstract, ok, Kendall?
