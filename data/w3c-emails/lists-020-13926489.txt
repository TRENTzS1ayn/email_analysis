I wondered about this; but couldn't decide if that was *really*
satisfying the requirement. I'm glad to have the record corrected, but
I'm not sure I really understand this just yet.

Can you say more about this, Simon? One uses a subquery as part of a
search which may fail to match?

I guess I should have been more clean; "alias" didn't seem to be part
of the query language per se. It has the same effect -- and I like
this design idea; it reminds me of the Haskell prologue -- but for
small devices, say, it's not as helpful as USING, IMO.

Yeah, that was one part of the syntax which is not so human-friendly,
for met at least.

Fair enough. :>

Thanks for correcting my mistakes!

Best,
