doubt we can afford much time for this item this week,
but I don't want to drop it.


p.s. This agenda is a few hours late. If that inconveniences
anybody, please do let me know. I have about 1 hour between
the start of my workday and when the agenda is due, and half
of it is taken by a meeting. I could try to do agendas
on Fridays, but that's harder.
