I believe the description of collations in the Functions and Operators
specification makes it clear that a collation, as identified by a URI,
is fully defined: that is, once you have specified a collation, you have
specified all possible tailoring, and you don't need to specify any
further parameters. 

From F+O 7.3.1:

"Some collations, especially those based on the [Unicode Collation
Algorithm] can be "tailored" for various purposes. This document does
not discuss such tailoring, nor does it provide a mechanism to perform
tailoring. Instead, it assumes that the collation argument to the
various functions below is a tailored and named collation. "

So you are right, but I think the assumption is explicit rather than
implicit.

We did at one stage have an essay on collations in the XSLT spec, but we
took it out in favour of linking to the similar essay in the F+O
specification.

Do you think we need to do any more, or can we close this with no
action?
