It seems to me that the underlying requirement is to be able to ask cyc: for
what it knows about this class.  It is a general, open question "tell me
about cyc:cat" or possibly "tell me about cyc:cat because I want to process
it" (that is, setting some context to the query).  The significant point is
that the client can't know exactly the graph pattern.  Here, there may be
several restrictions for the class.

We had queries of this kind in early email: it's a data oriented task but I
think has this similar characteristic of being an open "tell me about"
question.

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0022.html

where the query is "tell me about" addressed to different KBs, resulting in
different information.  In each case, the query is an open question to the
KB and the requestor is then going to look at the graph returned (it has to
be a graph - not variable bindings).

Jim - have I understood you correctly?

This has got a bit lost in the document IMHO.  The nearest I can see is the
2.2 "Finding Information about Motorcycle Parts (Supply Chain Management)"
where the query gets back "Accelerator Cable" depends-on "Mounting Bracket"
and requires some screws.  This isn't an exact graph pattern match - it's a
"tell me about "Accelerator Cable" which also yields other stuff that the
server has been configured to return.

This "tell me about" query does not get reflected into the requirements
except weakly in 3.4 (Subgraph Results).  I see it as important though for
semantic web applications which want to do some further processing, here
process classes and properties, or wish to aggregate information from
different places and pass the assembled RDF graph to some other system.

(Aside: the text says "fuel management system" but the example is
"Accelerator Cable MK3" and "Mounting Bracket").

I don't see the relationship to 3.7 (Limited Datatype Support) but I do see
the relationship to 3.6 (Optional Match).
