Andy-
  I think you missed the intent of my message - I tried to be  clear 
that I was NOT talking about an open ended query -- I would not be 
going to CYC and saying tell me what you know about cats, I would be 
going to a graph and querying forthe bindings for a query something 
like this (I leave it in RDF/XML form for readability, but the quesry 
would be for those subgraphs of triples that match this


  <owl:class rdf:resource=":cat">
   <?CLASSTYPE>
     <owl:Restriction>
       <owl:onProperty ?PROP/>
       <?OWL ?REST>
     </owl:Restriction>
   </rdfs:subClassOf>
  </owl:class>

i.e. I don't say "tell me about cats" - I say
   Query the CYC graph for the pattern in which cat has a CLASSTYPE 
(subclassof or equivalentClass)
of a restriction class and return to me the names of what PROPerties 
the restriction is on, what OWLterm the restriction uses (AllValues, 
SomeValues, etc.) and what the RESTriction is.
   In practice I might do something different than this (perhaps 
multiple queries for specific combinations as I needed them), but in 
every case I am asking for specific properties of specific entities 
from an RDF graph - in my opinion, this capability is why I devoted 
so much of my past few years to making OWL an RDF language -- if I 
just wanted to query documents, I would have agreed that an XML 
syntax was sufficient -- but for linking and processing OWL, I want 
to use the URIs and the graph

  As far as 3.6 v. 3.7 goes, I was thinking of 3.7 for a couple of reasons:
  first, when cardinality is used the syntax of the query has to be 
able to handle the fact that the cardinalities are expressed using 
xsd:nonNegativeIntegers, and also some of the restrictions in OWL for 
datatype properties would include being able to query for the 
datatype -- maybe I was misinterpreting what 3.7 was intended for.
  As far as 3.6 goes, I guess I could use optional features in the 
above, I was thinking of multiple queries myself, but could go either 
way ...

  Hope that helps make things clearer -- if you want me to work out 
the informal example above as the actual triples, I'd be happy to, 
just didn't have the time so far.
