I was assuming it was one query in which case the query does not know what
the nature (exact graph shape_ of the restriction.  I read the intention as
"get the restriction whatever it is".  Then, a request to get the
restriction has more than a fixed request because (example) there may be an
RDF list in there.  A query of "get me the restriction for <expression>" has
the feature of the subgraph return that the exact shape of the graph is not
entirely in the

So the restriction returned is that subgraph.  Am I still missing the point
here?

If you are prepared to make several queries, walking the graph and building
up the query each time then it is doable.  I prefer the "get the subgraph
from this point" style which alos makes getting collections clear.

I hope we can make this one query - having several small requests has
impacts on servers as well as issues of inconsistency in the presence of
updates (not bad in this case but in general the matter exists).

My mistake.  I was thinking about 3.7 => supporting things like "?age < 43"
