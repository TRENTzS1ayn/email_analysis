As I said in the telecon today, I suppose that I (eek!) introduced
this troublesome clause. I don't remember where it came from, and I
don't remember why I would have introduced it. But it is troublesome,
as you point out, and suggests something very different from (and much
harder than) what we wanted to set down as a requirement.

It'll be stricken from the next draft of UC&R.
