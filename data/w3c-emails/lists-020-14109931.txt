I think we clearly need to find some common ground, because I object to
4.6a and am fine with 4.6

I understand both of your objections, but to be honest they are the main
*reasons* I think this objective is desirable. I think it's important to
point out that even though there are ways to encode knowledge about RDF
graphs that have not yet been standardized, we strive to produce a query
language in which *any* extra knowledge which describes RDF graphs can
play a role. SWRL is the best example I know of; if adding one or two
others (remember, these are just examples, not an exhaustive list)
alleviates your concern that we're explicitly endorsing SWRL, then maybe
that's a solution.

I'm also interested in your "confusing rule processing with other kinds
of inferencing" statement. So is rule processing a kind of inferencing?
How do you see it as fundamentally different from other kinds of
inferencing? I'm not sure whether we're coming back to the "inferencing
is nothing more than adding triples" argument, but if so it is quite
clear that even OWL takes you beyond this: there is no canonical set of
triples which represents all consequences of an OWL ontology within RDF
using RDF semantics.

I very much intended this objective to be vague and non-required of
implementations, keeping in mind that most "inferencing" systems are not
based on sound and complete reasoning algorithms. Further, the actual
details of such reasoning (and even the format of knowledge encoded
beyond bare RDF triples) are explicitly beyond the scope of this group.
Any SHOULD would be burdening simple RDF processors with the requirement
to process all the other semantic languages in the universe. The
objective is that systems with more robust reasoning capabilities
available should be able to use them to assist in answering queries
about the RDF graph(s) they describe. If you feel that we need to be
more specific in terms of soundness versus completeness in order to
enforce monotonicity of query results, then we should talk about an
appropriate wording. My opinion is that it's more detail than anything
else in this document addresses, so it's not really necessary at this
stage.
