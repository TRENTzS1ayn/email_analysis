ACTION Kendall to dispose of "3.3a Extensible Value Testing" variant


> -- 3.4 Subgraph Results
> ACTION: RobS will email to the group a proposed change to cover this.
> (that 3.4 doesn't cover queries with disjunctions. re 3.4)

Yoshio: what if the original queried graph is a "merged" graph? 
DanC: want that people think up further for one week (only 2 prepared to 
vote)
AndyS: want to leave the ability to answer queries with optional arcs.
JimH: with some queries, you don't know what type you'll get back?
Alberto: +1 for optional arcs
RobS speaking against 3.4a
Yoshio: don't see the reason why we should restrict the answer to 
"subgraph"s

ACTION EricP send an example to the list (as a test case)
ACTION RobS to tweak it that it doesn't work ??


> -- 3.5 Local Queries
> 
> ACTION: BryanT to draft possible new requirement on independence of
> protocol and query language.

BryanT's action continued

 
> -- 3.6 Optional Match
> 
> It has been mentioned in several evaluations.
> straw poll: who is convinced this is a requirement?
> do we have consensus?

RobS: doesn't think that there is enough justification for such a 
requirement
Simon: pretty in defense of this requirement
Kendall: anyone want to drop the optional match variant?
AndyS: this is the #1 request I get for additional features
Yoshio: +1
JimH: in favor of keeping optionals in
  some conditional being done as an optional: we're doing lots of extra
  queries that i think we can do more easily with a single query with 
optionals
RobS: i'm not sure that i'm at abstaining vs. objecting
Simon: i can provide two defs:
  SQL outer joins + something products withing products
DanC: ignore the results if the first one fails, but how long
  will it take to get the details worked out, 2..3 months?
Howard: is optional the same as conditional? there is a conditional in 
XQuery
PatH: from "not being possible" to "extremely desirable"
DanC: that's an objective
Kendall: re eric's survey of impls, we have to think about the politics
  if we tell folks to switch to dawg-ql, and it doesn't have optionals,
  it's a harder sell.
DanC considers moving it to an objective
AndyS: let's finish the requirements discussion
  many of the proposed options seem to push us towards a style of ql,
  ala relational vs. graph; other reqs don't do that

ACTION Simon draft 2 design proposals


> -- 3.8 Bookmarkable Queries
> 
> not sure we're close to a decision here; intend to focus on other
> items this week.

RobS: would rather have a requirement that a query should be expressed as 
text
AndyS: 'GET'able via HTTP
RobS: someone speak in favour of this?
DanC: our mission is to promote interoperability. would consider my time 
well
  spent to get this done
RobS: this is talking about the protocol
AndyS: we could say a "bookmarable query request"

ACTION DanC: rephrase 3.8 with reference to protocol


> -- 3.9 Bandwidth-efficient Protocol
> ACTION: SteveH to write his experiences on bandwidth efficiency for
> querying and email to group.

appeals to about 5 people; 6 or 7, maybe
Simon: bandwidth-efficient protocol is hard to measure
DanC: +1
RobS: it's more like a "let's keep in mind" (which is an objective)
Steve: it is quantifiable
DanC: does anybody have customers with this requirement?
Simon: we have features that won't work without efficiency
  could support latancy as a requirement and bandwidth as an
  objective: "the format in which" must not preclude serialization
DanC: people have argued that it is not testable
Simon: we can test streamability
AndyS: that would me you could process the first result before ...

several in favor of moving 3.9 to an objective
vote: no objections; no abstentions

RESOLVED to adopt 3.9 as an objective

ACTION AndyS to email text for a requirement on streamable results 


> -- 3.10 Result Limits
> 
> straw poll: who's convinced this is a requirements? are we close
> to a decision here?

AndyS: RDQL does not have a limit. Joseki provides limits.
PatH: it could mean 2 things: I don't want more than 10 answers
  and the next ones after that or *just* 10
AndyS: seen this to prevent error conditions
EricP: SQL has it
RobS: there are other things in SQL that we don't have
Steve: can affect latency
AndyS: can be either a query or a protocol issue
EricP: arguing from the point of view of a straightforward implementation
  (for both client and server)
Yoshio: but then we need a way to specify the snapshot of the database
RobS: what is understood as a "result"
Kevin: do we want an exact upper bound? could cause more impl burden on 
the server
DanC: does "upper bound" appeal to somebody?
Kevin: yes
FarrukhNajmi: +1
PatH: DQL could, by request, give a count of results
DanC: motivation to spend time on this is in discussing/bounderaries with 
other groups
