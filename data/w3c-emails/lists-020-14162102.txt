There's now a page with venue information:
http://www.networkinference.com/w3c/dawg/venue.html

There's also a front page for the meeting:
http://www.networkinference.com/w3c/dawg/dawgf2f.html
I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to be hosting/maintaing that page or
whether it should be on the W3C site. The agenda and the like are really
no more my business than any other member's.
