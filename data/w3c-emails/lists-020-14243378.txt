I'm afraid I don't understand what you're trying to demonstrate. Clearly
encoding the answer within the query doesn't really show anything; in
this case you're not really using RDF for answering the query at all.

Perhaps you could explain your intent more clearly. What is the
"knowledgebase" in the first place, what bits of it are RDF and what
bits are "additional semantic information", what is the human-language
query you want to answer, and what is your approach for answering that
query?
