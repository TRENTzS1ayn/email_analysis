It's getting late here, but I'll dump my case
I've done a test with the given kb
  :a :b :c.
  :d :e :f.

and a test with the given kb
  :a :b :c.

and a test with the given kb.
  :d :e :f.

and a test with the given kb which is empty

That are all RDF graphs.

The query is implemented with the --filter
option of cwm and euler, which is an RDF formula
  {:a :b :c} => {:yes :for <>}.
  {:d :e :f} => {:yes :for <>}.
but haven't yet thought about other designs...

The answer is definitely an RDF graph like
  :yes     :for <testC.n3> .
(where testC.n3 is actually that filter file)
or the empty graph for the fourth test.

I fail to see the harm in doing
"encoding the answer within the query"...
Isn't "select ... where ..." an encoding?

I'm afraid I don't understand what you're trying to demonstrate. Clearly
encoding the answer within the query doesn't really show anything; in
this case you're not really using RDF for answering the query at all.

Perhaps you could explain your intent more clearly. What is the
"knowledgebase" in the first place, what bits of it are RDF and what
bits are "additional semantic information", what is the human-language
query you want to answer, and what is your approach for answering that
query?
