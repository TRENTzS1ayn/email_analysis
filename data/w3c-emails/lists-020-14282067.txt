Maybe I didn't understand what 4.6 was about, I assumed it was 
something like this:

if I have
   a rdfs:subClassOf b
   b rdfs:subClassOf c

then I was assuming that the requirments in UC&R would imply that if 
I query for
   a rdfs:subClassOf ?x
then ?x would be bound to b
however, if we include 4.6, then we would be expected to return
   ?x = b and ?x = c

if I'm misunderstanding, please let know.
