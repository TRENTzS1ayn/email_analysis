I mean that I reject Rob's warrant for his claim.

He says that, in order to avoid doing a query language for *every*
layer of the layer cake above XML, we have to make an RDF query
language in which "*any* extra knowledge which describes RDF graphs
can play a role".

So, in addition to begging the question by suggesting we've already
agreed to that, which is precisely what we're trying to decide, he
suggests what seems to me a real case of false dichotomy: either do
*all* "semantic hinting here and now or make a query language for
every layer. Usually people try to avoid starting down the slippery
slope; sorry to be blunt, but in this case it seems like Rob is
rushing headlong toward it.

But maybe that gin and tonic I had at dinner was too big?! :>

Well, please recall that I originally proposed 4.6, so I am inclined
to support some version of it.

Frankly, I'm not as concerned with wordsmithing this objective as
others seem to be; what the requirements or objectives mean,
ultimately, for non-WG implementors will be determined in the context
of *all* of our other documents, which will include lots and lots of
stuff about design, as well as some existing implementations.

That being said, I could support your variant, given that it makes a
principled distinction between RDFS/OWL and SWRL/N3.

Best,
