Rob,

I now understand the matter better - the "they are connected but by unknown
means" is a strong argument.  I agree with removing the text "that the query
matches" that was in the document.

I think we should avoid "explanation" but I didn't think that was the
intention anyway.  Things I think are important are:

1/ that queries can be considered to execute by RDF graph pattern matching.

This is a building block requirement: it helps with the charter item "2.2
RDF Rules".

2/ one return format where part of the larger queried graph is returned.

This is two things: the need for a "tell me about <thing described by
pattern or just URI>" query and the ability to get results as RDF graphs
which are part of the information in the large, remote knowledge base.

The current text is acceptable to me.  The variant is more explicit about
the derived information.

"""
3.4 Subgraph Results
It must be possible for query results to be returned as a subgraph of the
original queried graph.

Status: Pending.

3.4a Subgraph Results (variant)
It must be possible to select an entailed subgraph of a queried graph, in
which case the query results are an RDF graph.
"""

(it removes the "that the query matched" part which I agree is unhelpful).

??

As it asked for "find everyone" it is a variable bindings results with
projection to one variable:

SELECT ?x WHERE (?x friend (:Eddie OR :Jane))

(or other flavour of query with explicit union)

I don't view this requirement as having anything to do with explanation so I
wouldn't approach it as a subgraph query.

But if the query is (Eddie friend ?x) then "Eddie friend Jane" is a
returnable triple.  Its not explanation but derived facts.

This is the argument that, for me, hits the spot.  This is problematic
without bArcs and there may well be worse cases as well where bArcs aren't
enough.

Example query:
<x> ?p <y>

and we can know they are not how (we can't instantiate ?p to an RDF graph
arc let alone a URIref).

If the query is "are <x> and <y> related?" the answer is "yes"
If the query is "how are <x> and <y> related?" the answer is "unknown"
