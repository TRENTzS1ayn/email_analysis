I don't read Dan's wording like this.  In partcular, you talk about "all
knowledge about an RDF graph".  

Assuming by "about" you mean "contained" ("about" suggest stuff like who
authored it, when it was last changed etc - external assertions aboiut the
graph as well), then I don't see why the wording implies "all knowledge",
rather then some additional knowledge.

Some extra knowledge, but not all possible knowledge, would meet the
wording.  Such "virtual graphs" don't have to be everything an inference
system can derive - they are access to some of the extra information.
