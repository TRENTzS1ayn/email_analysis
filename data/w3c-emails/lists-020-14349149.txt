It occurred to me that one way of differentiating between exactly 10 and
more than 10 (and an unknown number) when we have "LIMIT 10" is to ask for
11.  If 11 results return up, it is more than 10.  Otherwise, it is exact
and 10 or less.  This is making the (trailing) flag we discussed a matter of
whether the 11th slot gets filled at all.

Hence, no requirement for a special flag and the client can decide whether
to ask for 11 if it needes to know the difference.  It still might be a
better design overall to have a flag.
