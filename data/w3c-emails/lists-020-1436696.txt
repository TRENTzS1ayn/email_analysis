XQuery section 4.11 states:

If a variable declaration contains neither a type nor an expression, the
type and value of the variable must both be provided by the external
environment at evaluation time. The static type of such a variable is
considered to be xs:anyType.

I think that "xs:anyType" should read "item()*"
