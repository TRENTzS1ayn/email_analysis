Could this not be generalised to just talk about results (or result
sequences, or result sets)?  This would cover returning multiple
graphs IF that was decided as a result format.

Let me try a rewrite:

3.? Streamable Results

When returning multiple results there must be a form of the protocol
that allows streaming of results.  In this form, the results must be
returned to the client so that all the data in one result are
available before all the data for the next result.

Optional addition:
This does not require an ordering of results but that each result
is available one at a time.
