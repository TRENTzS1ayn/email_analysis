Is there anything on the Web about REX so that some of us could
consider your evaluation critically? It's hard -- well, impossible,
really -- to know what to make of this w/out independent access to the
details.

Some questions:

Is this because "provenance" is overloaded or for other reasons?

I don't understand this; can you say more about it?

Well first, can I use REX to query multiple graphs in one query? If
yes, what are the semantics of that query? If you can't query multiple
graphs in one query, then I think it's not supported, right?
