Andy - referring to two of your messages at the same time (this one 
and the one on streamable results) I wonder if both of these are 
needed -- a lot of query systems I've played for have protocols which 
work by returning the number of answers and the first one, and then 
have a mechanism for requesting the next N -  if we were to design 
that as the streamable interface, would there still be a need for 
3.10?
   -JH
  (note: in practice there is often something that keeps the system 
from having to actually count the results when there is a large 
number - usually just some flag that says "*many"" when the number is 
greater than some parameter -- that could either be in the design or 
could just be how people really implement for efficiency)
