Rob - I've been suspecting you and I have been misunderstanding one 
another on this, now I'm sure of it.  Not quite sure where we're off, 
so let me ask two questions
   1 -  in your opinion, what does objective 4.6 add -- that is, if we 
accomplished this objective what would be in the language that isn't 
there in the design that doesn't include it?  Are you implying below 
that if we don't reach the objective it will be "wrong" for a query 
of an RDFS store to return the ?x = c answer below?
  2 - .  The UC&R doesn't have any use case that seems to really 
motivate disjunctive queries and the charter says that the 
expressivity (using disjunct as an example) will be determined by use 
cases.  In my experience most query languages don't actually handle 
disjunctive queries very well (SQL, for example, only allows the OR 
in the conditional of a return, which is a very limited kind of OR). 
I think the reason for this is that a lot of the complex border cases 
seem to arise around disjunctive queries (as in the case below) - so 
my question is really whether you see this as a trade-off, or if you 
take it as a given that a good DA rec would include" (a R b) OR (c S 
d)" and thus worry about a lot of these complex cases?
  thanks
  JH
p.s. if either of the above sound hostile or argumentative, please 
don't take them that way -- I haven't been privy to the discussions 
of the group to date, and am trying to catch up - I'm trying to read 
the message log, but there's too much to simply read end to end, so 
i'm trying to catch up on the most relevant threads, and thus may 
have missed things where the above were discussed.
