I like the objective, I just want to get it stated clearly -- I can 
imagine an "extension" mechanism for doing this and, once again 
citing the charter, I see we are expected to take this into account 
(i.e. section 1.6 reads:
"Many items ruled out of scope by this charter require an 
extensibility mechanism for later implementation. This mechanism must 
allow for arbitrary combinations of orthogonal extensions."

So I think we actually have a mini-consensus (i.e. you and me) 
reached that we like the intent of this clause (your vague goal), but 
think we need to reword it -- let's work on that and see if we can 
make it clearer.  I do think it very important we refer to RDFS and 
OWL in this document (I'm much less convinced about SWRL, but we can 
argue that elsewhere) -- that's because those Recs do layer on RDF 
and IMO it is important we make it clear that this WG has considered 
those uses as well.

p.s. sorry to keep quoting the charter all the time, but as a former 
WG chair it was beaten into me by my team contact and is now a bad 
habit :->
