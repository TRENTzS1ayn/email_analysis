FWIW, I was just thinking this today! Along the lines, "don't we need
disjunction as an explicit requirement?" I don't know how or why
disjunction use cases fell out of the doc; maybe this is one of those
many mistakes I've made, but if so, it was totally unwitting.

In other words, I think that disjunction should be an explicit
requirement about disjunction, and I would be happy to help someone
craft a use case that motivates it.

I don't think that's the case at all -- rather, I think that
disjunction just fell off the map. Let's get it back on.
