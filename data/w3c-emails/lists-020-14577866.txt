I think we're using "RDF" to refer to different things here.
I recognize that provenance can be very useful in many RDF applications,
but I don't see provenence within the RDF spec. If it is actually
realized as triples (and there are ways to do that with provenance
information), then it's RDF, but if it's meta-information sitting
outside the RDF data model then I think it's somewhat out of scope.

I'm glad we've finally gotten down the list to talk about some of these
objectives that have never really been addressed.
