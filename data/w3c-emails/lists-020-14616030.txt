What does "externally stored" mean? Per the conversation about 4.4 on
the list lately, you can't identify RDF serialization formats by
Internet Media Type. The obvious alternative is to identify them via
URI.

But there's no "external storage" -- though, frankly, I have no idea
what you mean by that.
