I don't think we're supposed to be addressing this case, and thusly,
it shouldn't constrain our requirements.

It's been a couple weeks since I quoted this so here goes:

http://www.w3.org/2003/12/swa/dawg-charter#scope
[[
The principal task of the RDF Data Access Working Group is to gather
requirements and to define an HTTP and/or SOAP-based protocol for
selecting instances of subgraphs from an RDF graph.
]]

and http://www.w3.org/2003/12/swa/dawg-charter#derivedGraphs
[[
The working group must recognize that RDF graphs are often constructed
by aggregation from multiple sources and through logical inference,
and that sometimes the graphs are never materialized. Such graphs may
be arbitrarily large or infinite.
]]

If the data in the KB can be written in RDF and we ask

Q: who is friends with either Eddie or Jane?
KB: Bob is friends with Eddie.
    Sue is friends with Eddie or Jane.

the the KB can say, in whatever ontology is appropriate:

A: BobBob friendsWith Eddie.
   SueSue friendsWith disjunctionA.
disjunctionA leftSide Eddie.
disjunctionA rightSide Jane.

If the data can't be expressed in RDF, isn't that out of scope? chair?
