Why would disjunction be an explicit requirement when so many other things
(like conjunction!) are not?  The UC&R is neither an exhaustive set of
requirements nor a design (well - its exhaustive to Kendall in another
sense!).

As JimH pointed out, other systems introduce disjunction in various careful
ways.  I take from this that we may need to take a similar, careful
approach.  Wording a requirement to allow for this later work would seem to
be make the requirement meaningless and very hard to agree what it actually
means.

For example, if the disjunction is effectively making two independent
queries, then a design could say "its two queries".  Is that then
disjunction?
