Eric-
  I'm not against disjunction, but let me point out that the Algae 
case points out exactly the problem with disjunction -- if I have 
multiple disjunctive clauses then the cross product of all of them 
must be looked at somewhere -- in your case, you only had to do one 
query, but over on the server side your query engine had to run all 
four -- generally the problem w/disjunction is one of the many in 
query language design where you can either have easy query processing 
but the querier may have to do extra work or a more expressive query 
language that allows more powerful queries that are harder to process 
-- one way or the other the piper has to be paid...
  -JH
p.s. FWIW, if I had to commit this minute, I'd propose we use a 
prolog like notion of allowing disjunction in the "where" clause -- 
it's a compromise between the two above, so that objective 4.6 seems 
to make good sense to me
