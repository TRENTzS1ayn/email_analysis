I'm not sure I follow. The Algae server had to recurse down the left
side of the disjunction, and, if it found nothing, down the right side
(it's treated as a shortcut OR, not a union). I think this had roughly
the overhead of introducing half of a new conjunction constraint.

When translated to SQL, I think the server has a similar burden.

I'm not dead-set for disjunction, but want to make sure we make the
decisions for the right reasons. I think that Alberto said that it
would be inefficient to impelement disjuntion in his (very slick)
database. But I'm not sure we want to keep users from haing ineffic-
ient tools at their disposal.

Could you explain this a bit, either privately or on list? I don't
know anything about this. (If it's a pain, feel free to tell me to
read a book.)
