Er... let's please don't do that... that only works if
the friendsWith property knows about leftSide/rightSide.
I've seen RDF data files that assume that
<book> dc:creator [ a rdf:Bag; rdf:_1 :Eric; rdf:_2 :Dan ].
means the same thing as
<book> dc:creator :Eric.
<book> dc:creator :Dan.
but the definition of dc:creator says nothing of the sort.
(I think; if it does, pick a property that doesn't.)

Well, yes, that's what the charter says, as you pointed out...

but presumably the charter says that for good reasons that
(1) motivated the charter writers to put it there
(2) gained support of the AC
(3) gained support of those of us who reviewed the
charter when deciding to participate.

The motivation is clear enough to me. But if a significant
number of WG members want the charter changed, we can look
into that.
