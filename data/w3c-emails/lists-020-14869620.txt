True, I should have spelled it friendList. Which underscores the
point that we don't have a way to say friendsWith A or B.

My issue is this: Rob wants us to include factors that I think you
agree are outside the charter, but when uttering them, does not
mention re-chartering. Dealing non-RDF data has made at least the
wording of the requirements considerably harder. I'm in favor of
not dealing with them now, but if we are, I don't want put this
burden on the working group without the WG and the AC acknowledging
that we are undertaking a new job.

Defining how you query and report a set of triples in a database
must be much easier than defining how you query and report facts
which may have triple implications given sufficient other triple
and non-triple facts.

Perhaps the non-RDF query services can use DAWG-QL's tuple binding
syntax but not the graph reporting.
