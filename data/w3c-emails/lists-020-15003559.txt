I wasn't talking about multiple queries over time - although these 
are slow changing documents in the main so it woudln't worry me - I 
meant submitting multiple query patterns for each of the things I 
wish to check for -- thus, if a new foaf implementation wants to know 
if, for example, DNA-Checksum is owl:inverseFunctional or not, that's 
just a single query for a single result -- which is why this use case 
is important, it reminds people that dereferencing RDFS (and OWL) 
relations is basically just an RDF query - which is a major benefit 
of RDFS
