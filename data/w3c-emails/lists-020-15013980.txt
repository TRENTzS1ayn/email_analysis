I added some fields to the (bottom of) f2f registration form [1]:
  Arrival Airport
  Arrival Time
  Hotel
  Departure Time
  Seats Available

The idea is that if you rent a 4 person car to take you from LAX to
the face to face, you can advertise 3 spare seats. If you need a ride,
you can put -1. If you might rent a car, I recommend the token -1/+3 .

If we take this protocol further, you can decrement your available
seats every time you offer to ride share with someone. They can set
their seats to 0. There was no automated way to do this.

The form assumes that someone using an extra seat will be doing so for
the duration of the trip. Putting in lots of extra inputs for every
segment seemed impractical.

If folks have better ideas about how to set this up, let me know soon.
If I change the nature of the ride share questions, the current ride
share data goes away, so suggestions before lots of people fill it out
are ideal.
