I don?t think that the XML specification would make suggested mapping
illegal. I am suggesting to use the second subtag for variant.
Such usage is recommended by
http://www.openi18n.org/specs/ldml/1.0/ldml-spec.htm

I think that unumbigous mapping of a variant would be useful for
users.
Changes in behavior caused by the variant are ,of course?
implementation defined, but I would expect that Java JDK or ICU
users would have the same unambiguous results.

Personal response:

I may have misunderstood the intent behind the specification of
xml:lang, but my reading of it is that subcodes after the first can be
anything you like, so long as it is alphabetic: for example, they can be
used for variants.

I'm reluctant to fall out of line with the XML specification here.

I'm also rather dubious of having too many of these mechanisms where we
specify the syntax but say nothing about the semantics. Does it really
improve interoperability?
