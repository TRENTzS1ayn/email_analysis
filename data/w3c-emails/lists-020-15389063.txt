Welcome to the RDF Data Access Working Group [1] mailing list
(public-rdf-dawg@w3.org). This forum will be used for technical
discussion as well as working group logistics. This mailing list is
publicly archived [2] but only members of the group may post to it.

Per tradition, we can start the working group with personal
introductions. I am Eric Prud'hommeaux (home page [3]). I'll be the
W3C team contact. I've impelemented a query language called algae
which served as the basis for an RDF application called Annotea. With
algae, I've recently been exploring using an RDF query language to
query and update heterogeneous databases (conventional databases with
generic triple stores for the miscellaneous data).
