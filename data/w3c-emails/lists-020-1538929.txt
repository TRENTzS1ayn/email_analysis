Thanks, that was my main point.
(Although as I said it would be nice if the "obvious" interpretation of
<foo a="b">aaa</a> 
as XML could be made safe, as people will try it  unless this section
strongly warns against that.

[Michael Rys] This is clearly incorrect. An XML document clearly can
contain ]]>. 

Er, depends on your definition of "clearly" I think:-)


http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#syntax

  The right angle bracket (>) may be represented using the string "&gt;",
  and must, for compatibility, be escaped using "&gt;" or a character
  reference when it appears in the string "]]>" in content, when that
  string is not marking the end of a CDATA section


For example msxml3 (in IE6)  says
of

<foo>]]></foo>

The XML page cannot be displayed 
Cannot view XML input using XSL style sheet. Please correct the error
and then click the Refresh button, or try again later.

The literal string ']]>' is not allowed in element content. Error
