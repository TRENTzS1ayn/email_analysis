Right... I'm particularly interested in

 -- a bio summarizing experience you have that's relevant to the
 work of this group

 -- as much contact info as you care to share on this public list

 -- what you expect to get out of this WG

 -- what you hope/expect to contribute.

Before W3C, I studied computer science at U.T. Austin.
I worked at Convex doing hypertext documentation
for supercomputer software; then I went to a Atrium
where I wrote a client for some their enterprise
print management system; then I went to HaL to help
them add Web smarts to the online docs for the workstation
they were building.

I joined W3C in March 1995. I'm a member of the TAG and the
Semantic Web Coordination Group. I edited HTML 2.0, chaired
the WG on HTML 4.0 and CSS 1, participated in the XML Schema
Working Group, and served as team contact for the WG on OWL.

I work out of my home in the Kansas City area, and I travel
to W3C meetings etc. about once a month. I don't publish
my office phone number, but I do make it available to W3C
members. Another near-real-time contact mechanism is IRC.
When I'm in office-mode, I'm generally also in
the #rdfig channel.

The premise of W3C is that working together on new Web technologies
is better than working separately. In particular, I think the role
of a chair is to see that the time each of you spends in this
group is well spent. First and foremost, our time will have been
well spent if the technology we develop gets widely deployed.
But along the way, it's important that each of us feels our
peers understand and acknowledge our contribution, even when
they do not agree. So I hope to contribute to this WG by
fostering a spirit of open and effective collaboration.

What I'd like to get from the group is the smallest spec
that will advance the state of the art, connecting the
providers and consumers of RDF data access technology.
That small spec may look boring at first, but I think
the momentum around it will enable us to build something
more interesting to both the providers and the consumers.
