My short bio is
Jobs

My current mission at Agfa Healthcare is doing advanced
development w.r.t. components to realize semantic web
oriented architectures for healthcare imaging applications,
healthcare enterprise integration, medical decision support.
So I do all kind of things that fit with that mission
and one of them is the ongoing "Euler proof mechanism"
http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2003/03swap/index.html

I'm also a member of the RDFCore, WebOnt and SWBP WG's
and I hope to focus here as well on test cases backed-up
with running code.
