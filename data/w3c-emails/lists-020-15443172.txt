EricP and I set up a survey:

[[[
The telephone meetings section of our charter calls for weekly
distributed meetings. Reviewing meeting times for Boston, Tokyo, and
Paris, EricP and DanC note that there is no time of day that is
convenient for everybody. So we have picked three times that are
convenient for the current critical resources (the chair and team
contact). (If you volunteer to co-chair, you get priority in
teleconference scheduling!).

We hope to find a time for which a critical mass of the participants can
regularly attend.
