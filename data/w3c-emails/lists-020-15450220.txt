EricP and I went round and round about teleconference times.
We set up a survey to get input on a recurring time.
  http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/35463/ttime/

But for the first one, since W3C process[3.2] calls for 7 days notice,
we're picking somewhat arbitrarily.

We'll have our first teleconference

Wednesday, March 17, 2004, at 22:00:00 UTC
Wednesday, March 17, 2004, at 5:00:00 PM Boston time
(18-Mar 7:00JST) (17-Mar 23:00CET)
http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=17&month=3&year=2004&hour=17&min=0&sec=0&p1=43

I'll send out an agenda 24hrs in advance.

I intend to use telcons mostly to give deadlines to email
conversations, so participation by email is at least as
important, if not more important, than real-time participation.
