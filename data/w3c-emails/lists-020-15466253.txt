First I'd like to say hello to all and that I'm excited to be a part of 
this working group.

Brief Bio:

While finishing up a BS in Mathematics from the University of Minnesota 
I started working at the Geometry Center[1] where I helped set up and 
maintain their web server, and develop interactive web applications 
(1991 - 1995). I moved on to the Sonderforschungsbereich 288[2] as a 
visiting researcher then worked at a consultant shop that specialized 
in NeXT's WebObjects and Java (1996); then at Object/FX[3] built Java 
Beans for displaying and interacting with spatial objects (1996-1998); 
then at Bowstreet[4] assisted company on advanced technology-related 
issues by tracking web standards and technologies, communicating 
expertise, and providing guidance in the ongoing implementation of XML 
related functionality (1998-2001); then at Eikco implemented rdflib[5] 
and some SW applications that use it (2001-2003); and finally at the 
Mindlab[6] continue to help build the semantic web (2003-present).


I'd like to get a clear, concise, and implementable specification that 
will be a useful building block for the Semantic Web. I hope to 
contribute all that I can and expect to help make sure things are 
implementable by producing running code.

Best way to contact me is by email, or on #rdfig (look for eikeon).
