Let's start with a simple case as much to find out what a use case is:

Suppose an application wishes to find the resources in a knowledge base for
people with the name "John Smith".  The knowledge base is a collection of
vCards in RDF (see [1] for RDF version, see [2] for the definition) e.g. an
address book or an enterprise directory.

vCards have a property vcard:FN (FN is "Formatted Name" I think) so we want
those things with a value of "John Smith" for property vcard:FN.

(I used vCards in this example just because its one we use in the Jena
tutorials and find it easy to communicate to people.)
