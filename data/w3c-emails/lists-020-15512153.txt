This is a good start, but it's not clear to me how the customer/client
gets value yet.

If you take the system I work on, cwm, and ask it
?WHO vcard:FN "John Smith".
it'll dutifully bind ?WHO to _:bnode23o4u23 and report

[ vcard:FN "John Smith" ].

i.e. yes, there is somebody/something that has vcard:FN "John Smith".
Gee thanks. The user probably wants his contact info, if he's
using the vcard namespace.

Could you (or somebody...) flesh this example out a bit? Tell me
more about the user... are they trying to find John Smith's
email message to send them email? Or are they trying to bust
John Smith for some crime? Or invite him to a party?

Can you say something about why writing a program on top of
rdflib or XSLT doesn't suit this user's needs?
