Our charter calls for a few face to face meetings,
starting with on in April.

XML Europe 2004 is 19-21 April in Amsterdam.

I gather a number of us are going to be there
or could get there easily.

I'm interested in proposals to host our first
face to face meeting. It's possible that W3C,
in particular our Amsterdam office, could host,
but I haven't looked into that.

If you're willing to host, please propose
dates and let us know what airport we'd be
flying to, if not the street address of the
building where you propose to host the meeting.

In the 'Art of Consensus' guidebook
  http://www.w3.org/Guide/ (member confidential)
we've got some relevant collected wisdom...

  Host Guidelines for W3C Face to Face Meetings
  http://www.w3.org/Guide/hosting.htm

I hope to put the question of where to hold
the 1st face to face meeting in the agenda
of the 17 March teleconference, so let's please
have a proposal (and some "yes, I like that
proposal" follow-ups) in the next few days.
