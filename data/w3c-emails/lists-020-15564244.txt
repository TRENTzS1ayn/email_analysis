No problem - can do.

Might be useful to discuss use cases at a general level as well hence this
thread. Are we moving towards a use case having the structure (quick draft):

  Description/Context:

  Audience: (e.g. application, user, toolkit developers, ....)

  Value/Why:

  Implications:
    Technical discussion

  Other:
    General notes - to ensure they don't get lost.


The structure can't be too long and I think each section must be completed
for all use cases (that is, no sections that work for only half of the UCs -
hard to evaulate systematically later).

Any one what to add/refine/alter etc this list?  What experience is there of
using these?

Andy

No problem: are we moving towards a use case having the structure:
