Revision (and this as supposed to be a simple case!)

== Task & Roles

Use agent wants to find one or more URIs for a person whose name is "John
Smith" as part of a larger task.

== Value/Why

A user has assigned an agent the task of finding their personal emails to
"John Smith".  As part of that process, the agent is going to look up the
text name, get any URIs then look these out in a SWEB email archive which
relates people/URI to email messages.

== Description 

John Smith has decided has decided to allocate himself a URN to help other
people refer to him.  (I want to avoid discussing the modeling issues around
giving people: its not a URL; other people not called "John Smith" could
also have given URIs to a person called "John Smith".  Personally in things
like FOAF files, it seems to me to be helpful to give oneself a URI to help
others refer to you but then and references other people by descriptions).

The application queries a LDAP directory of people, which has advertised
that it presents the vcard voclabulary.

vCards have a property vcard:FN (FN is "Formatted Name" I think) so we want
the URIs that are subjects of property vcard:FN and value "John Smith" for
property vcard:FN.
