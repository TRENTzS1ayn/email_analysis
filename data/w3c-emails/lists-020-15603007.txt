I try to follow the evolving use case structure here

== Task & Roles

A client software wishes to connect to server software
to find out if it could find an object whose property
matches certain value.

== Description

The client has support for basic dublin core (dc)
vocabulary.

The server has support for music related vocabulary
(music).

The server has rooted 'music:composer' to 'dc:creator'
via (music:composer, rdfs:subPropertyOf, dc:creator).

The client queries for

(X, dc:creator', 'John Smith')

and should be returned with composers that have name
'John Smith'. The return vocabulary should by default
be that of the client (=dc) or by explicit request
something else (e.g. =music).
