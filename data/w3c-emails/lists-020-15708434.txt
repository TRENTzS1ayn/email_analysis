In a pre-working group poll, danbri and I determined that April 22-23
would work for everyone polled (probably 80% of the current WG
members).

       April
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa 
18 19 20 21 22 23 24
   |XML EU| |f2f|    "XML E" is XML Europe [1].

This takes advantage of everyone who has gone to Amsterdam for XML
Europe and doesn't seem to cause the rest of us excessive hardship.
Alberto, Dirk, does that work for you?
