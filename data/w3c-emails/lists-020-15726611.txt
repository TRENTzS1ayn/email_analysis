One could get the answer:

  { ?tune vcard:FN "L'amour de loin".
    ?tune mb:genre ?genre. } => { <> answer (?genre) }.

and the presentation information:

  { mn:genre rdfs:label ?label } => { <> answer (?label) }.

separately. Is it a common case that the client asking
about an mb:genre property won't know how to display it?

I think this presentation request comes up more commonly
when the client doesn't know exactly what properties it
is looking for:

  { ?thingy vcard:FN "L'amour de loin".
    ?thingy ?p       ?v. } => { <> answer (?p ?v) }.

A query language that expressed variable predicates would
allow for these queries to be smushed together:

  { ?thingy vcard:FN   "L'amour de loin".
    ?thingy ?p         ?v.
    ?p      rdfs:label ?label } => { <> answer (?p ?v ?label) }.
