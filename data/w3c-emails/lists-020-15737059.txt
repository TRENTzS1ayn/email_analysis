I agree that making separate queries will do the trick
but it will make XSLT development trickier.

What we need to build to our customers is query result
visualisation using XSLT from RDF/XML to (X)HTML and
other markup.

For this purpose we've noticed that we need
access to labels/comments from XSLT. If they are
not explicitly requested in the original query, alternatives are:

a) make other queries for them like you suggested which
makes xslt more inefficient.

b) include the natural language descriptions in the XSLT
(replicating strings from RDFS to XSLT, not very nice)

Therefore we had to introduce support for syntactic sugar
ourselves to include rdfs:label and rdfs:comment to
query results without query explicitly asking for them.
