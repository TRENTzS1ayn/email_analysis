What is specific to XQuery is that it uses a syntax which is very close
to XML syntax but subtly different. In fact, very many well-formed
XQuery queries are also well-formed XML documents, and in many cases
putting something like

<foo>bar</foo>

will produce the same infoset whether you put it through an XQuery
processor or through an XML parser. This means that the other cases,
those where a query is a well-formed XML document but has different
interpretation, are particularly pernicious.
