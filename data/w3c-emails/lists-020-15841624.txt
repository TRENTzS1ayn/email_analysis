Howdy folks,

My name is Patrick Stickler [1] and I work for Nokia, most recently
with the Web Services group at Forum Nokia [2], the developer tools
and support division of Nokia, and earlier at Nokia Research Center
and Nokia Networks.

I've been banging about the SW community for some years now, mostly
using RDF to build metadata-driven content management and publication
solutions used both internally within Nokia as well as in product
documentation delivery systems for telecom network management systems.
I'm a member of the RDF Core WG and have participated in several other
standards groups and initiatives in the past.

I have a bachelor's degree in Computational Linguistics and Computer
Science from the University of Helsinki and a master's degree in
Information Studies from the University of Tampere. I'm an American,
but have lived in Finland for the past 18 years.

My work/research experience [3] has centered around structured markup,
content management, data mining, and knowledge based systems; and
my current interests and activities are focused primarily on the
publication and discovery of knowledge for use by automated systems,
to which end I have been working on several technologies that
intersect with the goals of this working group, in particular
URIQA [4], the URI Query Agent model for discovery of authoritative
resource descriptions, and RDFQ [5], an RDF vocabulary and query
model for expressing RDF queries in RDF and recieving the results
of those queries in RDF, both of which are central components of
the Nokia Semantic Web Server [6], a knowledge portal providing rich
metadata descriptions of resources of interest to mobile
application developers and used to orchestrate web services and
content provided by Forum Nokia.

I am particularly interested in seeing the emergence of a standardized
means of bootstrapping the Semantic Web through access to authoritative
descriptions of resources by agents having nothing but the denoting 
URIs.

I am also concerned about standardized knowledge discovery and
interchange being as efficient and light weight as possible for
SW agents, particularly those running on mobile devices.

I'm very glad to see this working group finally get off the ground
and look forward to collaborating with all of you.

Cheers,

Patrick
