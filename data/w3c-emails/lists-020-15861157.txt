A client encounters a URI.

The client has no information whatsoever about that URI, nor any
idea what that URI might denote.

The client employs the DAWG recommendation to obtain an
authoritative description of the resource denoted by the URI.

The only special knowledge required of the client to accomplish this
is the URI itself and the DAWG recommendation (and whatever general
knowledge needed to apply the DAWG recommendation, i.e. foundational
standards such as URI, HTTP, RDF, etc.).

Glossary:

"client" - a person or software agent

"description" - equivalent or similar to a URIQA concise bounded
description (http://sw.nokia.com/uriqa/URIQA.html#cbd).

"authoritative description" - the description published/provided
via the web authority of the URI, or by some other generally
accepted authoritative server associated with the URI.

BTW, I think it would be good to start now building a glossary of
terms which would be used consistently in our use cases. The sooner
we agree about what we mean by particular terms, the better off
we will be... ;-)
