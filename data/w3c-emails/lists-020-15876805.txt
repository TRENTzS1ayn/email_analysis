A client wishes to obtain a third-party description of a known
resource.

The client is aware of a source of third-party knowledge from
which such a description might be obtained.

Following the DAWG recommendation, the client formulates a
query which identifies the resource in question using a URI,
and submits the query to the knowledge source.

If the resource is known to the knowledge source by that URI,
the knowledge source returns a description of the resource.
