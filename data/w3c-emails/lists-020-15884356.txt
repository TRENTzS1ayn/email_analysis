A client wishes to discover resources which have certain
characteristics and obtain explicit information about
those characteristics of such resources.

The client is aware of a source of knowledge from
which such resources might be discovered.

Following the DAWG recommendation, the client formulates a
query which describes one or more example templates which
reflect the desired characteristics, and which associates
explicit names with each characteristic of interest, and
submits the query to the knowledge source.

The knowledge source returns a set of zero or more
value bindings for the set of named characteristics, for
all matched resources.
