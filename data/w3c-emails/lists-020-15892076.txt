A client wishes to discover resources which have certain
characteristics and obtain descriptions of those resources.

The client is aware of a source of knowledge from
which such resources might be discovered.

The client is aware that the knowledge source is able
to apply RDFS and OWL based inference when evaluating input
queries.

The client is aware of rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:subPropertyOf
and owl:sameAs relationships between various vocabularies
in common use which the knowledge source may not be, and which
may affect the success of the query.

Following the DAWG recommendation, the client formulates a
query which describes one or more example templates which
reflect the desired characteristics, and submits the query
to the knowledge source along with the additional knowledge
which should be employed during the resolution of the query.

The knowledge source returns a set of zero or more
resource descriptions, each description describing a
resource which matched an example template.

[Note that this use case could also be adapted to one
  where variable bindings were requested rather than
  descriptions]
