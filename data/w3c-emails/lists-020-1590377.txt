In Section 7.3 "Judgments for step expressions and filtering", in 
Introduction, the judgments introduced by the section are mentioned as 
first, second, etc. The order does not correspond however to the order 
in which they actually later appear in the section.

Also in 7.3.3.1 the first occurence of Type2 in the first rule should be 
replaced by Type3.
