The U.S. Census Bureau provides some really nify data
  http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tiger2003/tgr2003.html
it's public domain.

I want to do a query like
tell me the lat, lon, name, and type
of everything within 50 miles of Cambridge, MA

Right now, I have to download all the files, unzip them,
read a bunch of docs, write some software, blah blah blah.

I'd like to just look at it as a big RDF graph and issue
a query.

Hmm... it's not clear they (the census folks) have motivation
to offer a query service. But clearly a third party could.
