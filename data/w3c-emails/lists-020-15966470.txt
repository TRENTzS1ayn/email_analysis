An application wants to query a remote system for RDF information about
a resource with a URI X.  It can offer hints of the kinds of
things it understand(properties, other things) and wants back more RDF
or compatible answers that it can try to interpret, some of which will
be presented to the end user.  The answer should be quick since the user
is waiting for it, so it would be good if this was a single request and
response.

More specifically:

The remote service is a thesaurus or RDF schema service on the web that
knows how to represent or map between vocabularies and could return
inter-term relationships or a "useful" part of a graph.  The client is
an end-user desktop application for cataloguing items for a digital
library and the client app is constructing the user interface from the
schemata information and searching for terms related to existing terms.
