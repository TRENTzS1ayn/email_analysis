Thanks, Andy, for taking notes during the call.

  http://www.w3.org/2004/03/17-dawg-irc

For this first meeting, I'm sending an edited summary of
the meeting, to set an example of the sort of balance
I'd like to see between a record that's easy to produce
and one that's useful for the group, including (a) people
who weren't on the call and (b) people looking at this
record many months from now.
In the future, I'd like the scribe to send the proposed
minutes for review.

  send us a pointer

We tried to find, among the use cases that had been sent, those
that were appealing to several of us and hence merited further
development. In response to a request to discuss structure,
DanC asked that we find one or two specific cases before
looking for a general structure. DanC reiterated the qualities
he suggested the group should be looking for in use cases:

[[
The ideal use cases will

  -- command consensus of this Working Group
as a description of a problem we intend
to solve (or: solve a part of)

  -- clarify one or more requitements

  -- still be relevant when we're at last call,
deciding whether we think the spec is done

  -- engage potential users of our technology
and convince some of them to closely
review our spec

  -- be clear and engaging enough to
get picked up by journalists and copied
into trade press stories
]]
  -- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0009.html

A few offers to elaborate on specific cases were accepted:

ACTION KendallC: refine JS-1, esp the composer/creator version
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0025.html

  Note: this is on the boundary of the charter, which says.. "This
   may in practice be the virtual graph which would follow from
   some form of inference from a stored graph. This does not affect
   the data access protocol"
    http://www.w3.org/2003/12/swa/dawg-charter#rdfs-owl-queries

ACTION AndyS: refine AFS-1: "Find the resource for the person called
'John S mith'" with some details
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0023.html

ACTION EricP: send "tell me properties of X" case

ACTION AlbertoS: elaborate on AFS-2 "Tell me about ..."
