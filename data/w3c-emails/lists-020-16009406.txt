A client wishes to discover resources which have labels
and descriptions in Finnish and obtain descriptions of
those resources.

The client is aware of a source of knowledge from
which such resources might be discovered.

Following the DAWG recommendation, the client formulates a
query which describes one or more example templates which
reflect the desired characteristics, in particular specifying
that the literal values for labels and descriptions are
marked with the language tag 'fi', and submits the query
to the knowledge source.

The knowledge source returns a set of zero or more
resource descriptions, each description describing a
resource which matched an example template.

--

Note that this use case reflects the requirement that
queries match the language tags of literals irrespective
of what the literal itself is.
