A client wishes to discover resources which are denoted by
URIs which match a particular regular expression and obtain
descriptions of those resources.

The client is aware of a source of knowledge from
which such resources might be discovered.

Following the DAWG recommendation, the client formulates a
query which describes one or more example templates which
reflect the desired characteristics and submits the query
to the knowledge source.

The knowledge source returns a set of zero or more
resource descriptions, each description describing a
resource which matched an example template.
