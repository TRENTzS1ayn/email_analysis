A client wishes to capture a query to a known knowledge source
as a bookmark so that execution of the query can be accomplished
simply by resolving the bookmarked URI.

The query identitifies target resources which have been created
or modified in the last 24 hours.

Because the query is saved as a static bookmark, a means of
expressing relative periods of time must be supported.

Following the DAWG recommendation, the client formulates the
query and constructs a query request URI to the known knowledge
source where the query is expressed as a CGI parameter in the
URI. Per the DAWG recommendation, the temporal characteristic
is expressed using a special relative term 'oneDayAgo' such
that the query identifies resources having an ex:modified
value which is less than or equal to 'oneDayAgo' -- the actual
date/time being calculated when the query is executed.

Any time the client wishes to execute that query, it simply
resolves that bookmarked URI.
