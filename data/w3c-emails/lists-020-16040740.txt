A client wishes to capture a query to a known knowledge source
as a bookmark so that execution of the query can be accomplished
simply by resolving the bookmarked URI.

Following the DAWG recommendation, the client formulates the
query and constructs a query request URI to the known knowledge
source where the query is expressed as a CGI parameter in the
URI.

Any time the client wishes to execute that query, it simply
resolves that bookmarked URI.
