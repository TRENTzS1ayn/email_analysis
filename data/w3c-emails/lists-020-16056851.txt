A client employs an RDF API for creating and manipulating
RDF graphs.

[A client wishes to discover resources which have certain
characteristics and obtain descriptions of those resources,
or obtain information about particular characteristics.]

[The client is aware of a source of third-party knowledge from
which such resources might be discovered and such information
might be obtained.]

The client uses the RDF API to create an RDF graph expressing
the query.

The client adds client-specific knowledge to the RDF graph
which may be useful/relevant to the execution of that query.

[The client submits the query graph to the knowledge source.]

[The knowledge source returns an RDF graph containing description
of the resources identified by the query, or containing variable
bindings.]

The client uses the RDF API to process the query results.

--

This use case aims to demonstrate the benefit of expressing
both queries and query results in RDF, such that a client need
only use a single RDF API to construct a query and process
the results, rather than employ multiple APIs, parsers, etc.

The essential bits of the use case are the same whether the client
wishes to obtain descriptions or variable bindings in the result.

In this use case, the bits that are not essential are in brackets.
