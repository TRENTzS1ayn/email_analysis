A client frequently needs to express queries which compare various
datatype values. These comparisons include the following:

Value X is equal to value Y.
Value X is not equal to value Y.
Value X is less than value Y.
Value X is less than or equal to value Y.
Value X is greater than value Y.
Value X is greater than or equal to value Y.
