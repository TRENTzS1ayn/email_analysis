While this is an important, and needed, application, this seems out of 
scope
to me.

Some particular service could provide a DAWG conformant interface to a 
virtual
knowledge store which constitutes a federation of heterogenous 
knowledge from
a broad range of disparate repositories -- but a DAWG agent should not 
be concerned
with, or even be aware of, such federation.

Such a service would be very useful, and I expect it to be done often, 
but it
has IMO no affect on how queries are expressed and submitted to 
services for
resolution.

The same goes for any form of distributed query.

(or have I missed something more fundamental, Alberto, in your test 
case?)
