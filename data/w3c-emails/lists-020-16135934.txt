It is clearer. Your example above also relates to ongoing work on named
graphs that I find very interesting. However, I think that such issues
are out of scope for DAWG for two reasons:

1. It really is an implementational detail how one service might
    provide a unified point of access to a federation of other services,
    and I don't think it is a sufficiently acute need in the general
    community to consume WG time to innovate a solution.

2. I believe that whatever solution DAWG recommends, it should be
    in sync with the new RDF specs -- and so adding support for
    named graphs seems too significant an extension for this first round.

Of course, that's just my personal opinion, and the rest of the WG
may disagree (certainly won't be a first ;-)

Cheers,

Patrick
