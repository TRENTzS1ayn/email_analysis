Two of Dan's qualities of the ideal use case are:

. . .

  -- engage potential users of our technology
and convince some of them to closely
review our spec

  -- be clear and engaging enough to
get picked up by journalists and copied
into trade press stories
. . .

While I have sympathy with having use cases be framed in terms of the future
rec (i.e. diving into tehtechnical), I am also aware that, as a group, we do
not have a sense of what that recommendation is.  I like the qualities Dan
provided as they are outwardedly focused, not technology focused.  Getting
engagement with the wider audience means talking about the value provided
and less about the "how".

So I see use cases serving as input to a refinement step.  Let's not jump
too early and only make use cases a technical description.  The need for a
technical feature needs to be backed with an illustrative use otherwise it
is a requirement with unclear value.

If we find that many use cases are covered by one technical aspect, then
that's good.  We will come out of the first phase with concise requirments
that cover a range application/user needs.
