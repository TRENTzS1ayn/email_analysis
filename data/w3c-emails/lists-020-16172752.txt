But I agree with Patrick: a good way to get a sense of it is to tell
each other stories about it and see if those stories line up.

I think what he's suggesting echoes another one of the qualities
of the ideal use case that I gave earlier:

"
The ideal use cases will

  -- clarify one or more requitements
"

My hasty use case description fell short of ideal on that count.

Yes, the outward focus is critical. But the "how" needs to be in
there somewhere, eventually.
