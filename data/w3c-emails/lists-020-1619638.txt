I think that if you want to constrain the type of the supplied
parameter, the type declaration should go in the query. It seems odd to
me if you declare the existence of the parameter within the query, but
don't declare it's type.

While we're discussing global parameters, one XSLT feature which I
really miss in XQuery is the ability to specify a default value for the
parameter.
