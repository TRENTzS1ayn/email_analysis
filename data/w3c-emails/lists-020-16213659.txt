I'm mostly happy to let the structure of use cases emerge
as discussion progresses, but I'd like to nip this
naming convention involving people's initials in the bud.

Please pick names/identifiers that are real-life words
that would be reasonably meaningful to somebody who's
new to the WG. Yes, it's harder, but coming to agreement
on terms is the game we're here to play.

Use of opaque codewords like XY-23 can lead to inter-group
efficiencies, but it creates a barrier around the group;
it makes it expensive for new people to figure out
what we're all talking about.

Also, naming use cases (and issues and so on) after people
is counter the goal of group consensus/endorsement/ownership.
Each of us should feel free to criticize a use case without
giving any signal of attacking a person whatsoever.
