Thanks for carrying the ball forward on this topic and
for the timely follow-up on your action item.

But please consider the subject of this message
from the perspective of somebody joining
the WG 6 months from now and scanning the archive.

It's totally opaque.

Reading the rest of the message, I struggle to
find anything other than technical jargon
to use as a topic for this discussion.
"information discovery", "optional  properties",
"Joseki RDF Net API/protocol", URIQA, MGET,
"TAP GetData" ...

The references to the implementation experience
are very helpful, but
can you relate these technical terms to
some business sectors, like publishing/syndication,
multimedia asset management or the like?
even something really broad like enterprise integration
would be help.

Going back to the message of Thu, 11 Mar 2004 17:15:17 -0000
that started this thread, I see that the use case
involved somebody doing journalistic research...
"gathering information about
http://www.w3.org/ because they are writing a news article about W3C's
new
look web site as an example of excellent web design"

Can we get the discussion to include more of that sort thing, please?

I'm sorry if I sound like some sort of marketing person, but, well,
marketing is a big part of getting a technology deployed.
