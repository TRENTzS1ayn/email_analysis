Abelard... great name... now... why does he care about these URIs?
What life persuit/business is he in? What's his role?
Is he an IT application designer?
A web site designer? A financial analyst? A plumber?

Can we find something less technical than "capability discovery"
to label this use case with? I think you've done a good job
of motivating a requirement around preserving an investment in extant
data access mechanisms. But I'd like the story to start with
something more real-world than "an arbitrary list of RDF
storage servers".
