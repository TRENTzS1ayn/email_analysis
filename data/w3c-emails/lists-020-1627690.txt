  The only real problem
  would be how to handle the "<" operator, which must be represented as
  &lt; in XML but cannot be represented as &lt; in XQuery.

This problem would be solved, and the correspondence between Xquery and
Xpath-in-XML would be improved, if the charef production was removed
from the grammar and instead an xquery parser was specified as acting
(as if) all charrefs were expanded (and line endings normalised)
_before_ parsing the input against the specified grammar. This would
mean that Charref could appear anywhere (as it can in Xpath in an XML
attribute) including use as Xquery syntax such as <.
