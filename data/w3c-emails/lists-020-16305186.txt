Hi all,

The WG is off to a pretty good start, thanks to all of you,
and I expect at least a few more W3C member organizations
to join the fun.

Meanwhile, there are a few roles I'd like your input
and advice on.

First, we're still recruiting a co-chair. If you'd
like to volunteer or to nominate one of the other
WG members, please let EricP <eric@w3.org> and me know.

Second, if you feel there is some area of expertise
that we lack, and somebody you know who could fill it,
let us know. I'm obliged to invite experts if we need
them to get our job here done.

There are a couple people EricP and I are discussing
invited expert status with. If anybody has any
concerns about that (e.g. WG size, etc.) please let
us know.
