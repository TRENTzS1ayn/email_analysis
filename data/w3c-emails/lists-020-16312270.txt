I'm not sure I've completely absorbed this use case, and it does
seem like a stretch... but there
does seem to be something novel to it: it motivates interoperability.
In many of the use cases, it's not evident why we need lots
of services to work the same way: as long as a particular
client and server agree, they're happy. This case
relies, pretty clearly, on lots of interoperable services.

I'd like to see it presented in "once upon a time..." story format,
with more connection to less technical concepts (shopping,
health care, ...).
