Jeremy Carroll, Chris Bizer, Pat Hayes, and I have been working on an 
approach
to address such issues -- concerning named graphs, signatures, and 
authentication.
We are working to get a paper completed.

To properly address such concerns, you have to (in our opinion) add a 
little bit
of extra machinery and augment the RDF MT -- so given the presumption 
that what
the DAWG comes up with should sync with the latest RDF/OWL specs, that 
could put
it out of scope.
