But that's *why* we express our use cases in terms of an anticipated
DAWG rec, making clear in the use case what bits were faciliated by
the rec, so that it becomes clear how we see the rec impacting users
activities.

I wasn't proposing taking about "how" -- but of making it clear what 
bits
of value are specific to the DAWG rec.

 From that, we can derive requirements.

If it's not clear in the use cases which bits of value are in scope and
which are not (simply used to illustrate the use case) then we have
a *much* harder time when it comes to deriving requirements.

Do you find many, if any, technical features in any of my use cases?

If you could point those out to me, I will try to reduce the occurence 
of such.

I'm also not clear on what you deem "technical".
