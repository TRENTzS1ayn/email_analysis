this UC seems to express some of the ideas/requirements of AR-2 in less 
technical terms - good!

even though I find the usage of "Content Management" in the title a bit 
misleading - I guess most people out there they use the term CMS 
talking about a system offering either PULL and PUSH functionality 
(e.g. most DBMS existing today). Where the latter seems out of scope 
from our DAWG charter -
