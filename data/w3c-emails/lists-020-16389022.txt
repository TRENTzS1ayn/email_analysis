I don't mean it to be restrictive, only to reflect our expectations
of what the DAWG recommendation might address.

It's a bit like the blind men and the elephant. Each is talking about
their personal experience (use cases) in terms of what they all think
is a shared point of reference (the DAWG recommendation). At some
point, after a good bit of confusion, they ultimately reach a general
concensus about what that thing is.

So, my use cases may reflect a possible realization of the DAWG
rec that your use cases may reflect a slightly different realization,
and through the process of understanding each others use cases, and
how those use cases are presumably facilitated by the DAWG 
recommendation,
we are able to come to a concensus about some intersection of 
realizations,
and then get to work on making an actual rec.

So, just because one of my use cases may suggest that the rec would
govern a particular characteristic of a conformant application, does
not mean that you have to agree and make your use cases reflect the
same coverage.

Eh?
