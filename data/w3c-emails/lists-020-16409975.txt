Well, no, don't double the traffic just to eliminate the initials.

But please don't rely on the XX-23 names. If you use them,
include a few other subject words too. i.e. don't just say
AS-1. Say: find stuff about John Smith (AFS-1).

When we've got at least 2 or 3 that pretty much everybody likes.
Right now, we have about 72 proposals with varying level of
endorsement and criticism. We looked at a handful in the
telcon and assigned actions; I'd like to see discussion
of those cases mature.

Anybody is welcome to try to do some gathering, but at this
early point, there's no guarantee that it'll become the
basis of the group's work going forward.

A recommendation to anybody who tries it: don't try to
be exhuastive. Pick a few good ones, not all of the
ones that have been proposed.
