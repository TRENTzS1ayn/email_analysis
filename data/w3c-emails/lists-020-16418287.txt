I agree that in the overall swemantci web architecture
provenance/attributions are going to be important and that it is very
significant for query in the long run.  I don't think that means we/DAWG
must address it in order to get a rec done that helps many people and
systems.  I think that is huge benefit in a "simple" rec that helps toolkit
builderd provide the same capabilities (they can confidently invest time in
building a quality implementation); it helps application writers be able to
access different sources without needing to adapt their applications to the
details of a particular source, and it helps end users by allowing them to
use their apps with many data sources.
