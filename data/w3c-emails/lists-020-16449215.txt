Hi all,

My name is Dirk Colaert. I live in Belgium, I am a medical doctor and I've
been working in healthcare informatics for +/- 20 years. (Much has changed
since ...)

I developed Medar, an Electronic Medical Record system that does more than
just storing and retrieving medical results. We try to actually capture not
only the medical data but also the whole medical and clinical process (the
'thinking' of the doctor). 

We use ecompas, a home made object relational mapper to our database. Wich
uses an Opath-like query language. We want to access and query data in a
more semantical way, so making a semantic mapper would be the next step to
do. For that we need a semantic query language. So, the efforts of this WG
are interesting me very much and I want to contribute as much as I can.

I look forward to work together,

Dirk
