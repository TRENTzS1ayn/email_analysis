I definitely agree in principle with not trying to expand our scope too
much, but I absolutely don't want this group to rush a spec out the door
for the sake of getting one out. One more spec (and one more query
language incompatible with all the others) isn't just worthless.
In-the-trenches engineers look at the huge tangle of half-useful
technologies associated with the semantic web and decide it's not worth
the investment.

My stance is that if we can't come up with a recommendation that offers
enough value for widespread adoption (and I believe that the goal is
possible), then we're better off not codifying an irrelevent spec.
