I'm very sympathetic to such a goal, though I hope that
won't result in too rushed a rec which misses key issues.

I'm expecting that the DAWG rec solution will not employ built-in
datatypes (even if it recommends support for XML Schema predefined
datatypes) and will support RDF's datatype framework agnostic model.

I.e., if I can't express datatype values as typed literals
with arbitrary datatypes, then that is not acceptable.

I hope that this is a widely shared position in the WG.

I think that the WG actually has a bit more work to do than just
repackage some existing legacy solutions as-is.

Yes, most of the work has been done, and we should avoid venturing
into any truly new areas, but I don't think we have absolutely
all of the pieces in the form we need them in a single existing
deployed solution to make the WG's activities primarily editorial.

Three particular issues that I hope/expect the WG will explore,
and ultimately incorporate into the final rec are

(a) expressing queries and query results in RDF
(b) a standard definition of a concise bounded description of a resource
(c) a standardized means to request the concise bounded description of a
     specific resource

I agree that provenance should be out of scope for this round.
