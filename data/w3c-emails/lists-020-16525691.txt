+1

And I would add:

() a standard means to make such a query (HTTP and/or SOAP) to a remote
datasource on the web.

Not all situations need this protocol part or access (for example, a local
datasource may have other, more sophistaed means) but as a web
recommendation, the DAWG should include the web access aspect to meet the
charter.

The matter of "concise bounded description"s should be an orthogonal issue
to the general form of query and of protocol.  That is, it would be good if
it did not need to be distinguished in the rec.
