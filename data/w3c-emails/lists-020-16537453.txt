Agreed.

I think the DAWG rec could (perhaps should) in fact be two distinct
documents, the first covering the expression of queries and query 
results
in RDF (i.e. the vocabulary and semantics), and the second covering
protocol issues for clients submitting such queries to knowledge stores.

We could even choose to have distinct "task forces" within the WG
focusing specifically on each.

I don't agree.

Unless you are intending to restrict query responses solely to
bindings (which I think is both unnecessary and fails to meet
the needs of a very broad range of use cases that we've already
identified) you need to define what a "description" is.

I don't think it should be left up to each implementor to define
themselves what they will consider a description (such as is the
case with Joseki's 'fetch' operation) but that there should be
consistency across implementations insofar as the default, normal
behavior of DAWG conformant tools. Implementations may choose to
offer other flavors of descriptions, fine, but we really do need
to have a precise, standardized definition of a "concise bounded
resource description".
