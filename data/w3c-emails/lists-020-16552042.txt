FWIW, I argued as much with some folks in Cannes. I think the query
and protocol parts of our task are entirely orthogonal (though there
is the one bit, in the protocol phase, of figuring out how to
represent query types...), and thus could be handled as separate DAWG
documents. (I know this is insanely early, but Query, Protocol, and
one or two Primers shapes up nicely as DAWG deliverables -- but, hey,
Dan, don't shoot me for talking about this too soon! :>)

I took this position originally because I feared the query bit of our
work would turn into a death march. While I'm less skeptical about
that now, it still seems a smart choice to make, if necessary, to
separate the two issues as cleanly as possible.

(Also, fwiw, I could do without provenance in the first version,
though I'd like to have a predicate in our capabilities vocabulary to
make assertions about provenance.)
