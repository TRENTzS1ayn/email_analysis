+1 for me too

and perhaps have the possibility to express more the one datasource in 
the same query from where to pull data/metadata  - also leaving to the 
implementation the decision how to merge or smush those graphs. Even 
though I understand this might kick back in provenance in our 
requirements....but assuming we ignore that aspect for the moment, I 
find the need to select RDF from several different datasources as 
crucial requirement for a "web query language".

agree - some work about recording query-results has been already done 
in the past, and recently nicely summarized

http://www.w3.org/2003/03/rdfqr-tests/summary.html

which also provides a little bit of guidelines how to run simple 
interoperability tests between tools/implementations

perhaps worth to add that page to the DAWG page for reference?

agree too - and I would expect that to happen at the first f2f meeting 
- or immediately after

I would rather agree with Andy here instead

I do not think so - I rather would find such a requirement quite 
restrictive

even though that would be too much "application specific" - while we 
should try to be completely "opaque" on the "about" definition IMO
