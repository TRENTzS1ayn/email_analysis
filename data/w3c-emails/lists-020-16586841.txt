Maybe I wasn't clear? Our charter talks about a query language and a
data access protocol. These strike me as rather orthogonal; hence,
specifiable in separate documents, both of which would be deliverables
of this WG. Eventually we'll have to start thinking about the
documents this WG is going to produce, and it seems, at this very
early date, that something like a doc for the query language and a doc
for the data access protocol (plus some supporting docs, notably, a
primer) seems a relatively decent starting place.

I'm not sure I know what you mean about "two independent issues" and
"artificial links" between them, Rob.

Best,
