Rob,

A query language on its own provides some benefits but it still means
developers are tied to a single toolkit for their application and their
storage.  I would like to see a simple protocol (c.f. the concept of JDBC
but without the need for client-side specific drivers) so that selecting the
RDF storage technology is separate from the choice of
application/business-logic level software.  Whether that separation is
across the web or across a LAN, still requires agreement.  A recommendation
means that software providers can choose to provide systems that can be
mixed.

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by the term "distributed query" - to me
it means wide area, federated data sources with source selection and
possibly query partitioning and routing.  That is out of scope.

Earlier Rob said:

True - but if the way one system decides to do it in SOAP is different, even
at a trivial level, to another system means that apps are tied to one
toolkit.  I see the access protocol as being the communicate means -
"protocol" is a grand, more like a documenting of a way to use SOAP or HTTP
so there is mix-and-match of software components.
