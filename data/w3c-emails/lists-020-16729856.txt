How so? Can you give some clear use cases where having a precise
definition of a resource description prevents some key functionality?

So one implementor has a minimal definition, which excludes any
statements with bnode subjects as well as all reification statements
(providing too little information in the response even though that
knowledge is there in the knowledge store) and another implementor
has a maximal definition which includes up to 5 levels deep descriptions
of other URI denoted resources "just in case" such information is needed
(providing far too much information, including knowledge which is not
directly relevant to the resource in question)...  No thanks.

I'm not proposing that an implementation is limited to returning
descriptions according to a standard definition, but that
having that standard definition as the default, unless otherwise
specified, allows clients to know what they will be getting
and that it will be the minimal, relevant body of information
about a resource.
