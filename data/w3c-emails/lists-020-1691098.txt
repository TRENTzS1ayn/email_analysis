| Norm,
|
|     [XSLT] Replace reference to RFC 1738
|     ref: qt-2004Jan0013-01
|
| Thanks for the comment. 
|
| I have corrected the reference so it now points to the more recent RFC.
|
| I trust this meets with your approval.

Completely.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
