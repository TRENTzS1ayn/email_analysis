Thanks. Personal response:

XPath 1.0 compatibility is obviously important here. The XPath 1.0
specifications are rather terse on these matters, but the only way you
can interpret them consistently (and the way that implementors have
consistently interpreted them) is that all the string-matching functions
behave as if every string (including the zero-length string) contains a
zero-length string right at the start. This means that the example is
wrong, and fn:substring-before("Baloney!","") should return "".
