/ Asir Vedamuthu <asirv@webmethods.com> was heard to say:
| I have a quick question. I am wondering if these issues are recorded in a
| last call issues list. If so, may I request you to send me a link?

They are now recorded[1]. Apologies in advance for any formatting
glitches; like the rest of the XSL/XML Query editorial team, I'm still
getting used to the ExIT system.

Asir/Michael/Schema WG: please acknowledge that you accept resolution
of qt-2003Aug0002-14, the issues I believe have been overtaken by
events.

Paul: please add qt-2003Aug0002-03 (1.3. Items and singleton sequences) and
qt-2003Aug0002-04 (1.4. The implications of [validity] != valid) to the
discussion list for the f2f. (And accept my apologies for tardiness, please.)

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
