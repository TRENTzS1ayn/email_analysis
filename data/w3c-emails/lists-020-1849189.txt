A small inaccuracy in     3.2.2 Predicates

it reads:

By contrast, |(preceding::foo)[1]| returns the first |foo| element in 
document order,
 -> correct
...because the axis that applies to the |[1]| predicate is the |child| axis.
-> I dont see any child axis here
    If I am not mistaken, it should read something like "because the
   expression that applies to the |[1]| predicate is itself in document 
order"
  (being a whole path expression, and not a simple reverse step)
