Section 6.2.2 Accessors
Technical

We should make the rules for dm:typed-value simpler and make all
non-simple typed content the same as dm:string-value(). Also applies to
fn:data() and atomization. 

The reason is that static implementations will have the problem that
they have to otherwise raise a type error on even mixed content typed
elements, since an instance may be of a derived complex-content type
that is not mixed.

Also note that this would change the typed value of an element with
empty content type from () to "".
