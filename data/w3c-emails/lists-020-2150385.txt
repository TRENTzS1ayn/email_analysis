Section 6.7.3 Construction from an Infoset
Editorial

"Applications may construct text nodes in the data model to represent
insignificant white space. This decision is considered outside the scope
of the data model, consequently the data model makes no attempt to
control or identify if any or all insignificant white space is ignored."
XQuery considers all text nodes in the data model to be significant
(does not generate them if they are not significant). Do we thus still
need this paragraph?
