Section 6.7.3 Construction from an Infoset
Editorial

"W3C normalized" has been renamed to "fully normalized". There are also
other normalization forms that may be interesting for an application.
Just say that text nodes are not necessarily normalized. Also, the term
"programmers" should be defined (implementers of the data model or
somebody that writes Xqueries or XSLT stylesheets?)
