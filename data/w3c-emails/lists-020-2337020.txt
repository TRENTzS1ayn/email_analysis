Section 2 Basics
Editorial

"In some cases, where the meaning is clear and namespaces are not
important to the discussion, built-in XML Schema typenames such as
integer and string are used without a namespace prefix.": Do always
qualify if you talk about these types. This is just editorial laziness
and will lead to confusion for the user. It is also not clear if that
rule is only part of the spec or the language itself.
