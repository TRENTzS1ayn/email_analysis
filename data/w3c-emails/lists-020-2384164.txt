Section 2.2.3.1 Static Analysis Phase
Technical

"During the static analysis phase, if the Static Typing Feature is in
effect and the static type assigned to an expression other than () is
empty, a static error is raised.": We also need to exempt fn:data(())
which is used by atomization since we atomize () in an expression such
as foo(()).
