Section 2.2.3.2 Dynamic Analysis Phase
Editorial/Technical

"If the Static Typing Feature is not in effect, an implementation is
allowed to raise type-related warnings during the static analysis phase,
but it must proceed with the dynamic evaluation phase despite these
warnings. In this case, type errors must be detected and raised during
the dynamic evaluation phase.": This is too strong. If I know for sure
that I always will have a dynamic type error (e.g., the expected type is
xs:string and the passed value is always an instance of xs:int, I should
be able to raise this type error during the static phase even if the
static typing feature is not employed).
