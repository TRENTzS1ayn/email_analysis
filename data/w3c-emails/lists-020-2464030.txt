Thank you for your detailed and well-explained comment.

I am responding on behalf of the XML Query WG.

We considered your comment today and the XML Query WG decided to adopt
the solution of changing the value of a constructed comment as XSLT does
e.g. change any embedded "--" strings to "- -" and change any trailing
"-" to 
"- ".

We would be grateful if you could confirm that this response resolves
the questions you raised in your comment.
