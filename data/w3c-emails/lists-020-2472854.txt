I am responding to this comment thread on behalf of the XQuery and XSL
Working Groups.

The WGs reviewed your comment [1] and agreed with the explanation that
Michael Kay provided in [2].  The WGs were pleased to see that you
responded positively to Michael's explanation in [2] in your message
[3].

In you message of [3] you further asked:

> Why support such inappropriate type-checking?

The WGs also discussed this question and felt that this type of static
type-checking is indeed useful and several WG members said that they
will have implementations that will indeed implement this feature.  In
addition it was pointed out that since static typing was an optional
feature if you feel that this form of static typing is not useful then
you will not have to implement it.

We would be grateful if you could confirm that this response resolves
the questions you raised in your comments [1] and [3].
