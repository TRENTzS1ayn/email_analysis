Thank you for you comment on XQuery 1.0.  I am answering your comment on
behalf of the XML Query WG.

The WG considered your comment and a similar comment [1] about the
optionality of certain axes in XQuery 1.0.  As explained in [2] we have
decided to not change the optionality of these axes in XQuery 1.0.

We would be grateful if you could confirm that this response resolves
the questions you raised in your comment.
