Section 2.6.1 Schema Import Feature
Editorial/Conformance

We would like to be able to do implicit schema imports (based on
externally associated schemata) while not supporting the import syntax.
We would like to have this option acknowledge here (it seems to be
possible based on implementation-defined ISSD). We propose adding the
following note:

Note: An implementation may provide implicit schema import by
initializing the static in-scope schema definitions with externally
provided schema information, even if the schema import feature is not
provided.
