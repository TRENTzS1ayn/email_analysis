Section 2.6.2 Static Typing Feature
Editorial

Please reword definition of static typing to positive formulation
(otherwise a static typing implementation does not need to report type
errors statically with current definition):

[Definition: An XQuery implementation that supports the Static Typing
Feature is required to raise type errors during the static analysis
phase.] Note that implmenentations that does not support the Static
Typing Feature is not required to raise type errors during the static
analysis phase. However, non-type-related static errors must be detected
and raised during the static analysis phase.
