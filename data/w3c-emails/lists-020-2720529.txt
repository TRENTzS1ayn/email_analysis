Why are the Flaggers mandated when providing extensions? This is
basically a parser option and should be left to the implementation. I
can always run somebody else's query that contains pragma since I can
ignore them (as can other implementations) and other implementations
will always flag extensions anyway. This seems to make the flagger only
an implementation nuisance.
