Section 3.2.1 Steps
Editorial

Please remove "The result of the filter step consists of all the items returned by the primary expression for which all the predicates are true. If no predicates are specified, the result is simply the result of the primary expression.": This has been said in paragraph before and is also falsely implying that you can use a na?ve conjunction of all the predicates. Also rewrite beginning of following sentence.
