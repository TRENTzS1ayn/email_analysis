I am sorry but I find the description of the rationale totally
unsatisfactory.
The status quo, having parent:: and << mandatory means that there are no
technical reasons for not having all the axis available.
The rewrites needed to "remove" expressions involving these axis are
purely syntactic, but much more easily done by a parser than by a human
since it has the tokens of the expression to hand.

this is likely to be  a crippling bar to interoperability between
xquery systems and between xquery and xpat.
