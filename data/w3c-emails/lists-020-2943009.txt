Hi Mike,

The XML Query and XSL Working Groups have considered the following comment:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Nov/0223.html

This is an official response from the Working Groups.

We agree that your proposed change would make optimization easier for many 
implementations, but it would also make position() behave differently for 
steps than it does for filter expressions. This non-orthogonality is just 
one more thing that a user needs to remember when using the language, and 
violates the general approach we have taken to designing the language. 
Therefore, we have decided not to make this change.

Please let us know if this is acceptable to you.

Thanks!

Jonathan
