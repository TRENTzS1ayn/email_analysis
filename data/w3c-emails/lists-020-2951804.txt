Hi Per,

The XML Query Working Group has considered the following message:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Nov/0300.html

The following is a response from the Working Group.

The Saxon output, of course, is wrong. We will clarify the XQuery spec to 
make it clear that XQuery treats the scope of namespaces the same way as XML.

We agree that the change you propose could simplify some implementations, 
but it would also mean that users could no longer cut XML text and paste it 
into their queries when they need to create literal XML. Instead, they 
would have to reorder the attribute list to ensure that namespace 
declaration attributes come first. We find this burdensome, and have 
decided not to implement the change you request.

Please let us know if this is acceptable to you.

Thanks!

Jonathan
