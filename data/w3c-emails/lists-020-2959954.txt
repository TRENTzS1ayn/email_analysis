Mark,

The XML Query Working Group has considered the following message:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Oct/0096.html

The following is a response from the Working Group.

> I believe XQuery is missing an important feature; the ability to
> serialize a document in URI form, so that the resulting URI may be used
> as an argument to the GET method.

The XML Query Working Group noted that there is already a standard method
for serializing strings (such as queries) as URIs: RFC 2396.  We
also already provide the escape-uri function to reflect this.

We have closed this issue for now; please let us know if this
disposition is not satisfactory.

Thanks!

Liam, pp. XML Query WG
