Dear Dana


The XML Query Working Group has considered the following message:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Jan/0088.html


The following is a response from the Working Group.

The Working group accepted your proposal and changes the value
comparison operators to return the empty sequence when one or both of
their arguments is an empty sequence.

Please let us know if this is acceptable to you.

Thanks!

Michael (this time speaking for the WG)
