I am replying to your request on behalf of the XML Query WG.

 

The WG considered your proposal and adopted the following solutions to
the problems you identified:

 

(a) "Setters" must occur at beginning of Prolog, in any order. Includes 

XMLSpace, Default Collation, Base URI, Validation Mode, Default Function
Namespace, and Default Element/Type Namespace 

 

Note: Your proposal did not include the default namespaces.

 

(b) All other parts of the Prolog then occur in any order, but
namespaces, types, and variables do not allow forward references. Only
function-names may be forward references. This rule is described by
stating that the static context for a variable initialization or
function body contains all functions but only those variables and
namespaces that are defined or imported earlier in the prolog.

 

We would be grateful if you could confirm that these changes resolve the
questions you raised in your comment.
