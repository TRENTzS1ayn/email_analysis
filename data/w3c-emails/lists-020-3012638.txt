XQuery 1.0: An XML Query Language
W3C Working Draft 12 November 2003

A.2.2 Lexical Rules

In some of the states, there are conflicts between some of the patterns,
i.e. cases in which the input could match more than one pattern.

Specifically:

OPERATOR:
conflict between QName and all the single-keyword patterns
(e.g., "external", "skip", "default").
(Luckily, this appears to have an easy fix: simply delete QName
from the state: I don't think it's valid here.)

KINDTEST:
conflict between QName and the keywords "context" & "global".

EXPR_COMMENT:
conflict between ExprCommentContent, PragmaContents,
and ExtensionContents.
(Fix: They're all defined to be Char, so you could just replace them
with Char in the EBNF and here.)

EXT_KEY:
conflict between QName and the keywords "pragma" & "extension".
