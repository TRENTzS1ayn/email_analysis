Hi Xavier,

This is a response to the following message, which you posted to the 
comments list:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Dec/0138.html

Your comment has been classified as editorial, and assigned to the relevant 
editors, who will take it into consideration. An editorial comment is one 
that does not change the language that is being specified (note that the 
use cases are not normative, and do not define the language - these are 
bugs in the document that need to be fixed). Please let me know if you 
believe that we have misclassified your issue.

Jonathan
