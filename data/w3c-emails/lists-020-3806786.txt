The OCCURRENCEINDICATOR State contains: input_stream.backup(1), which is 
undocumented.

(Formal comment for a known (since a few days after release of the draft) 
bug.  The input_stream.backup(1) action has to back the lexer up by one 
character in the OCCURRENCEINDICATOR state for anything that is not an 
occurance indicator, so that other operators besides "+" and "*" can be 
recognized as operators.  Another option for this is to reproduce all 
operator transitions in the OCCURRENCEINDICATOR state.)
