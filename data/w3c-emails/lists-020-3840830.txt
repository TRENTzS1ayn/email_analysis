Thanks for the comment, which will be processed by the working group.

I attach some personal observations on your comment.

Please note that section 3.3
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#extension-attributes

already permits such attributes, provided they are in a private
namespace.

I think you are right to recommend that users should document their
stylesheets in this kind of way, but I think (from previous discussions
concerning other parts of the language) the WG will be reluctant to add
elements or attributes to the language whose sole purpose is
documentation.
