Kenneth Stephen raised this comment {qt-2004Jan0000-01} at

I made a personal response at:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Jan/0003.html

The XSL Working Group considered the comment on 2004-01-20 and decided
to endorse my personal response. This recommends that we make no change
to the language specification, but strengthen the warning to
implementors and users of the dangers of allowing extension functions
that have side-effects.

Kenneth, can you please confirm that this action is sufficient to
resolve the comment?

Thank you for taking the time to comment on the specification.

Regards,

Michael Kay
