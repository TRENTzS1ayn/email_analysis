David Carlisle raised this comment at:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Dec/0120.html

The WG considered the comment on 2004-01-20 and agreed that the current
wording of the specification was inadequate and inconsistent.

The editor was actioned to provide revised wording, which the WG will
review. This needs to balance the need to provide interoperability by
requiring all XSLT processors to accept stylesheet modules in the form
of lexical XML documents, while also allowing the flexibility for
stylesheet modules to be provided in other forms, e.g. as a document in
the data model, or as a DOM, or as a lexical XML 1.1 document.

The intention is to allow stylesheet modules to be expressed as XML 1.1
documents, but not to require XSLT 2.0 processors to accept such
stylesheets.

We are leaving the comment open for the time being.

Regards,

Michael Kay
