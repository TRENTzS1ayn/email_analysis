Richard Zschech raised this comment {qt-2003Nov0055-01}:

The Working Group considered this proposal on 2004-01-20 and decided not
to add the new functionality requested.

There were a number of reasons:

(a) It would be difficult to make any kind of definitive statement of
what "short", "medium", and "long" were supposed to mean, other than by
example

(b) We don't currently have any functionality that depends explicitly on
the user's locale or localization preferences, and it would be difficult
to define this concept

(c) We felt the required functionality could easily be provided by a
function library sitting on top of the current date/time formatting
functionality that is already provided: in other words, it was non-core.

Richard: thank you for raising the comment. I would be grateful if you
could confirm that this response is acceptable.

Regards,

Michael Kay
