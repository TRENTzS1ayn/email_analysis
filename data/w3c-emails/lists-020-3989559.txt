Hi Scott.  Your last call comment in [1] has been given the ID 
qt-2004Jan0360-01.  This is the official response from the XQuery and XSLT 
working groups.

Your issue pertaining to the error in the XmlPI has been accepted, and the 
WGs have approved the fix you suggested.  The production will read:

[110]           XmlPI      ::=          "<?" PITarget (S Char*)? "?>"   /* 
ws: explicit */

(Since I am writing this to myself, this mail should also provide the 
confirmation that this fix is satisfactory!)

[XQuery] Missing S in XmlPI rule







There seems to be a missing S between PITarget and Char* in the rule for 
XmlPI in the spec:

Current rule:
XmlPI    ::=    "<?" PITarget  Char* "?>"

Should be:
XmlPI    ::=    "<?" PITarget  (S  Char*)? "?>"
