Hi Michael.  Your last call comment in [1] has been given the ID 
qt-2004Jan0242-01.  This is the official response from the XQuery and XSLT 
working groups.

All your suggested fixes concerning the removal of patterns from lexical 
recognition states have been implemented except for the removal of "," 
from the DEFAULT state (this broke the test "deep-equal(/,foo)", though no 
others).

Thank you for raising the comment.  I would be grateful if you would 
confirm that this provides an adequate resolution.

-scott
