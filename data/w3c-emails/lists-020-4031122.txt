Hi Sarah.  Your last call comment in [1] has been given the ID 
qt-2004Jan0340-01.  This is the official response from the XQuery and XSLT 
working groups.

This issue has also been raised by Michael Dyck in [2].

The relevant patterns now "pushState(OPERATOR)" when in non-element 
content, and "pushState"  in the ELEMENT_CONTENT state. Samples to test 
for this situation have been added to the regression tests for the test 
parser.

Thank you for raising the comment.  I would be grateful if you would 
confirm that this provides an adequate resolution.
