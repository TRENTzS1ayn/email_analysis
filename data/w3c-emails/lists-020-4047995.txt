  For the time being we are leaving the comment open. David, if you have
  any comments on the direction we are taking, please let us know.


Thanks for the detailed response.

If I think of anything else I'll reply on this thread, of course it
would be easier to think about interoperability between schema aware and
basic xslt processors if there were any schema aware processors to try.
It's very worrying that XSLT has got as far as last call with, as far as
I know, no schema-aware implementations available.

One thing that did occur to me was the interaction with forward
compatible processing. If the mechanisms for having safe compile time
guards becomes too complicated, it will be easier to just tell people
to put version="1001" on their xsl:stylesheet, as the main effect of
that is to make all these static errors dynamic. (It would also make
xsl:schema-import be ignored, even under the current working draft)

I don't think that faking a higher version number would be desirable,
and would no doubt lead to bad interoperabilty problems in the future if
you ever did produce an XSL version 1001, however I think the "forwards
compatible behaviour" model has proved useful and could be used here as
well, by essentially thinking of a schema-aware processor as version
2+epsilon (or, if you prefer, a basic xslt processor as 2-epsilon).
This would perhaps suggest a more implicit, and more global, switching
between dynamic and static errors than the explict guards suggested in
your mail, but here I'm just reporting "gut reaction" and don't have any
specific propsal at this time.

David
