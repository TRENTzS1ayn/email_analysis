I agree.

By the way, the history of this is that we tried the syntax proposed below 
before we had semicolons as separators between declarations in the prolog, 
and faced ambiguities. We then added semicolons to give ourselves this kind 
of flexibility - and then never got around to fixing variable declarations 
to take advantage of this. We still need to actually make this parse, but I 
see no difficulties now, and this would definitely improve the language.
