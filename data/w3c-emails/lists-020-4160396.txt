Hi,

I was surprised when I looked in the XQuery specification for a media
type definition, but couldn't find one.  I believe XQuery should have
its own.  FWIW, there's a TAG finding that seems to recommend it too;

"W3C Working Groups engaged in defining a language SHOULD arrange for
the registration of an Internet Media Type (defined in RFC 2046
[RFC2046]) for that language"

Thanks!

Mark.
