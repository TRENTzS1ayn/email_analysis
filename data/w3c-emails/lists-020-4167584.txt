Speaking for myself here, and not the WG...

Note that it's not generally enough to escape a query in a URI;
you'll need to decide whether to use CGI-style encoding, and if
so, what the variables should be called, and how to name a script
that interfaces to a query...

Or are you expecting a standardised WHEREIS query for a Web page?

Do I do,
http://www.example.org/collections/36/search.pl?query=XXXX
or do I do
http://www.example.org/~user/cgi-bin/q.cgi?srch=XXXX

The best I can suggest here is that you investigate WSDL and Web
Services for a more general mechanism than I believe XML Query
can or should provide.

Are you asking for the XML Query Specification to have a note saying
that queries can be put in a "GET" URL and escaped as per the URL
RFC?  Or that when embedded in a URL, queries must be escaped
according to the rules of said spec?  Doesn't that follow
automatically from HTTP and the URI/IRI spec?  I'm sorry if I'm
being slow -- I'm missing how interoperability is helped by a
more specific note.  How do you think we should proceed?

Thanks,

Liam
