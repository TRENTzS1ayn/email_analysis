David:
Thank you for pointing out the seemingly outdated reference to the
Character Model draft in 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Nov/0214.html

On further deliberation, we decided not to make the change to suggested
based on the rationale
spelled out by Paul Cotton in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Nov/0224.html

I trust you will find this resolution satisfactory.

All the best, Ashok
