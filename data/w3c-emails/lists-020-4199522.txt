And how to supply the values of external variables used by the query,
and how the base URI of the query is related to the URI in which it is
embedded, etc, etc.

The Query WG has set out to define a language, and not an API or
protocol for transmitting that language between clients and servers. I
think that embedding XQuery in a URI is one example of such a protocol,
and goes beyond the WG's charter.
