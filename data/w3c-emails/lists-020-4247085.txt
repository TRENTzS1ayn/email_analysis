I don't think that part needs to be standardized upon, at least not as
part of XQuery.  See below ...

In response to Michael, and as I earlier pointed out, the TAG has
"recommended" (or whatever weight you put behind their findings) that,
in general, queries be performed via GET.  See;

Not at all.

That depends on the form language.  What depends on the query language
is the "XXXX" and how that's encoded, I believe.  See below ...

Perhaps I should break down how I see it, as there's a few specs
simultaneously in play here;

1.  URI spec
2.  Forms language spec
3.  An instance of a form
4.  XQuery spec

#1, obviously, defines the URI syntax and generic semantics

#2 defines how form "questions" are presented, and "answers" encoded.
For GET forms, the encoding describes how the answer structure (e.g.
name value pairs) is encoded into a URI per the URI spec (e.g.
"?param=value&..." ala HTML).

#3 defines a specific parameter and type for a value (e.g. "xq" will
hold an "XQuery document") per the forms spec

So the role of #4, XQuery, needs to be to define a canonical
encoding for its documents to fit into the parameter value.  If URI
escaping is to be used, that's fine, but nothing in #s 1, 2, or 3,
says that this is the case.

I should add that the interplay I described there is current practice
per HTML and largely XForms, but need not be the only way this is
handled.  For example, #2 could have been done in #1.  Nonetheless, I
believe it to be a sound design.

Mark.
