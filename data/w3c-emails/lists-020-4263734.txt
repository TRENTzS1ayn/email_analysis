Dimitre:
Thank you for your comments in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Nov/0320.html

We are glad that you like the definition of fn:root().  However, we
could not find other functions that allow
node()* or item()* that you suggested should be changed.  If you can
make specific suggestions, the WGs would
be happy to consider them.

All the best, Ashok
