Personal response: 

I think you would stand a better chance of getting this proposal through
the working group if

(a) you stated a justification as to why you think this change is
beneficial (don't assume that the benefits are obvious)

(b) you made a proposal as to how the language should deal with the
resulting "dangling else" ambiguity.

(For my own part, I would have much prefered a syntax in which
expressions were self-closing, e.g. 

if (Expr) then Expr [else Expr] fi

But I lost that battle. I don't think it would be a good idea to make
"else" optional unless we introduce a mandatory closer to remove the
ambiguity.)
