This has been an issue in the past, and the WG decided against it, partly 
because it causes a choice conflict in the grammar (though this is a 
common thing with languages, and we can define some rules and live with 
it), and partly because the if statement has to return something, and so 
we would have to define the else to return an empty sequence.

consensus.]
