So you've built these lexical states, and you'd like to make them
non-normative, but you can't, because they might convey some information
not stated elsewhere. Only, you don't know if they do. Is that correct?
You don't actually know whether or not they're redundant?

It seems to me that that lack of knowledge alone means that you can't
risk making them normative. If in fact they're *not* redundant, and *do*
convey a restriction not stated elsewhere, it might be a restriction you
didn't intend. You don't know.

Do you intend to determine (before the next revision) whether or not
A.2.2 is redundant? (And if so, how?)
