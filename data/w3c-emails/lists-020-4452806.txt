A regrettable decision, though expected, that will leave the future
XML Query/XPath/XSLT2 user community with a
date/time/duration function set that is complex,
heavy to use, and large yet incomplete, probably
requiring non-standard extensions for practical applications.

I wish I had seen a rationale and use-cases
demonstrating the relevance of this choice.
