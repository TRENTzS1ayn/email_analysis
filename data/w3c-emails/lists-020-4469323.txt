The FLWOR construct is a new syntax which unlike IfExpr is a borrowed
grammar. FLWOR does not contend with a mindset precedence and
I don't think making the else clause optional necessitate a change on FLWOR.
Making the else clause optional does not in any way make
IfExpr any less as an expression. Making it mandatory does not
enhance its functional value either (even perceptively) but its redundancy
becomes a syntactic nuisance.

The balance to enforce IfExpr with a mandatory else clause doesn't feel
right. My sincere apologies for the seemingly painful revisit of IfExpr
but please reconsider.

I agree - since there are many ways a FLWR expression can start, it's
hard to come up with a closer that feels right.
