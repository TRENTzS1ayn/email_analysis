What? Then how does it handle something like this?

    validate strict context type(po:Address) { <zip>90952</zip> }

After "validate strict", the lexer is in KINDTEST. If you don't have a
transition on "context", the lexer will have to read "context" as a
QName, which will lead to a (bogus) syntax error.

(It would  be better if the EXT_CONTENT state were placed after the
EXT_NAME state.)

Apart from the KINDTEST problem, yes.
