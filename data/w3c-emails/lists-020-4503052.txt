Hi Scott

The current working draft grammar is much better than a year ago when I had
some
difficulties constructing an LALR grammar and I think I pointed out the need
to reserve
function  names. It's now almost trivial, so while you say you have an LL
grammar you actually have a better LALR(1) one.

I have now trimmed my NiceXSL grammar of which XPath is a part, so that
I can verify the ambiguity issues. The grammar is attached. It requires
just one %prec to resolve the leading "/" problem. (The inlining of a number
of single-use productions was necessary to avoid a 65535 byte count limit
in the generated NceXSL parser. I don't think it makes any difference to
the grammar ambiguity.)

There is no dangling-else ambiguity with "if", because the "else" clause
is not optional.

Thgere is no function call ambiguity with "if", because "if" is not a valid
function name.

So the EBNF needs just one <..> grouping to resolve leading "/".

Regards

Ed Willink
