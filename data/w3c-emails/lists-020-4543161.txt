Thanks Ed, I'll take a detailed look at your cup file over the next couple 
of weeks, it should be very useful.  I'm also working on a test CUP parser 
that is generated from the grammar XML source (I hope to have fairly 
functionally equivalent javacc, byaccj, CUP, and antlr versions).  It will 
be interesting to compare your cup grammar with the generated one for 
various properties, and to see what opportunities for simplification in 
the spec might be made more apparent.
