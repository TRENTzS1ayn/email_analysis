Hi Folks,

[If this has already been answered, or this is not the appropriate venue
for the question then please direct me to the  appropriate place.]

In the latest XPath 2.0 spec it defines a quantified expression as
follows:

QuantifiedExpr ::= (("some" "$") | ("every" "$")) VarName "in"
ExprSingle ("," "$" VarName "in" ExprSingle)*
"satisfies" ExprSingle

And ExprSingle is defined as follows:

 ExprSingle ::= ForExpr
              | QuantifiedExpr
              | IfExpr
              | OrExpr

I do not believe that this is correct.  Here is one of the examples that
is given in the discussion on quantified
expressions:

every $part in //part satisfies $part/@discounted

The satisfies expression in the example is: $part/@discounted

Clearly, it is neither a ForExpr, a QuantifiedExpr, an IfExpr, nor an
OrExpr.

In fact, wherever SingleExpr appears in the quantified expression it
makes no sense.

Can someone provide the correct BNF for the quantified expression?
/Roger
