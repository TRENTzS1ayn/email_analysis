I wonder whether the WG members have ever tried to write *real* 
applications with XQ!
Do they think it is acceptable that a query exits with a fatal error 
just because
  of an unsuccessful attempt to open a document ?
I wrote a small yet real application (300 lines to generate my web site 
from bare XML content)
and I found simply indispensible to add something.
It took me less than 10 minutes to implement  the function 
catch-error(expression, fallback)

Frankly speaking, I would say that a V1.0 without a proper error 
handling is *not* completed.

I don't want it to be silent, this is just a desperate solution in case 
no catching mechanism
is introduced.
Another solution is to add functions like test-doc-access() to check a 
possible
error before trying doc(), but this is poor design.
