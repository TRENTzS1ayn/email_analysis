Dear XML Query and XSL Working Groups,

I'm sorry for the delay of this message.

The I18N WG (Core TF) has looked at my comments sent to you at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0389.html and
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0415.html.

In these comments, I wrote:

These comments have not yet been approved by the I18N WG. Please
treat them as personal comments (unless and) until they are approved
by the I18N WG.

The I18N WG (Core TF) has approved these comments, with the following
additions/changes:

For http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0389.html:
- The subject should be [XPath], not [XPointer].
- For comment [10], the WG(s) should carefully consider where a generic
   reference is needed (for which the newest version of the spec should be
   used) and where a specific reference is needed (for which a reference
   to that specific version should be used). For more considerations, please
   see Section 8 of the Character Model, at
   http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-charmod-20040225/#sec-RefUnicode.

For http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0415.html:
For comment [14], add: or at least, the name of the collation should be
                        changed from 'eng-us' to 'en-us', to be in line with
                        RFC 3066 language tags.

So please change the origin of these comments from myself to the
I18N WG, with the above tweaks.

Regards,    Martin.
