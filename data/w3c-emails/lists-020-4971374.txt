This version preserves the feature that the presence of a comment or PI
affects the result (as explictly mentioned in a note).
I find this rather regrettable and the function would be a lot more
useful if adjacent text nodes in the sequence of element-or-text node
children of elements or document nodes were merged. This is slightly
verbose to write out as XPath but as the function is now being defined
by prose text, that is less of an issue.

On the other hand, the function will so rarely be useful, as almost
always you will need to write a specific equality function that captures
the information important in a particular context, that I do not think
I wish to hold up the process by formally objecting to this resolution
of my last call comment. I can live with this result, this function
(like so many others in XPath2, regrettably) will just be part of the
"excess bloat" that accounts for much of Xpath2.

"satisfied" is putting it too strongly:-) but I don't formally object.
However if the definition could be modified so that adjacent text nodes
are merged, that would be an improvement, I think.

Thanks for your consideration of my comments,

David
