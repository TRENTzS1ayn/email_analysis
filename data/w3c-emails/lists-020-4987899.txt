In your note http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/1230.html you requested that F&O functions that operate on URIs and now take strings as arguments be callable with an anyURI without error.

In San Jose on 4/13/2004 we accepted a proposal to allow promotion from anyURI to string. I trust that is satisfactory. 

All the best, Ashok
