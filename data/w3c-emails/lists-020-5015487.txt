Subject
Cast/constructor should allow empty sequence.






Don, Michael:
We discussed your comments 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Mar/0211.html 
and 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Mar/00891.html 
in San Jose and agreed to make the following changes:

1. The constructor functions should accept the empty sequence.  If the 
empty sequence is passed to a constructor function, the empty sequence is 
returned.
2. The cast syntax allows the type name to specify whether an empty 
sequence is acceptable.  If it is, and the expression to be cast is the 
empty sequence,  the empty sequence is returned.  If the empty sequence is 
not allowed and the expression to be cast is the empty sequence, a type 
error is raised.

Please confirm that this is satisfactory.

All the best, Ashok
