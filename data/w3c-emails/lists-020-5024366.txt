In http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0910.html Steve Buxton requested that
we define 'collation'

I did some research and tried to find a definition but did not
find anything satisfactory.  Here's an attempt at a definition.
Please comment.

A collation is an artefact that assigns a sort order for every codepoint or sequence of codepoints.  The sort order is implementation dependent and can vary widely.  The sort order may or may not distinguish between lower and 
upper-case variants of codepoints or accented and unaccented versions of codepoints.  It may also choose to ignore punctuation between certain codepoints. 

All the best, Ashok
