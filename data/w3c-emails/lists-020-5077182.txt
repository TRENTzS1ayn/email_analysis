Hi Folks,
 
I have finished reading the November XSLT 2.0 specification.  Below are my
comments.
 
Section 9.2
 
However, it is permissible for the default value to be depend on the values
...
 
Typo: it should read: ... default value to depend ... (delete "be")
 
Section 9.5
 
... which it references in an attribute value template.
 
Typo: it should read: ... which is referenced in ... (replace "it" with
"is", add a "d" to reference)
 
Section 10.1
 
format="{$format}"/>
 
Typo: it should be: format="{$equation-format"/> (the variable is
equation-format, not format)
 
Section 6.4
 
No matter how many times I read this sentence, I am not able to figure out
what it's saying:
 
Next, all matching template rules that have lower priority than the matching
template rule or rules with the highest priority are eliminated from
consideration. 
 
Section 14
 
This whole section is extremely tough reading.  Without the excellent
examples I would have no idea what the section is saying.  I'm afraid that I
can't specifically nail down the trouble I had.  In general, I felt like it
jumped into the details before giving a good general understanding of what
the capability was all about.
 
/Roger
