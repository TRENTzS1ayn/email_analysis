Andre Cusson raised a comment at:

Our reference: qt-2004Feb0160-01

The XSL WG debated this comment over a period of time and decided on 20th
May to accept a proposal along essentially the lines suggested in the
original comment.

The effect is that all the serialization attributes defined on xsl:output
are now also defined on xsl:result-document. With the exception of
use-character-maps, they can all be AVTs. (This exception ensures that a
composite character map can always be constructed at compile time.) The
ability for xsl:result-document to reference a named output format remains,
and the attributes defined on xsl:result-document override (or in the case
of cdata-section-elements and use-character-maps, supplement) the attributes
in the base output definition.

Andre, I trust you will find this a satisfactory outcome.
