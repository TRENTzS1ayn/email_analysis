[...]
| 2.1 Accessing unparsed entities
|
| In section 6.1
|
| Document nodes have a [unparsed-entities] property, which is a sequence of
| entities. They also have accessors "dm:unparsed-entity-system-id" and
| "dm:unparsed-entity-public-id". So there are ways to query the
| system/public id of a given entity. Wouldn't it be useful to have an
| accessor that exposes all entities within a document node?
|
| Propose to introduce:
|
| dm:unparsed-entities($node as document()) as xs:string*
|
| and optionally:
|
| dm:unparsed-entity-system-ids($node as document()) as xs:string*
| dm:unparsed-entity-public-ids($node as document()) as xs:string*
|
| (If the above 2 are introduced, then the processor must guarantee the order
| of the entities is the same for all 3 accessors.)

Thank you for your comment. The WGs have discussed this matter and concluded
that the existing accessors are adequate for the unparsed entity use cases.

The WGs have no plans to add any additional accessors.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
