Know a Veteran? Disabled Veteran? Know a Serviceman?
Write your congressman.  They can be contacted at: 
http://www.house.gov/writerep/  

This is where you can make a real difference especially, if your congress representative  is listed as one of the committee members below.

Your local congress reprepresentative can also co-sponsor the bill.  Write to see if you can get them involved.

This should not be a political issue it should be a bipartisan issue, Political party affiliation should not be holding this bill back.
 
If you have already signed ourpetition and you know of others that would want to help pass it on.

11/17/2003: Referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
This Bill is sitting in the Committee on Veterans' Benefits, since January 2004.

This is a critical issue for disabled veterans, there is a petiton attached, take a  few moments sign them and pass them on to everyone you know, it is a petition allowing veterans to hire an attorney to represent them for their va claims.

It is only right, that veterans have the same rights as citizens.  Even the IRS allows attorney representation for individuals.

Veterans are both individuals and citizens.

They are entitled to Due Process, as a citizen.

Several Veterans Advocates have responed back stating they agree with this bill, however they would like to have dollar limits and percentage limits, that attorneys could charge.  Additionally, they feel the services they provide are free and the veteran should use them for filing claims.    I agree with the veterans advocates, they do a great service for veterans.  However, I believe, the veteran should have a right to attorney representation, if things aren't going well in their claim, and he or she feels that is it necessary.   Veterans should have the right to choose, who is going to represent them.

Feel free to express your opinion on this petition site and write your congress representatives.   Hopefully, it will be presented to Congress, and your opinions could result in a meaning bill for veterans attorney representation.
