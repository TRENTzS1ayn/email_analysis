Hi, Steve.

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working 
Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization:

     Thank you for your comment.

     The XSL and XML Query Working Groups discussed your comment.  The 
working groups agreed that the first paragraph of section 4 was intended 
to place a requirement on the serialization process that it must produce a 
well-formed entity (a document entity or external general parsed entity, 
as appropriate), unless it is unable to do so because of the effect of the 
character expansion phase of serialization.  Otherwise, a serialization 
error results.

     In response to your comment and a related comment on the first three 
paragraphs of section 4, the working groups decided to make clear the 
intent of the first and third paragraphs of section 4 by making the 
following changes:

- in the first sentence of the third paragraph, change "and the"
  to "then", to make it clear the conditions under which a
  document entity will be the result of the serialization process.

- change the wording to make it clear that these rules describe
  requirements on the processor, rather than on the user.  The
  processor will be required to produce a serialization error if
  it is unable to produce a well-formed entity of the appropriate
  kind, unless that is because of the action of the character
  expansion phase of serialization.

     As this seems to be in agreement with your proposed rewording, and a 
representative of Oracle was present when this decision was made, I will 
assume the response is acceptable.

Thanks,

Henry [On behalf of the XSL and XML Query Working Groups]
