Hello,

     In [1], I submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working 
Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization on behalf of IBM:

     The XSL and XML Query Working Groups discussed the comment, and 
decided to remove this rule about whitespace in attributes for the xhtml 
output method.  All the other rules for describing the formatting 
requirements of the xhtml output method are strictly under the control of 
the processor, but in this case, the user has control of the content of 
the data model instance that is to be serialized, so the serialization 
process should just leave that to the user's control.  Instead, the rule 
will be replaced with a non-normative reference to the compatibility 
appendix of XHTML as guidance to the user. 

     This note announces and acknowledges that decision.

Thanks,

Henry [On behalf of the XSL and XML Query Working Groups]
