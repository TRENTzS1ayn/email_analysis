I have concerns about making this change. If a function is declared to
accept an argument declared as "$i as xs:integer", then I don't think
calling it with xs:integer(foo) should ever fail with a type error. Our
normal convention is that when a type name is used with no occurrence
indicator, it means "exactly one".
