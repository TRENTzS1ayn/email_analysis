I think those assumptions are true for the Unicode Collation.

I think that (generary speaking) it is false
for the Unicode Collation because of Contextual  Sensitivity.

I think I did mistake assuming that having the Unicode Collation
in XSLT is our goal. I don?t  think that I have any points to prove,
if it the case.
