The mathematician in me is required to reply with a proof that contains()
can never satisfy such a property.  The problem is that equality is
reflexive (symmetric), while string containment is not.

Assume contains(A, B) is true if and only if collation(A) = collation(B) is
true.  Then consider any two strings A and B such that contains(A, B) is
true but contains(B, A) is not (for example, "a" and "aa").  By the
hypothesis, contains(A, B) implies collation(A)=collation(B), but then by
the collation(B) = collation(A) so by hypothesis contains(B, A) is true, a
contradiction.

Therefore there cannot exist a collation for which contains(A, B) is true if
and only if collation(A) = collation(B).  [Note that this proof holds
regardless of what value space the collation maps into.]
