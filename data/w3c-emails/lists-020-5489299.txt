In the functions and operators document, section 7.5.4.1, the function 
fn:substring-before has the following error:

Definition:
|fn:substring-before|(|$arg1|| as ||xs:string?|, 
|$arg2|| as ||xs:string?|)| as ||xs:string|
|Behavior description: |
||If the value of |$arg2| is the zero-length string, then the function 
returns the zero-length string.
Example given:
|fn:substring-before("Baloney!","")| returns "|Baloney!|".

In the example, $arg2 is given as the 0 length string, however this 
returns the word Baloney. The behavioral description states that it 
should return the 0 length string. Am I misunderstanding?

Thanks,
Doug
