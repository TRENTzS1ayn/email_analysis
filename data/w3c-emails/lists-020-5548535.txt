Igor,

I'm not completely convinced that the collation itself defines how matching 
is done.  I think that the rules for matching are heavily influenced (even 
determined) by the semantics of the collation, but I think that the act of 
matching involves string comparisons, which is covered by my proposed 
definition of "collation".

In fact, I recently analyzed that very situation and believe that my 
analysis supports my statement above.  The secret seems to be in carefully 
reading the definitions for comparisons and matching in Unicode Technical 
Report #10, especially the definition for 'minimal matching', coupled with 
an understanding of 'ignorable collation elements'.

Once those are understood, I agree with you that the definitions of 
fn:contains, fn:starts-with, fn:ends-with, fn:substring-before and 
fn:substring-after are pretty obvious.

Hope this helps,
    Jim
