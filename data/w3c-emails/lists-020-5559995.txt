I would agree with such interpretation as long as we define the matching
rules
somewhere else. (Matching rules were described in the "collation" part of
the Unicode specs though). If we allow several matching rules to be legal,
then the "matching" functions (fn:contains, fn:starts-with, fn:ends-with,
fn:substring-before and fn:substring-after) should have another parameter
which defines a matching rule, which should used.
