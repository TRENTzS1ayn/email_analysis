     Thank you for pointing out this error.  The editors of the various 
XQuery and XSLT specifications decided that the appropriate term to use 
when speaking of a value is "instance of the data model", and that the 
term "data model" should be used only when speaking of that specification.

     I have applied this editorial change throughout the Serialization 
specification.

Thanks,

Henry
