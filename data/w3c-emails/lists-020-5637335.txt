Steve,

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working 
Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization.

     In response to your comment, I applied an editorial change to rename 
the section that was previously entitled "XML output method: the 
omit-xml-declaration Parameter" to "XML Output Method: the 
omit-xml-declaration and standalone Parameters".  I believe that should 
make it clear that the standalone parameter is applicable to the xml 
output method.

     Thank you for submitting your comment.

Thanks,

Henry
