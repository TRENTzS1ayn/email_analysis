Steve,

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the Last Call Working 
Draft of XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization.

     Thank you for pointing out the potential difficulty in parsing this 
sentence.

     I have reworded the clause as follows:  "Additional namespace nodes 
may be present in the new tree if the serialization process did not 
undeclare one or more namespaces. . . ."  Note that "undeclared" has 
become "did not undeclare" in response to a substantive comment.  I hope 
you will find that the new version is not so difficult to parse.

Thanks,

Henry
