Re: issue qt-2003Dec0166-01

David Carlisle suggested changing the values returned by certain system
properties from "yes" and "no" to "true" and "false".

 

The XSL WG discussed this and decided that the proposed change would be
undesirable, because the effective Boolean value of the string "false" is
true (as in XPath 1.0). So a user writing <xsl:if
test="system-property('xsl:is-schema-aware')"> would always go down the
"true" path.

 

David, I would be grateful if you could confirm that this is OK.

 

Regards,
