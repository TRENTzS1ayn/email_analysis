This comment from Michael Smith requested the addition of documentary
attributes to <xsl:output-character>

 

The Working Group reviewed the comment on 26 Feb 2004 and endorsed my
earlier unofficial response: there is a general mechanism for adding extra
documentary attributes to any XSLT element (in a user-defined namespace),
and the WG considers that this mechanism meets the stated requirement.

 

Thank you for raising the comment, Michael. Could you please confirm that
this resolution is acceptable?
