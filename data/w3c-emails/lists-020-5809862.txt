Issue: qt-2004Jan0350-01

 

See:

This comment proposed the addition of rules requiring an overriding
definition of a variable, template, or function to declare a type consistent
with the type of the object being overridden.

 

For the record, this proposal has been withdrawn after WG review. On
examination, such rules proved too restrictive; and in cases where the type
is incompatible with the overridden object, this will usually result in a
type error being reported at the point where the object is referenced or
used.
