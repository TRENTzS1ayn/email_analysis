qt-2004Jan0019-03 : [XSLT2.0] Add lang attribute to xsl:decimal-format

 

This relates to "Suggestion 3" in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Jan/0019.html

 

The XSL Working Group reviewed this suggestion on 26 February. The group
felt that although it might be "nice to have", it was a feature that was not
essential to satisfy any known requirement or to fix a pressing problem, and
that we should therefore not include this feature in this version of the
specification.

 

I would be grateful if you could confirm that you can live with this
decision.

 

Many thanks for making the comment,

 

Michael Kay

For the XSL WG
