Gentlepeople,

I might be the last person on the planet who doesn't know how to deal with 
this message, but I don't know...

Fairly recently, I started getting messages from Norm Walsh with these 
".ems" attachments, but Norm's open when I click on the attachment (giving 
me a PGP warning box that I can just close).

However, this particular message (from Michael Smith) contains a ".ems" 
attachment that I cannot open at all.  When I click on the attachment, I 
get a dialog box that says "The message/data contains a detached 
signature"; when I click "OK", the dialog box goes away, but the message's 
attachment doesn't open.  Thus, I am completely unable to read the message.

If I'm doing something stupid, or failing to do something obvious, I 
apologize for this query (and would appreciate guidance!).  If it's not 
just me, may I request that messages to the public QT comments list not be 
hidden from WG members no better educated than I?

Sorry!
   Jim
