There is this "Michael Kay" guy who seems to disagree with you:
"XSLT Programmer's Reference", 1st edition, page 220:
"A stylesheet must not directly or indirectly include itself."

Some guy with the same name is listed as editor of "XSL Transformations
(XSLT) Version 2.0 - W3C Working Draft 12 November 2003" which says:
"[ERR XT0180] It is a static error if a stylesheet module directly or 
indirectly includes itself." and
"[ERR XT0210] It is a static error if a stylesheet module directly or 
indirectly imports itself."

Or are we talking about different things?

It's not just formal semantics, but *static* semantics.  XQuery supports
lexical scoping and static type-checking; XSLT has neither.  I'm sure
one *can* do lexical scoping and static type-checking with mutually
dependent modules (C does it, sort-of), but I'm also sure that the
drafts I've seen don't come close to a consistent or workable
specification, formal or informal.
