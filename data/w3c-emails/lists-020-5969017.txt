Hi Jonathan,
Regarding comment 1b, we do not believe it's an editorial comment.    The
specific substantive request being made is that QT consider using schema
context paths as the (no longer implementation-dependent) type ids for
anonymous types.
Thanks  -

Hi Lisa,

I think the placement of parentheses is significant here:

So there are two kinds of types - named types and anonymous types.

These are not "names" in our terminology - they are expressions used for
matching types. Is there a specific request here?

For now, I am classifying this comment as editorial.
