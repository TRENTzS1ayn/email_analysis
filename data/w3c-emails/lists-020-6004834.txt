OK.  However, XQuery has static binding of names *within* each module,
and we should be able to separately compile a library module.  In XSLT
you don't static name binding in the normal sense, and while you might
be able to do some kind of separate compilation it would have to leave
a lot of name binding until run-time.

I was thinking of each .c file as a module.  Two .c files can
reqursively reference definitions in each other.  And there is
information hiding between .c files.  Include files provide a (manual,
unenforced) machanism for "interface files".

Either than, or some subset we're confident is well-defined, can be
easily implemented, and can be extended to the "all-dancing" module
system we want.

In that case, for the next version I'd lobby for my "local:" prefix
for non-exported definitions.
