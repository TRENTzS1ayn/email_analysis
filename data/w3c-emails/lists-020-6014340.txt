# 
# OK.  However, XQuery has static binding of names *within* each module,
# and we should be able to separately compile a library module.  In XSLT
# you don't static name binding in the normal sense, and while you might
# be able to do some kind of separate compilation it would have to leave
# a lot of name binding until run-time.

I would imagine that most XSLT processors do indeed bind the names of
variables and templates/functions statically; but it's true that the module
mechanism isn't designed to facilitate separate compilation. However, I
don't think separate compilation is at all impossible within the XSLT model,
it just needs (as you imply) rather more work at link time (which might be
the same as run-time).
