(IBM-FO-029): Section 9.6.2, "fn:adjust-date-to-timezone": In this 
section, the "summary" paragraph is followed by 7 rules. Rules 5 and 7 
seem redundant. Both rules deal with the case where $timezone is not 
empty. Probably the last rule was intended to deal with the case where 
$arg has a timezone and $timezone also contains a timezone. The last rule 
should be rewritten to correctly describe this case.
