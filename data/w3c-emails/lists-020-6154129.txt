(IBM-FO-038): Section 15.2.1 (fn:deep-equal) has many problems. The text 
that begins "Return true if the two nodes have names that compare equal" 
does not match the code that follows it. It's not clear why the case 
dealing with document nodes is surrounded by comment delimiters. The code 
contains various syntax errors (if with no else, missing parens after 
"not", "return" used improperly, etc. Clearly nobody has ever tried to 
parse this code.
