(IBM-FO-040): Sections 15.3.3 (fn:max) and 15.3.4 (fn:min): In both of 
these sections, all the examples except the first one are syntactically 
invalid because they pass many arguments to a function that accepts only 
one argument. This needs to be fixed by enclosing the argument sequence in 
parentheses. Also, in each of these sections, the fifth bulletted example 
is missing a right-parenthesis at the end of the function parameters. 
Also, the third bulletted example in each section claims it can return 
either an integer or a double. But the text says that all numeric values 
are promoted to a "single common type", implying that (for example) max(5, 
5.0e0) will always be of type xs:double.
