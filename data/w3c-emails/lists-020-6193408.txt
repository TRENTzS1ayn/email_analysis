(IBM-FO-041): Section 15.3.5 (fn:sum): Second paragraph says that "The items
in the resulting sequence may be reordered in an arbitrary order." I don't
think this is relevant to the fn:sum function. 

--Don Chamberlin

 

It is relevant because the sum of a sequence is not necessarily the same as
the sum of a permutation of that sequence, given that type promotion and
underflow conditions may occur as you proceed.
