Unless there is a good reason not to, please provide a schema document
for the xmlns:xdt="http://www.w3.org/2003/11/xpath-datatypes"
namespace, containing at least the definitions for
xdt:yearMonthDuration and xdt:dayTimeDuration, to facilate their use
by schema authors.

I would recommend that such a schema document should appear both as a
normative appendix to one of the spec. documents _and_ as an
independent document at the namespace URI, i.e. at

 http://www.w3.org/2003/11/xpath-datatypes.xsd

The latter document should be governed by the W3C policy for
namespace-related documents, reference available on request.
