We have observed a welcome trajectory over drafts of the Data Model to
reduce the distance between its core and the W3C Infoset
Recommendation.  We actually see no remaining impediment to completing
this and actually identifying the Data Model explicitly as an
extension of the Infoset.  This would probably need to be done on two
levels: the first, in the spirit of the PSVI, adding new properties
and possibly new information items, the second adding accessors.

Although in one way this might seem to be a purely editorial request,
or at best a rhetorical one, we actually think participating in the
use of the Infoset abstraction in this way will actually make the
Query specs stronger and simpler.

A major advantage of adopting this suggestion, connected to our
previous comment XSCH-QL-018 [1] about 'validate' expressions, is that
the need for serialization in the definition of validation goes away
-- infosets are by definition validatable as such.
