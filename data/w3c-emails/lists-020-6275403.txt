[minor editorial]

In section 1. Introduction, 2nd paragraph, we have,
    The Query Working Group has identified a requirement for both a
    human-readable query syntax and an XML-based query syntax

In fact the Requirements document does not talk about a
"human-readable" syntax, and does not discuss a concept that the
non-XML syntax is intended for human consumption and the XML syntax
is intended only for machine use (not human readable).

There are people who consider that at least some XML documents - for
example, XSLT stylesheets - can be read by humans.

I suggest using the terms "XML syntax" and "non-XML syntax".

Thanks,

Liam
