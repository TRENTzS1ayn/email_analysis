The Web Serice Description Language (WSDL) [1] provides a facility for
describing Web services - a WSDL document could be thought of as an
XML description of a set of function signatures.

Some XML Query implementations will very likely support the idea
of calling such functions in XPath expressions.

Would it increase interoperability of such implementations if
one could explicitly associate a namespace prefix with a WSDL
document in the XML Query Prolog?

For example,
    import service cvt at "http://example.org/wsdl/cvt.wsdl";

and then, in the body of the query, one might be able to use
    cvt:convert("F", "C", 23.6)
to convert between temperatures.

An alternative to extending the prolog might be to extend access
to an implementation's underlying URI resolver, so that users
could implement WSDL support in XQuery directly.

However, interoperability and integration between specifications
is important to the W3C.
