There are several problems with such an approach:

1. Often, the Infoset is considered an abstract description of parser
output. Thus an extension with the necessary informations may be not
acceptable for this camp. 

2. The data model is based on the XPath 1.0 data model that uses most of
the terminology (in particular "node"). The XPath/XQuery community has
repeatedly expressed disdain on using the Infoset terminology to
describe the data model.

3. There are a couple of properties that are not that easy to add to the
Infoset. Examples: Notion of nodeid (mainly philosophical issues when to
instantiate such a concept on the infoset), atomic values, even some of
the PSVI abstractions.

4. There are issues with the relationship of typed values, comments,
PIs, character information items and text nodes.

5. This comment has a very large impact on the data model document and
other documents and is therefore of high risk to the specification and
progressing. Since it has mainly definitional impact and would not
change the semantics, I feel this is too risky an undertaking before we
progress into Recommendation.

Having said all of that, I can see the value of a general evaluation of
the notion of the Infoset, PSVI and data model and would support an
effort inside the W3C to get to a single model AFTER XQuery 1.0 has been
released.

Michael (speaking for myself)
