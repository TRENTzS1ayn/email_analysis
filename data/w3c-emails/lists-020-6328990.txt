I commented about the lack of meaning of this definition. If they remove
the phrase "or more typically, an expression that evaluates to a
sequence", then this whole function becomes useless to them. Their idea is
that the argument *must* be an expression, which is not yet evaluated. The
fact that such an expression is passed as argument to fn:unordered will
tell the processor (!) that it is allowed not to preserve order and to
produce an unordered result...

The purely formal problem with this function definition is that there is
no "expression" data type in the DM, therefore, they can only explain it
in plain English...

Of course, this is absolutely incorrect!

I propose once again that this function definition be removed from the
document. All other arguments put aside, the mere failure of the attempt
to define it correctly is a very strong indicator that this is simply not
a function.
