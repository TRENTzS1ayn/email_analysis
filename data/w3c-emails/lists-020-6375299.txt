To: XML Query Comments<public-qt-comments@w3.org>


We are considering a proposal from Mary Fernandez and Michael Rys that addresses most of the issues I raised in the following message:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0176.html

I have agreed to close the above issue in favor of a smaller one:

For any named type assigned for a node by XML Schema in the PSVI, the XML Query Data Model should contain the same named type. The proposal under consideration almost achieves this, but not for untyped attributes. To me, this is a coordination issue, and may require discussion among Working Groups.
