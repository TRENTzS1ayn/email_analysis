Subject: [F&O] resolve-QName function, $element as empty sequence


The description of the resolve-QName function says that the error
"invalid
lexical value" is raised if $element is the empty sequence.  This seems
to
be the wrong error message.  Perhaps "no namespace found for prefix"
would
be more appropriate?

I'm also not sure I understand why the function signature even allows
$element to be the empty sequence, if the processor automatically raises
an
error when it is the empty sequence.
 
Thanks,
Priscilla Walmsley
