Dimitre,

This is a personal response, and has not been seen, much less approved, by 
the Query WG.

The Query WG is considering some proposed changes to the facilities related 
to "unordered" in XQuery/XPath.  It's too soon to tell precisely what 
outcome will result, but I feel personally confident that the situation 
will not remain as it is.  The results might be more favorable to you than 
the current situation.

Watch this space!
    Jim
