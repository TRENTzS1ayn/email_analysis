The rules in section 4.3 concerning whitespace stripping in source documents
do not define what is meant by a source document.

 

Traditionally in 1.0 these rules applied to the principal source document
and to documents loaded using the document() function. They did not apply to
documents supplied in stylesheet parameters or returned from extension
functions.

 

We need to decide what to do about documents returned by doc() or
collection(). It would make sense to apply the same rules as for document();
however, the semantics of doc() and collection() are not defined in the XSLT
specification, so this might be tricky.
