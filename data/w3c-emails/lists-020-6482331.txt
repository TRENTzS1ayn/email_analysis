Michael,
Thanks for pointing out that the XQuery spec defines a query as a string 
of Unicode characters. Of course, you are right.

Nevertheless, the Query Working group reconsidered comment MS-XQ-LC1-051 
at our face-to-face meeting on March 5, 2004, and reaffirmed our decision 
that we will continue to support character references and predefined 
entity references inside string literals. We feel that these features are 
helpful to users who need to represent characters that are not commonly 
found on keyboards. We want users to be able to represent international 
characters without depending on the existence of keyboard drivers for 
specific languages.

Regards, 
--Don Chamberlin

Whaaa? 

http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/#id-basics says:

    The basic building block of XQuery is the expression,
    which is a string of Unicode characters.
