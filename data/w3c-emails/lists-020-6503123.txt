     I need a clarification on this comment.  When you speak of "Namespace 
binding generation", are you speaking of the process of actually creating, 
given a namespace node, the characters for an attribute in the serialized 
result of the form xmlns:pre="uri" or xmlns="uri"?  Or are you speaking of 
the process of ensuring that, given an element or attribute node whose 
name is in a particular namespace, a namespace node for that namespace URI 
exists?

     Thanks to you and the XML Schema WG for this comment.

Thanks,

Henry
