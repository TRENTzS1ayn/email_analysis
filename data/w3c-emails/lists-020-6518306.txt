Section 1.7 
Editorial

The spec says:"The namespace prefix for these functions and datatypes
can vary, as long as the prefix is bound to the correct URI.

The URIs of the namespaces are:

http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema for constructors

http://www.w3.org/2003/11/xpath-functions for functions.

http://www.w3.org/2003/11/xpath-datatypes for the datatypes."

It is not clear what the meaning of the URIs are. The schema and the
xpath-datatype namespace both are used for the types and the
constructors. It would be better to say 

" The following prefixes and namespace URIs are being used:

The prefix xs is bound to http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.

The prefix fn is bound to http://www.w3.org/2003/11/xpath-functions.

The prefix xdt is bound to http://www.w3.org/2003/11/xpath-datatypes."
