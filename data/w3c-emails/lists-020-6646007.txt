Section 15.2.1 fn:deep-equal
Technical

This function is complex and not very useful since there are many
different useful semantics. We recommend removing this function. Most
use-cases (such as groupby) that seem to require a deep-equal are
actually better served by a user-provided Skolem function (see
information integration and semi-structured database research).
