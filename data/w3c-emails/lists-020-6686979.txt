Section 15.4.4 fn:doc
Editorial/Technical

The following sentence (and remainder) should be removed and/or
rewritten: "The data resulting from the retrieval action is then parsed
as an XML document and a tree is constructed in accordance with the
[XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Data Model]. " The URI may point to a
pre-parsed document and the current wording implies that the function
needs to perform the parsing.
