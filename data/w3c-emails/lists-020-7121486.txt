The formal semantics of the following:: axis is
incorrect when applied to an attribute node as
it excludes the children of the node in which the
attribute is contained.  

The formal definition should be changed to:

[following:: NodeTest] ==

[ancestor-or-self::node()/following-sibling::node()/descendant-or-self::NodeTest
 union
 typeswitch
 case attribute() return parent::node()/child::NodeTest
 default return ()
]
