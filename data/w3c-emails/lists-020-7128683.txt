Hi Jonathan:
Thank you for your comment. The XSL and the XML Query WGs discussed your
request at last week's meeting and agreed to add references to a section
in the Formal Semantics document that will define the types returned by
these documents in more detail.

All the best, Ashok

The type of each of these three functions is underspecified. In all 
three cases, we are told, "The type of the result depends on the type of

$arg." None of these functions tells us how to determine the type of the

result from the type of $arg.
