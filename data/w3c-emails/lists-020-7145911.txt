Michael:
The introductory material for section 15.4 is below.  It does mention
xdt:untypedAtomic.

15.4 Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions take a sequence as argument and return a single
value computed from values in the sequence. Except for fn:count, the
sequence must consist of values of a single type or one if its subtypes,
or they must be numeric. xdt:untypedAtomic values are permitted in the
input sequence and handled by special conversion rules. The type of the
items in the sequence must also support certain operations.


All the best, Ashok
