Steve:
Thank you for your comment.  The XSL WG and the XML Query WG agreed to
add the overloaded signatures you requested at the joint meeting last
week.

All the best, Ashok

SECTION 15.4.2: fn:id

It would be nice to have overloaded versions for fn:id and fn:idref,
which explicitly specify the document node to be searched from.

fn:id($arg1 as xs:string*, $arg2 as node()?) as element()* 
fn:idref($arg1 as xs:string*, $arg2 as node()?) as node()*
