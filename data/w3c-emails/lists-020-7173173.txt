Steve:
Thank you for your comment.  The XSL WG and the XML Query WG agreed to
add the overloaded signatures you requested at the joint meeting last
week.

All the best, Ashok

SECTION 14.1.5: fn:lang

Just like the rest of the functions in section 14.1, it would be 
nice to have an overloaded version of fn:lang, which explicitly 
specifies the node to be operated on,

fn:lang($testlang as xs:string?, $arg as node()?)  as xs:boolean
