Subject: [F&O] IBM-FO-032: Inconsistent function signatures

 


(IBM-FO-032): Sections 9.7.3 (op:subtract-dates) and 9.7.4
(op:subtract-times) have "?" occurrence indicators in their signatures
and state that their arguments may be the empty sequence. But the other
op: functions in this section (such as 9.7.13,
op:add-dayTimeDuration-to-time) do not have "?" occurrence indicators
and do not accept empty sequences. What is the reason for this
inconsistency?
