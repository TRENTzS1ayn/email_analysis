(IBM-FO-040): Sections 15.3.3 (fn:max) and 15.3.4 (fn:min): In both of
these sections, all the examples except the first one are syntactically
invalid because they pass many arguments to a function that accepts only
one argument. This needs to be fixed by enclosing the argument sequence
in parentheses. Also, in each of these sections, the fifth bulletted
example is missing a right-parenthesis at the end of the function
parameters. Also, the third bulletted example in each section claims it
can return either an integer or a double. But the text says that all
numeric values are promoted to a "single common type", implying that
(for example) max(5, 5.0e0) will always be of type xs:double.
