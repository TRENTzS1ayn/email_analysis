This was fixed as a result of decisions we took in Tampa.  Thanks!

 

All the best, Ashok

(IBM-FO-023): In Section 7.5.4, fn:substring-before(), paragraph 3 says
that if $arg2 is the zero-length string, the function returns the
zero-length string. But the example in the second bullet has a
zero-length $arg2 and it does not return the zero-length string. Is this
a bug in the example?
