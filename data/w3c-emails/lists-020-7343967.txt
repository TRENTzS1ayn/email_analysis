Xavier:
Thank you for your comment.  Precise wording for casting from
float/double to string was approved in last week's W3C meetings.  This
wording will appear in the next public version of the F&O document.

All the best, Ashok

Nothing seems to be specified about the number of digits that
should be generated when casting from double or float to string.

whether the absolute value is within or without the range of 1e-6 to 1e6
the problem is the same: "the" canonical lexical representation,
  as defined in [XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes] doesn't precise it.
