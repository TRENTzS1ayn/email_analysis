Ashok, I believe you are correct about the behaviour of the functions. I
believe this comment originated from something one of our developers stumbled
over in an earlier draft, and I missed the relevant bits in the current
F&O. Apologies and I wishdraw that part of the comment.

Much as I recognize that the WG has likely tread this ground heavily before I
joined and understand a reluctance to go there, I remain unconvinced of the
value of devoting 25% of F&O to the various and sundry date functions, and I
suspect a radical refactoring could simplify this part of the rec dramatically.

//Mary
