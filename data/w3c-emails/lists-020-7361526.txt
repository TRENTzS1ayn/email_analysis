Howard:
I believe your interpretation is correct.

In future please send comments on XML Query and XPath 2.0 to 
public-qt-comemnts@w3.org.

All the best, Ashok

I'm presuming by Michael's prior example that substring( "12345", -1, 3)
is
thus to be interpreted as the 3 characters starting from the -1'th
position
in the string. Which gives "1".

Grappling with the concept of imaginary numbers in university helped
convince me that I didn't have a vocation in the hard sciences.
Hopefully
the rather novel concept of imaginary character positions in strings
won't
similarly drive me out of computing! :-)
