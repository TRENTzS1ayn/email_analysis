The definition in terms of fn:round($startingLoc) <= $p <
fn:round($startingLoc) + fn:round($length) doesn't require a concept of
negative positions. All characters have positive positions; the character is
included in the result if the position is greater than a number X, where X
may be negative.

As background, this definition is an example of the XPath 1.0 philosophy of
avoiding run-time errors. This design principle was adopted, I think,
because XSLT was seen by many people at the time as something that would run
in the browser, where run-time errors are really bad news. XPath 2.0 is less
consistent in this regard: we have some things which return a default value
rather than failing (such as effective Boolean value), and other things
which prefer to fail (such as getting the typed value of a complex-content
element).
