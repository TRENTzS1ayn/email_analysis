How about the following?  The sentence in bold or within *s, depending
on your mailer is a suggested addition to the summary.

Summary: Returns the portion of the value of $sourceString beginning at
the position indicated by the value of $startingLoc and continuing for
the number of characters indicated by the value of $length. *The result
string does not include characters corresponding to negative positions.*
More specifically, returns the characters in $sourceString whose
position $p obeys:
 

All the best, Ashok

What would help me I think is an explanation of what a negative position
means.
