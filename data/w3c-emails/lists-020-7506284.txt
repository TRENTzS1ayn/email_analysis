Liam> Actually no, it *is* clearer.

Perhaps (or perhaps not:-) but anyway incompatible with XPath 1.
Given that specifying positions greater than the string length is not an
error and  just silently does the natural thing of not selecting
anything, the behaviour of negative starting values seems perfectly
natural to me.
