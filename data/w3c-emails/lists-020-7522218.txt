Current Captured Substrings missing in XPath Context, Mark Scardina
(2004-02-16) 

SECTION 15.2: Captured Substrings
 
Current Captured Substrings are missing from the XPath dynamic context. 
 
The first sentence in the Definition should be replaced with: 
The <xsl:matching-substring> initializes the stylesheet evaluation context
 "current captured substrings" component with the result of regular
expression evaluation ...".

MHK personal response:
 
I agree with what I see as the intent of this proposal, namely to marry up
the description in 15.2 with the definition of "additional context
variables" in section 2.5.2. I think we can do better on the wording.
