xs:NMTOKENS vs. xdt:untypedAtomic, Mark Scardina (2004-02-16) 

SECTION 4.4: Attributes Types and DTD validation
 
The 2nd paragraph points out backwards compatibility issues with an example;

however, it leaves the reader guessing as to a solution. Suggest providing 
guidance or at minimum a reference to section K. 

 

 

MHK response:

 

I think this is editorial. I have added more explanation to the example:

 

If the value of the colors attribute is red green blue, then the expression
@colors = "red" will return true if the type annotation is xs:NMTOKENS, but
false if the type annotation is xdt:untypedAtomic. This is because the typed
value of an attribute of type xs:NMTOKENS is a sequence, in this case a
sequence of three xs:NMTOKEN values, and the equality comparison returns
true if any one of these matches the string given as the other operand.

 

Can you confirm that this is OK?
