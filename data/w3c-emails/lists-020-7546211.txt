qt-2004Feb0613-01: ORA-XS-362-Q: Consistency of "as" Attribute 

[substantive, raised] 2004-02-16

ORA-XS-362-Q:
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0613.html>
Consistency of "as" Attribute, Mark Scardina (2004-02-16) 

SECTION 11.9: Constructing Sequences
 
Shouldn't for consistency, the "as" attribute be on every instruction
 returning a sequence or only functions, templates, variables and
parameters? 
 
 
MHK personal response:
 
It doesn't feel right to me to add this attribute to xsl:element,
xsl:attribute, xsl:comment, and the like.
 
We could add it to xsl:copy and xsl:copy-of, which would make them more
consistent with xsl:sequence. Alternatively, we could remove it from
xsl:sequence. This would leave XSLT declaring types in the places where
other languages declare types: namely on variable and function declarations.
