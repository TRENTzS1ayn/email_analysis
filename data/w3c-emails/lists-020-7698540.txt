But xs:decimal and xs:integer are NOT hardware types, limited to
64-bits of precision. At least, that's how I understand XML
Schema. I read them as being arbitrary precision numbers and integers
(with a cop-out clause).

My point was, why include xs:double (rather than xs:float - presumably
faster), and not include a hardware integer type?
