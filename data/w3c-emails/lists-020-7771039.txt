Is that really right? (A second reading of the schema spec would suggest
it might be., although it isn't clear that it has to be read that way)
That's er strange is about the only description I could give on a public list...

Yes I read that, but still read it as just saying that the notations had
to be declared but not that they then would wander in to the schema's
target namespace, that interpretation is straining the xml namespace
spec to the limit isn't it?

Unlike "other schema components such as element declarations" Notation
names are constrained to be NCNames in the document not only in the
schema syntax, so what's the point of putting them in a Namespaces?
