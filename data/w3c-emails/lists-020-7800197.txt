The message 

ORA-XS-350-E: xs:NMTOKENS vs. xdt:untypedAtomic

was posted twice to the public comments list, both on 16 Feb 2004:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0575.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0623.html

As a result it currently appears twice in the XSLT issues list, with
different reference numbers. 

I intend to keep this comment in the record as issue issue
id="qt-2004Feb0575-01", and to delete issue qt-2004Feb0623-01 as having been
raised in error.
