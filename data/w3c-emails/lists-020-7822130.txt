These are editorial comments on
XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Formal Semantics
W3C Working Draft 20 February 2004
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xquery-semantics-20040220/

* the document is 1.5 Mo big ; could you split it? this doesn't forbid
to also provide the one-page version as well, but being able to access
the cover page without downloading the whole doc would be really good.

* the table of contents is formatted with non breakable spaces ; why not
using imbricated <ul> or <ol> instead, with proper CSS ?

* please don't use the <font> tag ; CSS can replace all its usages more
efficiently

* you're using mathematical notations all around the document ; have you
thought to use MathML for them instead of HTML tables? and for the
simplest ones, instead of imitating the mathematical signs, what about
using the real mathematical signs in Unicode?
e.g. => is &#x21D2; and |- is &#x22A2;  (::= is &#x2A74;, but is less
likely to appear correctly in most browsers)

* <p><b>Notation</b></p> (and alike) are misusing paragraphs and bold
text for what really are headings ; I suggest using either the <h*> tags
or using <dl><dt><dd> when more appropriate
