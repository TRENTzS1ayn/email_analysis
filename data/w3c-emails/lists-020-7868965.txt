This would be very nice! Having to use more than one key on different
documents leads to sprinkling of lots of artificial xsl:for-each
instructions and this results in code that is very difficult to read and
understand even by its original author. It is especially difficult to
decide what the current document is at particular point of the code. I had
a recent bad experience exactly with this.

Please, do include the proposed new argument -- this will make
programmer's work a lot easier and the code much more readable, 
understandable and maintainable.

This should be a separate overload, preserving an overload with the
current signature of the key() function.


With regards,

Dimitre Novatchev.
