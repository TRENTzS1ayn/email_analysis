" to determine whether the types of the two operands are comparable.
They aren't (there's no listing for A gt B where A is a xs:string and
B is numeric), so you will get a type error."

So when the XHive XML DB does an implicit conversion of "20" (xs:string) to 20 (xs:integer) then this is not supported by the XQuery Spec, but a nice feature?

Hi Daniel,

Questions about XPath or XSLT can be asked on XSL-List (see
http://www.mulberrytech.com/xsl/xsl-list). Questions about XQuery
should probably go to XQuery-Talk (see
http://xquery.com/mailman/listinfo/talk).

Conversion rules can be found in the XQuery language document. Your
example:

  "20" > 1000

uses the > operator, and the conversion rules for that can be found
in:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/#id-general-comparisons

This directs you to the "gt" operator; the conversion rules for that
can be found in:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/#id-value-comparisons

This directs you to the Appendix B.2 Operator Mapping at:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/#mapping

to determine whether the types of the two operands are comparable.
They aren't (there's no listing for A gt B where A is a xs:string and
B is numeric), so you will get a type error.

It's generally the case in XPath 2.0/XQuery that the only implicit
conversion rules are from the xdt:untypedAtomic type to other types.
xdt:untypedAtomic values only really arise in unvalidated documents.

Cheers,

Jeni
