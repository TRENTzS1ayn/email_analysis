# So when the XHive XML DB does an implicit conversion of "20" 
# (xs:string) to 20 (xs:integer) then this is not supported by 
# the XQuery Spec, but a nice feature?

A non-conformance with the language specification is never a nice feature,
however much it appears to be helpful to users.

However I don't know if XHive is claiming conformance with XQuery 1.0. XPath
1.0 does allow a type conversion in these circumstances.
