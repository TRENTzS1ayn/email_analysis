This public comment is raised purely for the record. It documents decisions
that have been made by the Query working group in response to comments that
were raised internally before the 12 November 2004 drafts were published,
but which were only processed after the publication of that draft.

1. There is now a rule under "import module" that the target namespace of
the module being imported must not be the same as the target namespace of
the importing module. [1]

2. The rule that the variables and functions to be exported from a module
must have the same namespace prefix as that of the module has been replaced
by a rule that they must have the same namespace URI.

[2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-query-wg/2003Nov/0020.html

Both changes have been made to the internal editors' draft.
