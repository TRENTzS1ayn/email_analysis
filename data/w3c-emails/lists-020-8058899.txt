Yes there are a great many things in XPath2 that are more horrible than
this small duplication of functionality.

But actually what is the semantics of the second argument?

Does it have to be a single document node, or is there some implicit
application of union and root() invoked as would be the case if
id($a,$b) were defined to be $b/id($a).

I have a horrible feeling that you are going to tell me it's a type
error to have anything other than a single document.
