Thank you!  That's much clearer.

All the best, Ashok

Subject: [F&O] adjust-date-to-timezone underspecified?


When describing adjust-date-to-timezone, F&O says:

"If $timezone is not the empty sequence, then the result is $arg with
$timezone as its timezone component."

I think this means that a timezone adjustment is performed, based on the
time value 00:00:00, similar to the other "adjust" functions.  But the
current text seems vague, and I know of one implementation that does not
work this way.  

I would recommend the following more specific text (modeled after the
text
for adjust-time-to-timezone):
-----------------------------
If $arg has a timezone component and $timezone is not the empty
sequence,
then:

- Let $srcdt be an xs:dateTime value, with 00:00:00 for the time
component
and date and timezone components that are the same as the date and
timezone
components of $arg.

- Let $r be the result of evaluating

    fn:adjust-dateTime-to-timezone($srcdt, $timezone)

- The result of this function will be a date value that has date and
timezone components that are the same as the date and timezone
components of
$r.
