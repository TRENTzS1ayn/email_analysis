I agree with Dimitre that xsl:key and xsl:id should have the same
argument forms but I do question why this is needed (for id() or key())
It is true that the XSLT1 for-each hack was horrible but given that the
XPath2 versions allow id() to be used within a path expression and
index the document current at that point, what is gained by the new
syntax. Isn't id("a",$somedocumentnode) the same as $somedocumentnode/id("a")
in the case when $somedocumentnode is a single document node (and
perhaps also when it is not?)
