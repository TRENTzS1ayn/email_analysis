Jonathan:
Your comment
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0284.html
was discussed as the joint XSL/XML Query WG meeting in Cannes.  The WGs
decided that because of the decision on typed value to adopt the strict
interpretation, solving the problem identified in the comment requires
the use of the fn:string() function.  Thus, no changes are required.

Please let us know if you agree with this decision.

All the best, Ashok
