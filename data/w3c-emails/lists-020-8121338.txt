Thank you for your comment.  The wording between the F&O and the DM has
been aligned.

All the best, Ashok

Dear Colleagues,

This comment pertains to the 25 December 2003 internal WD of XQuery 1.0
and XPath 2.0 Functions and Operators, as provided to our WG [1].

XSCH-FO-002 Datetime without a timezone

    From section 1.6 "xs:dateTime, xs:date and xs:time values"

        xs:dateTime, xs:date and xs:time values are represented in the
        Section 4.3.1 Mapping PSVI Additions to TypesDM as tuples: a
        xs:dateTime, xs:date or xs:time value without a timezone and a
        timezone represented as a xdt:dayTimeDuration value.

The above doesn't quite agree with the relevant section of DM or with
your examples, in which the first member of the tuple does have a
timezone which must be Z.
