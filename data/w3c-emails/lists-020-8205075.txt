Steve:
In this and a related comment on the unary minus operator
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0721.html
you say that the magnitude of the largest negative value is less than
the magnitude of the largest positive value.  I don't understand this.
I thought all the these operations did was flip the sign bit but perhaps
some representations work differently.  Could you please elaborate.


All the best, Ashok
