Michael,

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the serialization last 
call:

> General

     Thank you for submitting this comment.

     The XSL and XQuery working groups considered your comment and related 
comments.  There was general agreement that there is some need for a 
mechanism for serializing arbitrary sequences that preserves most or all 
of the properties of the items in an arbitrary sequence that is being 
serialized.

     The working groups decided that precisely defining all of the 
requirements for such a mechanism at this stage would be difficult, and 
would likely lead to a solution that would not satisfy real user 
requirements.  Therefore, the working groups decided to consider such a 
feature for a future revision of the recommendations, and close this 
comment without any changes to the specifications.

     As this seems to be the outcome you proposed, I trust this resolution 
is acceptable to you.  May I ask you to confirm?

Thanks,

Henry
