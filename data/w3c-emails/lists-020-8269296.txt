     Thank you for your comment.

     The XSL and XQuery Working Groups discussed your comment, and agreed 
that the serialization parameter for Unicode normalization should be 
aligned with the fn:normalize-unicode function and permit additional 
normalization forms to be specified.  The working groups decided to make 
the following changes to the definition of the normalize-unicode 
serialization parameter:

1. Rename the parameter to "normalization-form".

2. The possible values of the parameter will be "NFC", "NFD", "NFKC", 
"NFKD", "fully-normalized", "none" or an implementation-defined 
normalization form.  The default value is "none".  We will also add
a note advising of the interoperability problems that can arise by
using anything other than NFC.

3. All of "NFC", "NFD", "NFKC", "NFKD", "fully-normalized", "none" and
any implementation-defined value are permitted for the xml, xhtml and
text output methods.  The values "NFC", "fully-normalized" and "none"
must be supported by an implementation for these output methods.

4. The normalization-form parameter is permitted to have the values
"NFC", "NFD", "NFKC", "NFKD", "none" or an implementation-defined value
if the output method is "html".  The values "NFC" and "none" must be
supported for the html output method.  The value "fully-normalized" is
not permitted if the output method is "html".

5. In the case of "fully-normalized", the normalization is the same as for 

NFC, but the processor must signal a serialization error if any of the 
"relevant constructs" of the result would begin with a combining 
character.

     The XSL Working Group will also make the corresponding changes to the 
xsl:output element in XSLT 2.0, replacing the normalize-unicode attribute 
with a normalization-form attribute.

     May I ask you to confirm that this response is acceptable?

Thanks,

Henry
