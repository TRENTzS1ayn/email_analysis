Thanks, Jim.  You're correct! I think we should add an error condition
and also some explanation.

All the best, Ashok

This has been a perennial thorn in the side of SQL standardizers.

If you have a binary representation for some data type (e.g.,
"integer"), 
and that representation has a specific, fixed number of bits (e.g., 32),

then the range of values available for sites of that type is -(2^32) .. 
+(2^32)-1.

Consider a 16-bit integer (just to make the numbers more manageable).
The 
range of values is -32,678 .. +32767 (if the integer is signed, of
course; 
if it is unsigned, then the range is 0 .. 65,535).

Therefore, for *fixed-length binary representations*, under
2s-complement 
arithmetic/notation, the magnitude of the largest positive value is less

than the absolute magnitude of the smallest negative value.  (Actually, 
your quote suggests that the Oracle comment said that the magnitude of 
negative values is smaller than the magnitude of positive values; if
that's 
what we said, then it was a typographical error.)

On the other hand, if a decimal notation is used, the magnitudes of the 
largest positive value and the smallest negative value are identical
(for 
example, a 5-digit decimal type would support values ranging from
-99,999 
.. +99,999).  The same is true of binary 1s-complement
arithmetic/notation, 
where the range of a 16-bit type is -32,767 .. +32,767 (but the cost
here 
is that you get 2 zeros: +0 and -0).  I know of no current commercial 
hardware that uses 1s-complement notation for binary representations.  I

know of only a few hardware decimal representation implementations, but 
they are commerically important ones.

Hope this helps,
    Jim
