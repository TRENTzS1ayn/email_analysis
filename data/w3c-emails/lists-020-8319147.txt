     In [1], I submitted the following comment on the last call draft of 
Serialization on behalf of IBM:

In response [2], Michael Key proposed:

     The XSL and XQuery working groups considered this comment, and 
decided to accept Michael Kay's suggestion.

     This note announces the decision and signals my acceptance of the 
response.

Thanks,

Henry
