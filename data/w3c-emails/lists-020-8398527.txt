Don:

Thank you for your comment.  The joint WGs discussed this at the Cannes
meeting and decided not to add a function to deference XPointers.

All the best, Ashok

(IBM-FO-020) Section 15.4, Functions and Operators that Generate
Sequences: We need a function that takes an XPointer as its parameter,
dereferences it, and returns the node referenced by the XPointer. Since
this function has similarities to both fn:doc and fn:id, it should be
defined in the same section as these functions. This function would
satisfy XQuery Requirement 3.3.4, which requires support for references
from one XML document to another.
