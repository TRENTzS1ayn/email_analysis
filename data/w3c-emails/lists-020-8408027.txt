I think it is OK.
There is some discrepancy between specs for fn:normalize-unicode
(according to the latest Draft) and the normalization-form attribute.
The  ?fully-normalized ? value of the   normalization-form attribute must
be supported . This normalization is not mandatory to implement for
fn:normalize-unicode.
The  ?fully-normalized ? mode could be difficult to implement.

Igor,

     In [1], you submitted the following comment on the XSLT 2.0 and
Serialization last call drafts.

     Thank you for your comment.

     The XSL and XQuery Working Groups discussed your comment, and agreed
that the serialization parameter for Unicode normalization should be
aligned with the fn:normalize-unicode function and permit additional
normalization forms to be specified.  The working groups decided to make
the following changes to the definition of the normalize-unicode
serialization parameter:

1. Rename the parameter to "normalization-form".

2. The possible values of the parameter will be "NFC", "NFD", "NFKC",
"NFKD", "fully-normalized", "none" or an implementation-defined
normalization form.  The default value is "none".  We will also add
a note advising of the interoperability problems that can arise by
using anything other than NFC.

3. All of "NFC", "NFD", "NFKC", "NFKD", "fully-normalized", "none" and
any implementation-defined value are permitted for the xml, xhtml and
text output methods.  The values "NFC", "fully-normalized" and "none"
must be supported by an implementation for these output methods.

4. The normalization-form parameter is permitted to have the values
"NFC", "NFD", "NFKC", "NFKD", "none" or an implementation-defined value
if the output method is "html".  The values "NFC" and "none" must be
supported for the html output method.  The value "fully-normalized" is
not permitted if the output method is "html".

5. In the case of "fully-normalized", the normalization is the same as for
NFC, but the processor must signal a serialization error if any of the
"relevant constructs" of the result would begin with a combining
character.

     The XSL Working Group will also make the corresponding changes to the
xsl:output element in XSLT 2.0, replacing the normalize-unicode attribute
with a normalization-form attribute.

     May I ask you to confirm that this response is acceptable?

Thanks,

Henry
