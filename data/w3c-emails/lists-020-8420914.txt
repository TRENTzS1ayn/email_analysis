Don:

Your message below objects to the wording in section 1.5.2 of the F&O
which says

"The datatype xdt:untyped is a child of xs:anyType and serves as a
special type 

annotation to indicate types that have not been validated by a XML
Schema or a DTD." 

on the grounds that we do not support DTD validation.

 

The datamodel document, however, says that:

"In other words, the data model supports the following classes of XML
documents:

*Well-formed documents conforming to [Namespaces in XML]
<file:///C:\XMLSpecs\Query\Datamodel\data-model.html#REC-xml-names#REC-x
ml-names> ,
*DTD-valid documents conforming to [Namespaces in XML]
<file:///C:\XMLSpecs\Query\Datamodel\data-model.html#REC-xml-names#REC-x
ml-names> , and
*W3C XML Schema-validated documents."

 

We need to make our messages consistent.

 

All the best, Ashok

(IBM-FO-008) Section 1.5.2, xdt:untypedAtomic: Delete "or a DTD". We do
not support DTD validation.
