Mary:
Thanks for your comment.  There has been a great deal of discussion over
these functions and there is a significant section of the WG that really
wants them.  Unless you insist, I would rather not reopen this
discussion.

Is that OK?

All the best, Ashok

F&O 5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.3

The functions fn:zero-or-one, fn:one-or-more, and fn:exactly-one can
trivially
be written as user functions and provide little benefit. Given widely
useful
functions such as value-union that are not being provided, there seems
little
justification to require these functions. Suggest they be removed.
