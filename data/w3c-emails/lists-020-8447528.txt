and you responded:

     It was my understanding there had been a comment against F&O that an 
implementation should be required to support the parameter value 
"fully-normalized" for the fn:normalize-unicode function.  I specified 
here that the value "fully-normalized" must be supported as a value for 
the normalization-form parameter in order to align with what I understood 
was a pending change to F&O.

Ashok:  Can you confirm that an implementation will be required to support 
the value "fully-normalized" for the fn:normalize-unicode function?

Thanks,

Henry
