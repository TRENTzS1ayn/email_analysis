According to the current spec (12 Nov 2003 public draft as well as 25 March
2004 internal draft) the following is a type error:

xs:yearMonthDuration("P2Y") * 2

Multiplication of a duration by a double is allowed, but not by an integer.
There is no rule anywhere that causes the integer to be promoted to an
xs:double in this situation.

This is clearly an oversight.
