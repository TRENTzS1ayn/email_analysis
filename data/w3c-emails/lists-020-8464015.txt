Mike:
I made the same point in my mail 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xsl-query/2004Mar/0075.html
on 3/11.  It seems to me that we need numeric promotion rules for
operators
just like we have for functions.

All the best, Ashok

According to the current spec (12 Nov 2003 public draft as well as 25
March
2004 internal draft) the following is a type error:

xs:yearMonthDuration("P2Y") * 2

Multiplication of a duration by a double is allowed, but not by an
integer.
There is no rule anywhere that causes the integer to be promoted to an
xs:double in this situation.

This is clearly an oversight.
