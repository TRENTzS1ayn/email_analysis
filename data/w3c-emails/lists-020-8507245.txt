Henry:
I realized after I sent the note that we needed to be more precise about
the wording and we should discuss the details.  I'll put it on the
agenda.

Here is my proposal:
You start with $arg2 and count towards $arg1.
Keeping the day and time values constant you increment the month value,
rolling over the year value as needed until adding another month would
take you past $arg1.  You then convert the months you added into an
yearMonthDuration.

Make sense?

All the best, Ashok

Thanks for your comment.

In fact, the first alternative you mention in your note is what is
intended.
I've clarified the wording to make in clearer.

All the best, Ashok

[My apologies that these comments are coming in after the end of the
Last 
Call comment period.]

Section 9.7.1

According to the first paragraph, "first the duration is calculated as
the 
value of an xdt:dayTimeDuration in seconds. Then, starting from $arg2,
the 
maximum number of months in the duration are calculated.  If there is a 
remaining number of days, they are discarded."

This description is not sufficiently precise.  Is the maximum number of 
months computed using the number of actual complete calendar months 
beginning from $arg2, or is it the maximum number of months that could
be 
accommodated in that computed number of seconds, regardless of the 
starting point?  Or does month here refer to the time interval between a

dateTime value and the dateTime value that would result from adding the 
duration P1M to it, as described in Section E.1 of XML Schema:
Datatypes?

Thanks,

Henry
