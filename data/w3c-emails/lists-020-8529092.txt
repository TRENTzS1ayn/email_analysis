Your proposed text doesn't explain what happens with negative durations.

I actually thought the wording in the Christmas Day draft was an improvement
over the 12 Nov wording, and was probably OK.

But here's a more precise approach:

Firstly, calculate the number of months M1 between the supplied
date/dateTime and the baseline xs:date -0001-01-01 (equivalent to the ISO
8601 date 0000-01-01). If the year is positive, this is (12*y + m-1) where y
and m are the year and month components of the date. If the year is
negative, M1 is the negative number (12*(y+1) + (12-m)).

Now calculate the number of months M2 in the supplied duration, as 12*y+m
where y and m are the year and month components of the duration. (If the
duration is negative, both y and m are negative).

Finally, add the number of months (M1+M2) to the baseline xs:date
-0001-01-01, using the rules for adding a yearMonthDuration to a date.
