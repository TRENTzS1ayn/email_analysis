Michael,

whenever XQuery or his descendants will become closer to a
programming language then it is now (thing that will not wait for
very long) and will have statements, then YES at that point we should
definitively add ";" or some other form of statement combinator.

In the meantime, a single side-effect free expression doesn't seem to
need one. Such an expression doesn't make a statement to me. The
updates definitively are, but not the read-only queries.

For example:

  //foo;
  delete //foo[1];
  //foo;

should end up at least with a warning (if not an error) because
the  //foo; is meaningless code (doesn't impact the semantics of the
program).

But we are going to fast I think.

Best regards,
Dana
