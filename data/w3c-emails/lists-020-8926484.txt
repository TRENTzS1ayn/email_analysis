Sorry, Martin, but I think you have completely missed the point here. If an
XML Schema declares the colors attribute as having type xs:NMTOKENS, and the
typed value is the sequence ("red", "green", "blue"), then the correct
lexical representation of this according to the rules in XML Schema is
colors="red green blue". If you don't like that, you need to complain to the
XML Schema WG.

The places where XSLT/XQuery use space as a default separator are all
associated with converting a typed value to the string value of a node, and
are therefore closely associated with this XML Schema convention for
representing lists. Of course we can't totally control how the facility is
used, but we do provide a string-join function that allows any separator to
be used in the lexical representation of a sequence, so we are not imposing
any constraints on users.
