This was the case I had in mind. People create documents in cp1252 and
declare them as iso-8859-1. And it all works, because the errors cancel each
other out. If we oblige processors to detect this situation we will be
asking users to pay for the extra processing cost, and in return the
application that worked before will stop working. Will they thank us?
Because if they won't, we shouldn't do it.

I may have lost the thread, but I thought we were discussing the HTML output
method?
