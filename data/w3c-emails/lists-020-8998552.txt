David,

     This is the response to your comment on the XSLT 2.0 Last Call 
Working Draft.  Your comment can be found in the following message:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0856.html

(Issue qt-2004Feb0856-01)

     Thank you for your comment.

     The XSL Working Group discussed your comment, and agreed that it 
would not be acceptable for it to be, in all circumstances, a static error 
to specify an xsl:with-param in an xsl:call-template if the named template 
did not have an xsl:param with the same name.  As you pointed out, the 
effect on any existing XSLT 1.0 stylesheets that relied on the fact that 
no error would be produced would be too great.

     However, the consensus of the working group was also that this 
feature of XSLT 1.0 was a likely source of bugs, as simple typographical 
errors in the name specified for an xsl:with-param could easily go 
undetected.  Therefore, the working group decided that ERR XT0680 (defined 
in Section 10.1.1) should be produced only if backwards compatible 
behavior is not in effect for the xsl:call-template instruction in 
question.

     As that is the proposal you made in your comment, I trust the 
decision will be acceptable to you.  May I ask you to confirm that?

Thanks,

Henry [On behalf of the XSL Working Group]
