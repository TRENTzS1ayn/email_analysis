Mike,

My apologies.  It was my intent to state the answer to that question in my 
response to your comment, but I obviously forgot.

The joint meeting decided that the new syntax applies *only* to XQuery and 
not to XPath 2.0.  XPath 2.0 will have to get by with only the 
fn:unordered() function ;^)

Hope this helps,
    Jim

P.S., With this additional information:  are you willing to accept this 
resolution for your comment?
