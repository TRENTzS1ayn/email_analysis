This is a request for the rationale as to why the quantifiers
for "()" and "none" changed between Aug 2002 and May 2003.  In
Aug 2002:

quantifier(())   = 0
quantifier(none) = 0

In May 2003, this changed to:

quantifier(())   = ?
quantifier(none) = 1

Why?  The current version seems rather odd.  Why should
quantifier(none) be 1?
