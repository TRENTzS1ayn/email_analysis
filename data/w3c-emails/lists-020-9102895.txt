Issue qt-2004Feb1007-01

At its meeting on 13 May 2004 the XSL WG agreed to accept your proposal that
elements constructed with validation="preserve" should have a type
annotation of xs:anyType rather than xdt:untyped [or xdt:untypedAny as it is
in the current published draft].

I assume this meets with your approval.

Michael Kay
for the XSL WG
