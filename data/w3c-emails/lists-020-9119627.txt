A little detective work indicates that this has been the definition
since May 2003:
http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-semantics/#jd_prime
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xquery-semantics-20030822/#jd_prime
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-xquery-semantics-20030502/#sec_factor

Returning to Nov 2002, we see the old definition:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-query-semantics-20021115/#jd_prime
which was unnecessarily complex.  First, there is no '0' quantifier
in the language, only ?, 1, *, +.  Plus all the entries in
the table for combining the 0 quantifier are redundant 
(e.g., () . 0 = () = () . 1),
so we can just get rid of 0 quantifiers entirely.  Make sense?
