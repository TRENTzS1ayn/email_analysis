The Schema WG thanks you for this response. We find the clarification as a
serialization error an improvement and accept that. We continue to be deeply
troubled, however, by the fact that data models with xs:QNames fail to
serialize and therefore validate correctly. We are heartened by our knowledge
that the Query/XSL Working groups have continued to discuss that matter, and
encourage them in that effort.
