I think we need to work together to find a solution to the QName problem.
It's wretchedly difficult having a data type where the value in the value
space has no context-independent lexical representation. Adding the
possibility of representing QName values in a lexical notation such as
uri##local would greatly ease the pain. (We choose choose a format that can
potentially be used anywhere in XML, XML Schema, XSLT, XPath, or XQuery that
lexical QNames are currently used).
