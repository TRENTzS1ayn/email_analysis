I may, or I may not. Given the complexity of the XSLT/XQuery specs,
and the fact that I'm dealing with a lot of other things (not to
speak about the rest of the I18N WG), it might not necessarily
come as a surprise.

There is no problem with that, if indeed these values are typed as
xs:NMTOKENS. But we strongly suspect that there is a problem if there
are some values that are just simple strings. The fact that simple
strings and text nodes are not treated in the same way, we suspect,
will often lead to confusion.

Would it be possible for you to write the following three examples:

- An example (such as above with "red", "green", "blue", but with the
   actual code) where these are e.g. NMTOKENS, and where the serialization
   with spaces makes sense.

- An example with e.g. strings used as intermediate text in a formating-
   like operation (a la printf in C), where inserting spaces would happen,
   but would not be desired.

- The previous example with the above 'string-join' function used to
   avoid the problems with spaces.


Regards,    Martin.
