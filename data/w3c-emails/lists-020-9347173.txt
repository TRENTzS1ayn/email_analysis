Appendix B1 states:

     This media type registration is for XSLT stylesheet modules as 
described by this specification.
Applications which use this media type:

     Some authors have already started to write XSLT 2.0 documents. 
However that content is currently most often described using the 
unregistered media type "text/xslt".

     There is no experimental, vendor specific, or personal tree 
predecessor to "application/xslt+xml", reflecting the fact that no 
applications currently recognize it. This new type is being 
registered in order to allow for the expected deployment of XSLT 2.0 
on the World Wide Web, as a first class XML application.

I have two problems with this. The first is minor. I have never seen 
"text/xslt" used anywhere. Microsoft uses text/xsl" without the final 
t.

The second is much more major. This registration should not be 
limited to XSLT 2. It is needed for XSLT 1.0 as well. The current 
language strongly implies that this media type is only acceptable for 
XSLT 2.0 stylesheets.

RFC 3023 does not restrict application/xslt+xml to XSLT 2.0.
