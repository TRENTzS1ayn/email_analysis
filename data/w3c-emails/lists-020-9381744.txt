Henry:
Thanks for your note http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Mar/0243.html

The WGs agreed to clarify the wording for how case mapping should be implemented.  Since TR#21 is now outdated we agreed to refer to the Unicode 4 specification.  Please look at the wording as in appears in the next version of the document and let us know if you are satisfied.

All the best, Ashok
