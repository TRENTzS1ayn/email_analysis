Michael:
The WGs considered two of your comments on fn:doc on this morning's telcon.

We agreed to remove the restriction on the argument not being allwed to have a fragment identifier as requested in your note http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Mar/0105.html

The comments in your note http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Mar/0106.html
have been overtaken by events.  The wording you refer to has been changed.

All the best, Ashok
