Howard:
The joint WGs considered your comments on the substring 
function at this morning's telcon and agreed to redo the 
description and add another example to clarify the behavior. 
Please take look at the resvised description in the next public working draft and let us know if you are satisfied with the resolution.

All the best, Ashok
