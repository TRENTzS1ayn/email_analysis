Till:
We discussed your note http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0327.html on this morning's Joint WG telcon.

We have changed 'parent type' to 'base type' and made the other editorial change you recommended.  The WGs decided that no further changes were needed.

All the best, Ashok
