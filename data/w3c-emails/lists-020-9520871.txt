The XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Functions and Operators W3C Working Draft 12
November 2003 does not state explicily how tokenize should behave if the
pattern is not matched.

Example

tokenize("foo",",")

My intuition would tell me this is a case of a 1 token string so it should
return ("foo"). I think, this would have the most utility in practice. In
any case, I think this should be added to the examples.
