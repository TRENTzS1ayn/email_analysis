Hi Martin:
In your note http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0388.html you questioned the value of the fn:collection function.

This was discussed during the joint WGs telcon on 5/26 and the members decided that what was needed was some non-normative wording to motivate the the function.  This wording will appear in the next version of the F&O.  Please take a look at it and tell us if you are satisfied.

All the best, Ashok
