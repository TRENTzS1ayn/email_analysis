Michael:
In your notes http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0761.html and http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Mar/0104.html you requested that this function be removed.

The joint WGs discussed this in San Jose as well as on the telcon yesterday and there was not consensus to remove the function.

The WGs also decided that the function should be stable.  See following note in reply to a comment by Steve Buxton.

All the best, Ashok
