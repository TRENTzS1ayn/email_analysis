Steve:
In your note http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0729.html you questioned the stability requirement on the fn:collection function.  The WGs discussed this on the joint telcon yesterday and decided, as they did for fn:doc, that stability was a conscious decision and should be maintained.

Removing the stability requirement would lead to the possibility of temporal instability and was felt to be undesirable.

All the best, Ashok
