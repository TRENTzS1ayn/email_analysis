Thank you for your comment http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0361.html.  This is a good suggestion and the WGs decided to adopt it.

The WGs also agreed to add appropriate references as requested in your note http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0358.html

Many thanks, Ashok
