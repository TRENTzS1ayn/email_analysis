In your note http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0357.html 
you recommended that the rules for casting xs:float and xs:double to xs:string use the XML Schema 
canonical forms for these datatypes.

The Schema WG decided on these canonical forms in Cannes and the QT WGs adopted them with one exception: numbers
between 0.000001 (one millionth) and less than 1000000 (one million) are converted using decimal notation instead of scientific notation.

All the best, Ashok
