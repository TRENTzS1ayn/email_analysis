In reference to Comment no. 4 in this posting, the Query and XSL working groups have discussed your comment and agreed to make the changes you suggest. The next version of the XPath 2.0 specification will include a glossary entry defining the substitution group headed by a given element and containing a reference to XML Schema Part 1, Section 2.2.2.2.

On behalf of the XML Schema WG,
