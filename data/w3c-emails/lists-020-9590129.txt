Jim, you commented at 

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Mar/0012.html

that you thought the XSLT 2.0 specification was "a bit vague" in its
handling of xml:base.

The WG looked at this comment yesterday evening and had trouble identifying
any problem in this area.

Relative URIs in xsl:include, xsl:import, document(), etc are resolved
relative to the base URI of the element on which they appear. I think the
spec says this clearly. It also, in relevant places, points to the Data
Model document for a description of the base URI property of a node. The
Data Model document explains how the xml:base attribute affects the base URI
of a node: not directly, but implicitly by reference to the InfoSet and XML
Base specifications.

The description of xs:result-document in 19.1 similarly explains that the
href attribute of this instruction is *not* resolved relative to the base
URI of this instruction, but relative to the "base output URI", which is a
value supplied by the caller when a transformation is fired off.

I appreciate that it may be difficult to follow all the threads at times,
but our job is to specify things unambiguously, not to write a tutorial. If
you feel there are any particular ambiguities in the document, we would be
grateful if you could point them out. Otherwise we will close the comment
with no action.

Regards,

Michael Kay
