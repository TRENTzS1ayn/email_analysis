Thank you for your comment: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0334.html

The table has been fixed.  The WGs declined to change the type of the numeric argument to decimal because if they are defined as double then decimal arguments can be passed to
the functions (the decimal will be promoted to double) but if they are defined as decimal then double arguments cannot be 
passed to the functions because double cannot be promoted to decimal.

All the best, Ashok
