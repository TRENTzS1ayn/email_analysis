Till, Henry:
In your notes http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0329.html and http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0970.html you pointed out that the concept of system defined default collation was not 
well-defined in section 7.3.

There were other comments along similar lines.  The WGs discussed this in the telcon on 5/26/2004 and decided to reword the section to say that if a collation was not explicitly
specified the default collation from the static context would be used.

All the best, Ashok
