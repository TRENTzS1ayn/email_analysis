Steve:
In your notes http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0900.html and http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/0899.html you requested that error codes and the error summary be normative.
This was accepted by the joint WGs on May 4 as part of Andrew Eisenberg's errors proposal.

All the best, Ashok
