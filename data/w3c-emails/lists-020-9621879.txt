Dear Don:
This is in response to your note http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Feb/1227.html where you requested the
addition of a deep-distinct function.

This was discussed by the WGs on 5/26/2004 and most people felts that such a function would not be useful 
for order-by as it was too fragile.  In fact, order-by was best done with a constructed compound key so indicies could be used.

The WGs, therefore decided not to add the function.

All the best, Ashok
