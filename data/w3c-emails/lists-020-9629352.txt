David:
In your note http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Nov/0210.html you commented on the deep-equal function.

In fact, there has been a great deal of discussion about this function and on On 3-16-2004 we decided to accept Mike Kay?s wording contained in:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-query-operators/2004Jan/0005.html

Please look at the next draft of the F&O and tell us if you are satisfied with the result.

All the best, Ashok
