Richard:
I'm sorry it has taken us so long to get to your suggestion in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2003Nov/0324.html

This was discussed at the joint WG meeting in San Jose on April 15 and the WGs agreed to make the change.  
See item [487] in the minutes http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-query-wg/2004Apr/0142.html

All the best, Ashok
