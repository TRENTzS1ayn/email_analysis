Don, Michael: 
We discussed your comments http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Mar/0211.html and http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-qt-comments/2004Mar/00891.html 
in San Jose and agreed to make the following changes: 

1. The constructor functions should accept the empty sequence. If the empty sequence is passed to a constructor function, the empty sequence is returned. 

2. The cast syntax allows the type name to specify whether an empty sequence is acceptable. If it is, and the expression to be cast is the empty sequence, the empty sequence is returned. If the empty sequence is not allowed and the expression to be cast is the empty sequence, a type error is raised. 

Please confirm that this is satisfactory. 

All the best, Ashok
