I can't speak to Andy's agenda, but one point that's been kicking
around in the XQuery/RDF Query arena for a while is that XQuery can be
used to express SQL queries so it must be able to express RDF
queries. I've seen a couple approaches that I believe workable [1]
[2], but would like to see how people solve the problem for SQL.

I suspect that in standardizing an RDF query language we are going
beyond where existing SQL mappings to XQuery have gone in that we want
*one* mapping to XQuery that operates on XQuery+whatever
implementations from different vendors. Does such a "standard" mapping
to SQL exist?
