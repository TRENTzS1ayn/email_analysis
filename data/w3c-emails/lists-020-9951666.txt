Task

An RDF/OWL ontology editing/browsing/displaying system uses a 
specialized GUI to display OWL/RDF ontologies.  It uses RDF 
annotations to the OWL/RDF to record information relevant to its 
operation (such as screen coordinates, font styles, color) as part of 
the ontology, using a specialized set of property names all in a 
namespace reserved for use by the application. This enables it to use 
RDF/OWL tools and conventions to store an ontology during an extended 
work period.

(We are designing such a system right now, called CODE, and it will do this.)

The developer wishes to be able to detect when any such triples occur 
in an RDF graph, to extract them all when they do occur, and also to 
be able to extract all triples which do not use any name in this 
reserved namespace. To do this, a query which matches any triple with 
a property name in a set of namespaces would be a useful feature, for 
example in an ad-hoc notation:

(?x {+<codelay:>  +<cadegra:>}?y ?z .)

should match any triple whose property name is a URI in one of the 
namespaces indicated, while

({-codelay:}?x  {+codelay:}?y ?z .)

should match any triple whose property URI is in the codelay: 
namespace and whose subject is a URI not in that namespace.

Actually this notation really is horrible, but I dont have time to 
think of a better one.

We actually will have to be able to do this for CODE, and will 
implement it ourselves if we have to, but I think that being able to 
do name-space sensitive retrieval might be generally useful, eg so as 
to be able to easily detect if an RDF graph uses any OWL terminology.
