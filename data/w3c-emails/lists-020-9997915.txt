"incoherent" such that, insofar as the RDF graph and MT are concerned, 
the term
"namespace" or "namespace name" has no meaning, and statements using 
terms
that have no meaning are incoherent.

If by "namespace" you mean "vocabulary" (e.g. akin to 
http://sw.nokia.com/VOC-1/Vocabulary)
then the use case is very appropriate and I support it's inclusion in 
the draft
doc.

If by "namespace" you mean an XML namespace name, as used as a 
syntactic mechanism
in some serialization grammar for capturing the structure of an RDF 
graph, then
I think this use case is subsumed by the more general use case applying 
regular
expression comparisions to node labels.
