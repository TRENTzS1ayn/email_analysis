This looks fine to me. Since it got some support last week, I'm
inclined to regard silence at this point as agreement from
most members of the WG.

Anybody who doesn't like this will please let us know, preferably
before I send out the agenda on Wednesday for Thursday's teleconference.

One or two more like this and it will be time to build an outline
of the document and start to flesh it out, yes?

Hmm... one shortcoming I can see is that it doesn't explictly
identify a requirement. Hmm... another imperfection is: we already
have LDAP; ideally our use cases should show why the existing
technologies are not enough. Perhaps a query like "find the
email address of the person in <picture23.jpg>" would be more
compelling?
