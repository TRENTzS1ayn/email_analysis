No, not yet. ("Kendall", btw.) With PyCon (annual Python conference,
FYI) in DC starting tomorrow, I'll be lucky to participate in the
telcon, so it'll prolly be a few more days before I discharge this
one. (I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to do here; I was
perfectly happy with Dan's restatement of the issue, using dc:creator
and music:composer examples...)

Best,
Kendall
