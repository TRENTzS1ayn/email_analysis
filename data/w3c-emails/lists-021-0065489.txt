Y is interested in using triples from U1 & U2
but before he is prepared to do so, he wants
to detect eventual inconsistencies in there
(for instance U1 says :a owl:sameAs :b, :c.
whereas U2 says :c owl:differentFrom :b.)
and so he first wants to query U1 & U2 to find
out about their inconsistencies (we have some
experience in doing so by querying with the
empty graph)
