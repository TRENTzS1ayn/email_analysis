It wouldn't be an answer to any question if it isn't syndicated into
a knowledge store against which the question is asked (i.e. poor
organization/management/engineering can result in lots of "dangers")

If the query isn't within the focus of interest, then don't put it into
the knowledge base that *is* the focus of interest.

Like I said, poor organization/management/engineering...

If a harvestor is gobbling up stuff with little to no discrimination,
and/or if the same queue is being used by a query engine *and* a
harvester gathering knowledge that may fall within the focus of
executed queries, then that's just poor engineering plain and simple.

Sure. And we can have a nice non-normative section of the spec that
covers all sorts of "don't do this" scenarios.

I don't. As long as folks realize that graphs containing queries should
not (usually) be mixed with graphs containing general assertions, all
will be well.

If some folks are careless, sloppy, or ignorant and merge such graphs
then strangeness could result (though I'm not convinced
that anything bad would actually happen, just that query results
could be of degraded utility).

A query graph is essentially a claim. There exist some target resources
which have certain characteristics, etc. and execution of the query
is figuring out how to make the claims true, and providing all the
evidence.

So if you merge a query graph with your main knowledge base, the claims
are still valid -- you're saying "some" resource exists that has... -- 
yet
since all you have are bnodes, you don't know exactly which one it is,
and any query executed against those query-based claims would be *true*,
just not very informative.

Ugh. Please no.

And there's no need. A query expressed in RDF is making certain claims.
And those claims are true no matter what other graphs they get 
syndicated
into. Whether you *should* syndicate those claims into other graphs is 
the
real issue here, not the fact that the query is expressed in RDF.

Indiscriminate syndication will always lead to headaches. Be careful 
what you eat!

Never said it was necessary, only that it was very useful, because from
start to finish an agent is able to work with RDF graphs rather than
multiple serializations.

We've now dipped below the specifics of what the DAWG spec would

XXX

At which point, the original federator recieving the original query
returns the final set of bindings -- which could just as well be
expressed in RDF using the Result Set Vocabulary, so that the
requesting agent need not have to parse yet another serialization.

Thus, for DAWG to specify that variable bindings (if such are requested)
be communicated in query results as RDF does in no way prevent or even
complicate any of the above scenario you present above.

And at each level, the same could be achieved if those bindings were
expressed in RDF rather than some other encoding.

Sorry, I fail to see any issues with expressing bindings in RDF in
the scenario you are presenting.

Specifically, how does returning the equivalent of

>     20040309  mailto:bob@example.com  Bob     Robertson
>     ...       ...

expressed in RDF using something akin to the Result Set Vocabulary
cause you problems or in any way preventing you from doing what you
have described above?
