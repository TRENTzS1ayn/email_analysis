Example: a query gets information about a book.  The server also sends
details about the author as well.  c.f. DNS sending answers to lookups you
haven't asked yet but are likely to.

A FOAF example, which is good as a FOAF graph is all bnodes, would be to
return the description of the person specificied by foaf:mbox and the
defining properties of the foaf:knowns foaf:Persons so that further graph
retrievals can be done.

A Joseki 'fetch' isn't just about "descriptions" of things.  Its about gets
parts of grpagh - your "desriptions" are one case of that.

I don't see why a standardized definition is needed in a W3C recommendation.
