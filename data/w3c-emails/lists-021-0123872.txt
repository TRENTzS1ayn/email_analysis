Agreed - it will be time to build an outline of a document.

Adding requirement: no problem.  I have been avoiding doing this, assuming
that we will collect some use cases then extract requirements.  This allows
agreeing the UC and then discussing the requriments. But if this is seen as
generally stable, extracting requirements is fine.

LDAP: Assumes a planned deployment.  And my address book is an RDF file, not
a RDF-fronted LDAP server.
