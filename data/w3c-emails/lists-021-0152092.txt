This was the approach I also proposed, and the one that I think
makes most sense at this point in time.

Adding support for mathematical functions is something that we likely
will want to do during a second pass -- and which I expect can be
done as a fully backwards-compatible extension to whatever we come
up with in the first version, but I think that doing it now is
taking a bigger bite than we have time to chew...

(there's also the issue of adoption due to implementational burden)

I.e. I think we should consider math (or other add-on) functions one of
those "out of scope but nearby" issues, for which we can address in the
documentation using examples such as above which illustrate how such 
things
can be done on the client side in conjunction with a 
slightly-less-powerful
DAWG query.
