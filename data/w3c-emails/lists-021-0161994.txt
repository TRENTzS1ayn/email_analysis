Well, the big difference between DAWG and DNS is that the volume of
those answers you haven't asked yet but might could be *alot* bigger
as a DAWG query response than a DNS response, and if my agent is
operating on a small device (e.g. a mobile phone) I don't want it
being force-fed *anything* that it has not asked for explicitly.

I.e., again, it's OK if some server provides for responses that are
more comprehensive than a concise bounded description -- but I want
it to be crystal clear what the default, presumed, expected nature
of a resource description is and for servers to provide *that*
form of description unless I say otherwise.

If some server is able to anticipate your possible future needs, fine,
and some agents may really benefit from that, but that is IMO a 
value-added
feature and out of scope.

A concise bounded description, as specified by 
http://sw.nokia.com/uriqa/URIQA.html#cbd,
would do the same in the case of FOAF.

In fact, I've long considered adding a parameter to limit the number of
secondary levels in a resource description as in some cases, the bnode
closure can be overly large.

Right, and one can submit the exact same query to different 
Joseki-accessible
models containing identity underlying graphs and get back different 
responses,
since what 'fetch' provides is implementation specific.

So that there is consistency in the behavior of conforming servers.

So that when a client says "tell me about X" to a dozen different 
servers,
they understand exactly what is meant, and in the same way.

So that implementors creating new services which provide descriptions of
resources can be provided guidance about what an optimal level of 
resolution
for a description is.

I think there are many reasons why a standardized definition is needed
in a W3C recommendation.

And again, a standardized definition does not preclude other forms of
descriptions or any kind of value added functionality. It merely 
facilitates
consistency across disparate implementations, which is, I believe, the
ultimate goal of the W3C.
