If I do my arithmetic right, that would be necessary when querying a
foaf entity. Given a typical foaf graph:

  _:1 foaf:firstName "bob"
  _:1 foaf:surname "smith"
  _:1 foaf:knows _:2
  _:2 foaf:firstName "bob"
  _:2 foaf:surname "smith"
  _:2 foaf:knows _:3 ...
  _:1 foaf:knows _:4
  ...

the data bounded by a CBD would encompass most of the graph.

Suppose we had a query language that allowed some sort of URI-labeld
profiles.
  GET http://liber.examaple.com/book1
  Profile: http://www.example.com/profiles/Book

This would allow for the definition of different queries, some of
which would specify that no addtional data would be returned, and
would thusly be more attractive to small devices at the end of long
thin pipes (network term meaning slow data feeds).

If the DAWG query language did not specify that returned triples
and/or bindings must all be specified in the query, folks wishing
to define such profiles could define them in terms of properties.
Query servers that didn't understand these profiles would simply
give no results for a query like:

  <http://liber.examaple.com/book1> <http://www.example.com/profiles/Book> ?x

The upside is that you get distributed and domain-specific profile
definition. The downside is that a client can't lean on a
specification that says "if you answer this port, or claim to handle
this SOAP message, you must also understand this profile."

I suspect that defining the perfect resource description query is as
difficult as defining the perfect ontology. The parallel follows for
"good enough" queries and ontologies. W3C doesn't define (very many)
ontologies, but is rather keen on specifying ontology definition
languages. Hence my compromise suggestion above.
