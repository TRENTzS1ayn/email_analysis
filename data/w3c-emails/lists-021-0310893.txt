Hmm... remote participation constrains the ftf meeting somewhat.
I'm not inclined to offer remote participation for the whole
two days, but perhaps we could have a couple 3-hour sessions
with remote participants.

I'm interested in advice from other WG members. I'll allow
a bit of time in tomorrow's telcon for that.

There's also the question of whether the host can offer this
facility. DirkG, AlbertoR? Can you guys arrange for a
speakerphone that can be called by the W3C teleconference
bridge? We could try my VoIP phone. It's about as reliable
as the net connection it's connected to.
