  send us a pointer

We've had a request to participate by phone. Let's discuss
briefly.


3. Use cases and Requirements

ACTION AlbertoS: elaborate on AFS-2 "Tell me about ..."  
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0022.html

seems to be done:

 thoughts and some refs about AFS-2 UC
 http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0087.html

Discussion has been interesting, but I don't see
much convergence.

ACTION AndyS: refine AFS-1: "Find the resource for the person called
'John S mith'" with some details
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0023.html

seems to be done:

  Use case: Find the email address of "John Smith"
 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0113.html


ACTION KendallC: refine JS-1, esp the composer/creator version
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0025.html

Kendall has asked us to continue that one.
