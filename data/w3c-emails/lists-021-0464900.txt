(ammended to show regrets from PatrickS) as a true record.

DONE: ACTION DanC: reserve a teleconference bridge

2. Amsterdam meeting arrangements

I expect to continue these actions without much discussion:

ACTION DirkG: collect logistics details in a web page and
  send us a pointer

ACTION DanC: set up meeting registration
(ericp, bonus points if you beat me to it)

We've had a request to participate by phone. Let's discuss briefly.


3. Use cases and Requirements

ACTION AlbertoS: elaborate on AFS-2 "Tell me about ..."  
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0022.html

seems to be done:

 thoughts and some refs about AFS-2 UC
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0087.html

Discussion has been interesting, but I don't see
much convergence.

ACTION AndyS: refine AFS-1: "Find the resource for the person called 'John S
mith'" with some details
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0023.html

seems to be done:

  Use case: Find the email address of "John Smith"
 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0113.html


ACTION KendallC: refine JS-1, esp the composer/creator version
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0025.html

Kendall has asked us to continue that one.

ACTION EricP: send "tell me properties of X" case
