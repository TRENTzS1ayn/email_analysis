ACTION: EricP to take over face-to-face registration
ACTION: DanC to work on face-to-face agenda

We discussed various existing Use Cases:

    - the examples or user stories *are* our use cases

    - tell-me-about-x UC should perhaps be split into several others:
        data/metadata browser and metadata crawler

    - address precisely what user wants to do with email address in AndyS's
      "find John Smith's email address"

    - some consensus around solving the john-smith email case

    ACTION: PatrickS to write this use case up
    
    - general approval of Alberto's restatement/solution of DanC's
      geolocation use case
      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0059.html

    - DaveB spoke in support of 
      http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0083

    - DaveB asked for more use cases.

    - KendallC asked for more use cases specifically about uses of protocol.

    - AlbertoR asked that UCs might be organized into types or categories.
    
Straw poll suggested that structuring ongoing discussion about use
cases around a document would be more helpful than continuing in a
free-form way.

DanC solicited one-page outlines of such a document be emailed to him
directly.
