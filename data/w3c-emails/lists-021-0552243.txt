That's a somewhat obsolete look at generic triple stores. The algae
implementation now uses the schema and algorithms described in
Heterogeneous RDF Databases:
  http://www.w3.org/2003/02/15-RDF-hetro-DB/
which leans on RDF Access to Relational Databases:
  http://www.w3.org/2003/01/21-RDF-RDB-access/
Ie, generic triple store is simply a degenerate case of a triple
store for accessing conventional (normalized) data with a generic
triple store for stuff that doesn't fit into the normalized database.
