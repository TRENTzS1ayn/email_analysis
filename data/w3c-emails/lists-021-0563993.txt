FredCo sells a variety of products to consumers and maintains an order
tracking database to track customer orders. The database is a
conventional relational database with a schema normalized for their
application

Each day, the invoicing program queries the database for orders from
the previous day. This query is expressed in DAWG-QL (motivating use
cases for this choice will follow) and, due to the normalization of
the database, joins several tables.

This use case calls for a mechanism providing RDF access to the bulk
of the machine-processable data in use today. It bears on the question
"how can we match what people use today?" Following messages with
address "how can we improve corporation's infrastructure?" and "how
can we improve consumer experience?"

It would, of course, be nice if there were no performance sacrifice
inherent in using DAWG-QL to perform this query. OrderTracking1-alg.sh
[1] demonstrates a test case for an application that transforms this
somewhat complex graph query into a single somewhat complex SQL query.
See also, the example tables [2].
