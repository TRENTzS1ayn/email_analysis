Each day, the shipping department packages and address the previous
day's orders. The address used comes from the shipping address
provided with this order but defaults to the customer's billing
address if none was provided.

This use case demonstrates a use of optional arcs in DAWG-QL. The
implementation, OrderTracking4-alg.sh [1], demonstrates translating
these to outer joins in SQL.
