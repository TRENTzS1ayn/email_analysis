The sales department can store additional data not currently allowed
for in the relational schema. This out-of-relation data is stored in a
generic triple store next to the normalized relations. Because this is
stored with more structure than a "notes" field, queries can be
constructed to make good use of this data (imagine if google stored
triples). This allows the organization to fluidly adapt to needs to
express different kinds of data.

This use case demonstrates joining a conventional relational store
against a generic triple store to resolve a query expressed in DAWG-QL
[1]. Another exmaple [2] demonstrates out-of-relation data being
stored in the generic triple store. The latter would count as update
but it is useful to see that the data could come from somewhere
without sales people entering triples into the database by hand.
