A consumer, Chip Thompson, wants to check on the status of his
order. His money-minding application, QuickWeb, supports a widely
adopted schema to track pending orders. It communicates a query to
http://fredco.example.org/RDF using DAWG-QL.

The endpoint trivially translates this query into a query that maps to
its internal structure (either a graph that corresponds to the actual
schema of their database, or a layer on top that is used to insulate
the enterprise programs from the implementation details). The endpoint
executes the query, re-maps the results to the outside schema before
giving them back to QuickWeb.

Chip plans to attend a party to show off the item which has just been
shippedq.

Sorry, no specific implementation on this one.
