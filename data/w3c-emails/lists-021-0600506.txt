Chip wants to buy a used green GMC Gremlin (a car) in order to get
some body parts for his own green Gremlin. He is not interested in
a lot of fantasy stories about green gremlins (the creatures). He
uses the semantic google interface and uses 
  http://ontologies-r-us.example.com/machines/cars/brands#gremlin
in place of "gremlin" in his google search. Google has scanned
several used car marketplaces so it is likely to have a match.

Maybe a buying-a-house search example would be better?
