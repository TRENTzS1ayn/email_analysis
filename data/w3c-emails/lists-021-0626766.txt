An automotive parts vendor maintains a database which describes
parts (their properties and their relationships).

A technician is repairing a vehicle and a diagnostic tool produces
a report which identifies a faulty part.

The technician goes to a query interface to the vendor's
parts database and asks "tell me about this part".

In response, the technician recieves a description of the part,
which provides sufficient information to determine how to obtain
the part and whether any other dependent parts must also be
replaced at the same time.
