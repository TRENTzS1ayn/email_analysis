A server recieves a request from a mobile device for some
content and expects that it will need to optimize its response
in terms of the capabilities of the device.

The server asks (the device, some knowledge base, some registry,
whatever) "tell me about this device" and recieves a description
of the device which enables it to decide how best to optimize
its response in the most suitable form for the device.
