A server recieves a request from a known user for some
content and expects that it will need to optimize its response
in terms of the preferences of the user (locality, language,
level of competence, etc.).

The server asks (the user client application, some knowledge base,
some registry, whatever) "tell me about this user" and recieves a
description of the user which enables it to decide how best to optimize
its response in the most suitable form for the user.
