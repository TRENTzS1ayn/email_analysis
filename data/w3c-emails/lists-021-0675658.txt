I'm not sure I necessarily grok every part of this use case.

Could someone suggest what kinds of requirements would arise
from this use case (i.e. I can't see where the line is being
drawn, or proposed to be drawn, between what DAWG would be
specifying and what would be application specific, e.g. the
RDF layer atop teh RDBMS).
