(This probably didn't come to mind right away since it is
arguably so obvious...)

A client is directed to a particular web service to accomplish
some task, e.g. purchase some product, register for a conference,
etc.) yet the client is not sure exactly how to best communicate
with that web service.

The technician contacts a registry which knows about such services
and asks "tell me about this web service".

In response, the client recieves a description of the service,
which provides detailed information about portals, parameters,
encodings, forms of expression, etc. supported by the service,
and uses an OWL reasoner to determine the optimal way to proceed.
