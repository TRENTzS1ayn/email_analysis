I'm currently working on an extended version of D2R MAP called D2RQ, which
will allow the general rewriting of RDQL and find(s,p,o) queries to database
specific SQL queries.

I have attached the current language specification and an example mapping
which shows how the ISWC ontology
(http://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/suhl/bizer/d2rmap/iswc.daml.xml) is mapped
to a corresponding application specific relational schema
(http://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/suhl/bizer/d2rmap/iswc.sql.txt). The example
also shows how D2RQ deals with taxonomical class structures in the ontology
and many-to-many relationships in the data base.

D2RQ is currently implemented as a plug-in for Jena 2.1. The first prototype
will be released sometime in May under an open source license.
