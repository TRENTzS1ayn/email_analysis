Patrick,

I agree with you that there is a useage model that is around some kind of
"get RDF about ..." operation - we have not convinced everyone of this.  The
important point is that the result is an RDF graph and part of the knowledge
base, and that this is different from a result set (whether encoded in RDF
or not).

One of the requests I received in yesterday's telecon for the use case "Find
the email address of "John Smith"[1] was for detailed explaination of what
the results are used for.

It could help me to understand "description" better if you could show how
the software used the RDF.  

Andy
