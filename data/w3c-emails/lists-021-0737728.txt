The Amsterdam DAWG F2F registration form [1] is ready.
I may have missed important issues, but all I thought
of for questions were attendance and meal requirements.
Please let me know if I need to add more to this
questionaire.

The sooner we fill this out, the earlier our hosts will
know what size crowd to expect.
