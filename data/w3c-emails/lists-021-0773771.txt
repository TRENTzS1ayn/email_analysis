I don't think this use case (and a few of the other "tell me about...")
demonstrates the "tell me about..." functionality as I'd like it
defined. I certainly think the use case is valid, but I see a general
"tell me about..." feature as adding a requirement not implied here.

The issue is that the server will almost certainly know which attributes
it cares about. It knows very well that it's not interested in the
person's latest weblog entry, or their haircolor, or how their mother
describes their first girlfriend's personality.

I think there is usually a fairly clear distinction between systems
which have at least some idea what they're looking for (just about any
automated system) and those which are truly searching for *any*
information relating to a particular entry (which I think would almost
always involve user interaction of some form; the classic "browser" use
case).
