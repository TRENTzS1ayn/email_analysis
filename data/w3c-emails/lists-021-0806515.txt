Hi Everybody,

I'm very pleased to be able to join the group as an Invited Expert. I've
been a programmer and technical writer off and on since 1965. In past lives
I've written articles and online columns on programming issues
(object-oriented programming, Java, parsing issues, etc etc.) for Apple,
Microsoft, and IBM. I live and work in beautiful Roberts Creek, British
Columbia, just north of Vancouver.

Most relevant to the task at hand, I'm the author of an open-source,
Java-based XQuery engine [1] and am the editor of Addison-Wesley's "XQuery
from the Experts," [2] a collection of technical essays from members of the
Query working group. In accordance with the Charter item on XQuery [3], I'm
particularly interested in seeing whether lessons learned from XQuery can
usefully inform the decisions of the DAWG. My personal programming interests
include efficient implementation of data structures, language syntax, and at
the moment REST. I'm currently working on a tutorial for IBM's
developerWorks website on a RESTfull interface to an XQuery back end.

I am probably the RDF "babe" in the group (I speak in terms of knowledge and
experience, not sexual magnetism unfortunately!) and am paddling as fast as
I can to catch up to the rest of you. Nice being aboard. I'm generally quite
quick to respond to email.

Howard
