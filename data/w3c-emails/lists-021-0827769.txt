I think the "tell me about this web service" is a pretty good example
that alot of folks should be able to directly relate to. It could  
perhaps
be fleshed out with a few more concrete details, but the skinny is that
the client needs to know a number of things about the service in order
to interact with it, and the service description should provide all the
information needed.

Eh?
