comments on the agenda?


2. Use Cases

DONE: PatrickS to write this use case up

Discussion of an outline
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-dawg/2004JanMar/0227.html

3. Requirements

An idea: if any 2 wg members agree on a short description
of a requirement (one word to one sentence), I'll see that
it's added to a list of candidate requirements, which list
is maintained thru the first ftf meeting. (ideally,
that list will be in the same place as the use cases
outline).


4. Issues

Shall we start an issues list?
