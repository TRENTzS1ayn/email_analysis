I would hope that we can come up with a formal answer to this and leave
the slipperinesses alone.

I think that this is the central issue that needs to be addressed.  In
particular, what can replace the proposed totalitarian solution to this
issue?

This needs to be addressed.  Fortunately, RDF has already mandated a
solution.  :-)  (The freedom to say ``anything about anything'' is also the
freedom to not listen to what the defining authority has said!)

Hmm.  This appears to be a bit unfocused.  I would say that there are at
least three related notions here: how and where information is stored (at
URIs, in documents written in a SW language), how to indicate that a
particular document is to be used (explicit import directives), and what
best practices might say is reasonable in the absence of other guidance
(strip off the fragment identifier and look there for a document in a
SW language you understand).

I would morph this into

Which document/document section gets retrieved when a URI reference
is dereferenced?

Other aspects are, I hope, beyond our scope.

Needs addressing, if only to categorically deny.  :-)

I would be happy not addressing this one.

Consider also RDF vs RDFS.   I believe that this one needs to be addresssed.

This is a separate issue that I don't think we need to address.

I hope that we don't have to address this at this time.

Hmm.  Perhaps not out of scope, but I hope that we only need say that for
our purposes if it is there, then it is (formally) asserted.

Committment is out of the scope here, I think.

Also out of scope.

Definitely out of scope.
