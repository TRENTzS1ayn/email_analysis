r1 and r3 are easy to meet with any ftp server. I don't
think r4 is a good architecture for query services.
I think query answering services should be related
to KBs by ordinary triples, not by URI munging.

Whether r2 can be met at the same time is unclear to me.
Do "currently-deployed browsers" support client-side XSLT?

I don't think that's at all feasible. You can't propagate
information for free; either you pay the price as publisher
(http/dns) or you get the world to support your views
(freenet, NNTP, etc.).

I don't think we should expect any technology to prevent
the winners from rewriting history, as it were.

My intuition says I should be able to make an argument
from information theory and economics about why you're
basically asking for a perpetual motion machine. But
I need to study information theory and economics some more ;-)

Using an HTTP URI for r1 buys you the ability to use the same
URI for r1 and r3... or at least: a syntactically related
uri, ala http://.../surnia-r3#surnia-r1 .

If enough people want to cooperate with you to keep the pictures
available, you can use something like freenet. Otherwise, I don't
see why the Internet/Web should meet this requirement. There's
no such thing as a free lunch.
