Seems already covered.

Can't you use content negotiation for this?

I don't know how this would work.  Which knowledge base?  How is it related
to the URI reference with optional fragment identifier?

It seems to me that you can already do all this.  Use a URI reference with
a fragment identifier as the name.  The web page and the RDF/XML content
(and maybe OWL content (and maybe FOL content (and ...))) can all live at
the URI address.  The query answering system could also live there, I
guess.

So you have

http://sandro.org/foaf#sandrofor the name
http://sandro.org/foaf.htmlfor the human readable page
http://sandro.org/foaf.rdffor the RDF/XML content
(http://sandro.org/foaf.owlfor the OWL content)
http://sandor.org/foaf#sandro?...for other purposes

All, except the last, would be accessible via
http://sandro.org/foaf#sandro.  The last, I think, needs extra parameters,
and thus can't be just http://sandro.org/foaf#sandro.  

This has the advantage that related names can share URIs.

You could even use redirection to use a URI reference without a fragment
identifier.  I think, however, that this is a mistake.

This is *much* harder.  I believe that it would need a significant upgrade
to WWW mechanisms, essentially a way of specifying a temporal component in
URIs and redirecting somehow based on this temporal component.  I don't
see this happening, ever.

I think that most solutions will have this property.

Why not just use http://sandro.org/surnia# ?  I don't see why this wouldn't
work?  (Maybe I don't understand content negotiation, but I think that
requestors can get the .html document and the .rdf document depending on
how they ask.)

I suggest that you bring this up with the gods of the WWW.  Or perhaps you
need to design a new way of sharing information between computers! The
Semantic Web isn't going to have anything to say on this issue, I think.

I think that you can already do this, modulo browsers and other tools not
adequately supporting you.
