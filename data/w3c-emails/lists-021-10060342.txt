After reading that several times, I can now parse it as English
(a comma ala "under a representation regime, context..." is sorta
implicit, yes?). But I'm still having a lot of trouble understanding.
How about a few examples? What's a representation regime?

I'm not sure what "excludes issues of differing languages" means,
but if it means disregarding things like WSDL and XML Schema,
I doubt that solution is very interesting to the TAG.
