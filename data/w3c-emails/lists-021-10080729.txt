This to my mind is the real crunch: I don't believe it is possible to
have a theory of relevance, such that we can distinguish between the 
assertions 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name' can make authoritatively
regarding the meaning/definition/referent of the property 'foaf:name', 
versus those assertions it just happens to be making in passing. 

I've other concerns with the strawman'd position, but until someone here 
claims it as their own and champions it, I'm happy not to trouble the 
list with them.
