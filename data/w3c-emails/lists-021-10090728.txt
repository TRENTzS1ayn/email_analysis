no. no, no - this is very different -- in English the string "person" 
may have many definitions.  On the web the string 
"http://www.../foo#person" may be said to refer to many concepts, but 
the label is unambiguous - think of it as if in English I was to write
  "No(1), No(1), No(1), this(17) is(42) very(6) different(7)"
where each of the subscripts refers to a specific definition on a 
specific page of a specific dictionary.   This would not make all 
problems go away magically (or we wouldn't need this group), but it 
is not the same as the first sentence I typed because you have a 
place to reference to somehow learn more about the intended semantics.

yes, but it would require a new URI if we then wanted to name one of 
these new concepts.

well, maybe - most people coming to http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hendler 
seem to expect to find my web page there... common "meaning" is hard 
to discuss, common referent seems a lot more straight forward, and 
something to ground the meaning discussion on much more precisely 
(See Harnad's many papers about symbol grounding and language)

I would love an operational definition like this - now can we find an 
example? (I've been trying to create one, but keep getting stymied 
because I'm not yet sure the implications of some of the different 
quasi-proposals floating around)

I agree with the goals, although as you know we don't always agree on 
how to get there :->
