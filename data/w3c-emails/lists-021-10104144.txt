I don't view it this way at all.  My view is that the English word
``person'' unambiguously labels the word ``person'', just as
"http://www.../foo#person" unambiguously labels
"http://www.../foo#person".

And how is this different from

    http://...#peter (http://xmlns.org/foaf) rdf:type (http://...rdf...)
    http://www.../foo#person (http://www.../foo) .

Just as providing pointers to documents provides a place to somehow learn
about the meaning of URI references in the Semantic Web.

The situations are even closer than this.  Pointers to dictionary entries
don't provide all the meaning of a word, nor do (single) Semantic Web
documents provide all the meaning of a URI reference.

Why?  Why would (should) a new URI be required?  Why can't (shouldn't) I
``say anything about anything''?

I don't see a difference between referent and meaning here.

Well, suppose I wrote a formal system that works by the strong-Tim hypothesis.
This system would be in a contradictory state if given the following
(single) premise

<http://www-db.bell-labs.com/user/pfps/#Peter_Frederick_Patel-Schneider>
owl:differentFrom <http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/> .

A system that implemented only RDF (or RDFS or Full OWL) would not be in a
contradictory state when given an RDF graph consisting solely of this
triple.  This should result in differing behaviour between the systems.
