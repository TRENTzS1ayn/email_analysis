Do you mean that the URI is ***as ambiguous as the english word*** in 
terms of meaning?

Should I interpret your sentence""" My view is that the 
***ambiguous*** English word ``person'' unambiguously labels the word 
``person'' """

still from Wordnet
http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn1.7.1?stage=1&word=person

1.  person, individual, someone, somebody, mortal, human, soul -- (a 
human being; "there was too much for one person to do")
  2.  person -- (a person's body (usually including their clothing); "a 
weapon was hidden on his person")
  3.  person -- (a grammatical category of pronouns and verb forms; 
"stop talking about yourself in the third person")

At least, we can identify two meanings here: the biological thing and 
the grammatical rule.
But you can also and sticking to english, imagine that:
Some people thing that some other people are not persons (example in 
the history with slavery, or women history)

Not only in this case the word but the word + its definition. And we 
know that definitions change in time too.

one of the definition of Earth is
1.  Earth, world, globe -- (the 3rd planet from the sun; the planet on 
which we live; "the Earth moves around the sun"; "he sailed around the 
world")

A few centuries ago it was not a globe, but a flat thing and it was not 
the 3rd planet, it was the centre of Universe.

Agreed.

Because of social implications and interactions ? Will you agree if 
the meaning of the law (the references in the code) were fluctuating 
all the time?
