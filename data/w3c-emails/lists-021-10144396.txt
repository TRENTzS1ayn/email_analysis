All I'm trying to say here is that A is the same as A, and that there is no
difference here between the Semantic Web and English (or French, or ...).

I would prefer not to have to do into changing definitions or even adding

I don't see that this has any bearing.  Even if I agreed that social
implications and interactions provide some component of meaning, I wouldn't
go so far as to argue that the Semantic Web should *prevent* the flouting
of these social implications and interactions, nor even that it should
state that such flouting is allowed but considered to be a bad thing.
Flouting social implications and interactions has a cost, but that is
totally different from being forbidden or even from being strongly
discouraged.

Huh?  This is how the situation really is.  The meaning of legal terms
fluctuates all the time and between different people, at least in legal
systems derived from English common law.  (The situation with respect to
the Napoleanic code may be different, at least in principle.)  The debate
over the US constitution is only a very extreme example of this
fluctuation.
