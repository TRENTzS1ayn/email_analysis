See below.

I was trying to produce a neutral term.   Examples would include ``the
model theory of RDF'', ``abstract ontologies in OWL'', ``first order
logic'', ``a unified theory for RDF, OWL abstract ontologies, and XML
Schema datatypes''.  

Under the first regime, context for an RDF/XML document is exactly what the
RDF (not RDFS) model theory gets you from the RDF graph for that document.
Under the second (not-quite-extant) regime, the context for a collection of
abstract OWL ontologies includes not only the information in the ontologies
but also involves following imports links and looking for other abstract
OWL ontologies there.  Under the third (definitely-not-extant) regime, the
context for a collection of documents could include all of the above plus
the results of some process that uses information in the documents to look
for XML Schema documents that provide definitions for the datatypes in the
documents.

No, it means that someone is going to have to state what sort of languages
can be used to write information.  For example, can XML Schema documents be
used to provide information for RDF?
