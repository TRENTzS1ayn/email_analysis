hmm. ok. I think I understand
but it depends if we talk about the meaning of A, the representation 
of A, the reference of A,

Let's say: article 123456X of Code FooBar has a reference.

There's a reference to this article. when you read it, you usually take 
the most recent version of the law, because as you said. It has changed.
BUT in the article:
- you have traces and references to the old versions.
- When you evaluate a case which has been committed ten years ago. You 
can refer to the law at this time. For example: "It was not illegal at 
this time in the past, and this is the pointer to it." The court will 
decide after if it has to be judged under the old article or the new 
ones, use amendment or not, etc.

You have a trace of all old meanings. The meaning of a reference 
doesn't change because it is dated and traced.

Though what can change is the interpretation of what people were 
thinking at this time, when you have centuries between the contemporary 
reader and the publisher.
