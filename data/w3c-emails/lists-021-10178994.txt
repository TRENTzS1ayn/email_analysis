Ah, OK, I didn't read it the same way.  But rather than dwell on that, I'll 
cut to the immediate debate...

To be a subset suggests to me that they are in some sense the same kind of 
thing.  My view is that they're quite different.

What I would say is that the formal meaning attempts to capture aspects of 
the social meaning to the extent that systems that behave solely according 
to formal rules do so in a way that is consistent with peoples expectations.

That would appear to be a point of divergence between us.

OK, so here we have some common ground.

When a programmer writes a program based (only) on an English (or other 
human language) description, I'd say that the *programmer* is creating an 
automaton that complies with some aspects of the social meaning.  But, at 
this level, the human translation is crucial.

I think I'm also agreeing with you when I say that as out formalisms get 
better/more complete, we capture more of the social meaning (or can create 
formally specified automata that are compliant with a broader range of 
behaviour that a human might consent to be consistent with the social meaning).

But until we have software that understands human languages as well as the 
people that speak them (and I'm not holding my breath), I assert there will 
always be some aspects of the social meaning that are opaque to formal 
reasoning.  As far as our Semantic Web software goes, I see that as meaning 
that we'll continue to depend on programmers writing special-purpose 
software to deal with the social meaning of particular vocabularies in a 
specific contexts.

I suppose that's an option, somewhat orthogonal to the preceding 
discussion.  As far as formal treatment of (just) RDF is concerned, I'd say 
the answer is "no", there's no further documents you have to 
retrieve.  I'vr seen some debate about the role of owl:imports, but don't 
personally have an opinion about that.  I'm sure we could (and maybe will?) 
end up with some kind of specification that describes how additional web 
retrievals can be performed to obtain more information to refine the formal 
meaning of some RDF+(OWL/whatever) data.  But while these may increase the 
reach and utility of SWeb information, I don't see this as addressing every 
situation.  At some stage, I think we'll still end up with aspects of 
meaning that are described by imformal language, and maybe processed using 
ad hoc software developments that embody the programmers understanding of 
that language.

Yup (about the "ton more ...")

Er, I don't follow that.

I don't see it quite that way.  To my view, it would require that the 
describing/specifying is itself done in some formal language.  By which, I 
mean a language with well-founded inference rules, etc., like logic, RDF, 
Owl, or whatever.

Sure!

I'm not going to try and tell folks here what Tim meant.  I'm describing my 
response to it, which I grant may not be supported by an in-depth analysis 
of the words used.  (But I know I find it infernally difficult to find the 
right words to pin down a difficult concept in ways that others can't 
misinterpret, so I tend to allow that others do too.)

By the latter, I mean new assertions that may be derived from available 
data by purely formal (mechanical) reasoning processes;  deductions that 
can be supported by some proof.

I'm not sure which notion of meaning you're questioning here.  When it 
somes to running software, I come back to the difference between a 
programmer interpreting an informal specification and a deduction that can 
be supported by proof.

For social meaning, I don't think there's a lot we can specify.  But we can 
still note that there are a range of social mechanisms and procedures that 
will permit consensus to be formed around deductions that are not supported 
by any formal proof.

And insisting on conclusions that are not supported by such consensus might 
be regarded as disrespect for the social meaning.

<Nods/>

I suspect there's only a very limited amount we can do about social 
meaning, other than to acknowledge it's existence and maybe put together a 
characterization that helps people to understand that not all useful 
information can be proven.  I absolutely don't want to spend the next 6+ 
months arguing this ... at the end of the day, I (and others, I suspect) 
will go write software and make stuff happen.  If and when there's 
observable harm then maybe we'll review what we're doing.  Meanwhile, maybe 
we can spot some of the pitfalls before we fall in;  if this discussion 
alerts me to any then that would be a useful outcome.  And maybe we can 
alert some other folks too.
