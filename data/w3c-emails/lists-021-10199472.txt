OK, the opportunity for me to ask my first naive question.

For now and if I understood correctly.

URI doesn't have to be deferenced. They are chosen or defined by a  
person or a group of person as a pointer to an intended meaning which  
is described somewhere else.

One of the issue: an URI relies on a domain name that can be cheated,  
stolen by someone else, given by the justice to someone else.
I know only 3 domain names which have not this problems.

example.org
example.com
example.net

Ex: http://example.org/meaning/tomato/sauce

And when someone uses it, he/she will choose the definition of it which  
is at the place http://www..../explanation/tomato-sauce (URL1) or  
http://www.../ontology/kitchen/sauce#tomato (URL2)


NAIVE QUESTION: Why can't we use these domain names to define URIs?

Reasoning: Why I came to this naive question.

In english, I can use the word "headache" (URI), but the definitions of  
this word is available in many different dictionaries
http://dictionary.cambridge.org/ 
define.asp?key=36196&dict=CALD&desc=headache (URL1)
http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/ 
webwn1.7.1?stage=1&word=headache (URL2)

Lot of possible choices here http://www.onelook.com/?w=headache&ls=a

So you will have an URI which is not dependent on the technical  
architecture and you can decide to say: "I have chosen that these URLs  
were a representation of the meaning of my URI."
