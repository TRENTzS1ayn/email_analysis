Agenda
======


A.  Set expectations for this meeting  (15 min)

    1.  Public notes for this meeting will be taken, probably on IRC.
        To appear at http://www.w3.org/2003/09/26-sw-meaning-irc

    2.  Speak up if there is a pause, or type "q+" on IRC to be placed
        on the chair's speaker queue.  Start by identifying yourself
        ("This is Bijan, ...") if you haven't spoken recently.

    3.  Pick a Scribe to take notes

    4.  Review this Agenda

B.  Set expectations for the coming months  
 
    1.  Lets try two more meetings and see how we're doing.  (10 minutes)

        PROPOSED: Telecon at this time on 2003-10-10 and 2003-10-31.
        At the 10-31 meeting we'll talk about future dates, perhaps
        keeping a twice-a-month pace. 

Who expects to be there, who does not?

    2.  Purpose and scope of discussion (15 minutes)

        PROPOSED: Our goal is to collectively write a document which
        is accepted as the TAG finding on rdfURIMeaning-39 by March 1,
        2004.

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sw-meaning/2003Sep/0036

    3.  Working style: issues list, requirements, branch points? (15 minutes)

        Preliminary discussion, getting some options on the table
        
C.  Issue: Does use of a URI in RDF imply committment?
    (variously phrased, variously debated) (40 minutes)
