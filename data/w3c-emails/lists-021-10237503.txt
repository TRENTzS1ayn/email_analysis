Hmm... that seems a little like sticking our head

Well, that makes this theory pretty uninteresting;
the question we've been asked to discuss is how
representation systems, particularly RDF, contribute
to the meaning of URIs.

I don't see any motivation for treating the
bit after urn: as different from the bit
after http:// , nor for treating that differently
from the xyz bit in http://example/xyz/
and so on.
