Sure.  Sounds good to me.  You write an RDF-only tool and get RDF content.
I write an OWL tool and get OWL content.  Netscape writes a web browser and
gets HTML content.

Sounds fine to me.  If I have a tool that wants to display HTML then URI
references with fragment identifiers should be somehow related to HTML
anchors.

Again this sounds great to me.  If I have a tool that prefers RDF then this
seems to be just what the doctor ordered - URI references with fragment
identifiers are names, and it is possible to get information related to
that name by accessing an RDF document at the URI that is the URI reference
with the fragment identifier stripped off.

I don't see what is missing from the above approach.

I agree that using redirection gets some of the same benefits.  I just
worry about the problems of uniformly using URI references without fragment
identifiers as names.  What happens if there is a document at that URI?
Is the URI reference then required to denote that document?

Perhaps it would be possible to use only URIs without file extensions to
denote non-pages.  This would however go against the RDF way of doing
thing.

Perhaps.
