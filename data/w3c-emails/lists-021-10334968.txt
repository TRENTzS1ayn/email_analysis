exactly what I was saying in "URI and domain name"

I'm worried a lot about any systems which relies on the power of the 
host. It's why I would be in favor of put the host out of the loop 
(urn?) or to have a system ala P2P. Where the content is somewhere not 
dependant on a particular hosts.
The other thing, I'm worried about, is ownership of the concepts. I 
understand the needs for private vocabularies. But we will create again 
a system where people will claim, you can't use this (URI) without 
paying it.

For me, it's a bit like if our language was something with label 
attached.
wordnet.headache
cambridge.headache
But you can't have anymore just headache. wordnet and cambridge are 
the hosts, where they should be only the namer.

Too optimistic and not for a long term. DNS, SMTP, etc show systems 
that were done for the good and have been used for the bad or the ugly. 
And it's not finished. We are only at the start :(

But if you make the system not dependent from the host you don't need 
to say "should", you don't need to be dictatorial, you just use it.
