That's an interesting claim; you write lots of text after it,
none of which actually supports it.

quite.

I don't believe so. Which prose?

I see nothing nonsensical about saying that a URI identifies
a galaxy. I'm not sure what "on the Web" means, but recently
it seems to be limited to the case where URIs identify
network doodads. I'm not aware of anybody, smart or otherwise,
claiming that a galaxy is a network doodad.

some of them are.

in other cases.

yes, it does if you're more careful with your quantifiers.

To say that *some* resources are network doodads
is not to say that *all* resources are network doodads,
i.e. it is not to say that galaxies are network doodads.

I don't see any craziness.

I don't believe anyone holds the position that all URIs must
have a single denotation in all interpretations.

The only moral I see is that we should be careful
with our quantifiers.

Yes, they do:

 A Trivial Convention for using HTTP in URN Resolution (RFC 2169)
 URI Resolution Services Necessary for URN Resolution (RFC 2483)
 and the list goes on, at
 http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/OLD/urn-charter.html
 
The software is less widely deployed, but
that's not a property of the strings, which provide
just as much access as http: URIs provide.

I think you meant 4 ;-)
