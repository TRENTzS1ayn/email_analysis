I agree this picture makes short-term pragmatic 
sense. What bothers me about it is that the 
RDF/OWL kind of distinction doesn't seem anything 
like a media type distinction. Maybe Im being 
overly fussy, but to subsume semantic depth under 
media type feels like a hack, and I am sure that 
if we do this then it will come back to bite us 
fairly soon.  And we can do it in a cleaner way 
by using our own technology, see below.

You are assuming that we will be using the same 
kind of tools we have now, and browsing and SW 
inference have nothing to do with one another. 
But surely we can hope for a future superBrowser 
which can use SW markup in some way to provide a 
more useful browsing experience. I have always 
assumed that we should be thinking about ways of 
including SW markup *inside* web pages, linked to 
the current visible HTML content. Then the 
conflation of HTML-# with RDF-# seems like a 
problem.  Like, if I can refer to a document, why 
can't I refer to a place in a document? Or to the 
anchor at that place in the document? I should be 
able to refer to anything, and it might be very 
useful to have an SW ontology which is about HTML 
documents.

Better say not, given what you find at the URIs 
already out there, eg the RDF, RDFS and XSD 
no-frag URIs.  But why do we need to specify what 
they *denote* at all? What they *fetch* is one 
thing, what they denote can be another. I don't 
see any reason to impose general conditions on 
denotation in this case.  If we have to say 
something, it would make more sense to say that 
IF there is a document at that URI which asserts 
that they denote something, THEN that is what 
they denote: ie what the document says, not the 
document. That is, they SHOULD denote something 
that makes that document true.  We don't have to 
go into details about what kind of 'true' that 
is.  That has the merit of making a rough kind of 
semantic sense and also covering the actual 
examples which are out there, eg XSD asserts that 
'XSD' denotes a namespace.

It occurs to me that this all follows from a 
simple principle: an URI should not Web-retrieve 
anything that is SW-false of itself.  So if A 
fetches a document which says that A denotes, 
say, a certain namespace, then it has to denote 
that namespace. Again, never mind for now about 
HOW it says that.

I think a better way of handling this would be to 
use a convention in RDF itself which treats the 
various documents as properties of a single thing 
denoted by the URI.  Think of a bare-ass URI as 
denoting an intensional thing called a 'webdoc'. 
Never mind what webdocs 'really are'; all that 
matters about them is that they have properties 
you can detect, such as their HTML rendering, 
their RDF rendering, whatever. Not all of these 
may exist, but when they do, they are genuine 
syntactic thingies that you can express as 
strings and look at. Now you can say things like

http://sandro.org/foaf/sandro form:HTML _:x .

and maybe some tool knows enough to automatically 
bind _:x to an HTML document, which it can show 
you if you like; but you can also assert things 
like

_:x rdf:type Liar .

which is not the same as

http://sandro.org/foaf/sandro rdf:type Liar .

or as

http://sandro.org/foaf/sandro form:RDF _:y .
_:y rdf:type Liar .

or  indeed as

http://sandro.org/foaf/sandro#sandro rdf:type Liar .

and to just say

http://sandro.org/foaf/sandro rdf:type Liar  .

is probably a category error, since webdocs just 
aren't the kind of thing that can be said to be 
Liars.

(BTW, these bnodes can always be skolemized into 
'new' URIs by some binding tool if you wanted to 
do that, and if there were some URI-form 
conventions then it would be easy to arrange that 
the appropriate forms were used, so this is quite 
compatible with your other style of doing things. 
BUt it doesn't require it.)

Basic idea is to utilize the fact that we now 
have ways of *describing* things and denoting 
them by names, so that we can distinguish them: 
so why not use it, rather than trying to hack it 
by using old tricks like file extensions or media 
types, which are already loaded with legacy 
meaning from other technologies anyway. We can 
write specs for RDF ontologies like this pretty 
easily, I'm sure.  Then we don't have to muck up 
or re-write existing Web low-level conventions, 
and we can use XML to convey all the information, 
and it's automatically accessible to the SW 
reasoners if we want to try getting fancy. For 
example, it occurs to me that one way to tell a 
simple-minded OWL engine to just use a bare URL 
to denote the HTML document, say, would be to 
tell it work out the consequences of

form:RDF rdf:subPropertyOf owl:sameAs .

which is kind of sneaky, but a lot simpler than 
reprogramming the low-level MIME handling code, 
or tweaking the file extensions in PERL, or some 
other Unix-geekish hack.
