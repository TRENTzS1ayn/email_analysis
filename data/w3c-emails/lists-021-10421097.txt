Of course. I have kept thinking and writing along those lines, but with not
much feedback here - maybe I don't speak loud enough, maybe my voice is not
one to be noticed against so many knowledgeable ones on this forum ... so
I'm happy to see this endorsed by a more authoritative one. Actually that
is something that techies know pretty well : a string means nothing outside
of a specific processing context ...

Amen. A NL word is also a string (or a stream of sound is the exchange is
vocal). And the "shared knowledge" is the "processing context", no more no
less. This is not big deal, either - just common sense for techies, there
again. Anyone having tried to communicate with anyone else with neither
common language nor knowlegde has experienced the painful absence of
absolute meaning. This is something I've experienced a lot in teaching
maths :)

Well, I won't be so definitive about boarders of NL. NL takes ages to build
up meaning through usage, and new forged names, and singularly technical
names, are for a while as meaningless to many people as URIs currently are.
But it may turn out that e.g. http://www.w3.org will make as much sense in
NL conversation to many users as W3C NL address (Street, Town, Phone number
...), and may be more than, say, "labeled hypergraph". It figures ... to
what extent do maths concepts belong to NL? Certainly "number" belongs to
NL, although it has not the same meaning for a 6 years old kid and a Ph.D.
in Algebra.

Sure. As Peter pointed out, we are not to expect to solve those issues in
our personal lifetime - and certainly not even in our lifetime as a species
:))

So I think we should replace "meaning" by a more operational definition
like "behaviour in some processing context", and figure what are the URIs
processing contexts, and what is the behaviour expected in each of those -
maybe depending on the URI type or extension, as Sandro suggests.

Exactly, and well, sorry to hit on the same nail again, but Topic Maps
specification has clearly tackled this issue by making a clear distinction
between references to "subject address" (using the URI to identify the Web
source) and "subject indicator" (using the URI to identify the "world
thing" denoted by the source). And TM processors trigger different
behaviour out of that distinction, and avoid pretending Messier 51 is on
the Web.

Yes. That would be like saying that "person" in NL is denoting only its
entry in Cambridge Dictionary - not even what is asserted in this entry,
but the entry itself. Completely absurd.

They are indeed, and both have to be taken into account. And there again,
in which processing context(s) does the URI mean the subject "directly"
represented (e.g. an application processing the image sent by the webcam),
and in which does it mean some abstract subject denoted or indirectly
represented (e.g. using dc:subject included in the same image metadata)

Here we are. I forward this to Topic Maps community. I guess people there
will be very happy to read that, and hope some of them will join here.

(snip all the rest out of time and bandwidth to parse it thoroughly - sorry
about that).
