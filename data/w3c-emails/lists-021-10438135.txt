I don't see that there is any problem here.  Why shouldn't the difference
between an RDF document and on OWL document that attempt to represent the
same intuitive notions be just like the difference between a GIF document
and a JPEG document that attempt to represent the same picture?

Sounds nice.  Propose a content type that allows this.  Browsers and RDF
tools alike could employ these sorts of document, after suitable upgrades
of course.

I don't see anything wrong with having a theory of HTML documents in RDF.
This theory would provide denotations for certain URI references, tied to
implementation using World Wide Web protocols.  If you have a URI reference
that has been determined to denote an HTML document or a portion of an HTML
document then the above situation would seem to still work.  The URI
reference still has a denotation, which is a document or document section.
Browsers can still use the URI reference as before.  Semantic Web tools can
still use the URI reference as before, including accessing relevant
information by retrieving a Semantic Web document at the related location.

Where this does begin to break down is if you want to be able to access
Semantic Web documents in a similar fashion, because there is no easy way
to extend this to have Semantic Web documents that relate to other Semantic
Web documents in the same way that Semantic Web documents relate to HTML
documents.   Some (new) redirect mechanism would be needed to handle this
case, but I don't think that it is needed right now.

Well at some stage of the game we would like to be able to have a Semantic
Web theory of World Wide Web documents.  I think that at this stage we need
to be able to specify that a particular URI reference denotes a particular
document, just as the typed literal "3"^^xsd:integer denotes the integer 3.

I don't follow this at all.

I think that this is incredibly prone to problems.  This seems to be the
``Use Implies Consent'' notion in another guise. If the meaning of any URI
in the Semantic Web is inextricably tied up with a document that can be
fetched at that URI, then I would argue that Lucent should not use any URIs
that are not controlled by Lucent or organizations that Lucent trusts.
This would make it very hard for Lucent to communicate with its suppliers
or customers, many of which do not belong to this select group.
