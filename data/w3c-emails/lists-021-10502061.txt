Sure, _if_ you already know that an aspirin is "medicinal" and that a 
dog is not.  There's part of your context.  Or look up a word that fits 
right in with logic/ai/etc - "proof".  Wordnet gives 6 noun senses for 
"proof", one of which relates to the alchohol content of beverages. 
Which one should I use right here and now?  It depends on the context of 
the conversation.

That is presuming that you can in fact define any one of those 
"meanings" in a clear and definite way that is completely independent of 
any context.  That is not likely to be possible.  Consider the legal 
profession.  Part of the business of being a lawyer is to craft language 
that is so precise in its meaning that it cannot be misunderstood, yet a 
large number of court cases serve mainly to determine the effective 
meaning of legal terms and documents.  The precise legal "meaning" of a 
word or phrase is determined primarily by years and centuries of court 
decisions.

So how can you ever expect to precisely define an invariant meaning to 
thousands and millions of URIs?

Right - if you want to converse with that group you had best use words 
in a way similar to the way they will hear them.  Context again.

What is the slang meaning of the word "cool", or "wicked" (as used in 
New England), or "bad"?  What is the meaning of "boot" as used in Denver 
and "boot" as used in England?  What is the meaning of "http://www.w3.org"?
