I may be a little unclear on how 'referent' is being used. If the term
infers 'the actual object', as in Venus, I guess it's pretty clear. Perhaps
a better example of what confuses me is my congressman. My intent is to
assert something about the representative like "he is accountable for X", by
virtue of his role as a representative. In this case I don't care that at
the moment my congressman is John Smith, since next year my congressman may
be Jane Doe. But my assertion still stands. Is this notion of role different
from the Venus example?
