To me, context refers to how the word is used in a sentence, in a paragraph,
etc. But you're right, definitions will rely on other words, which rely on
definitions using other words, and that is a system similar to what you
describe as follows...

That's the advantage URI's (should) have over NL, you use a different
"spelling" for each meaning.

I don't see this so much as context, at least in the grammatical sense, but
as agreement.

Just a consideration: why can't I just say that  "http://www.w3.org" means
the entire W3C? Would this encourage use that would promote untrue
assertions? You might say that it is too ambiguous, (the organization, the
website, the authority?)I would just reply "use a more specific URI". Use
"http://www.w3.org" when you want generality as in "The W3C gets things
done."
