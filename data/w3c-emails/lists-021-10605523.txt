Agreed, important point.

Why? Why do we need to say that it refers to ONE thing? Even as a 
normal assumption. Surely, all we need here is the following:

Right. Now, lets suppose that as well as there being a document that 
you get, that the document says that it refers to something.  (Eg the 
document at http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema says "This document 
describes the XML schema namespace.") Under those conditions, then, 
accepting the truth of the document amounts to accepting that it 
refers to some unique thing. It might say that more formally in some 
way, or it might not say it at all.  But it seems to me that all we 
need to stipulate is that if it says something, then there is a 
ceterus paribus, normal, all things considered, good practice 
assumption being made by everyone involved that whatever it says, is 
being considered to be true. That seems the least we can reasonably 
say about this, and I think it is all we need to say about it; and it 
has the great merit of being susceptible to precise semantic 
description which applies both to SW stuff and NL stuff that you 
might find there, and it treats the URI according to existing Web 
architectural principles (you ping it, you get a representation, you 
assume its true) and it seems to conform with existing practice, 
insofar as there is one, and it cuts through useless debates. What 
exactly does http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema denote? Well, use the 
Web, take a look, and see what it says.  If that doesn't tell you, 
nothing will.  We don't need to make this semantically dubious claim 
that URIs denote uniquely. There isn't even any way to make sense of 
that claim in many cases, and communication doesn't depend on it.
