I think this closure of context is essential.  I don't think it will
break the Semantic Web, I think it will *make* the semantic web.  
Without this closure of context this project could become a YARS, 
yet-another-reasoning-system.  One thing that distinguishes the 
current effort is that statements are embeded in the context of the 
web.  Now if I had to constantly compute this closure on my laptop, 
that would be impossible.  Similarly Pat warns in 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sw-meaning/2003Sep/0139.html,
"...*any* adult human being brings to bear an incredibly rich 
context of meaning and interpretation to any linguistic act. There 
is no hope of having software do anything remotely like this in the 
forseeable future;..."  I disagree. I think we will use huge engines 
running at places like Google to compute these closures.  I just 
searched the Web for the phrase, "semantic network".  According to 
this search application, I reviewed about 3,307,998,701 pages.  Of 
these, this search engine located about 26,400 pages in 0.12 seconds.  
Frankly, this does seem like software doing something remotely like 
the kind of ontological closure you're saying will break the semantic 
web and Pat says won't happen in the foreseeable future.

If constant, aggressive, far-reaching closure of context is essential, 
as I claim above, then I agree, some sort of sifting or selection of 
the relevant portions of an ontology would be a good idea.

As I say, this is the very thing that distinguishes the current efforts 
from dozens or hundreds of reasoning systems that have been built before 
it.  So I agree, but I would qualify and say it is a *research* 
problem.
