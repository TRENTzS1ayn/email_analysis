I agree with this.  But why not go on and say that it should be 
formal?  If you want to define a URI for use in RDF then you must 
embed an <> rdf:type ontology:ClassOfThisURI in the document at 
that URI.  The architecture should then specify that any URI 
that does not have such a tag defaults, for the purpose of 
meaning in RDF to <> rdf:type rdf:Thing.  So now all such 
undefined URIs can be converted into logical statements that 
assert the existence of Thing(URI).  An owner of a URI thus 
defines its meaning by embedding such a tag.  Operationally, 
any use of this URI should be checked for conformity with 
this assertion.  That is, if you use that URI in RDF, then 
you must do so in a way that conforms to the assertion 
that it designates an individual of ontology:ClassOfThisUri.  
Then, logically, the entire web becomes a federated binary relation 
of dyadic tuples (uri,type) that can be used to test all uses of 
a URI.

Any use of a URI that defaults to type Thing will 
always conform.  Furthermore, if URI is of type 
ontology:ClassOfThisUri then any use of that URI as 
a ontology:SuperClassOfThisUri will also conform since any 
URI that conforms to a onto:Class will also conform to all its 
onto:SuperClasses.
