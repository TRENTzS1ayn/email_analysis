I agree that at least some computation should take place at places like
Google, but I'm skeptical about how much review really takes place when
Google claims to have reviewed 3,307,998,701 pages. I don't know all that
much about the details of the Google engine, maybe someone else could
expound, but isn't this "review" a lot more restricted in scope than the
kind of computation necessary in the imports closure operation?

As an alternative, rather than viewing owl:imports as the #include
mechanism, suppose we view it more like the java import statement, where we
are simply state "the name 'someFoo' is the one defined by the full name
com.xyz.someFoo", sort of an on-demand basis. This way, you only agree to
the definition of the terms you use.

It would be convenient to have the ability to carve out chunks of an
ontology with a single owl:imports, sort of a subpackage mechanism, like
Ada, not java.

Just a thought.
