I think you just made Jim's point. If imports 
really does mean 'include' then your laptop would 
be trying to compute the closure.

Different topic. Google doesn't do any meaning 
analysis. (Well, that is not quite fair: but it 
doesnt do what I was talking about.)

I was talking about something else entirely. 
(Now, to be fair, you can make out a case - not 
one that I find persuasive, but there those that 
do - along the lines that the sheer size of the 
database represented by the Web makes all this 
contextual sophistication irrelevant, and the 
human-style smarts can and should be replaced by 
raw statistical techniques.  But even if these 
were true, it would require a Google on every 
laptop.)

Surely the key point is that to say its great and 
to tell people that you agree with it and that 
they ought to take it seriously when performing 
inferences from what you say, etc. - call this 
*endorsing* it - is one thing, and copying it all 
out into your address space is something else 
entirely. And to use the latter to do the former 
is like trying to move someone's house next to 
your finger instead of pointing to it (or writing 
their address on a letter). The SW really does 
need an endorsing technique, to be sure; in fact 
it will pretty soon need a whole range of 
endorsing, qualifying, explicitly rejecting and 
generally being able to comment on other SW 
content sources. None of this has got much to do 
with COPYING, however.

Why do you need one? Just USE THOSE TERMS in your 
document. That's all you need to do. Then 
anyone/thing reading your document will find them 
,and they will direct him/her/it to NCI, where it 
will find some stuff which it can use in drawing 
conclusions.  If you don't use any of the fast 
food vocabulary and there isnt any inference path 
from what you have used to it, then it won't get 
used (or at any rate, not because of anything you 
have said.)

Well, it can't ensure that others will use your 
stuff, presumably: but I agree this seems 
sensible and again, you don't need to do anything 
SW-special: if others start using your URIs then 
there is an access path back from their use to 
your SubCLass assertion to the NCI origin for the 
superclass.

All of this seems to be what might be called 
normal-usage on the SW. Ontologies use terms 
originating in other ontologies, using the normal 
Web linking to provide the traces back for users, 
so that inference engines can hopefully find 
relevant content. To the extent that the links 
aren't broken and the SW-markup composers have 
their act together (failure in both of which will 
be rapidly detectable), this will probably work 
reasonably well with the current 'design'  or at 
any rate the emerging best-practice. I take it 
that our current goal here is to articulate this 
best-practice vision as concisely and 
'reasonably' as possible without treading on 
anyone's methodological toes.

I think we can do better than that. Imports 
needn't be understood as 'now you must copy the 
transitive closure here before proceeding'. A 
much better way to interpret it would be 
something like 'this ontology is intended to be 
read while supposing that  ontology is true', ie 
that this ontology gives you, the reader, an 
explicit licence to draw any conclusions from the 
imported ontology as well as, and together with, 
it, the importing ontology. Not, of course, that 
you actually *need* that licence, since you are 
free to draw any conclusions that you feel like 
drawing from whatever sources you, in your 
wisdom, decide to trust for whatever purposes 
suit you best.  But (a) the importing ontology is 
trying to be helpful and (b) the endorsement 
links may add up a kind of SW-googlizable subWeb 
if there are enough of them, which I guess 
everyone hopes is going to happen some day , and 
(c) if your inference screws up, your lawyers may 
be able to put some of the blame on me even if 
the cause of the screwup is in the imported 
ontology; so I have, by taking this risk, 
exhibited some reason why if you trust me, you 
maybe should also trust that.
