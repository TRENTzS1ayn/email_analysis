well that is what I approve of - a sort of "follow your nose" - but 
when I said there is no mechanism for this, I meant in the sense that 
I haven't seen something specified that makes it clear which things 
are in an "inference path" and which things aren't -- that said, I'm 
personally fine with this...

I think you and I are in total agreement here (Scary, ain't it)
