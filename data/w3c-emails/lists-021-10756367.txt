agreed. Imagine for this discussion going on since the start on this 
mailing-list. How many english speakers with different background. A 
few none english speakers like me.

people will develop their registry depending on the community I think 
and we will not have One semantic Web, but a lof of mini semantic webs, 
that will have sometimes great deal to communicate effectively even 
based on the same protocol.

I would rather say that the dictionary definition is the choice of an 
editor on one or more interpretations of the word at point in the 
society. It's why words are entering or going out of the dictionary or 
sometimes change meanings.

Recently sometimes has referenced the definition of woman in french 
dictionaries at different years (on a scale of 150 years). The results 
are very interesting.

You haven't worked at W3C :p Ask to DanC ;)

Very good point and without saying that they are still on an ongoing 
production and that words, for example, starting by T are still not 
defined. Pathetic sometimes, but poetic as well.
