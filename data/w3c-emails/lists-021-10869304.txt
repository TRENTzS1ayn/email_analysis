Hmm. I just sat down to write a clarification of the question, 
which took me back into the thread, which made it clear to me that 
a lot of what I'm asking for is right there. Guilty of lazy 
thread-reading in the first degree. I thought I remembered it 
pretty well... 

So I'm going to go REALLY read the thread, and if I still have any questions, I'll come back with 'em. Sorry. 

Thanks, 
Mike
