And the degree of control possible.

Plus, the degree of control *other* people have over *my* document, if 
I use "their" URIs.

All of an OWL ontology is, save for comments, stipulative. I'm not sure 
what you mean by lexical.

Of terms, sure. Owned by the author, no. At least, if you take that 
literally, it's not only not done, but highly undesirable.

You couldn't use *anyone* else's URIs in your ontology!

Methodological point: Who are these "users"? If you are referring to 
debates on the list, it would help to point to threads or mention 
names.

Not me. Stipulations can evolve.

One thing I've held out for is the propriety of is a document author 
being allowed to stipulate the meaning of *all* the URIs in her 
ontology (well, at least ones that aren't part of the syntax of OWL or 
RDF).

It will inhibit me disagreeing with your stipulations, or overriding 
your (from my perspective) erroneous stipulations.

I don't think you've hit on the key to any debate on this list that I 
am aware of. Again, perhaps a pointer or some names of players would 
help clarify?
