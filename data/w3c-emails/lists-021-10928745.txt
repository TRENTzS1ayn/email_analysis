I don't think that this distinction really has any meaning for formal 
ontologies. All the meaning on any formal notation is in a sense 
stipulative, surely (?) since there is no prior basis for any other 
meaning it might have. OWL is not a natural language.

Yes, quite: natural language. But OWL is not ... (see above).
And just for the record, nothing in any RDF, RDFS or OWL can really 
be called a 'definition'. All of these language consist of is 
assertions. Someone else can always add some more assertions.

Well, the original owner's assertions can be stipulative about what 
it is that they assert, but that doesn't stop the meanings being 
extended by others.

Right. The point of this kind of talk , and its utility (and 
similarly in legal contexts, contracts and so on) is to *limit* any 
other interpretations or ancillary meanings that these words might be 
taken to have by virtue of some aspect of their NL meaning, to guard 
against possible misinterpretation. But OWL URIrefs have no other 
potential source of meaning to guard against or to be protected from. 
Suppose one were to try to imitate this kind of language when talking 
about a URI in some OWL; what could you say? It would come out like 
this: The URIref "http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes" in this ontology 
is to be interpreted according to the way it is used in this 
ontology. Well, yes.... but is this worth saying?

I would be interested in knowing how you propose this might be done. 
I have absolutely no idea even how to begin to tackle such a project. 
Remember that OWL identifiers are URI references, not English words.

To publish some OWL is generally understood to be an assertion that 
the OWL is true. This might be called a partial stipulation. It is 
stipulative to the extent that it says something positive about the 
intended meaning. It is partial since it generally does not 
completely determine the intended meaning. Nothing in natural 
language is exactly like this.
