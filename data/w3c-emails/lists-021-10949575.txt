Control over meaning is possible and frequent.  For example, """In the 
following triple, let x = "JohnBlack"; let y = "is"; and let z = "correct".
Here is the triple: :x :y :z. """  My meaning for x, y, and z is clear, 
unambiguous, and undisputable due to the stipulative definitions I provided.  
It would be silly for you to come along and say, """I dispute that what
you meant by x was "JohnBlack", In fact, what you meant by x was 
"BijanParsia"! """  Of course, the truth value of the overall triple is 
debatable, in either case, but *my* meaning is under *my* control.

Is the RDF version of Wordnet, http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/, "a 
lexical database for the english language." an example?  
A lexical definition reports on the way a term is used.  It describes 
the meanings of terms as found in existing statements.  The difference 
between descriptive definitions and stipulative definitions is the 
difference between describing and prescribing meaning.  I can see many 
uses cases of ontologies being lexical, trying to capture some existing 
terminology and formalize it in owl.  But I can also see many use cases for 
the opposite, stipulative ontologies, where new terms are created or 
existing terms are appropriated and their meaning, in the context of the 
authors statements, is stipulated.

Perhaps we could say authorship, and compare it to citation.  I can 
quote your paper, but I should put it in quotes and include a citation 
so my readers can look it up and read for themselves what you meant.
This respect for your meaning, by citing your entire paper, does not 
prevent me from using quotes from your paper.  In fact, it makes it 
more valuable.  I don't have to redo all your definitions, propositions, 
or arguments.  I can use your conclusions and cite the rest.

This distinction is perfect.  The meanings of the key words of the syntax 
are stipulative, and it would be pointless to dispute the meanings defined 
for them, if we are to use RDF or OWL as so defined.  Their value is due 
to everyone's acceptance of the stipulated meanings.  On the other hand, 
to the extent that everyone's meaning was always stipulative, there could 
be no dispute over meanings.  For it is pointless to dispute stipulative 
definitions, they cannot be wrong, by definition.

To use a programming language example, rather than natural language,
If we were to use OWL to define a programming language with an ontology, 
we would need the ability to define the keywords stipulatively.

One's stipulative definitions are not disputable, nor can they be wrong.

During many debates, you** have used the freedom to dispute the meaning 
of an authors URI as the concluding argument against proposals for 
controlling the meaning of a URI an author wants to establish for it.  
In particular, you just did so above when you said such a facility would 
"""...inhibit me from disagreeing with your stipulations...""".  I'm saying
that to the extent I use stipulative definitions it is pointless to dispute 
them.  The meaning of my URI so defined is just what I say it is in the 
context of my statements and the statements of all who accept my stipulated 
definitions.
