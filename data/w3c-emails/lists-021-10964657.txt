But you didn't, and it isn't. What exactly do you mean by "correct", 
for example? (Do you have a correctness ontology somewhere?)  And is 
there only one John Black on the entire planet? So which of them are 
you referring to?  etc..

More generally, setting out to define OWL meanings by reference to 
English words is hopeless. It is impossible to capture the full 
meaning of any English word in any piece of OWL; but on the other 
hand, the precision of meaning that can be achieved by OWL exceeds 
that of the most careful English statement. Formalisms like OWL treat 
URI meanings like very thin needles, whereas English words are like 
wide, flexible plastic sheets. They are just incomparable.

You intended meaning may indeed be under your control (though I bet I 
can produce doubt in your mind by a bit of Socratic questioning), but 
your intentions are kind of irrelevant since you can't transmit them 
over a Web. What you can transmit is OWL, and the meaning of THAT is 
determined by the OWL model theory. That's all that you have. Now try 
doing some stipulation.

No. Wordnet is a network of English words, not an ontology. Nothing 
in Wordnet tells you what any of the words *mean*.  Of course, being 
an native English speaker, you kind of know what they mean, but OWL 
isn't designed for native English speakers.

Look, NONE of these metaphors are relevant. The entire business of 
handling formal ontologies and asking about their meaning is quite 
unlike the business of communication between speakers of a natural 
language. If its like anything, it would be more like a kind of 
primitive telepathy but between intellects about the size of a 
dormouse.

Not in the same sense as a stipulative legal text in English. The OWL 
keywords have a meaning provided by a model theory. The nearest 
English equivalents would be the closed-class function words (is, 
and, not, and so on)  and the grammatical auxiliaries such as the 
'will' for future tense. These are usually considered to be immune 
from stipulative definition.

But, critically, they can be incomplete. Ontology sharing depends on 
this observation. English doesnt offer a good analogy to this.

I doubt if that would be possible. For example, there is no way to 
specify a minimal fixedpoint operator (needed for the meaning of 
recursion or iteration) in OWL.

You are here presuming a social setting in which the stipulative 
definition has a certain role. But this social setting is not 
applicable to web ontology traffic, so your point loses its force. It 
is always possible for one agent to disagree with another. The  Web, 
however, unlike English, provides a way to follow any name to its 
source, which allows readers to determine which sources are more 
definitive than others. If English were like this, we could all, just 
by reading a word, know everything that its inventor wished us to 
know about the meaning he had in mind. In this case, the entire 
apparatus of stipulative definitions would be largely unnecessary: 
rather than set out to attach a special meaning to an existing word, 
one would just use a new word.    English of course is not like this, 
so we have a different way to share meanings which depends on 
flexible social agreements which at times need to be explicitly 
denied or over-ridden. However, to repeat, the semantic web is not 
like a bunch of people talking in English.
