Yes I did, and I have.  I said my meaning for x, y, and z is clear.  I 
did not say I had defined "correct". It is you who has overreacted to the 
english meanings of the strings, all I said was z = "correct".

But how then does one thread this tiny, little needle?  The way you are 
describing it there is almost no way to get meaning into the system at all.  
I'm not talking about the meaning *preserving* inferential machinery.  What 
I'm talking about is how do you put the meaning into the URIs and how do you 
get it out.  How does one encode a URI with meaning so that it can be used 
at all?  And how does one decode it on the other end?  Obviously, you can't. 
Meanings happen to intelligent agents when they encounter a symbol and 
know what the intention of the sender of it was, by some sort of prior 
agreement, and so interpret that symbol correctly.  And this hardly seems 
incomparable to natural language.  What else in the universe could be 
more similar?

No, I use OWL to transmit my intentions, and it has nothing to do 
with english or natural language or even OWL for that matter.  If I send you 
a Java class file, coded to carry out my intentions on your machine, and you 
have a Java virtual machine, which can interpret it, then my meaning has 
been transmitted.  There is nothing mysterious about that.  When I use 
OWL, my meaning is NOT determined by the model theory any more than the 
behavior of my Java class is determined by the Java language specification.

Yes, they are ALL relevant.  You make working with ontologies sound like 
some mysterious black art.  If using an ontology is that hard, what use is 
it?  And again, what else in the universe is more similar?

Right, and that is because the meaningful uses of intelligent agents is 
initiated by humans, and in the end, it is still humans that 
interpret the final results for their meaning.  In a way, it seems to 
me that all meaning is social.  Who is ready to come out and say 
that their agent really "understands" the meaning of the RDF it parses?
Isn't the truth still that all of our agents are far less capable than 
even a dormouse of interpreting the meaning of anything?  So who 
here is doing the semantic work of the semantic web?

Yes I am presuming a social setting, and rightly so, in my opinion, so
my point doesn't lose it's force.  I don't think we are at a point of 
letting our agents loose to go their own way, inventing OWL all 
by themselves.  We still give it meaning and we interpret the meaning 
so given it.  (Us humans I mean).

And I too will repeat, I can't think of anything that is more similar, 
in spite of how immensely far we have to go.
