I'm not getting this.  How do you use this formalism to make 
statements about particular things?  Does the formalism get 
involved here?  If I want to make assertions about my specific 
company and its employees, and have my assertions understood to 
refer to them and none other, how do I go about that?  Isn't it 
true that until an association is made between the URIs in a 
document and some real (or abstract) things, that the formalism 
is not about anything? except perhaps logical forms?  If I want 
to use RDF to assert that a particular employee is strong, not 
the English word but the concept of that property, how do I get 
a URI to serve as my sign for that concept and have it received 
that way so the final interpreter acts on the same concept?  How 
do I make my URIs stand for my meanings?  Or when I receive a 
document, does the formalism help me to interpret the URIs? to 
determine what they signify?

My questions are only a bit rhetorical, mostly I would really like
to know if I have missed something important about the model theory.
