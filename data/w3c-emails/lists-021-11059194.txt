Just cherry picking a couple of replies to Pat.

I think this thread is a non-starter, personally.

*THAT* is Wittegnsteinian?! Surely not!

Still too simple. Gricean accounts quickly get way more complicated 
that this. And any convention based account is going to have to spend 
quite some time eliding the "some sort of prior agreement" so they 
aren't prior and aren't agreements :)

And meanings don't *happen* to agents. Most agents. *My* agents, anyway.

While I agree that my intentions, or most of my intentions, haven't 
been transmitted (how do we pick out which ones?), I don't knwo the 
behavior has been trasmitted. Frankly, only the *code* has been 
transmitted. That code bears a startling number of relations to the 
behavior of a computer, most of which is fairly underdetermined, 
certainly by the author's *understanding* (much less intentions).
