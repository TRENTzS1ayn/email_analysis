No, I would't say.  The graph (by which I take to mean the RDF graph) is
just a set of triples [RDF Semantics, Section 0.3).  In the graph there is
no distinction between owl:sameAs, foo:bar, and rdf:type - they are all
just URI references.

Well, some of these things might not be predicates.  Even requiring that
everything be filtered through the mechanism of an RDF graph might preclude
a particular kind of extension.

Hmm.  Well this might work, except that, as I indicated above, it may be
that a particular extension requires a different kind of logical formalism,
which cannot be couched as strictly an extension of the RDF machinery.
Further, this approach doesn't seem to fit into one of the preferred ways
of using URI references from the OWL namespace, namely just adding a means
of coidentification to RDF.

What does ``missing out on some triples'' mean?  

My preferred solution to all this, by the way, is to have different
languages, perhaps all being written down in XML, and perhaps not.  Each
language would have its own media type, at least.  (I'm not sure whether
media types are adequate for this.)  

Then there is no notion of missing out on triples.  A piece of software
gets to see out front what the language is, and can either handle it or not
(or, perhaps, partly handle it).
