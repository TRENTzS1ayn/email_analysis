Dan,

Before we continue, would you mind taking a 
stab at answering the same questions that Pat answered from the 
point of view of the TAG and the Web architeture?  Or at least 
the specific question that Pat answered: If I want to make 
assertions about my specific company and its employees, and 
have my assertions understood to refer to them and none other, 
how do I go about that?
