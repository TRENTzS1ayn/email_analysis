Like he said, I'd use owl:FunctionalProperty and/or
owl:InverseFunctionalProperty.

There's an ESW wiki topic where I started answering the
question in a little more detail... hmm... not much more.

[[
How can I use naming properties to tell that things are the same?

      * use owl:InverseFunctionalProperty. e.g. statecode, iata codes,
        log:uri 
      * @@discuss the cost of dropping the unique names assumption,
        equality reasoning, etc. 
How can I use naming properties to tell things apart?

      * use owl:FunctionalProperty, as in [WWW]mtgppl.
