You haven't mentioned resources, URIs, or the identification of the 
former by the later.  Is that involved?  So far, it seems that you  
only need the main URI to hang the owl:FunctionalProperty elements on,
since the meaning is actually created by the addition of functional 
properties.  Turning the question around, how does the URI/Resources 
formalism relate to these meanings?  It would seem that the main 
URI was almost irrelevant, you could substitute one for another 
and, due to the functional properties, the meaning would be the same.
Is this right?  How about the notion of the strength of one of my 
employees.  Are there functional properties I can use to get a URI 
to communicate to my audience that one of my employees is really 
strong?  How do I make a URI stand for my notion of strength, so 
that I can be sure my audience gets it?
