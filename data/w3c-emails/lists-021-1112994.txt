Hello,

Trying to catch up with the emails exchanged during the past 2 months,
I'm attempting to capture the 2 emerging solutions that I have
identified (*not* saying that these are the only 2, nor that the
requirements phase is ended):
1. RDF in XHTML using a mix of schemas technologies, mainly proposed and
developed by Masayasu [1]; this solution involves putting real RDF
inside the XHTML Markup; the XHTML Markup could be validated using a
schema validator
2. RDF expressed in XHTML, where the RDF content would be extractable
from an XHTML document using a well-defined process (such as XSLT); this
solution has been championned by Dan Connolly [2]

It is still a bit unclear to me if solution-1 does indeed require that
entities are expressible in XML Schema (as asserted in [3]).

I would be interested to hear if this is a fair summary of the current
situation, esp. from Mimama and DanC.
