Mutual use or agreed-on, it must surely happen prior to the successful
exchange and interpretation of my message.  But how can I be sure that 
my terms will be interpreted according to the ontology they were 
created with?  I certainly don't want any triples, with truth 
values attached, attributed to me, if the URIs are going to be 
interpreted according to a different ontology than the one I used to 
code my message.  I would say that in critical cases, I would insist 
on, that is, stipulate, that the ontology used to interpret my triples, 
be the same one I used form them.
