Actually they are (carefully) not conflated in the specs.  Maybe you 
should start with the specs and say what it is about them that isnt 
adequate for you.

I don't think it is very useful to speak of "the meaning" of a URI. 
Suppose I say, URI's (by themselves) just don't have meanings. I 
would be willing to stand up and defend that position in a formal 
debate if required. (If the TAG is reading this, I acknowledge that 
they might *identify* something...) . Now, does that answer your 
question?

OK so far.

At this  point a miracle occurs.  Machines CANNOT "get" human-level 
meanings of words. Sorry, but its just a fact. Ive been working in AI 
now for over 30 years, and I wish sincerely that they could, but I 
know they can't, and aren't likely to be able to in the forseeable 
future (IMO: others are more optimistic.)  However, on the bright 
side, they can 'get' some of it, for some purposes, and do useful 
things with the little glimmerings of it that they can get; and by 
virtue of being able to run with this little amount of knowledge at 
remarkable speeds over remarkable amounts of data, can do things with 
it that humans couldn't possibly do.

Don't rush to this conclusion. The basic point is that the machine 
(or the human for that matter) does not need to UNDERSTAND the 
meaning in order to pass it on to someone, or something, that does. 
All that is required is that the passer-on doesnt do anything that 
will change any meanings.  Consider: your picture above (before the 
miracle) could be applied to the current non-semantic Web, where the 
people write HTML with NL text in it, the machines do things to it, 
and then humans read the text on their screens. The machines don't 
understand the text, but they can transmit it and even process it in 
certain ways without either understanding it or breaking the meaning 
that it carries from humans to humans. Meaning isn't something that 
needs to be understood in order to be preserved in a message. OK, 
what we can do with SW technology, hopefully, is to have the machines 
do some smarter things than this based on a certain level of 
comprehension of the SW markup. They can draw conclusions in ways 
that are potentially very useful, according to rules defined relative 
to agreed-on formal semantics. But the stuff they manipulate might 
well have other 'meanings' for the humans (or indeed other software, 
for that matter) at either end, and we don't have to insist that this 
other meaning, if it exists, is accessible to the SW engines. All we 
need to know is that the SW engines don't break it: and to do that, 
all we need to know is that this meaning, whatever it is, is 
*preserved* under SW inference. So if your URI  means "strength" to 
you, then as long as the inferencing process doesn't break that URI 
it can still mean 'strength' to someone who speaks your language and 
reads it. If the formal ontologies that manipulate the OWL containing 
that URI are all *compatible* with your human-level comprehension of 
that URI, everything is fine. They don't have to actually be up to 
the task of grokking all of your meaning.  So the human audience at 
the far end can look up your URI and find your essay about the true 
nature of strength, and be enlightened as to your true meaning; and 
the poor dumb machines can access any OWL stuff that they can find 
that uses your URI and draw some mundane low-level conclusions which 
only reflect a pale shadow of the full meaning. But as long as the 
OWL isn't actually *incompatible* with your intended meaning, 
everyone should be happy.

Now, a parenthetical remark about the above. I've used the 'meaning' 
word here rather loosely, which is dangerous. Its very important to 
realize that the message doesnt 'carry' the meaning. All it does is 
send enough stuff so that a sufficiently elaborate representation of 
the meaning can be constructed in the head of the recipient. Every 
native speaker carries around inside their own head the meanings of 
all the words of their native language. When we talk to one another 
we don't transmit *meanings*: we transmit *words*. We already have 
the meanings, or the words would convey nothing. So as long as the 
words are transmitted undamaged, the meaning will be conveyed to 
anyone or anything competent to read it. You don't need a 
meaning-pipe to send the meanings through.
