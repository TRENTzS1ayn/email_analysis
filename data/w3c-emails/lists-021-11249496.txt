Well, we introduced URIs in a way that we thought was fairly typical
of the way most people are introduced to them:

[[
While planning a trip to Mexico, Nadia reads "Oaxaca weather
information: 'http://weather.example.com/oaxaca'" in a glossy travel
magazine.

The typical protocol is: you register a domain name and
set up a web server and then announce it thru existing
communications channels.

We discuss that very briefly:

[[
The requirement for URIs to be unambiguous demands that different agents
do not assign the same URI to different resources. URI scheme
specifications assure this using a variety of techniques, including:

Hierarchical delegation of authority. This approach, exemplified by the
"http" and "mailto" schemes, allows the assignment of a part of URI
space to one party, reassignment of a piece of that space to another,
and so forth."
]]
 -- http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#uri-ownership

Do you think it would help to elaborate on how the weather service
registers its domain and such?

Doesn't the section on uri ownership cover this, if somewhat
briefly?

Are you using 'baptism' in some technical sense? or just the
conventional sense of "A ceremony, trial, or experience by which one is
initiated, purified, or given a name."

That appeals to me. In fact, does it really need saying at all?
Isn't it obvious?

OK, now you've lost me. What difference does it make to RDF
or OWL whether the names start with http: or ftp: or mailto:?
If it works for http: URIs, why not the rest of them?
Why not in RDF/OWL?

"just plain flat wrong"... now that's a new one.

I'm familiar with the leves of truth discussed in
logical literature such as

  Three Levels of Truth
  http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/courses/logsys/3levels.htm

but I'm not familiar with that one.

The only way I know to relate claims like saying your
name is "Bill Murray" to ... er... actual reality
is with economics and utilitarian measures. i.e.
you haven't agreed to answer to the name "Bill Murray"
so if I want to get your attention, calling out "hey Bill Murray!"
is not likely to help me much. And if the police want
to catch a criminal called "Bill Murray" they'll be
wasting their time if the go to your house, and so on.

No, it's not all that clear how it relates to Tarski and such.
I hope we'll figure that out in the coming months/years.
But I think the document isn't totally useless in its
present state.

This use of 'name' is new to me. I had previously considered
names to be just a kind of term, i.e. a syntactic device.

For example, you/we wrote:

"for example, this semantics assumes that names denote things in a set
IR called the 'universe'"
  -- http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/

But now you're saying, pretty emphatically, that there's some other
notion of naming that you think webarch should discuss, yes?

'Web resource' is the universe of discourse, no? Ah... perhaps
you mean resources that are on the Web in the sense of...

[[
Note: The Web Architecture does not require a formal definition of the
commonly used phrase "on the Web." Informally, a resource is "on the
Web" when it has a URI and an agent can use the URI to retrieve a
representation of it using network protocols (given appropriate access
privileges, network connectivity, etc.). See the related TAG issue
httpRange-14.
]]
 -- http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-webarch-20031209/#dereference-uri

I think TimBL, the leading proponent of making that distinction
in the webarch document, prefers the term 'Information resource'.

You seem to be arguing in the same direction. But I'm not sure
I see an argument clearly enough to convince other TAG members.

no, only representations.

I'm not sure how best to view it. Web architecture works
best if they really are rigid, but it degrades fairly gracefully
if, on rare occasion, a few of them are not.

Use the resource in communication protocols.

Most typically: register a domain name and set up a web server.

[Again: 'resource' is the universe of discourse, so I'm not sure
how to take "not a resource, a THING". Presuming you mean
"not an information resource" or some such...]

I think we're agreed that, in general, one assign names to things via
communication protocols.

But beyond that, lots of people disagree...

One position on httpRange-14 is
that to assign a URI to a person, you refer to that person
using an expression in some language like RDF or OWL...

  <foaf:Person rdf:ID="DanC"> ... </foaf:Person>

and you use that RDF document as the representation of some
information resource, say http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/home-smart .
Then the expression http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/home-smart#DanC
is an expression for "whatever DanC means in representations
of http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/home-smart".

But another position on that issue is that, for example,
http://www.markbaker.ca/ is a name for Mark Baker because
it's his URI and he says so.

We're very, very painfully aware. I don't think actual blows
have been exchanged, but very close to it. The issue was
"postponed" for a while because we were unable to discuss
it civilly.

Haven't you been working in groups long enough to appreciate
how difficult it can be to achive consensus on something like
this?
