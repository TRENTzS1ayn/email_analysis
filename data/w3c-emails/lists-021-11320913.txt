"Trolling: Deliberately posting false information in order to 
elicit responses from people who really want to help." -
http://www.datatronics.net/glossary_of_web_terms.htm#T

I sincerely appologize to you, Thomas, and to the other readers 
of this list for my trolling tactics.

Specifically, when you truly helpfully responded to my 
semi-rhetorical, semi-searching questions as though I was a 
complete newbie writing to this list to ask "How do I use the 
semantic web?", I should have stopped and explained that I had 
been participating in this public list for some time because I 
have opinions and ideas about the resolution of TAG issue 
rdfURIMeaning-39. 

However, I really did think you knew that my examples about 
my company and its employees and my strong employee were just 
that, examples to use as thought experiments.  Also, the other 
things I said about my history and experience are true.  I did 
use Prolog for about 5 years as my primary programming language, 
I did create a forward chaining production rule system, and 
so on.  And I continue to work on semantic software, now with 
Protege, Jena, and J2ee.  So my questions do relate to my 
professional experience in trying to make these technologies work 
in the real world.

And thats all I'm trying to do as well.
