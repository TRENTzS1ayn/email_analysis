No, that isnt what I meant. We seem to be at cross purposes. 
Registering a domain name gets the 'source' onto the global network 
and allows it to create URIs.  Good,got that.  But now: what 
determines what it is that those URIs *denote* ?? More particularly, 
suppose that I own  weather.example.com and here I am with my 
webserver set up. I have a licence to create this URI: 
"http://weather.example.com/oaxaca" and I can arrange that my web 
server sends back something nice when it is pinged with it. OK, got 
that also.  But still, I havnt said what it is that this URI is 
supposed to denote (unless it denotes the thing on my Web  server? 
That seems to be what it represents in the REST sense).  How could I 
possibly say what it denotes? Suppose I want to have the URI 
"http://weather.example.com/weather-Inc" denote my company, or 
"http://weather.example.com/people/companyBoss" denote me. How can I 
do that? What way is there for attaching a denotation to a URI, of 
saying 'this URI, which I hereby invent, shall be the name of <insert 
named thing here>' ?

Well, OK, I thought it was also. But then a lot of the stuff in the 
architecture document and rfc2396bis and even in the RDF semantics 
doesnt really make sense, because all these things seem to assume 
that the [URI--indicates/denotes-->resource] relationship has its net 
cast much wider than this. This only works for cases where the 
internet http: GET protocols do the identifying. It doesnt get you to 
URIs denoting people or kinds of wine or galaxies or books on a 
library shelf (Roy's example) or imaginary white whales.

Because the way that 'it' works depends on the protocol, right? I'm 
not saying that OWL needs the http: prefix: I'm saying that the story 
about naming given above, that you liked, depends on it.

>Why not in RDF/OWL?

What internet transfer protocol gets you from

http://ontolingua.stanford.edu/doc/chimaera/ontologies/wines.daml#LOIRE

to a wine-growing region in France? Remember, what we said for the 
http: was that the GET protocol defined the name: but for examples 
like this, all that gets you is a string in a DAML document. How do 
you get from there to the intended DENOTATION ?

Well, you can go all Dewey-pragmatical on me, I guess, and then we'd 
have to chase all over the last 100 years of linguistic philosophy.

It seems to me that the idea of naming things is pretty basic and 
intuitively well-understood, and that the relationship of a name to 
the thing it names is clearly more than just one of denotation. If 
you read in a math proof "let S be a set ..." then "S" is a logical 
constant, but its clearly not a *name* in the same way that, say 
"Paris" is the name of a city in France. Names come with an 
expectation that they can be used to refer without further 
explanation, but logical constants don't. Logical constants (often 
called logical names, I concede: but then field theory isn't about 
growing grass) are really very similar to existentially quantified 
variables, in fact. Names - real names, 'proper' names - are more 
than just this.

I agree its not useless. If you interpret it as being about URLs and

Yes. Look, I was using 'name' there in a restricted logical sense (I 
prefer 'logical constant' for just that reason: formal logic really 
doesn't have any names in it.)  In that context, for example, there 
is no such action as 'naming'. But the notion of 'name' in society in 
general is a different, larger, notion. Kripke has argued for example 
that names denote their referents necessarily, ie that the 
name-->named mapping is 'rigid' denotation rather than just simple 
denotation. As Dan B noted, Grice had some other things to say about 
causality and naming.

I don't mean to get into all this deep stuff here or to argue for a 
philosophical position regarding the true nature of naming, but it 
seems clear that there is a notion here that needs to be respected, 
that is central to the Web (the use of 'assign' language and 
ownership talk is all tied up with it, for example) and is not fully 
captured by any kind of logical semantical analysis.

Yes, but that language is systematically ambiguous (because 
'representation' might or might not connote reference, and there is 
no way to tell.) But given what I *think* this is intended to mean, 
yes.

Right, that is what I meant. Things you can send information to and 
from over a network; things that react to network protocols.

I have to leave that problem to you, Im afraid. Ive given it my best 
shot. (I'm not sure what counts as an argument here. What case needs 
to be argued? That 'information resources' exist?? That is surely 
obvious. That some facts are true of network resources that are not 
true of other things? Again, surely obvious. That much of the 
language of the architecture document seems to apply only to network 
resources? That ought to be obvious, but I've sent you extended 
detailed comments pointing out examples.)

Really? That is news to me, but interesting. And its encouraging to 
see you using a term like "rigid" here. :-)

Baptism is (for our purposes) the assignment of a rigid denotation to 
a name, how's that? I'd like there to be some statement of how to do 
that on the Web, or a best practice kind of discussion of how to 
approximate it, or whatever. Because until there is, language like 
"... assign a resource to a URI" is just fantasy. (Some URIs need 
rigid designators, some don't, BTW.)

That doesnt assign anything to a URI.  Web servers emit symbols, is all.

Right. And there was an implicit request to try stating your answer 
in ordinary English instead of TAG-speak, since the whole problem Im 
complaining about is that TAG-speak hasnt got a well-defined coherent 
single meaning.

in some sufficiently broad sense of protocol, OK. But there arent any 
of those on the Web, as far as I can see.

Begs the question. HOW do you refer to a (single) thing in the real 
world,  such as a person, in a language like RDF or OWL? That is 
where we came into the discussion, if you recall.

OK, but that still may not be a name. For example, it may well have 
different denotations in different interpretations.

HOW does he say so? On the Web, that is? That is exactly what Im 
asking for: a way to *say* that a URI names something.

I hadn't seen the whiteboard pics, but I've read all those emails. 
There is nothing in any of this about the issue that we are talking 
about here.

HttpRange-14 is obviously relevant to this issue, but it doenst 
resolve it. OK, suppose URIs can indeed denote real red cars and 
imaginary white whales. That resolves httpRange14.  Now, how does the 
owner of a URI *say* that his URI shall be the name of *particular* 
red car or white whale?

BTW, it would be perfectly fine to say that there was no general way 
to do this, and that you just have to do your best to describe the 
things as well as you can. At least then we would know where we 
stand. BUt then y'all ought to take out all that mantra about 
resources being uniquely identified by URIs.  You can't have it both 
ways. If the Web is essentially a trade in descriptions, then unique 
URI reference is achievable only by some external technique of rigid 
designation, many URIs are not unique identifiers, and most 
'resources' are not uniquely designated or identified. Which is fine 
and fits OWL/RDF. Or, if URIs really are required to be unique 
designators, ie names, then there needs to be some principled way to 
baptize resources with URIs.  Which would  be fine also.  And it 
would be fine to have some URIs one way and others the other way, as 
long as we could tell which was which for most purposes (which I 
think is close to the actual situation, in fact).  But right now we 
seem to have a reality which is descriptive, or a mixture, and a 
rhetoric which is insistently nominal, and they don't fit together. 
Which is not fine.

I meant that it isnt apparent from reading the document.

This doesnt seem to me to be a very difficult issue. If the TAG are 
painfully aware that they themselves disagree about what a word 
means, then surely it should be obvious that they shouldn't use that 
word without some warning or explanation of which of the various 
senses they mean? Im not asking them to declare which sense if the 
right one, just to resolve ambiguity.

Oh, fiddlesticks. Make it a real issue then:

speakClearly-45.
Statement: when the group is unable to resolve internal disagreements 
about the proper meaning of some word, it should not use that word in 
any documents without giving some indication to the reader which

I'm not asking for consensus. Im asking for clarity. You can be clear 
about lack of consensus.

What I think might be going on is that the TAG are trying to give the 
appearance of consensus when they in fact do not have it, by trying 
to hedge round the disagreement by using language in a deliberately 
ambiguous or indeterminate way. It would be better to acknowledge the 
lack of consensus openly, IMO. Almost the worst thing that a 
practices document can do is to be ambiguous at a point where there 
is known to be strong disagreement, and room for misinterpretation. 
Achieving surface consensus on wording when there is no consensus on 
substance resolves no real problems, but just means that both sides 
can claim the document as authoritative on their side of the 
continuing debate.

But to speculate along these lines is rather unfair, since I havnt 
given the TAG time to respond to my rather long rant to them yet, so 
I will shut up at this point.
