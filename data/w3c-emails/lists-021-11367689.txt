I think I get it now...

OK, I suppose we can agree to that.

We have made some progress in that direction. I just scanned
the document, and nowhere does it say "each URI denotes a unique
resource"... at least not using the word "unique". I'll have
to re-read your message to public-webarch-comments, where
you excerpt lots of text that bothers you.

I'm only aware of 1 at this point:
We still have "A URI must be assigned to a resource in order for agents
to be able to refer to the resource" which overstates the case since
you can refer to things using owl:InverseFunctionalProperty expressions
but without giving them URIs.

Yes, quite.

Hmm... I guess I think of the architecture as being ideally nominal,
but practically descriptive.



Some minor points...

So? If x > 10, it's not wrong to say that x > 5.

But it doesn't conflict with those cases.

Well.. there is a warning...

And there is a warning: "The TAG has selected a subset of issues that
the First Edition does address to the satisfaction of the TAG"
and "See the related TAG issue httpRange-14."

Yes, it would be better to explain the various senses, I suppose.
But that would require one person to understand and appreciate
all of them enough to write them down to the satisfaction of all
parties. That's... real work!

Quite. I just haven't figured out how to improve the situation.

I agree we've reached a point of diminishing returns. I'll study
your earlier comments again, now that I think I understand some
things better.
