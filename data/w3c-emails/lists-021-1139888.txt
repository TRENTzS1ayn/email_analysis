Right, the issue there was that I don't know what sort of doctype/namespace 
these documents would have. I don't think we could sneak it under any of 
the existing ones. Mimasa mentioned that folks were considering how to do 
modularization with non-DTDs, but I that's nascent work.

The issue here is whether we could ask RDF applications to support an "input 
transform" mechanism, with XSLT as an obvious option?
