Great.  (Really !)

Maybe this could be (perhaps later in the document) modified or 
expanded to something like

"SW formalisms such as OWL provide ways to refer to resources 
indirectly by describing their properties. This extends the reach of 
the Web, by making it possible to refer to resources which do not 
have a URI assigned to them but are suitably related to resources 
identified by URIs."

maybe with a disclaimer about this being relatively new and not fully 
explored technology yet, or some such. That would both qualify the 
overstatement appropriately, and also acknowledge that 'descriptive' 
reference does ultimately depend on some kind of external anchoring 
and can't be done *just* by describing things.

Well, OK, but the trouble is that things like the TAG architecture 
document tend to rapidly get treated as Holy Writ, and so a careless 
phrase can have truly awful consequences once the Gods have gone back 
to Mt. Olympus and all we have left is the tablets of stone to argue 
over.

No, but it is kind of misleading to keep on about numbers fitting 
into two bytes when you seem to be talking about all numbers.

Lots of the stuff said in the LC architecture document does. Like for 
example talking about resources being connected to one another, or 
URIs providing ways to perform operations on resources.

I guess the problem is that all of this reads like its talking about 
resources generally, rather than about a particular kind of resource, 
since it is stated without qualification.
