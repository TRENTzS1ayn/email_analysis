Yes, I like this direction. We should be careful also to allow the 
possibility that the reference-by-description can be done with 
Literal-valued properties, as well as URI-valued properties (and for
that matter, bNode-valued properties, if such scenarios can plausibly be
concocted). Literal-valued properties are very useful for this, I think.
<c:Company c:nasdaqCode="MSFT" c:name="Microsoft"/> and suchlike can be
useful packets of information, without using URIs for anything beyond
the terms in the ontology. 

So I would change ending of your last sentence towards something like:
"...are suitably related to resources that are themselves 
unambiguously identified through appropriate descriptions or URIs"
(too wordy to actually use, but in that vein ok?)

Yes, I believe (in light of the 3-4 year FOAF experiment) that such a
disclaimer is appropriate. When we started FOAF there was no class 
owl:InverseFunctionalProperty. Now we have it, but I am not 100%
convinced the semantics it has (due to the approach we took to
formalising RDF and OWL) capture entirely what we need for
reference-by-description. Specifically, OWL allows that the
property/value pair might match different individuals in different 
interpretations, and guarantees "at most one"-ness only with regard to 
a single interpretation. In FOAF, I say that properties such as
foaf:mbox and foaf:homepage are "Static inverse functional properties",
as a (not yet formalised) way of claiming that they cannot take
different values at different times. If you believe "a1 foaf:homepage
d2", you should not be prepared to believe a2 foaf:homepage d2" at a
later date. I don't believe these issues are fully explored yet, so am
wary of sending an "OWL solves this once and for all" message.

That is a nice way of putting it. BTW the recent RDF-in-XHTML progress
raises prospect of reference-by-description at the level of hypertext
markup in human readable documents. This would/will/could be fantastic
for data merging and aggregation applications. Instead of writing:
<p>I went to the <a href="http://w3cfood.example.com/">W3C canteen</a>
for a delicious meal</p>, you'd write some expression (I forget the
syntax) that makes it clear that the prose fragment has as its
primaryTopic a "Restaurant" that has a homepage of [...] and maybe a
phoneNumber of [...]. Same for movie reviews etc. With some UI support
(eg. in weblogging tools) we could get quite a lot more clarity of
meaning in hypertext prose.

Note that this still works regardless of any worrying about formal OWL 
and reference-by-description issues. Our discussions there correspond
only to the distinction between saying "a" and "the", which I hope could
be clarified through annotating the properties/classes involved, without
change to instance data aspects of the problem.
