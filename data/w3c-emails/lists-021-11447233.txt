There is also the interesting matter of what you might call probablistic 
identification by description.  Here's what I mean -

"A man who has brown hair" does not serve identify an individual 
because too many people have brown hair, but

"A man who has brown hair and whose first name is "John" and who lives 
in the southern part of Cairo, IL, and who is married to a woman named 
"Betty" amd who drives a brown Taurus  and who is 6 ft. tall" - well, 
this is getting pretty close to inverseFunctional when you take it all 
together.
