In the RDF Semantics Recomendation it states:

"1.2 URI references, Resources and Literals.
This document does not take any position on the way that URI references 
may be composed from other expressions, e.g. from relative URIs or 
QNames; the semantics simply assumes that such lexical issues have been 
resolved in some way that is globally coherent, so that a single URI 
reference can be taken to have the same meaning wherever it occurs."
- http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#urisandlit

What is the effect of the language, "...so that a single URI
reference can be taken to have the same meaning wherever it occurs."?
How important is this assumption to RDF semantics?
