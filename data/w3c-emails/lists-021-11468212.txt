Upon reflection, that isn't the best wording.

Roughly: In the *graph* there are only absolute URIs. There also are no 
contexts, so every node labeled with the same uri is equivalent.

*Between* graphs, however, URIs can behave quite differently (until you 
merge them).

I'd say it's pretty important :)

Note that URIs in literals (e.g., in literals of datatype xsd:anyURI) 
are exempt from this merging. So the above text isn't quite right if 
you try to read it in full generality.
