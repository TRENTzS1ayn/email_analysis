Very important, but it carries less weight than you (and others) 
might read into it. In hindsight I wish we had stated this more 
carefully and avoided the m-word. I was thinking of 'meaning' as a 
function from interpretations to referents; regrettably, many readers 
understand the 'meaning' of a URIref to be a single referent. My bad 
for not thinking of this potential misunderstanding.

All that is meant is that *whatever it means*, the URI is the same 
URI everywhere. This does not mean "The URI has a single unique 
referent". So if I communicate some RDF to you which uses a URI 
ex:uri and you also find some more RDF somewhere else that also uses 
ex:uri, then you are justified in teating these are really the same 
URI, and combining the information to draw conclusions. You don't 
have to think: Oh, this ex:uri over here might be understood in a 
different context from that ex:uri over there, so it might not really 
be the same thing. So it really is a single global constant, the same 
everywhere.  However, it can still be globally ambiguous what exactly 
it is referring to; it may well be that all the information available 
on the entire planet about ex:uri is not enough to tell you exactly 
what that URI is supposed to denote. So one should read the RDF as 
saying something like "ex:uri, whatever it is, has these 
properties...."  rather than " 'ex:uri' is the Name of a unique thing 
with these properties".

Another way to put it, if you are thinking along logical lines, is 
that bnodes are existential assertions with scope a single graph, 
while URIrefs are existentials with scope the entire Web. BUt they 
are logically very similar in everything but their scope.  Which 
emphasizes that the above text is intended to be making a syntactic 
point (about co-occurence of names and lack of contextuality) rather 
than a semantic point (about unique reference). But if this isnt 
helpful, ignore it.
