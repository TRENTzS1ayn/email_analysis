Sure. People can lie, using the same vocabulary as is used to speak 
truth. Sorry about that. Adding to the vocabulary doesn't help, 
however.  If we introduce an explicit "this is true" predicate, then 
liars can still lie using this larger vocabulary: all that we get 
that is new is the possibility of expressing the liar paradox by 
constructing self-referential lies.

That question is meaningless. Your INTENDED meaning isn't changed by 
anything Peter says. If Joe merges yours and Peter's graphs then it 
would follow logically (and Joe's OWL reasoner could come to this 
conclusion) that you were Peter, with two titles. No doubt with a bit 
more information the reasoner could detect an inconsistency.  The 
RDF/OWL specs do not specify what to do if one finds an 
inconsistency. Some intelligence may be required at this point.

>  Who are my
>statements about?

This question is meaningless. A chunk of OWL is 'about' whatever 
things (are in the universe of interpretations which) satisfy it. As 
you may have figured out from my recent exchange with Dan Connolly, 
there is as yet no a generally-agreed-on way to formally connect this 
'rigidly' to the actual world which you and I inhabit, although there 
are plenty of techniques which seem to work well enough in practice 
for many purposes

That is the key, seems to me. When getting information about YOU, I 
will tend to trust sources that originate with you more than I trust 
random sources originating from others. But its no good expecting 
RDF/OWL to provide this kind of correspondence between description 
and origin, since by their very nature, RDF and OWL are supposed to 
be the common languages that anyone can use to say anything (that is 
sayable in RDF or OWL, that is.)  So liars can use them just as 
easily, and with the same meanings, as trusted truth-speakers. A 
public vocabulary can't, by its very nature, provide a secure basis 
for trust based on origins, because anything A can say, B can say 
just as easily. You need some way to check the signatures, externally 
to the RDF/OWL, so that a mere falsehood becomes an actual forgery, 
in order to get a bit more security into the picture. But that goes 
outside RDF/OWL semantics. Some of us have some ideas about how to do 
this neatly, but they havnt made it to anything like W3C WG status 
yet.

They are not required to do it in order to be RDF compliant, but that 
doesn't mean they are obliged not to do something like this. The RDF 
WG was chartered not to, and so deliberately did not, go into issues 
of trust and provenance. You are right to emphasize that they will be 
needed, and people are thinking about that right now.

It is impossible to distinguish these topics.

Suppose A states that a=3 and B states that a=4 and C states that 
3=4. Then if we take what A says at face value, it follows logically 
that what B and C say amount to the same thing, since if a=3 then you 
can derive 'a=4' from '3=4' and vice versa.  Disagreement over the 
facts, and disagreements over meanings of names, come down to the 
same thing when facts can express identity between names.

PS Great story about Bertrand Russell. When 'principia mathematica' 
came out there was a lot of buzz in academia about this new formal 
logic stuff. One of the puzzling things was that you could derive 
anything from a contradiction. Apparently at a dinner party someone 
sitting next to Russell challenged him to prove that if 1=0 then he 
was the Pope, and he answered immediately: if 1=0, add one to each 
side of the equation, then 2=1; the Pope and I and two; therefore the 
Pope and I are one.
