Upon reflection, using whitespace for quoting in emaijl isn't the best

Oy, yes.

But interpretations of distinct graphs need not assign the same domain 
entity to the same URI. So, unless you merge the graphs, the URIs can 
have different meanings. Right?

Really? Huh.

There seems *some* sense in which it does, as mergine graphs can alter 
the set of axioms in effect (talking about OWL, now).

I don't believe that.

Sure there is: Behavior under merging.

What, no values?

And others!

Ah, right. For some reason I got stuck in my head that literals are 
self denoting.
