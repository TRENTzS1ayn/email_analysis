Seems easy enough:  the person who wrote a book whose title is "Moby Dick" ?

Also, even within a single interpretation, it is common enough in 
real-world usage to depend on uniqueness of a combination of properties;  e.g.
   The person whose name is ...
              who resides at ...
              whose date of birth is ...

I'm not aware of an OWL construct that achieves this.  (Or am I missing 
something?)
