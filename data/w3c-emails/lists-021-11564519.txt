Distinct interpretations need not assign the same entity, right. But 
an interpretation is of a vocabulary, not of a graph. So its 
misleading to speak of interpretations of my graph vs. of your graph. 
The distinctness of the graphs, and of the interpretations, are 
orthogonal.  I can apply your interpretation to my graph, and vice 
versa. The ambiguity arises from the multiple interpretations (which 
we might as well think of as applied to the entire vocabulary of all 
URIs) not from the multiplicity of the graphs.

>So, unless you merge the graphs, the URIs can have different meanings. Right?

No.

Well, yes and no. They can have multiple meanings whether you merge 
the graphs or not.

The trouble is., the phrase "same meaning" isnt precise enough here. 
For URis (names, logical constants, identifiers, whatever) there are 
two MT senses of "meaning". One is the actual intended referent in 
the actual real world, assuming you believe in such a thing and there 
actually is one.  (In this sense, the TAG wants it to be the case 
that URIs have only one meaning, but I think its fine if they have 
more than one, ie are ambiguous as names. )  Another sense of 
"meaning" is the referent of the URI *in a given interpretation*, or 
equivalently a function from interpretations to things.  Given a 
graph, this second sense of meaning picks out a set of possible 
referents which gets smaller as you add more information to the 
graph.  However, note that in that second sense - the only sense in 
which a URI might be said to be ambiguous - its just as ambiguous for 
you as it is for me. That is, the ambiguity here isn't that you have 
one referent and I have a different referent: its that both of us 
don't know what the referent is (assuming that is that we have access 
to the same information: if you have access to more information than 
I have then you might be able to pin down the referent to a smaller 
set of possibilities than I can - your meaning in this second sense 
might be tighter than mine.)

Again, need to say this more carefully. Merging graphs can certainly 
restrict the set of satisfying interpretations, so can make the set 
of possible referents smaller. In fact if A is the set of possible 
referents of a node given a graph G and B is the set given another 
graph H, then the set of possibilities given the merge off G and H is 
a subset of the intersection of A and B.  The point I intended to 
make by the above was that if you think in the first way, so that the 
'meaning' is a single referent, then merging can't change that. This 
is really a special case of monotonicity, in fact.

Right: see above.

Well, get used to it. This is vital to the SWeb. URIs are the same 
everywhere. Your graph might have more stuff in it, so the set of its 
satisfying interpretations may be smaller than mine: but the actual 
URI, the syntactic 'name' (sorry, Dan, if you are reading this) is 
the same in my graph as in yours. And if I get hold of your graph 
then my grip on what that piece of naming syntax is supposed to 
denote is exactly as tight as yours.

But that behavior is only the way it is BECAUSE URIrefs are global 
identifiers which are the same everywhere. If they weren't, we would 
have defined merging differently.

Right, no values. You can't put most values into syntax. Take 
integers, for example. The literal

"17"^^<xsd:integer>

actually contains a string which is an encoding of a numeral, not a 
number. The value is a natural number (called in English 
"seventeen"), but you can't send a natural number over a network. The 
literals denote the values, but they don't exhibit them in their 
syntax (usually).

Plain literals are, providing you ignore those bloody lang tags.
