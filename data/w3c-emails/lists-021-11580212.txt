I don't know what meaning is. I prefer not to use the word at all. 
Representations, now, I understand what they are. Along with many 
other cogsci folk, my theory of how cognitive agents, including 
people and animals, understand anything is that the understanders 
have representations in their heads which are active in some useful 
way. We can do something similar with software (ie put 
representations in it and manipulate them) so maybe our software can 
be said to understand meanings as well, but the extent to which they 
do so is very, very limited compared to what humans can do with their 
mental representations. (And this idea of mental representations is 
highly debated by some other folk, so best avoided in any SWeb 
standards kind of a forum.)

>(2) formal semantics provides us with tools to describe some 
>representation transformations under which the meaning is preserved 
>(according to the representation used).

Well, OK, though again this talk of preserving meaning as though it 
was a kind of pickle bothers me. What the RDF/OWL operations do is 
preserve truth (or, if you prefer, preserve interpretations). Again, 
truth I understand, but meanings I don't.

>(3) "naming" is a social process,

Yup

I wouldnt go so far as to say all. But probably, yes.

Well, there  might be some links. For example, it would be perverse 
to say that names don't denote what they name. But there is no 
connection between the actual process of naming, what I called 
baptism, and the formal MT, right.

Right.

Right, well put.

Right. And this relationship, referred to by the word "identify", 
seems to be what the RFC 2396 and TAG architecture text is mostly 
talking about (at least, it makes sense if you interpret it that way.)

BTW, I am trying to figure out how one might actually do a URI baptism. See

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/PatHayes

for a (rather lame) start.

Thats the way it seems. Mind you, I still don't fully understand how 
URNs are supposed to work.

Right. Some of the agreements are handled by language, however, so 
there is at least the possibility of getting them handled by 
computational agents if we invent and agree on suitable protocols. We 
can ride on society's coat-tails.

Well, what would be an example of a non-consensual agent?

Ah, good point I had not considered. Hmmm, need to think about that.
