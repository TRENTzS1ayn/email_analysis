Thanks.

Agreed. This is a possible way to allow sub-document inclusion.

Hmm.  Actually I am proposing that *no* Semantic Web meaning can be
imported from sources opaque to Semantic Web reasoning.

Yes.

Sure, but in my view this intent is only part of the Semantic Web to the
extent that it is accessible to Semantic Web reasoning processes.

I mean here that applications will generally go outside the (core) Semantic
Web meaning in various ways.

Well, I think that MIME type may turn out to be a useful first step in this
process, except that OWL has the same MIME type as RDF.

I don't think that this is the way to go.  Instead I would prefer some
meta-data indication (such as MIME type).

Well, an RDF processor would only get the RDF meaning.  An OWL processor,
reading an RDF file that imported another file that had OWL constructs,
should, I think, pick up the OWL meaning of these constructs.

Hmm.  This would work, but I think that it would be better to just point at
an information source (e.g., http://www.foo.ex/doc) and use some other
mechanism (content negotiation?) to get representations of the information
(e.g., one with RDF MIME type vs one with OWL MIME type).
