I thought this made for an interesting data point.

I've heard that the proposed resolution to this issue is to send out
an email to a bunch of standards orgs, asking them to fix their use of
the SOAP URI.  Hello?!?!

Mark.

Hmm, that's new.  I remember having this same discussion with Yves a
few months ago when we agreed, IIRC, that it was good that /TR/SOAP
didn't redirect to SOAP 1.2, unlike /TR/html which does redirect to
XHTML.  The difference is due to the public meaning of "/TR/SOAP", as
determined by how people use it, is that it identifies the SOAP 1.1
spec.

Bug!

Mark.

Both point the user to http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP/, which *was* SOAP 1.1, but which is now the Messaging Framework.  SOAP 1.1 can, in fact, be found at [1] below (which I found in an old post to this list by Martin Gudgin).
