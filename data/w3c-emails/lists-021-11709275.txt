But this is true if you owl:import http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ also, 
isn't it? So the imports-only proposal offers no defense against this.
The meaning of documents under this proposal is just as dependent on the 
stability of the ontological context it imports as other documents are 
dependent on the stability of the schemas whose namespaces they include.

Right.  And now that you have explained it, I will refrain from using FOAF 
for anything serious until I have a way to make sure my documents are 
interpreted using the exact version of the FOAF spec that existed when 
I wrote them using that namespace or when I imported it.  Personally, 
I predict that you *WILL* change it at some point in a way that changes 
the meaning of millions of statements. And this is the point Tim was trying 
to make, I believe, when he said "that use of a URI in RDF implies a 
commitment to its ontology." 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2003Jul/0022.html For, just as 
changing the FOAF spec. would alter the sense of millions of documents, 
failure to use the correct FOAF spec., when interpreting some RDF document 
dependent upon it, would alter the sense of the document.  If it is "good" 
of you to refrain from changing the spec. in this way, it seems it would 
be similarly good of you to use the spec., that is commit to it, when 
interpreting someone's URIs.  The scale is different but the effect is 
the same.  By refusing to respect the ontological context of a document, 
"I can make docs that weren't currently true of the world, true of the 
world; and vice-versa."
