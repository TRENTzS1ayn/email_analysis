So, using owl:imports introduces a dependancy that just using the terms 
doesn't.

You could also cut and paste the FOAF ontology into your document by 
hand. That would, on our view, preserve you from not-in-your-control 
meaning shifts.

You could also import http://foo.com/myfoafmirror/ (pace copyright 
issues) (which actually might come up with owl:imports). The imported 
document could use the foaf prefix and provide more stabilty.

Except that imports and URI use are separated. So you have more 
flexibility. We didn't claim it was a *grand* solution, only one with a 
bit of critical flexibility.

In my view, you have it now. Cut and paste, or mirror and import. Are 
this horky, sure. But at least they, in fact, work. This is all we were 
advocating.

What? Your prediction is Tim's point? Sorry, lost me.

Still lost, sorry.

Hmm. I *think* you mean that, sans import, if I fail to (in effect) add 
the imports in, then I've changed the meaning of the document? Piffle. 
Not *my* documents. Refraining from an imports seems to me to be a 
powerful way to signal what I mean by foaf:knows (*not* in the Biblical 
sense).

This is a difficult point for a number of reasons. For example, part of 
the point of moving to a machine processible formalism is so that the 
*formalism* can encode the "specification". But our specs aren't 
separate from the things they "specify" -- that is, it's very much 
unlike the relationship between a grammar and the strings recognized.

Oh wait, I see. Sure, when interpreting *some RDF document dependent 
upon the correct FOAF spec* (for its meaning). But, sans imports, 
there's no way in rdf to indicate that dependancy. And that's fine. RDF 
meaning is perfectly reasonable. If I want to conform to some other, 
tighter spec, there are any number of ways to indicated that.

Hardly. In one case *you* affect the meaning of *my* documents. In the 
other, my different use doesn't affect the meaning of *your* uses. If 
the difference, thus put, isn't brutally obviously, then I'm at a 
complete loss.

Clearly not.

You are imposing this very specific notion of ontological context. It 
happens not to be in any spec, nor is it, contra some view, at all 
imposed by web architecture. You can propose it, but I, for one, will 
vigorously resist.

But I feel like there must be a thinko here. I'm finding this symmetry 
argument impossible to take seriously.
