Agreed, this would do it.  But it seems to violate something that has 
been essential to the success of the web architecture.

You mean make a mirror of a snapshot of the FOAF site? a cached version?
and import that? I don't know what you mean.

Ok. Poorly stated.  New paragraph. It reminds me of Tim's point...

Let's use a little stage setting here.  Suppose I have a search engine 
agent that populates my web site with results of a semantic web enabled 
search.  I am in particular looking for FOAF documents with a particular 
content.  Now everything is working fine until one day, documents that 
used to be retrieved correctly stop showing up and others that I've never 
seen before - and don't want - do start showing up. Now I have to 
debug this. Two equally plausible hypotheses occur to me. Either Dan 
has gone bad, and decided to mess with the FOAF schema, or my search 
agent has failed and its mistakes are equivalent to what Dan might 
have done.  I can't tell which.  My documents, using the output 
of the search engine, are defective in the same way in either case.
This is the symmetry argument.  In a society of communicators, 
correct interpretation is just as important as correct publishing.
