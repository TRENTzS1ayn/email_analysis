If I had a nickel....

Not only am I unwebarchtiecturallysavvy, but I'm unpatriotic, too! So

Yes.

What you asked above. I've in fact used this technique for development.

Are there "FOAF" documents?

What is a "FOAF document"? Any RDF document that uses a FOAF uri? What 
is the proper mimetype of a FOAF document? The FOAF specification 
clearly has bits that go far beyond what RDF/XML supports (e.g., the 
use of seeAlso). Interesting, a FOAF document can *only* be in XML:

http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/#sec-foafsyntax

"So, what is the 'FOAF document format'? FOAF files are just text 
documents (well, Unicode documents). They are written in XML syntax, 
and adopt the conventions of the Resource Description Framework (RDF). 
In addition, the FOAF vocabulary defines some useful constructs that 
can appear in FOAF files, alongside other RDF vocabularies defined 
elsewhere. "

But perhaps not RDF/XML only?

If I have a 500,000 triple file and it contains one _:b foaf:mbox 
mailto:... is it a FOAF document?

Or all the data has changed.

It would be nice if you had kept the symmatrands consistent instead of 
introducing an extra intermediary (and eliminating the authors!!). If, 
on day 1, the search engine returned my "FOAF file" (because I imported 
the foaf schema, or whatever) and, on day 2, it doesn't (because I cut 
and paste and modified the foaf schema) then it strikes me that the 
results are correct. It's *you* who want to 'find' my document, 
regardless of what I put in it. Hence the asymmetry.

What if I want to set up a search engine using my alternative 
vocabulary, or offer a flag "interpret according to Mean Dan's or Nice 
Bijan's version of the ontology"...this is a problem, how? In that 
case, you, the consumer, know what's happening and have control, in, it 
seems, a useful and approriate way. I, the FOAF file author, have 
appropriate control, too. If you are going to interpret my document 
according to Dan's schema, you are clearly going beyond what I 
intended. This may, or may not, be a problem. Finally, Dan still has 
control over his foaf schema 1) in virtue of being the author of the 
document with write access and 2) in virtue of his IP rights and 3) by 
control over the "obvious" and popular URL for that document.
