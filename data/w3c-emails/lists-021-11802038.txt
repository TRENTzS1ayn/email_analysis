It seems similarly unfair to me that you and Peter make out anyone 
who argues that "...the URI ownership system makes statements by 
owners authoritative weight..." would lead the world down the road 
of totalitarianism.  Nothing that Tim or others have proposed 
warrants your repeated accusations that we are proposing to stifle 
free-speech, crush dissent, stultify the semantic web, or otherwise 
prevent disagreements and usher in Orwellian thought control.

These are shock-jock type of arguments using guilt by association. No one 
that I know of who has ever offered a proposal for URI ownership would 
advocate homophobic, racist, fascist totalitarianism.

I'll consider that. You too, eh?

So drop the accusations of totalitarianism - they don't have a place 
in these discussions either. ok?

I'd much prefer to talk about that.  The fear of totalitarianism 
seems to me to be the mother of all social meaning arguments, which 
is surprising given your position on that topic.
