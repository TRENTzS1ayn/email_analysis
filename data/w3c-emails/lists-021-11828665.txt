You are telling us to let go? Maybe if you guys hadn't started off 
using paranoid language like 'totalitarian', '1984' and so on, we 
would all be able to have had a more rational discussion in the first 
place. It seems to me that this entire thread is completely pointless 
and is discussing a non-issue. If you want to be absolutely in 
control, and are more worried about being misrepresented than in 
communication, then indeed your recommended course of action may be 
wise. If you really don't want anyone else to have any control over 
what your documents say, don't use imports. If you want to have total 
control over what appears on your screen, don't use a Web browser. If 
you want to be sure of never reading anything offensive, don't read 
anything.  If you want to be absolutely sure of never being 
misunderstood, don't say anything.  Fine. Now, can you let the rest 
of us normal people get on with talking to one another, and referring 
to one another, and importing one another's ontologies in peace, and 
just ignore you? Apparently you want to be ignored rather 
passionately. I'm perfectly happy to go along with that.
