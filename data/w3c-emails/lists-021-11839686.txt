I don't think a chair can do a lot in this kind of e-mail discussion,
and I'm not sufficiently motivated to organize a series of telecons.
I don't think the critical people are motivate to attend and do the
work, so there's not a lot of point to it.

I'm also vaguely hoping folks will come up with solutions and others
will recognize them; it's not clear how well that's happening,
although you seem to be trying.

Personally, I'm trying to focus on running code.
