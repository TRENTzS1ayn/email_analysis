These are remarkable:
1/  owner of a URI reference = ruler of a state
2/  use a URI reference = live in a state
3/  one's view of the meaning of a URI reference = one's own thoughts
4/  using someone else's meaning of a URI reference instead of 
your own meaning = complete subjugation of one's thoughts about 
that URI to the thoughts of the owner of that URI reference
5/  not use a URI reference = leave the state
6/  other users of a URI reference = inhabitants of the state.

1/ I own a web site. I pay for the domain name. I pay for the server. 
I write all the content and the URIs used to locate it. This does not 
make me like the ruler of a state. I have no subjects. Certainly my 
visitors are not like subjects, they visit briefly and leave. I don't 
have a police force, a militia, or a central bank. I just don't see this.  
Furthermore, there are millions of other such sites, in the free world, 
of all sizes and persuasions. Even if everyone could fix the meaning of 
their URIs this is not equivalent to concentration of all power in the 
hands of a few. It would still result in competitive marketplace of ideas, 
the very antithesis of a totalitarian regime. Because what seems to work 
best is a balance of adversarial powers. I think a better analogy would 
that I am like the author of a book.

2/ If someone uses my URI reference, that's not like living 
in my state since I don't have a state. Using a French word does 
not make me a citizen of France. Someone may be aware of others who 
use my URI references and thus want to use them to communicate to 
those people. But again, I just don't see any similarity between using 
a URI reference and living in a particular state. Using my URI 
references is more like someone reading or quoting my book.

3/ Ok. I suppose my own view of the meaning of a URI reference is 
like my own thoughts. At least it is one of my thoughts.  Often 
my thought is that the meaning is as it is given.  Your own view 
of a URI reference is more like what someone thinks about a book.

4/ Now this is the most remarkable. I use words I didn't invent 
all the time. And I strive to use them as accurately as possible, 
often consulting the dictionary. Doing this does not subjugate my 
thoughts to the owners of those words, of the dictionary, or the 
public domain. Using meanings of words I take as given, I can make 
all sorts of statements expressing my own thoughts. Only vary 
rarely am I tempted to create a new word, or alter the meaning of 
an existing word. But if I need to I can, just as anyone can coin 
a new URI reference.  Using someone else URI references is more 
like trying to understand the meaning of book as the author intends 
it before making your own judgement of it.

/5 Again, not to use someone's URI reference is just not like 
being banished. You use it if its meaning suits you, otherwise 
you use another. To say you want to use it, because not being 
able to use it would be like banishment since you would be 
prevented from communicating with other inhabitants, on the one 
hand, and then say but wait, you don't like the meaning of it, 
and intend to change it, on the other hand, and still use it 
to communicate with others who do use the given meaning, just 
seems like grasping. You want it for its meaning, but then you 
also want to alter that very meaning. Its unlikely you can have 
it both ways unless you stipulatively give it a new meaning, 
which is a laborious affair indeed.  Not using a URI reference 
is more like not reading a book, or not quoting it.

/6 Other users of a URI reference are not like inhabitants of a 
state, since owning a web site is not like ruling a state. I have 
never seen it argued that the users of a language formed a state.
These are more like other readers of the same book.

I'm not sure how you get to this. I don't see how the millions of 
authors of URIs dictating the referent of them leads to a 
concentration of power in the hands of a few over newspaper and 
magazine publication, radio and television broadcasting, postal 
mail, assembly, public speech, demonstration, not even via the 
slippery slope mechanism. It is hard for me to see how the semantic 
web will ever be the only venue for making statements. Unless 
someone said, and acquired the power to enforce, that a URI should 
have a single meaning *AND* no other form of communication will 
be allowed to mention that referent. Furthermore, I don't see how 
fixing the referent of a URI could lead to a concentration of 
economic power, military, police, and intelligence powers, as 
well as executive, legislative, and judicial power, not to mention 
religious and other cultural forms of power. All of which are 
necessary to call a form of government a totalitarianism.

I agree this is a technical problem that needs to be addressed, by
some type of context mechanism.

I agree. I was just arguing in the extreme. Of course you wouldn't 
need to create an entirely new set of URIs, and since, as you point 
out, communication depends on using existing terms (or meanings, 
as I would say), you wouldn't want to. But if you *could* do an 
entire set for yourself, you can surely create just the few that 
you want to alter the meaning of.

It is the common *meaning* that allows us to communicate - not 
just the terms.  At the United Nations, many terms are used from 
many languages, but communication takes place never-the-less, because 
many terms can be used for the same or similar meaning.

Again, to communicate, you have to share meanings. I think the 
market place of adversarial power centers will work this out the 
best. URI references that shifted, would be avoided in favor 
of those that are stable. Also, if it is important that they 
should not be subject to the whims of the 'owner', it should 
likewise not be subject to the whims of anyone else either, 
and for the same reasons.

This is the problem of all inventors of words and meanings. You 
can't escape it. It is done through initial baptism then marketing. 
That's why its not done constantly. Its more economical to find a 
word that suits your purpose than to make one up and market it.

Not, as I said above, if you rely mostly on existing URI references 
with commonly known and fixed meanings, that you don't disagree 
with, and only make up new ones when you do.

Totalitarianism is based in part on preventing real communication. 
And good communication can prevent or destroy totalitarianism.
