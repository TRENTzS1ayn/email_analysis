I realize you are far less concerned with continuing to dialogue with 
me than with Pat Hayes, but I would rather you not quit the discussion 
or block me from your inbox. So perhaps a public apology from me is in 
order as well.

I apologize for casting you and Peter by name in my scene. I would 
be happy to post the scenario again with myself cast as the villain if 
that would help. But you are wrong in asserting that my motive was make 
you out as Machiavellian morons, or suggest that you had ever advocated 
inserting triples anywhere. Nor is it simply a bizarre fantasy. I was  
just trying to use what seems to be a standard tool in the philosophy of 
language, which I have started to read avidly, that of the staged scene, 
which brings to light some interesting twist on how language is used. I 
was thinking of Putnam's twin earth fantasy or Searle's American soldier 
captured by Italians in "Speech Acts". In fact, knowing your affinity 
for the philosophy of language, I was hoping you especially would 
appreciate it. More directly, my motive was to try to get you to see that 
a certain position that you have held, well, sort of rigidly to, would in  
circumstances other than those you are used to think of it in, would 
not work at all and would in fact be both technically and morally wrong.

Alright. Once again your precision and knowledge of argumentation 
just astounds me. I apologize for saying that you and Peter made anyone 
out as I described. I was mincing several emails from others together 
with statements in your paper and then, as you say, claiming you 
accused others of proposing the negative consequences, rather than 
proposing something that has negative consequences. On the other 
hand, when you make statements like the one I quoted, "...for any 
proposal for Semantic Web meaning that cuts off easy access to 
disagreements will inevitably end up stultifying the Semantic Web."
The distinction does start tending to blur, in my mind, for things 
that are inevitable are often obvious and proposing something that has 
obvious and inevitable consequences is getting sort of close to 
proposing the consequences themselves.

Shock jocks make their ideas feel profoundly important by 
attaching other highly emotionally charged (shocking) ideas to 
them. The examples in Dan's and Jeremy's emails have that feel to 
me - anti-homosexual bias, racism, but so does totalitarianism.

As I said above, I apologize for any misrepresentation of your 
views along these lines.

I missed this one. We author both. And this is relevant. URIs 
have a rich semantics, all by themselves. RDF semantics may 
ignore it, but that doesn't make it go away.

I apologize for the tit-for-tat sound of that remark. No 
blackmail intended. But do consider the effect of even the 
remote implication that I am proposing totalitarianism, which 
I truly abhor.

I have begun to do so in another post.

Again, please accept my apology.

Last year when I brought of the possibility of product liability 
and fraud in an email, you and Peter were both very negative 
to my expressed concerns. 
Peter: "Do you really expect the Semantic 
Web to prohibit lying? ... Do you really expect the Semantic Web to 
educate fools?" 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sw-meaning/2003Oct/0011.html

Bijan: "The analogies have well leaked over to the hysterical." and 
"At this point I become totally annoyed by the analogies. This is no 
longer argument, and the analogies stretch all credibility."
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sw-meaning/2003Oct/0037.html

In a way, the fear of totalitarianism argument seems much like the original 
examples in Section 4. as well as others like mine about liability and 
fraud. And I feel the same way about the totalitarianism analogy as you did 
about mine, that it is hysterical and stretches all credibility.

I hope you don't after reading these sincere and public apologies.
