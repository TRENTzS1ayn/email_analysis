Well, yes, guilty as charged.  If every term (not just common words, but
also proper names, noun phrases, etc.) I use commits me to information
created by the coiner of that term, then I would be happier under a vow of
silence.

Note, however, that this only holds for me if the commitment comes from
*every* *term* and from a place determined by the form of the term.  I am
perfectly willing to join communities that provide a common set of
information related to certain terms.

Yes, I want to retain this ability for certain cases.  I believe that most
terms will indeed have a commonly-used meaning, and that this meaning will
usually be provided by the coiner of the term.  I fully realize that there
is a cost to be paid by not committing to this meaning, and that this cost
can indeed be quite serious.

Yes, this could happen in our scheme.  However we do allow that different
users of a term can commit to the same meaning of that term, either by
independently incoporating equivalent (or similar) information related to
that term, or, preferably, by both importing a document that provides
information about that term.  This imported document can easily be the
standard document provided by the coiner of the term.  We thus do not
expect that communication will collapse because of differing definitions
for most or all terms.

Well, yes, this is a danger.  I believe that it is not a negligible danger
- for some terms - and thus that a communication scheme must have ways to
opt out of information provided by the coiner of a term.  I believe that
human communication works this way - usually we go along with the standard
information package related to meaning of a term, e.g., the president of the
United States, but sometimes, and sometimes even for good reasons, we opt
out of this standard package, perhaps to argue that the true president of
the United States is not the person annointed by the Supreme Court but is
instead the person who should have received the most electoral votes under
the rules in place at the time the election was held.

Well I am (currently) prepared to believe that you exist and, moreover, to
commit to the information about you that is contained in your home page.

Well, to summarize, I view the opt-out aspects of our proposal to be there
for the hopefully rare cases where they are needed and that communities, in
particular application communities, will in fact end up always using the
coiner-provided meaning of the terms related to their interests.
