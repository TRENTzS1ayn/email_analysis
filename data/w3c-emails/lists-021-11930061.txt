Of course, I agree with this, too.

No, I think its fine to use emotive terms.

No, again, lets stick with controversial themes.

I apologize if I offended you with the "shock-jock type of 
arguments" comment. I do not think you are shock-jocks. Nor 
did I mean to say that your ideas were pedestrian, please forgive 
me if it came out that way.

I too like emotive examples, believe in the importance of these
ideas, and understand how corner cases can make or break a 
technology.

My objection is that if you're not very careful, in certain 
arguments, the emotive imagery can end up trumping the technical 
arguments or even preventing people from pursuing potential 
solutions for fear, for example, of being accused of bringing on 
1984. And by the way, this whole discussion makes me want to 
proclaim, defensively, that I am a firmly in support of the first 
amendment, bill-of-rights, ACLU, amnesty-international, ethic 
diversity, and lifestyles choices - AND I think it can work for 
URI 'owners' to have extra authority over the meaning of the terms 
they author.

Technically though, I think something more like 
'speaker-meaning' is what we're after. Then 'ownership' could 
be relegated to a less semantic role.

And 'speaker meaning' also. I think we should carefully distinguish 
between shared or literal meaning and speaker meaning. I believe not 
making that distinction has led to a number of problems and senseless 
disagreements.
