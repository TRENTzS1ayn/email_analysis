You say there are still these hopefully rare cases where opt-out 
of information provided by the coiner of a term is needed.

But consider the following scenario:

Suppose a good civil libertarian decides to set up a semantically 
enabled web site advising voters how to vote. He implements an 
agent which scans the RDF/OWL of congressmen and women looking for 
those who use 'softening-up' to mean 'righteous cruelty when 
carried out in the name of the war on terrorism', or other 
offensive definitions of certain controversial terms. When this 
agent finds such a use, it generates an RDF/OWL document that cites 
this use, states its oposition to the term, and then recommends to 
the constituents of the site that they vote against that politician. 
These RDF/OWL documents are then converted to HTML and used by 
citizens on their way to the polls.

This example has all the ingredients of such a case. The term in 
question is one of those disputed terms rather than a question of 
fact based on a shared vocabulary. It is highly politicized with 
angry participants on all sides of the debate. The purpose and 
design of the agent in question is to register dissent with the 
term and with the policies that would result from its use.

And yet, I assert, such an agent could not function if it opted-out 
of the politicians offensive definitions of those controversial 
terms. In fact, the more information provided by the coiner of 
the term this agent can access and rely on for its determination 
of its dissent, the more valid and useful it will be.
