John --

It's good to see someone stating the problems -- the first step to a solution!

A few of your stated problems concerning intended interpretations and URIs 
are addressed in the "Semantic Web Presentation" at www.reengineeringllc.com .

In case your are now thinking, "Oh great, Yet Another Powerpoint", there's 
an online system in which you can run all the examples in the presentation, 
using a browser.  You can also use a browser to write and run your own 
examples.

HTH,  -- Adrian
