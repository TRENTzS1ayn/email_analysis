Some of these are difficult in the real world also. But in the 
real world we have the benefit of the full power of natural 
language, centuries of vocabulary development, human perception, 
problem solving, and general intelligence, with brains that have 
evolved language capabilities over many millenniums. Still we have 
trouble.

But this is a new, artificial language that will be processed 
by machines without perception, natural language, or general 
intelligence. Things that we, as individuals take for granted 
in the real world, like 30 years of language vocabulary learning 
and conversational policy development are just missing. Its not 
like the real world. It is utterly language impoverished and 
we must manually supply everything it will do.
