But you don't seem to be working towards a STANDARD solution. 
There have been many proprietary knowledge representation and 
agent communication language systems developed over the years. 
Some of them are arguably more powerful or sophisticated than 
RDF or OWL. Yet none of them can talk to the rest. I prefer to 
support the ones being developed by the w3c because they are 
based on public, open standards. There is at least a chance 
that all agents based on these standards will be able to 
communicate with each other.
