I'm not quite sure why you are making these statements.  Yes, the Semantic
Web is currently quite literal, in that there is no way of stating
disbelief, denying something, etc., etc.  However, it is difficult to
devise a (single, uniform) representation language that gets all these
right, particularly if one wants to effectively reason in that language.

In any case, there are indeed already more-or-less standard ways of doing
much of what you appear to want.

How about the ``owner'' of the web page, just like for web pages that are
HTML or XML documents?

Again, why not the usual situation in the rest of the web?  The contents of
Semantic Web web pages are asserted, just like other web pages.  Yes, no
Semantic Web language currently allows for denying, or quoting, or other
relationships between agents and propositions, but this may change.

Well determining (all of) an ``intended'' interpretation is generally not
possible.  All that a formal language can do is provide information that
can be used to narrow down the formal interpretation of a term.  There
already is a standard mechanism (owl:imports) that allows for the inclusion
of the meaning of one Semantic Web document (written in OWL) in another.
What more is needed at this point?

This is not an easy problem to solve.  The current treatment of the
denotation of URI references at least has the desirable feature that it
does not rule out future solutions to this problem.

I'm of the opinion that removing information from a Semantic Web web page
``unsays'' it.

Not to my mind.  I've been arguing very hard for a (particular) notion of
Semantic Web pragmatics that I think is very pragmatically motivated.

Sure, there are lots of things that one might like to be able to do in the
Semantic Web that are not currently possible.  I don't expect this to
change (at least for quite some time) - formal languages and programs are
currently not nearly as capable as human beings and there are other issues
to be considered (such as symbol grounding).

As well, the work on Named Graphs (currently available at
http://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/suhl/bizer/SWTSGuide/carroll-ISWC2004.pdf)
appears to me to fit right into what you want.
