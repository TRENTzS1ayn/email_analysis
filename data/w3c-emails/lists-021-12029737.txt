Please take look at the attached file, RDFQueryLangComparison1.txt;

The example tries to build on the standards work from W3C, to fill in some 
of the glaring gaps you have so rightly pointed out.  It uses one form of 
RDF as the base.

So far as I know, there is no work from W3C so far that directly addresses 
the crucial human-semantics/pragmatics problems you have listed.  In fact, 
if I understand correctly, RDF/OWL is by design machine- rather than 
human-oriented.

It's time to drop the other semantic shoe -- human-orientation.   Your list 
of problems is a great first step, and hopefully our work can at least 
serve as one example of how to address some of the problems.

                         Cheers,   -- Adrian
