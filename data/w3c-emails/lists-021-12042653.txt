I'm inclined to agree.

I prefer to think the web page itself says things, and the owner bears
*some* responsibility for the things said, but does not literally say
them.

So perhaps "http://www.ibm.com" says some product is priced at $50.  I
take that as a good indication that IBM Corp. will sell the product
for $50, and I might say to a human that IBM says the price is $50,
but if I were being very literal minded I'd rephrase it as "IBM's
website says the price is $50."  That distinction is of course
necessary in talking about the website being defaced.  "IBM's website
was defaced!  Now it says the product costs $0.01!".  I couldn't
express something like that if the registered owner was always taken
as saying what the website said.

And I don't think it's a weakness to have little formal tie back to
humans or owning corporations.  Most of what I imagine doing on the
web (semantic or not) involves reasoning about what pages say, not
about what the people behind the pages say.

While the RDF and OWL Recs don't require it, I think the best practice
is to take all the RDF content obtained by dereferencing a URI used in
RDF and treat it at a level of trust very close to the level of the
URI's user.  Very much like you take one website's linking to another
as a probable-endorsement.  There's still a judgement call involved
that I don't know how machine can help with yet.  (One idea I'm toying
with is that the endorsement is much stronger if the linking page has
been modified since the linked-to page was.)

This is kind an intermediate position between the position I once
advocated (that using a URI impies you believe the content) and what I
think may be Peter's position (that there's no connection).

Yep.  Note that web pages have expiration times.  Thing they state
are, I think, asserted for the time range starting at the Last
Modified date (or at the time the content was provided, if no LM date
is given) and ending at the Expiration date.  Expiration dates are
often set in relative terms ("cache-control: max-age=600"), so they
remain asserted until a little while after you change the document.
If the expiration date is in the past (which is alas very common),
then IMHO the data is not quite asserted, and one has to make a "no
data change means no world change" assumption -- that the data on a
slightly-old web page is *probably* still true.  This is another
judgement call humans make (often incorrectly) every day using the
normal web.
