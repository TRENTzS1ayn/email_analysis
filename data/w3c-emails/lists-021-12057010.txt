Likewise. 

In practice, the way I have been doing this is just to treat 
RDF/XML documents much the way I treat XHTML XML documents, or other
text files. They are things with properties such as creator, creation
date, checksum etc. And as textual documents, they can be digitally
signed, encrypted etc. with widely available tools such as PGP. 

When I write an RDF file that is important enough that I want others to
know that (a) I wrote it, (b) it hasn't been subsequently changed, I
just include markup in the document that mentions me as the author, and
points to the results of PGP signing it.

Coming up with a formal account of all this would be hard work, but the
basic approach of treating RDF documents as having common
characteristics with other document formats seems a plausible and
pragmatic way of making progress.

cheers,

Dan
