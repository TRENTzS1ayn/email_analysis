John,

Topic maps offer a way to add in the information you note as missing.

Note that in the following when I use the term "topic maps" I am not
making reference to a particular data model or syntax but the
underlying paradigm of topic maps.

In a nutshell, what topic maps allow is for any surrogate for a
subject to be defined as possessing certain properties, one of which is 
a subject identity property (SIP) that can be compared to the SIP
property of other surrogate for a subject to determine whether the two
surrogates represent the same subject.

Where that becomes important is where two different systems or
ontologies may have different ways of identifying surrogates about the
same subject. With topic maps, the topic map designer can create
surrogates that equate two seemingly different SIPs as in fact 
identifing surrogates for the same subject.

Obviously I am eliding over a lot of detail in the foregoing but the
gist is that not only can you have your own view of what identifies a
surrogate to be about a particular subject, but you can also have the
ability to say that your surrogate represents the same subject as
surrogates made using an entirely different approach. And more
importantly, you can disclose what underlies your choices so that
others can make the same decisions as to whether their surrogates are
about the same subjects.

Hope you are having a great day!

Patrick
