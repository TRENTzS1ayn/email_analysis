+1. And I would further add, that if you want to do this stuff in a 
SWeb-explicit way, all the tools are available for doing this.  By 
all means come up with a suggestion: there are several already, eg 
see

for one.

Well, except that the work has already been done :-)  See above.

Indeed. In fact it seems hard to see how to stop people doing this, 
even if one were inclined to want to stop them.
