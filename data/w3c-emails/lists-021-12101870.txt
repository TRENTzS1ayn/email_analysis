Instead of a fourth component of a tuple, this can be considered to 
belong to the subgraph-identification problem.  Once there is a 
standard, blessed, practical way to refer to a particular subgraph, any 
amount of meta data can be associated with it, and a specific statement 
would be a minimal subgraph.  Then any of the kinds of things mentioned 
in this thread could be associated with a particular subgraph.
