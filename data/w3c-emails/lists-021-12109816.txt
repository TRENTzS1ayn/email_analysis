I believe there is a good case for the need for a Semantic Web 
Pragmatics, in the sense that Kent Bach[1] uses the term, which is 
intended as a substitute for the term "Social Meaning". I suggest 
that members of this list produce some text that would make up a 
finding that there is a need for a new section or even a new document 
called RDF Pragmatics, or the like, and further propose that the 
ideas in Named Graphs, Provenance and Trust[2] be the beginning of it.
