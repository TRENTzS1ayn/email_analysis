CALL FOR PAPERS

Workshop on the Potential of Cognitive Semantics for Ontologies

Torino, Italy, November 3rd, 2004

Held in conjunction with FOIS 2004,
the International Conference on Formal Ontologies in Information Systems

b. Joseph Goguen, University of California at San Diego, Computer 
Science and Engineering, http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/users/goguen/


Workshop Theme

What do ontologies, as used in the semantic web and elsewhere, have to 
do with meaning? In particular, where do their predicates get their 
meanings? Semantics, no matter what formalisms are applied to it, is 
ultimately a cognitive phenomenon: it refers to the meaning that symbols 
have for human beings. It is determined by individual and cultural 
factors, involving a human mind aware of the conventions of a language 
community. Yet, the mental interpretation processes are not accessible 
and the conventions of information communities are rarely meaningful to 
agents in other communities. Ontology engineers therefore face the 
problem of capturing enough of the cognitive as well as the social 
contexts of information. However, information system ontologies 
typically consist of networks or hierarchies of concepts to which 
symbols can refer. Their axiomatizations are either self-referential or 
point to more abstract, rather than more meaningful symbols. So, how do 
the ontologies become meaningful?

Cognitive semantics, in its various flavors, is asking similar questions 
for natural languages and symbol systems in general. It studies, among 
other issues, what the embodied nature of language can tell us about how 
we construct meanings, or what its socially situated nature says about 
the constraints on language use. Cognitive scientists have developed 
innovative and powerful notions that are potentially useful for 
ontologies. Among them are:

 a. image schemas
 b. prototypes and radial categories
 c. basic level concepts
 d. primes and universals
 e. language games
 f. metaphors and metonymies
 g. idealized cognitive models
 h. mental spaces and conceptual blendings
 i.  conceptual spaces
 j.  frame semantics
 k. affordances
 l. conceptual similarity measures.

So far, there is only sparse work on information system ontologies that 
takes any of these notions seriously, and even less that formalizes and 
applies them fruitfully. This workshop will take stock of such 
approaches and establish a research agenda for ontology design inspired 
and informed by cognitive semantics. It will bring together researchers 
in information system or natural language semantics with a formal or 
cognitive background or both.

Position Papers

Anybody with an interest in the questions raised above is invited to 
submit a position paper. Participation at the workshop is open to all 
position paper authors who also register for the FOIS conference. 
Extended abstracts of 800 - 1500 words should be sent by Email to 
kuhn@uni-muenster.de on or before August 31, 2004. They will be made 
available on the workshop web site, unless their authors instruct us 
otherwise. Authors will be notified by September 15, 2004 whether their 
position papers have been selected for presentation during the workshop. 
Authors are invited to submit revised versions of their position papers 
to a post-workshop review process, leading to a book or journal special 
issue on research directions to make ontologies more meaningful.
