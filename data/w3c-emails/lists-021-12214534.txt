Could you be more specific? What sort of app has this requirement?

I don't think it introduces ambiguity in the semantics of the data.
The data says what it says. The ambiguity in who said it or didn't
say it or meant it or didn't mean it is just life.

What suggests that RDF should be different from plain text in this
respect?

If you GET some text that says

The world is flat.

You can sorta tell from common sense that it's not asserted...
unless it was written a _long_ time ago. But if you find

 Four out of five dentists recommend trident
for their patients who chew gum.

You don't really know if it's in jest or serious without poking around.

If you see an ADA logo at the bottom of the page, linked to an
ADA homepage, and you find zillions
of links to the ADA homepage (e.g. via google or some other
backlink service), and there's a path from the ADA
homepage to the 4-out-of-5 page, then that suggests strongly
that (a) the ADA is widely respected, and (b) they meant it.

Similarly, most RDF data that published in a way that the
author expects others to believe enough to act on has
dc:creator link or some such.

At the end of the day, whether to believe something or
not is a risk/reward game. We act on some data we find
if we expect we'll win by doing so.

I hope to see semantic web escrow services before too much
longer. If I *really* want you to believe me that I'm
going to the web conference in NY, I could say so in my travel
schedule and put $500 in escrow to be collected by anybody
who can prove (mathematically) that I'm not (or more likely:
that I didn't.). I think that could bootstrap a lot of stuff.

I don't think it can be specified away.

Er... you somehow want to get a widespread understanding that
some RDF is asserted, but you want to short-circuit the process
of getting widespread agreement. I don't see how to do that.
