RDF, as currently specified, says nothing about when a graph is 
asserted (by whom). There was some text in Concepts and Abstract Syntax 
that attempted to say something (very weak) about that. It was struck 
(and for, IMHO, good reason). Sneaking in something about it in the 
media type thing seems very bad to me.

(And will this affect, oh, DAWG? I.e., if I want to use an 
application/rdf+xml as a query "by example", I won't be able to because 
it's asserted? I.e., my query wants to be *is* this bit of RDF/XML 
asserted by you.)

Oh c'mon :) Or, let me rephrase: Your response seems extremely 
non-responsive to Dan's point.

Plus, this totally kills aggregation and lots of other useful uses of 
application/rdf+xml documents.
