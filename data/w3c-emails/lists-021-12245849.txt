Right.  I believe that's the problem.

??  I'm only interested, right now, in knowing whether the *publisher*
of that information asserts it.

Well, there used to be something in the media type draft about it too,
but it was also removed.

I can't make sense of that, but it looks interesting 8-)  Can you
elaborate please?

Not at all; you've just got to read into it a bit deeper. 8-)

I understand that the WG had decided to punt this issue to the task
force, and that's fine.  AFAICT though, the task force hasn't rendered
it's decision.  So, by coming here I don't consider myself short-cutting
the process, because this seems to *be* the process.

While I'm focused on presenting what I believe to be a decent solution
to this problem, I'm fully aware that I have to get buy-in from the
task force.  Again, no short-cutting.

That seems to be begging the question.  I respectfully suggest that
your concern would be best directed at "other useful uses of RDF/XML
documents", which I agree with.  But I don't see how my suggestion
interferes with that in general, nor specifically for aggregation.
