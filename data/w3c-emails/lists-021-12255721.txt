Thanks Sandro, yes I think that does make sense, but unfortunately it's
not a self-descriptive solution.  That is, I can't - in Dan's terms[1] -
"follow my nose" from an HTTP/RDF message to an understanding of whether
or not the graph inside that message is asserted.

I agree that the whole "trust" thing is closely related, but I also
think that it's orthogonal to assertedness.
