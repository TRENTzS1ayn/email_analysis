And the right answer should be, IMHO, "It depends". So I'm against a 
blanket mandate, especially in the media type.

Who counts as the publisher? The owner of the server?

A question generally isn't an assertion. If my question is basically an 
RDF/XML document (e.g., "is this graph true") then, on your scenario, 
if I am the publisher of my query, then it can't have normal query 
semantics.

Pfft. Then read into mine deeper.

I didn't understand that. The WG decided to punt, yes. To whom arose 
later :)

Ah, this group isn't quite what was envisioned by many after the Tech 
plenary session.

In any case, the intent was to study and suggest, not to mandate.

I understand now. Ok, it was responsive. What you didn't realize is 
that this group has been moribund for a while. Perhaps this will revive 
things.

No need for buy-in from the "task force" because the task force never 
had any even-inside-W3C authority. However, it's prolly the case that 
if you get me agreeing (being a main naysayer) you'll get some traction 
*somewhere* :)

Yes, sorry.

Fortunately things aren't as they seem.

So, there's the duel problem: How someone indicates that *they've* 
asserted such and such rdf. And how someone indicates that they've 
*not* asserted such and such RDF. Inside RDF, the quoting mechanisms 
are, in a world, lame. (Reification, but reification is lame. Or 
literals, but that  doesn't seem to be to most people's taste.)

But let me back up: I don't see how media type does the job you want. 
How does media type help acertain who's the publisher? Do we really 
want to force publishers to assert all the RDF they publish? (I think, 
not. This was discussed extensively, I believe, in my last call 
comments.)
