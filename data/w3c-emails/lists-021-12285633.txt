I haven't seen enough semweb apps to know what's run-of-the-mill.

I'd like to understand the problem better.

Most likely, it is. The publishers/authors who are in the business of
making stock predictions gain and lose trust of the consumers
of that info depending on how well their info pans out.

Even if you're just making a prediction in a livejournal entry
or something, your peers are likely to change their estimation
of your reliability depending on whether the info you give turns
out to be right. And if you want to say "suppose SUNW
went up to $200" rather than "I predict SUNW will go up to $200",
you should either represent that in RDF itself or, as sandro
pointed out, make it part of the link metadata:

  You need me, as I hand you a URI, to say "this is true"

I still don't understand enough about your application to know
why you need that.

Such is life. Why do you want to constrain RDF to be more
self-descriptive than any other representation of information?
It's nice when a web page has links to provenance info to
show why you should believe it, but nothing in the HTML
spec says you must do that.

dc:creator is a/the way people connect RDF graphs to people
that assert them (or... at least: wrote them). You could try
specializing dc:creator to baker:asserter and let us know how
that works in your app.

The foaf community, among others, uses rdfs:seeAlso to
say "if you believe this document, you're probably interested
in that document over there too" and such.

The OWL spec gives owl:imports as a mechanism to say
"that document is asserted just as much as this one is".

And so on.

Hmm... ok, I've seen you declare that. I haven't seen rationale
that convinces me it's a good idea. And so the process continues
until consensus (or at least a critical mass of agreement) emerges...
