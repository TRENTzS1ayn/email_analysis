Drawing from another message in this thread, I think you're assuming
some connection between a "publisher" of some RDF and the web; a
connection I don't think is solid enough to use.  Can you pick a real
bit of RDF as an example and show me who the publisher is, and how
your software would act different knowing it was "asserted" by that
publisher?
