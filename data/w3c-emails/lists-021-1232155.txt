Yes.

Please not another one. I think this problem was reported about
2 years ago. I neglected to follow up; somebody else did
(danbri?) but they took the conservative route and
created a new XSLT rather than fixing the one you cite above.

When I write code, it's owned by W3C. If you're pretty sure
it's broken, please do fix it; try to notify me by email/irc/whatever,
but failing that I'll get notice from CVS (don't neglect
those checkin comments!).  There's rarely any need to get my
permission in advance.
