I got some feedback about these comments to the effect that they were 
beyond the bounds of reasonably polite discourse (or, perhaps, 
acceptably impolite jocularity). I offer my apologies, as appropriate, 
to any like minded parties. I'm a bit jetlagged and overdistracted.

FWIW, the "go me" was a reference to the Very Secret Diaries of the 
LOTR characters, and, thus, was meant to be more self-deprecatingly 
amusing, than triumphantly gloating:

(They're a bit racy, and may be somewhat problematic in other ways (I 
don't *think* they're homophobic, but it's a bit hard to tell), so, 
you're on your own.)

Cheers,
Bijan Parsia.
