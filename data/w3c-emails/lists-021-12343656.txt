I think this question below describes the essence of the disconnect, so
I'll focus on it.

I don't, I just want it to be as self-descriptive as other machine
targetted formats.

Consider an iCalendar document returned via GET and labelled as
text/calendar.  I consider that an asserted document because that seems
the intent of RFC 2445, and even how people are using it.  That's why
I'd expect the equivalent RDF/iCal document, published as
application/rdf+xml, to also be asserted.  If we are to open up the door
to "unasserted RDF" then we're going to have to consider how we'd
publish an unasserted RDF/iCal document, how that would be different
semantically to a text/calendar document, and how that difference would
reveal itself in the messages.
