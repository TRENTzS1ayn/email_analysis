Could you point to which section expresses that seeming? I'm not 
finding it.

Does this mean that one shouldn't publish sample calenders using 
text/calendar? (Or proposed, say, conference schedules?)

Perhaps these are outliers, but it might make a big difference.

Well, if I were writing a tutorial on iCal, I'd prolly publish the 
examples on the web with type text/calendar.

Have I violated RDF 2445? Could you point to the language that shows 
this?

(I'm being perfectly serious about this. Just because people *normally* 
mean to assert, e.g., their calendar by putting it on the web, and 
other people normally (and correctly) take them as asserting it, 
doesn't mean that the format mandated that assertion. And might not do 
so for very good reasons!)

I don't believe it does. I think it's application specific.
