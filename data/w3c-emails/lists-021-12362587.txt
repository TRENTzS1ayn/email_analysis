No, you haven't violated it.

You have a point.

I'm wondering if I had the wrong idea about what folks meant by
"assert".  I was assuming that in order to have the equivalent of a
text/calendar document, you'd need the graph plus a statement that the
graph was asserted.  But what I hear you and Dan saying is that the
equivalent is just the graph, and that assertion is something richer.  I
can buy that, and it makes me happy because it means that all
application/rdf+xml documents are mark:asserted.

This would mean that reification, parseType="literal", and using
text/plain or application/xml, are all mechanisms that avoid making
mark:assertions simply by not yielding triples from some RDF/XML.
Right?

So, is what is meant here by "unassert" intended to obliterate a
mark:asserted triple so that the result is, in effect, that the triple
was never extracted?  If so, I might have some more self-description
issues. 8-)

BTW, does it seem that mark:assertion is roughly equivalent to what some
would call a "speech act" (assuming there's a consistent definition for
it)?

P.S. no apology required regarding the earlier message.  I apparently
took it in the intended manner.

Mark.
