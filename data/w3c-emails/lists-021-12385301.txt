Just a data point: It doesn't for me.

Yes. That's my point. I want to use that media type. I don't want to 
tie propositional attitude to the format. I see no advantage to it. I 
see a lot of existing contrary use (i.e., I'll have to *take down* 
currently published RDF/XML). It's easy to screw up with high potential 
cost.

My counterpoint would be is that if you're going to make this sort of 
move, you need to jump right to something rather richer than what 
you've thus far offered (i.e., I need to have some sort of non-asserted 
publishing). Now, you have offered a possible future way of handling 
this (some other media type), but 1) we need something like this *now*, 
if we're going to break application/rdf+xml for people and 2) we 
shouldn't break application/rdf+xml for people, or, at least, me.

First, they do so want.

Second, I don't understand why we should do this with media types. I 
feel somewhat dense, but media types just seem so wrong for this task. 
I.e., I would *never* look at the media type document for this. Maybe 
I'm just dense, but it's really not obvious to me.
