Sorry, the intent of that sentence wasn't to question the "badness"
(which I agree with), but instead just to ask the reason behind why
it's bad.

Sure.

FWIW, my mental model which drives this belief is of two agents on
either side of an HTTP connection that want to communicate.  As an HTTP
message is the only means they have for communication, it's important
that the meaning of the communication, as determined by the sender, be
pickled up into a message such that when it's received by the other
agent, it can be unpickled and that original meaning reconstructed in
its entirety.
