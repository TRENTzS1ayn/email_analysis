Right ...

Yes, exactly.  That's what I mean by "communicate the graph".  If I
use text/plain, I'm not communicating the graph, because the message
doesn't include any information would inform a recipient that the
message semantics depend on the RDF specs.

In both cases (application/rdf+xml and text/plain) there is no
requirement that the recipient extract the graph, as that would be a
requirement on processing.

Yup.
