This is a total non-starter, IMHO. It doesn't work either way: I don't 
necessarily "communicate the graph" by using application/rdf+xml (think 
about a tutorial on the hidiousity of RDF/XML), nor do I necessarily 
*fail* to "communicate the graph" by not using it.

Note that by your model, there's no way to "communicate" an owl 
ontology (since we don't have an owl mimetype).

I don't want to put a yicky requirement on senders either :)

Hence you can't infer things *either way*. I.e., you can't assume that 
the sender *didn't* want her text/plain to communicate the graph.

Mimetypes don't tell use a lot about content, actually. Imagine a gif 
of an rdf graph. That might well communicate the graph! Why not? (e.g., 
I have an ocr program)
