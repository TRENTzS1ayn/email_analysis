I'm quite certain that you do, in both cases.

But is an OWL ontology any more than an RDF graph?  AFAIK, it isn't.
So you don't need a new media type.  I fully agree with DanC's
assessment here;

I don't see how that follows.  Perhaps I misunderstood Thomas.

I understood "possibilities" to mean possibilities for processing.
If he meant possibilities for interpretation of semantics, then I
disagree.  Ambiguity in message semantics is really bad thing.

If we're just talking about automata here, then no, the graph is not
communicated, because the recipient can't "follow your nose" from any
information in the message to any specification which says the graph is
being communicated.  You either need a new media type (image/rdf+gif?)
or out-of-band agreement between the parties for that to happen.  But
for an Internet scale system like the Web, I consider the latter a
non-starter.
