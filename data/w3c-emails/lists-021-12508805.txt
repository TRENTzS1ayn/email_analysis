Well, you are at least wrong about me. And I'd love to see spec text 
that even *suggests* that.

Yes. Radically different semantics.

Don't see how that helps with OWL. Quite the contrary.

How can you separate the two?

Eh.

I wasn't aware that automata had noses to follow.

Nose following, in any case, isn't the only way.

Yep.

So we disagree.

There's also an Always/Usually issue. I think that Usually is fine, but 
once you say Always then you've made your system way way way too rigid. 
It's very hard to capture all the different implicit and explicit 
agreements and understandings people come up with (sanely) and encode 
in their programs. Hamfisting it just makes people either ignore your 
restrictions or not use your system.
