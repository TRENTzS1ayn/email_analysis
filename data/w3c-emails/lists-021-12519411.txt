An OWL ontology is much, much more than an RDF graph, unless you believe in
the strongest of the various one-meaning proposals that have been bandied
about.

For example, if I ask you whether the RDF graph

ex:foo owl:sameAs ex:bar .

entails

ex:foo rdfs:subClassOf ex:bar .

you *should* say no, because I have only licensed you to treat this graph
as an RDF graph, not an OWL ontology.


I would thus (if I cared) agitate for a separate media type for OWL.
