Sorry, I don't follow.  Dan concludes there that OWL doesn't need it's
own media, and he does based on reasoning identical to my own (AFAICT).

Anyhow, I should add that I don't know OWL; my agreement with Dan was
purely a result of my agreement with the mechanism he used to come to
his conclusion.  More in the response to Peter ...

Here's an example ...

A message sender might send some XHTML as application/xhtml+xml to a
service, and that service could, say, print the number of lines in the
file to a printer.  So even though the intended semantics of the sender
was "Here's some content to interpret per the XHTML 1.0 spec", the
recipient is free to treat it as plain text in order to count the
lines.

I agree with your general point, though I'd opt for something a lot
stronger than "usually" in this case since the value of the
architectural properties obtained by adopting such a constraint is so
great.  But if you believe that what we've been discussing is one of
those cases where out of band agreement is valuable, I couldn't
disagree more.
