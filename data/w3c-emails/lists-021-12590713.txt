wrt to tests 4 and 5: Can you reference a spec(s) that 1) require the
retrieved representation to be processed using the associated stylesheet, 2)
that attribute a media-type to the result of such a transformation and 3)
require that the result of the transformation be displayed in place of the
original representation. I have so far failed to find any (including
http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-stylesheet/).

AFAICT the result of the transformations have no associated media-type (or
other representation metadata for that matter). I'd suggest that the
identity transform used is not quite an identity transform wrt to the
representation as a whole.

Ta,

Stuart
