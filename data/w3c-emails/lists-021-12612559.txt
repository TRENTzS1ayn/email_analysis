Yes indeed... there appeared to be an implicit expectation of what
processing should take place (which afaict is one of the topics on this
thread).

wrt a) whatever receives those results is processing them in an application
specific manner. It may not be 'inventing' media-type - I mean... how could
you tell? It's an internal matter for the recipient of the original
representation inc. media-type.

wrt b) how can you tell that any namespace dispatch is occuring... results
for test 4 rather suggest that the root namespace of the result is ignored.
