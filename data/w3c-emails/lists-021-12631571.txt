I don't think that *any* of these are appropriate.  What is being
communicated should be information, not syntax.  (Sometimes the information
is carried by the particular syntax, but, again, it is the information, not
the syntax that is being communicated.)

I do agree that attaching different meanings to the syntax should require
some sort of difference in the communication, be it either a different
media type or some information carried in the headers, or even a magic
number at the beginning of the contents (as in Unix).

Why should there not be many different kinds of meaning associated with
communications?  There are lots of different kinds of meaning associated
with human communications, for example.  (Think chat (English) vs chat
(French).)

Well, what is wrong with this?  Well maybe it is an indictment of using
media types instead of some other mechanism, but why otherwise?
