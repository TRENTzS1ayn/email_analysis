Yes, that's what I mean when I say "communicate a graph".  Sorry if
that's inconsistent with your vocabulary.

Great.  I think I've made my position clear that I think the media
type is (currently) the right place for this information.  But I'm
flexible.

Deploying new media types is currently expensive; if you have the option
between communicating some information using application/rdf+xml,
instead of with application/prs.pps.foobar+rdf+xml, you should, in
general, opt for the former (unless you know the recipient can handle
it, of course, but obtaining that information doesn't scale).

I can forsee the day when we have dereferenceable media types so that an
agent can, upon seeing an unrecognized one, dereference it to learn that
it's just a specialization of some type it already knows (e.g. in terms
of application/rdf+xml) with its own axiomatic triples.  But until
that's common practice, I think it's best to avoid minting new ones.
