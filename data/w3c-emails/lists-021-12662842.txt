Well, sure, if you have the option.  However, what if you don't?  

The example that I used before

 ex:foo owl:sameAs ex:bar .

has a different meaning when treated as an OWL ontology than when treated
as an RDF ontology.   Sending it as application/rdf+xml means, to me, that
you are sending as a triple with no special meaning attached to owl:sameAs,
whereas if it is sent as OWL (by whatever means you like) then the triple
means that ex:foo and ex:bar have the same denotation.

Actually I would much prefer to send it (or a close variation of it) as
the OWL ontology

Ontology(
Class(ex:foo complete ex:bar)
)

which, to me, is much preferable in every way.

Well, that assumes that you have some powerful logic backing up the
communication, which is certainly not the case with RDF.   Even if you do,
I would not advocate this approach, instead retaining an approach where the
formalism in which the communication is to be interpreted is sent by
reference and is not specified as a theory in this powerful logic.
