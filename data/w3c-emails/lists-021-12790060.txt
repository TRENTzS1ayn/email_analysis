Dan Brickley made what I think is an excellent response to this question,
but I'll provide a response as well.

Under a scheme where the owner of a URI reference (ruler of a state) has
absolute control over the meaning of the URI reference, it is the case that
if one wants to communicate using a particular URI reference (live in a
particular state) then one must completely subjugate one's own view of the
meaning of the URI reference (one's own thoughts) to that of the owner of
the URI reference (ruler of the state).  One can, indeed, not use a
particular URI reference (leave the state) but then one really cannot
communicate with other users of that URI reference (inhabitants of the
state).  So, yes, opposing expression (including all forms of expression,
not just political and cultural express) is indeed suppressed, and this
does lead to a very large degree of control.

I would even go further in the analogy.  One often wants to use URI
references from multiple owners, so one would be subject to multiple
controls on one's expression.  These controls could (and, I think, would
often) become mutually incompatable, leading to collapses of communication.

Nothing whatsoever.  So what?  If I *choose* to be contrary in this way
then no one will talk to me, because I will be using my own private
language.  This really only hurts myself.

Because without any common terms, there is absolutely no possibility of
communication.

Because to communicate, you have to share terms.  These terms become a
shared communication resource that should not be totally subject to the
arbitrary whims of the ``owner'' of the term.  

Consider a different analogy, related to the English language.  Suppose
that the meanings of English words that start with each particular Latin
letter are mandated to be those that are found in some particular on-line
dictionary.  I maintain that the owners of each of these dictionaries would
then have incredible power.  Sure, I could remove myself from the control
of a particular dictionary owner by refraining from using words whose
definition depends on that dictionary, but I would then, in essence have to
invent an entirely new language (and one using non-Latin characters).  But
then who would I be able to talk to?

Sure, but how will I be able to communicate that my URI reference has the
same referent as the customary one?  Remember, if I use the customary URI
reference, I have to then abide by all the meaning ascribed to it by its
owner.

This has no bearing on the issue under discussion.

Yes, sure, but, as above, I then loose the ability to communicate.

> This hardly seems a prescription for totalitarianism.  

Well, yes, I will give you that totalitarianism only comes out if you want
to communicate with others.  Perhaps the paper should have included that as
a premise.  :-)
