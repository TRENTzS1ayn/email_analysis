Right, I had your emails in the back of my mind while working on 
sections of the paper :-)

But the performative story only gives you a kind of act, not a 
stipulation about other's acts or interpretations. So let me try to 
rephrase this a little: suppose we say that the intuitive force of 
such a stipulative definition is to declare that *your intention* is 
that the terms shall have the meaning you give to them, and that any 
usage (such as Bijan and Peter's, in the example) which clashes or is 
incompatible with your meanings is not intended by you. This of 
course does not *prevent* P & B from misusing your terminology (how 
could it?) , or force anyone else to believe you rather than them (so 
all this foolish analogizing with tyranny, oppression and freedom is 
beside the point): but it does give any third party a clear, 
unambiguous, machine-readable and traceable-to-you indication that 
would enable them to follow your indicated intentions if they wish to 
do so, without your stipulative definitions being muddled by 
information received from elsewhere without your authority.

Consider the following strategy: you owl:import the UBL ontology into 
yours, and then assert your ontology using an appropriate warrant. 
The result would be in effect asserting the conjunction of the UBL 
'definitions' and your ontology together as a single unit: anything 
that contradicted the definitions would be in effect contradicting 
your assertion. Would that do the trick?

Well, Im not sure what that would mean exactly, but I think this is 
more or less the de facto situation we have now, where publishing is 
kind of generally assumed to be asserting. As many folk have pointed 
out, thought, this is likely to not be workable when things get 
larger, which is why we tried to come up with a way to rationalize 
this.

Ah, I may see what you mean. The fact that a URI is seen as an 
identifier which can be used to retrieve something, rather than 
simply a referring name, may be related to the performative idea (??) 
I hadnt thought about that before. Hmmmm....
