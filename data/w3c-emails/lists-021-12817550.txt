Yes. According to the way you interpreted my example this would work.
However, I intended my example to include one additional complication, 
which I didn't spell out properly.  Namely, suppose I wanted to owl:import 
both ontologies, because both had useful descriptions for terms that I 
wanted to use.  But there was this conflict over just that one term, 
'invoice'.  It creates a logical inconsistency, which I am saying is 
analogous to an ambiguity.  I still want to owl:import both ontologies, 
but I want to stipulate that one or the other meaning of 'invoice' is 
my intent and I want that to remove the logical inconsistency.

As for the "...SHALL be interpreted..." clause, true, it is not 
necessary, and for a first example, distracting.
But in very serious cases, I may want to include in my 
performative the promise to submit any dispute to an adjudication 
agent, lets say.  In that case, it is to this adjudicator that the 
"...shall be interpreted..." is directed. If there was a contract 
based on those terms, the adjudicator would be required to interpret 
those terms of the clauses of the contract according to the stipulated 
definitions provided for those terms.

Of course then I want to abstract out just the two acts of:
1) stipulating a description for a term; and 
2) compliantly interpreting a term according to a stipulated 
definition.
