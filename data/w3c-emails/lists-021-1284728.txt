Short answer to the question in the subject is no.  I'm not using XHTML
Modularization Framework to define RDF-in-XHTML schema, so there's no
point to try to conform to that spec.

There's no defined conformance level for "not-so-strictly" conforming
XHTML document, except that it must be well-formed.

Unless there is a normative schema for RDF/XML, we are not going to
define a new XHTML host language document type.
