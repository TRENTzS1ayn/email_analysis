I do. At least, I have elicited such view from Tim (and distinct 
views...his line is much softer on this for quite a while), and from 
other people.

Sigh. I meant Python Sets, which are mutable :)

Strange how it hasn't always been to some people in some conversations.

Yes. Or, at least it's possible that it will have to be said again.

I was just starting from the obvious case. Trying to start from a point 
I felt confident we all agree on.

Yes.

Sure. Though, I don't want to be told that my misuse is a matter of 
Web/RDF/OWL architecture or standards. I want to be able to do the 
analogue of deep linking. I want to use your URIs and make a slew of 
assertions involving them. If you've, from my perspective, published 
crap about the URI at some relevant web location, I don't want to have 
any technical pressure at all for including it. I don't want to have to 
keep delving into nasty preference files, etc. etc. I think this 
inhibits reuse, personally.

In his document. Neither Peter nor I have ever argued against anything 
like this. We've argued for it. But we want it to be the case for all 
document authors. I say what I say. If you want to combine what I say 
with what the "word (uri) owner" says, that's *your* lookout.

I think this is insupportable. I really do. Especially in the absence 
of the normal overrides for that authority.

Not in every case, but in many cases, especially casual reuse. Dan's 
example is compelling.

Right. I don't want to preclude them with hamfisted legislating. I'm 
the quietist on all this, after all. Though I don't object to the kind 
of moves you make in your paper, in principle.

No, but there are differences that make a difference. Clearly both 
Peter and I are find with normative specification and are totally 
inclined to be rather insistent about what you say an OWL document 
means. I find it to be a recurring irritation, going all the way back 
to the Boston tech plenary, that I am the object of such imputation. 
There *are* people who argue against standardized vocabulary in 
general, quite strongly. I'm not one of them, clearly.

We're worried about the nature of the conventions proposed. Some irk us 
and we think will irk others. They will be oppressive at least in the 
sense that some people (e.g., many Lispers) find programming in C++ 
oppressive. There is room, however, for worse on the semantic web.

It's not unreasonable to be concerned with various senses of security 
in a social system of communication, in *any* one.  There are special 
issues in a system involving significant automated processing in the 
midst of that communication.

We're trying to avoid a situation where we feel compelled to act that 
way.

We argue for choice. I don't believe we do argue for semantic paranoia. 
If you want to import everything under the sun, go ahead. It seems to 
be a sane and familiar way to operate. Or if you are writing processing 
software, aggregated a bunch of claims into a kb and work on that.

If OWl, for example, required some form of ontological closure beyond 
the explicit on of owl:imports, then OWL compliant software will 
process my documents a certain way. I can, of course, avoid such OWL 
compliant software and perhaps require people not to process my 
document with OWL compliant software (at least, if they want me to 
accept the results). This seems worse than doing things the other way 
around, frankly.

Well, I was tempted to make a plea for charity several times earlier, 
but resisted. But frankly, this is beyond my willingness to bear at the 
moment. I'm totally surprised you would think that I need this advice.
