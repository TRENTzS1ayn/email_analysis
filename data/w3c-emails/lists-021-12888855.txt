Ive never heard Tim say this (and in some cases he was arguing with 
you at the time.) What he did say was that the correct meaning of the 
URIs was to be specified by the owner of the URI (and accessible 
somehow from the URI itself). That is not the same as talking about 
importing. And I also think that the intention of stating even this 
much as part of a spec was not to IMPOSE meaning so much as to 
provide a system-endorsed way to DETERMINE INTENDED meanings in the 
case where a reader finds a URI used without further explanation. 
And even there, after taking part in some of the TAG debates 
concerning the architecture document, I think that what might be 
called 'rules of good practice' can be part of a spec and still 
intended to be understood in much less authoritarian a way than could 
possibly justify all this use of rhetoric like tyranny and oppression.

Oh, well then in that case you can't add to my set. You can copy it

I think it always has, in fact. I have never heard anyone deny any of

I think its not unreasonable for such standards to provide John with 
a way to establish that your use is misuse, by his standards. In this 
case the dispute about meaning is between you and John, and all the 
standards do is to allow you two to express your intentions more 
precisely.

Nobody can stop you doing that, for sure.

There is none.  Nobody is talking about inclusion. But there might be 
a way for someone else to make their difference of opinion with you 
evident to anyone who uses the URI to access the owner's ontology. 
That is, ownership of a URI should be able to count for something. 
The world will have to decide this for itself, but I'd predict that 
normal social pressure would follow this general rule, if we provide 
for some way to assert things clearly and unequivocally.

>I don't want to have to keep delving into nasty preference files, etc. etc.

I have no idea what you are talking about. What proposal has this implication?

>I think this inhibits reuse, personally.

I think there is a likely use case where a publisher publishes what 
is little more than a list of URIs, with the intention to do little 
more than encourage re-use and let their final meaning, if this term 
even has a meaning itself, be determined by their wider use. For 
this, I think we all agree that the conventions that are announced 
about importance or otherwise of author's intentions will be 
irrelevant. So this can always be done. But to assume that this must 
be the norm is like assuming that the entire Web consists of blogs.

Right.

That is too simple, for several reasons. First, many URI owners might 
deliberately not constrain their intended meaning very strictly, in 
order to facilitate re-use (I would put the DC stuff in this 
category, for example.) Second, there will be cases where a document 
is not intended to be a positive assertion, and/or where the owner 
might want to explicitly not endorse the content. Third, we may need 
to negotiate things like claims and counterclaims. We have to allow 
for more nuanced expressions of intent of a publisher to the content 
published.

Its not a question of support. Its a question of what will in fact 
turn out to be the normal case, in practice. I was making a 
prediction, not proposing a specification.

Interesting: I don't get that impression. Perhaps we are not

Maybe it would help if you articulated them. To me, what you say on 
this theme reads pretty much like a direct transcription of this kind 
of rhetoric from the HTTP protocol to the OWL protocol, and it makes 
no more sense in either one. We are in both cases talking about 
software, right? What is this talk of tyranny and freedom supposed to 
mean when applied to software?

Im afraid I do not follow what you are saying here, what it is that 
you think I am imputing to you. Did I say anything about standardized 
vocabularies?

Both, I hope. But seriously, it seems to me to be no more ludicrous 
to use this kind of rhetoric here than in the Sweb case where you and 
Peter use it.

?? I don't follow you. Are you saying that some set of conventions

True; but it is, I seriously suggest, a mistake to assume that issues 
of security and protection from misuse are the PRIMARY concern of a 
set of conventions intended to facilitate communication. First lets 
figure out how to transfer and communicate meanings, then worry about 
security later. If you can't even talk, worrying about lying is 
premature.

Frankly, I would be inclined to suggest that if you really do feel so 
compelled, then  by all means don't use the semantic web; just as if 
you are more worried about catching a cold than anything else, don't 
go out and talk to people. The rest of us will probably get along 
fine most of the time.

Choice for the reader, yes: but that does not need to be argued, 
seems to me, since readers have freedom, by the very nature of Web 
architecture. But you reject choice for the writer and owner to 
express their clear intentions, which seems to me a more corrosive 
kind of rejection. If all SWeb ontologies just kind of appeared, like 
fruit on a tree, and all we had to worry about was using them 
appropriately, then your position would make sense: but if we think 
of the Sweb as embodying a kind of communication, then the issue of 
how a reader can discover the intentions of the writer 
(owner/publisher/whatever) becomes more central.

Thanks, I will. But then I guess I fail to understand what your point 
is in this debate.

Can you document ANY claim by ANYONE that this should be *required* 
by any form of compliance? To say that meaning is partly defined by 
something is not to say that any reader is obliged to assent to the 
meaning or to do anything about it, still less that any piece of 
software is obliged to do anything about it. The OWL specs don't 
require that software perform any inferences at all: a conforming 
engine can just read OWL files and ignore them.

Well, sorry if it came across too strongly. It was based on what I

Tim's position.
