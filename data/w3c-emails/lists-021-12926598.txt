Nice example. Here's another, drawn from Wordnet. Wordnet is a lexical
database whose noun hierarchy (aka hypernyms, modelled on "a ___ is a kind of 
___" template) can just about be used as basis for an RDF/OWL class 
hierarchy.

There are some hierarchical relations in Wordnet which may well reflect 
attitudes that are evident in English usage, but which --- if we turn it 
into an Ontology --- would get "taken literally" by RDF tools.

Apologies for the text formatting, this is just what the Wordnet 
commandline tool emits. 

You can also some some other interesting bits of the hierarchy by
searching on terms like 'nigger', 'queer' etc. The 'nympho' example 
is perhaps more interesting because the more offensive terms are higher 
up the tree, and so could be inferred by class reasoning from the 
leaf term.

Incidentally, this illustrates some issues with moving too rapidly from
a lexical database into an ontology. The former is 'words people use',
the latter 'the way the world is'. We would do well to always emphasise 
that ontologies capture a worldview and that those worldviews may be 
highly contested.
