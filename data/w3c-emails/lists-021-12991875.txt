I figured a brief summary of the thread might be helpful.

This thread has not generated as much energy or enthusiasm as others.

Bwm proposed essentially that the ADTF might provide a home for
illustrations of best practice from other task forces.

Aditya and Marco both say they would like (prefer?) to see something
pragmatic illustrating the value of the semantic web.
