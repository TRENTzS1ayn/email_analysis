I don't see this as a design requirement, but more of a deployment
motivation.

If there's a service that rewards folks for composing documents
the right way, then folks will (more likely)
compose their documents the right way.

If there's a service that shows that RDF consumers should learn
from these documents, then RDF consuming software will (more
likely) be enhanced to support this syntax.

Also, if the design is too complex to deploy in our RDF validator,
then that says something.


Hmm... in a way, it does provide a design constraint: it answers
all the questions about whether RDF inside <blockquote> is
to be taken literally or not; i.e. it makes sure the solution
addresses the TAG issue
