I'd just like to reiteratate how useful this is. I use Dan Brickley's
version of wordnet for image annotations, and it just pulls down the
class you ask for and its subclasses as you say:

http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/City

I use a very lightweight annotation tool, so any more information than
this would not be useful. No suggestions on 'views files' creators
though (perhaps this is a usecase for the Data Access Working Group?)
