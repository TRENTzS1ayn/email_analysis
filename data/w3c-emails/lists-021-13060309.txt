I think that this rather proves Ian's point - I'm using Sean's species
validator behind the scenes (and a few simple and no doubt defeasible
heuristics), and it reports it as OWL Full. Maybe the question should
instead have been "what is the best practice for *indicating* which
semantic-web language and encoding is being used"?
