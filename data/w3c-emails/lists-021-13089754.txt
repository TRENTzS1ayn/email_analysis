Exactly. We should focus on the low-hanging fruit that is useful for 
semweb developers. That's why the charter talks about part-of and 
defaults, as those are among the prime expressivity requirements of our 
customers and at the same time are not handled in obvious ways by our 
languages. Certainly in part-of theory there should be enough to point 
people to typical solutions and pitfalls.
