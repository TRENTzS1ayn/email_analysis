I've produced a short note on porting issues for the various WordNet 
constructs:

   http://www.cs.vu.nl/~guus/public/wn.txt

The note takes into account two existing ports (should be extended). The 
aim is to be complete wrt the current WordNet distribution (could be 
subject of discussion). It does not consider extensions.

I hope it is useful input to reaching consensus on porting WordNet to 
RDF/OWL format, hopefully also with the original developers in the loop.
