Hello,

My name is Fabien Gandon and I am working in the ACACIA lab of INRIA 
(France). After attending the plenary session in Cannes I initiated the 
administrative process to join the SWBP(D) working group and get the 
opportunity to contribute some of the experience of my Lab.

ACACIA is a 12-year old lab with a background in Knowledge Engineering 
using Conceptual Graphs for applications in Corporate Memory Management. 
Ontology-based knowledge modeling has been at the heart of our work for 
some time now as well as other aspects of working with formalized 
knowledge (graph-based algorithms, multiple points of view, ontology 
learning, distributed knowledge base management, interfaces and 
ergonomics, etc.). Back in 1999 we started bridging the world of 
conceptual graphs and RDF/S by building a platform which handles RDF 
Graphs by translating them into Conceptual Graphs. The result is called 
CORESE, a light-weight semantic web search engine based on the 
projection operator defined in Conceptual Graphs.

Through a number of projects and the process of industrialization of our 
prototype we experienced some of the assets and drawbacks, interests and 
pitfalls of the semantic web frameworks. Since the main raison d'??tre of 
the SWBP WG is to "provide hands-on support for developers of Semantic 
Web applications" we decided this was a WG we could contribute to.
My personal background (though quite short compared to manyu of you) is 
in ontology engineering, multi-agent architecture for semantic 
intrawebs, context-awareness and privacy enforcement in mobile accesses 
to web services.

To make it short I am more of a practitioner than a theorist and I am 
interested in the following the tasks forces: "world-view", "demos and 
tools", "ontology engineering".
I would like involved in making public and discussing: tested design 
rationales and their documentation; repositories of demos, tools, online 
interactive tutorials, etc.; open FAQs and WIKIs, presenting and 
discussing typical examples, known alternative options to recurrent 
problems, pitfalls, tradeoffs, work around, etc.

I looking forward to working with you,

Fabien.
