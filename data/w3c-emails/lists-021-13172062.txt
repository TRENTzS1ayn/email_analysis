I have begun fleshing out the template for a thesaurus task 
force. The URI is http://www.w3.org/2004/03/thes-tf/mission
although it looks someone close to the original template.

I've drafted some objectives, short-term and long-term (the 
latter in terms of document outputs).

If you send comments, please cite version number.

I don't have a list of members yet. Who would like to 
participate in this TF?

Dan
