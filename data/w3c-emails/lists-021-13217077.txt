Dear all,

I just joined the group two days ago and am unsure whether
additional topics for TFs can still be considered.  

As head of the DCMI Usage Board, I am most interested
in plain-vanilla issues around managing and using small
vocabularies:

1) Policies for URIs as term identifiers: DCMI has a formal
   "namespace policy" [1] and participated in "first-step"
   agreement with maintainers of other key standards regarding
   such policies [2].  Some issues include: expectations from
   namespace policies generally (clarification of persistence,
   institutional commitment, etc); versioning of terms; version
   numbers in URI strings; granularity of entities identified;
   "# versus /"; and the like.  Would BPD want to formulate
   guidelines in this area?

2) Versioning terms and term sets: DCMI has a de-facto method
   for versioning terms, though it is not yet formally
   supported by DCMI policy.  (It is an event-based model which
   uses URIs to link changes in Term Versions to Decisions,
   which in turn are linked to supporting documentation.)
   Is the model good; what other methods are there; and could
   we provide guidance?

3) Assertion etiquette and "good neighbor" policies: DCMI is
   working with Library of Congress on developing an RDF
   schema in which LC asserts a set of MARC Relator terms
   to be subPropertyOf dc:contributor.  DCMI wants to then
   endorse these assertions.  Would BPD WG want to formulate or
   endorse good-practice guidelines for making such assertions?

4) Vocabulary documentation (see also Dan [3]): DCMI looks
   to the SW community for guidance on what to publish at
   its namespace URIs (it currently publishes RDF schemas).
   In terms of work flow, DCMI generates the RDF schemas along
   with ready-reference Web pages from a common source using
   XSLT scripts, though surely more sophisticated editing
   and validation environments are available.

5) Declaring versus reusing (see also Libby [4]): "Should I
   use an existing term, get DCMI to declare one, or declare
   my own?  How can I coin a URI?  Where would I put it?"
