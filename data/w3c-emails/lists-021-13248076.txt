At breakfast this morning, I used a chain saw to take the top off my boiled
egg, as it was the most powerful tool I had available.  Shame I didn't have
one of those loud pneumatic road digger thingies :)

Seriously, though, the point I want to make is that there is a notion of
appropriateness of a tool to a task.  It may be that there are no tasks for
which RDFS is more appropriate that Owl, but perhaps that is something to
examine rather than assume.
