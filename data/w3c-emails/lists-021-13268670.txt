Hi, WG,

One question that came up for me today, and which strikes me as an
important consideration in best practices, is how ontologies and semantic
web datasets are distributed among OWL Lite, DL, and Full. In the
particular case that I am considering, I am converting from a non-owl
vocabulary/ontology into OWL. A change in the semantics of the original
ontology could be justified by the fact that, say, an OWL Lite ontology
will let more users stay in their original species space than if the
ontology were in OWL Full.

Is there any data regarding what percentage of known ontologies are in
Lite vs DL vs Full?

Thanks,
Jen
