Er... hang on; you asked me what my requirement is. I told
you. You can decline to accept my requirement, but you
can't deny that I require it.

I don't expect the TAG to close its issue until there's a design
that makes it clear whether RDF inside <blockquote> is
to be taken at face value or not. If they do, it'll be over
my objection.
