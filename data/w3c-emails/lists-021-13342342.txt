actually, I think this is the right track -- to present it as one 
langauge overall - I'm not sure calling that langauge "OWL" is really 
right -- seems to me RDF is the right name -- that is RDF used in the 
"generic" sense the way "XML" is used to refer to XML, Xquery, XML 
Schema, ...  - we will need to be clear when we mean RDF per se and 
when we mean the specific subsets -- but, for example, a document 
which contains the statement

ex:foo  a ex:bar.

is clearly an RDF document, but depending on what is in the "ex" 
namespace, this could use vocabulary from the RDF Schema and/or OWL 
vocabularies.

similary

ex:foo rdfs:subClassOf sx:bar.

is an RDF document, an RDFS document and an OWL (Full) document, even 
though it doesn't appear to use OWL vocabulary

so I think a goal of the WORLD document (second document, aimed at 
Sem Web interested folks) will be to make clear the relations and to 
point out when there are semantic differences   The semantic 
differences outside OWL DL and Lite are not that great, so this makes 
a good way to discuss what the two profiles of OWL are and what they 
contribute (I'll even hope someone who likes them write this section 
:->)
