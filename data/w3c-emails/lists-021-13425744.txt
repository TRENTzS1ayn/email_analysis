I'm claiming that pragmatically we'd better learn to deal with it --- 
consider, if I publish a document that says:

I am male.
I am female.
Male and female are disjoint classes.
You owe me a thousand dollars

and your reasoner sends me the money, then I don't think you'll be in 
business very long.   More seriously, the problem is that the 
inconsistency can (and I argue will) arise from many sources -- 
accidental (you type 5 and I type 55 when we mean to say the same 
number), conflicting views (see if you can get right to lifers and 
abortion proponents to agree on what "birth" is), and from 
maliciousness - as in the case above, if I can fool your reasoner 
into making wrong conclusions, I have a whole new kind of net attack 
to explore.  There's many ways to deal with these kinds of 
inconsistencies, but note that the key is that we will have to deal 
with them somehow...

ok, I'll grant you that within a single ontology DOCUMENT (I won't 
get into a fight now about how you define what an ontology is when 
they are linked to others and include some imports) it probably makes 
sense to define things in a straightforward way and to document 
disparity from that ...

Now you finally get to the crux, although backwards in a way -- Web 
Semantic is a RESEARCH journal -- but read the W3C process documents 
and our charter and you'll see that WGs do NOT so research -- this 
was always a challenge in the OWL WG, and will be one for this WG as 
well

I can name that tune in one line:
  It is the use of RDF as the basis for the language, allowing linking 
between separately created ontologies.

In fact, I don't even have to make this up -- here's what it says in 
the OWL FAQ [1]:

Q. How is OWL different from earlier ontology languages?

A. OWL is a Web Ontology language. Where earlier languages have been 
used to develop tools and ontologies for specific user communities 
(particularly in the sciences and in company-specific e-commerce 
applications), they were not defined to be compatible with the 
architecture of the World Wide Web in general, and the Semantic Web 
in particular.

OWL rectifies this by providing a language which uses the linking 
provided by RDF to add the following capabilities to ontologies:

     * Ability to be distributed across many systems
     * Scalable to Web needs
     * Compatible with Web standards for accessibility and internationalization.
     * Open and extensible

so I think if we stick to best practices that draw from these four 
key capabilities (arrived at with great work, and signed off on by 
the members of the W3C)
