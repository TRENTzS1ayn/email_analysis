Frank - this was indeed an error on my part -- typing too fast -- I 
was trying to say that not all the specs included it (RDF and RDF S 
dont) nor do all the Owl specs (WG chose to use RDF/XML) -- my 
apologies for poor wording.   I also didn't actually argue in favor 
of N3 per se -- I argued for Dave BEckett's Turtle, and suggested the 
WG could make it a note -- not a spec, but a very useful way to write 
RDF/OWL - even better than the AS in many cases IMHO

however, I do agree with your conclusion:

However, I personally have always had far more difficulty reading the 
AS than the N3 or RDF/XML -- I also notice that my favorite SW text 
to date [1] uses the RDF/XML syntax as the common denominator 
language - so I suspect this, like lots of other things, is not 
something where there are hard and fast rules as to which is better 
for what...
