Touche...:-)
Actually, just before it was shipped to the press, we rushed in an appendix 
with all OWL examples listed in AS. (I attach them to this msg).

In fact, the appendix was done under serious pressure from members of our 
preprint reading group that weren't SemWeb insiders. But we might take up 
your suggestion for the next edition, and relegate the RDF/XML to the 
appendix instead:-)

We will make the OWL code (in both AS and RDF/XML) available at 
http://www.semanticwebprimer.org

Main thing is: it's good to hear the WG will consider which syntax to use in 
which documents!

Frank.
