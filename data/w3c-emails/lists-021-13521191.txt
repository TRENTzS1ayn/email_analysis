Yes.

(It's very tempting to stop there ...)
Ideally if a1 and a2 are abstract syntax trees and g1 and g2 are RDF graphs 
and a1 maps to g1 and g2, and also a2 maps to g1 then at a first 
approximation they all have the same OWL DL semantics  (a1 and a2 with the 
direct semantics, g1 and g2 with the RDFS compat semantics). So that 
"should not interfere" is correct.
However, if what you want to do is to use some OWL Full feature, it is not 
clear at all whether or not the (weak and unproven) semantic guarantees 
involved in the mapping are appropriate. e.g. foaf uses Inverse Functional 
Property on DatatypeProperties.

Basically if what you want to talk about is soemthing to do with OWL Lite 
or OWL DL, then the abstract syntax is appropriate, but using it to talk 
about dc:creator say does not work because it forces you into making 
decisions that are not appropriate for dc:creator.
