If we agreed that far, we could begin discussion of what particular variant(s) are preferred.

I don't think so - I tend to agree with Frank that there isn't a single 
answer. It may be helpful to have a tutorial on the abtsract syntax, but 
that won't make the universal answer.

One of the aspects of the syntax shock is that it is so XML unfriendly, 
making a more friendly XML syntax for RDF I suspect would make it even less 
palatable to naive users.

There is not one 'syntax shock' but many: RDF/XML is a compromise between 
pressures in different directions. OWL AS is more palatable to some 
communities, and less palatable to others.
