Just two cents on our experience in teaching OWL and writing about OWL

In our book on "Ontological Engineering" (from Asun Gomez-Perez, Mariano
Fernandez-Lopez, and me) the OWL examples are written in RDF/XML syntax [*],
and people who have read them have been able to understand it, since they
are small bits of code.

The same applies when we have taught about OWL in PhD courses.

Of course, the Abstract Syntax is much less verbose, and I also like it,
especially when I want to communicate something "bigger", but at the same
time, for those cases, we also use UML class diagrams and other graphical
notations.

[*] Unfortunately, some of those examples are not valid OWL by now, since
the OWL version we used when we sent the book to print was the one available
in March last year.
