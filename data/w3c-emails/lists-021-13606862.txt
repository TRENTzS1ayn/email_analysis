Here's a very simple one:

Saying that Pat Hayes is the author of RDF Semantics may be said in RDF 
with a single triple:

<http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt> dc:creator "Pat Hayes" .

To say that in OWL AS we may well end up with something like

individual(
    <http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt>
    annotation( dc:creator "Pat Hayes" ) )

The difficulty is that the mapping rules automatically will generate
dc:creator rdf:type owl:AnnotationProperty .
as well as the triple we want and some other fairly harmless triples.

A different way of saying a similar thing in the AS would be:


individual(
    <http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt>
    value( dc:creator "Pat Hayes" ) )

And here we would need to have dc:creator as a datavalued property, giving 
the triple:

dc:creator rdf:type owl:DatatypeProperty .

Under the OWL Full semantics these two are not semantically identical (in 
fact neither entails the other), and neither is entailed by what might 
actually be written in a concrete document which might just be the single 
triple.
