Dan

Please count me in the potential participants for this TF.

FYI I am invited to speak, among other topics, about Thesaurus, Ontologies and Semantic
Web, at the Environmental Thesaurus/Terminology Workshop organized in Geneva by UN
Environment Programme Regional Office of Europe, next week (April 14-15). BTW this
conflicts with next WG meeting :(

See http://ecoinfo.eionet.eu.int/

This workshop will focus on integration of environment terminologies and thesauri provided
by UN organizations such as FAO (AGROVOC Thesaurus), UNEP (ENVOC Thesaurus), UNESCO ...
and European Agencies like EEA (GEMET Thesaurus), and relevant technologies for such an
integration. Representatives of those organisations, and more, will be present, and I
think it's a good opportunity for outreach. I hope to bring some people from there into
the game, or at least making them more aware of what it is about.

Consider it as a preliminary action I take for this TF :)
