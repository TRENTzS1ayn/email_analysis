Hi all,

I am the one who originally asked about this problem.

Natasha : That said, I don't have an alternative solution, or any solution to 
this problem. We'll certainly have to document it somehow in the BP 
documents (the question will come up again and again), but it almost 
seems like the documentation would be "there is no good way to do 
it". Am I missing something?

I've looked more deeply into the question and I realized that it is a well 
known problem. I think there is no good solution at this moment to deal with 
constraints on values. Logic deals with entities, and everything is just 
entity. 
I believe you can only reason on the nature of entities (unary predicates) and 
on the link between entities (binary predicates). The formal model is not made 
to reason on entities themselves, because in general entities are just simple 
set without any order or whatever.
But this is not the case for datatypes. So It is legitimate that we want to 
reason on datatypes, in this case some modifications have to be made to the 
formal model. I recommend a paper "Web Ontology Reasoning with Datatype Groups" 
form J. Pan and I. Horrocks.
I think this is a problem that has to be explain in a FAQ.

Ben
