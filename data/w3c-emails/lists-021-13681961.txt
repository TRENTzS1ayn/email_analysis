This requires the ability to use user-defined XML Schema datatypes, an 
issue on our TF list.
Assuming we you can do this (at some near point in the future), the 
solutions looks like this:

1. Define a datatype such as "ex:TenPlus" e.g. as a subtype of the 
built-in datatype xsd:decimal, with the additional constraint that the 
value should be >= 10 (you can express this in XML Schema).

2. Define a restriction on BigWheel, e.g.

Class(BigWheel
   insersectionOf(
     Wheel
     Restriction(diamterValue, allValuesFrom(ex:TenPlus)

[assuming this this is a necessary and sufficient definition, otherwise 
use subClassOf instead of intersectionOf]
