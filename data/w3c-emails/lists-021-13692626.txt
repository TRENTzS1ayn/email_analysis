Is this an opportunity for a modelling pattern?

   Guideline: for numeric values, always use the "quantity" pattern
              [Fowler, Gruber]

For example (in a sloppy fashion, other have done this better)

ObjectProperty(diameterValue
   domain(Wheel)
   range(LengthQuantity))

Class(Quantity)
DatatypeProperty(value
   domain(Quantity)
   range(xsd:decimal))
DatatypeProperty(unit
   domain(Quantity)
   range(Unit))
Class(LenthQuantity
   subClassOf(Quantity)
   Retriction(unit, allValuesFrom(LengthQuantity))

Individual(myWheel
   type(Wheel)
   diameterValue(type(LengthQuantity) value(15) unit(cm)))

[the middle part is general and could come out of some 
units-and-dimensions ontology]
