Recently, the following email was sent to the [I think] Yahoo Semantic Web list:

Dear all,

Can STEP(Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data) be used as the fundamental of industrial Ontology? If yes, how can we do? And can we use the EXPRESS schemas as  ontology discription language? If not,can we translate EXPRESS into Ontology description directly!

This raises a more general and very important issue for people wanting to use Semantic Web standards, but who may already be heavily using alternate modeling languages. EXPRESS is just one, there are many others, (UML, FLogic, ...). This group is already addressing thesauri, in a similar vein.  I propose that we put this on the list of potential future Task for this group. The deliverable would be a 5-15 page document outlining the general issue, and addressing each of several languages with a few paragraphs or a page.  OF course, for more important ones like UML, there might be a full task.

Provisional name for Task: Other Ontology Modeling Languages [OOML]
