Well-formedness, at the very least.

And I said at the moment there's no defined conformance for that,
unfortunately.

Again, there's no defined conformance for that (yet).

That's why the HTML WG is discussing how to identify the "type of
a document" in a schema language independent way, and how to identify
appropriate schema(s).

schemaLocation is just a hint.  There's no guarantee that XML Schema
processors would use it.  And we need a solution not specific to XML
Schema.  Unlike DTD validation, an instance may be a valid instance
of multiple schemata, and different schema may check different aspects
of validity, and different kinds of schema languages may be applied
concurrently.  For example, the following NRL schemata will perform
XML Schema, RELAX NG and Schematron validations concurrently to take
advantage of different features in different schema languages.  One
schema is not enough.

That's why I've been consciously limiting my involvement in this
task force to syntax issue only.

Well, nearly.  We need to observe how DSDL Part 4 would end up.

Yes.  [a] is a valid instance of [3].  That doesn't necessarily guarantee
that [a] is conforming to any of XHTML specifications.
