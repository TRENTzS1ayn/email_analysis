Personally, I find questions like "Can STEP be used as *the* fundamental 
industrial ontology?" to be quite frightening for a number of reasons.  Mike's 
suggestion addresses the language part of the above questions.  I think
that is appropriate task for SWBPD to take up.  I could help with UML and 
EXPRESS aspects of the task.

In answer to the last question, there is an open source tool which converts 
EXPRESS to OWL syntax.  It goes through an intermediate UML representation, 
loses information that all of those languages can represent, and results in 
OWL that looks like RDFS with object and datatype properties.  But it is a 
start.

Finally, we should be very careful about taking a position about the 
definitiveness of any domain or upper ontology.  STEP is a huge standard,
but it doesn't cover all of manufacturing data concerns, much less the
broader area of industrial data.  It is also not a single coherent model,
but rather a set of application area models (called Application Protocols or 
APs) which conform to a common architecture and use a common information 
language: EXPRESS.  If someone wanted to convert a particular STEP AP to OWL, 
we might get involved.  Even then, I would be careful about how the result is 
characterized.  In manufacturing, different subdomains such as Aerospace, 
Automotive, Semiconductor, Oil and Gas employ different standards to address 
similar kinds of functions and data.  This is not just an accident of history,
there are *some* good reasons for these differences.
