In cases where units and dimensions are important, then this may be a good guideline to work with. In most other cases, it may be extra baggage.  I worked with Gruber's physical quantities ontology and on the whole thought it to be very high quality, well thought out and w/ few if any errors.

Is this an opportunity for a modelling pattern?
Guideline: for numeric values, always use the "quantity" pattern
[Fowler, Gruber]

For example (in a sloppy fashion, other have done this better)
ObjectProperty(diameterValue
domain(Wheel) range(LengthQuantity))
Class(Quantity)
DatatypeProperty(value
domain(Quantity)
range(xsd:decimal))
DatatypeProperty(unit
domain(Quantity) range(Unit))
Class(LenthQuantity
subClassOf(Quantity)
Retriction(unit, allValuesFrom(LengthQuantity))
Individual(myWheel
type(Wheel) diameterValue(type(LengthQuantity) value(15) unit(cm)))
[the middle part is general and could come out of some units-and-dimensions ontology]
