one more email on pattern forms for oep
my suggestion (from webont)  and 
from:http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/people/dlm/webont/HowToDoIt/closingRoles.html:

problem description
observations (optional)
abstracted solution
example

natasha's example at:  
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2004Apr/att-0061/ClassesAsValues.html  
had
general issue     (could be viewed as similar to problem description)
use case example
other scenario
approaches  (with considerations and summaries)

welty previously at  http://esw.w3.org/topic/PartWhole   had


Background
OWL Formalization
Pitfalls
References



my summarization of these is:

problem description   (including background   and observations could fit 
in here as well)
use case example
abstracted solution
owl solution
implications
references

if as in natasha's example, there are many solutions, then repeat   
abstracted solution, owl solution, implications, references as appropriate.
