Hello,

Congratulations,

I think that this document contains, at least for me, quite the type of
informations
i would like to find in a BPG : clear, very easy to read and neutral
towards the choice 
of one approach instead of an other.

Two little points : 

1) Approach 3 : 

You write : "We can take the second option in Approach 2" 

The figure seems to be relative to the first option ? am i wrong
?


2) Approach 1 :
 The first consideration is : "The resulting ontology is in OWL
Full"

I think that what could be vvery interesting would be to give a little
and very simple example of what does this categorization concretely
imply; indeed it's not always clear to clearly understand the direct
consequences of such a fact.

Perhaps that the fact to describe a blocking situation in the context of
this use case due to the fact that we are in OWL FULL, could help people
to better realize what to be in OWL FULL really means. My request comes
from the fact that when i tried to find such a situation/example it was
more difficult than i thought at first

Thanks

Best regards

MArco NANNI

Objet : [OEP] "Classes as values" first draft



Folks,

At the last telecon, I took an action to produce a draft note on 
dealing with the issue of classes as property values. My first pass 
at it is at

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2004Apr/att-0061/Classes
AsValues.html

This is a strawman, so please feel free to and do poke holes in it! I 
think the goal here is really two-fold: (1) to give some suggestions 
on how to deal with  the specific issue (classes as values) and (2) 
to figure out what the general format and tone of such notes and 
patterns should be. (The second one being arguably more important at 
this point)

I have shamelessly lifted most of the ideas from the discussion on 
the mailing list a couple of weeks ago. So, thanks to everyone who 
participated in that discussion. I would also like to thank Oscar for 
his comments on an earlier draft.

Natasha
