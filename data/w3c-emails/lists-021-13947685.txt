I must admit that up until I saw this document, I was seriously 
thinking of suggesting that OEP was a bad idea and that we should not 
have the task force.   Natasha's document shows me I was wrong, that 
it may be possible for us to create some useful information for 
Semantic Web users based on our experiences in our non-semantic web 
-- if all of the things written up are done as carefully, 
thoughtfully, and comprehensively as this - and are balanced in 
presenting the solutions as this is - then maybe there's hope. 
Natasha -- great job!
