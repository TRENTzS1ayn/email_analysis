FYI: I discovered one of my colleagues was independently playing around with 
"data islands" in IE:

it also has some support in Mozilla:

Joseph,

Thank you for your advice and information.
I'll check your "RDF in HTML" task.

Here is the information I talked to you, named "XML Data Islands".

http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_data_island.asp

They enabled to show the XML information included in HTML,
by using <xml> tag in HTML document and accessing those information
by "<span datafld=... >".

So I thought that I might be able to use this function to show the
translation information written in RDF/XML included in HTML(or XHTML).

I guess this may be microsoft only specification,
and I think this syntax is not XHTML valid,
But it says that these functions are implemented IE5.0 or higher,
and I also have confirmed this function with my browser IE6.0.

Maybe you can find more information by Google with keyword "XML Data
Islands".
