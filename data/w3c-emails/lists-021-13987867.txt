Perhaps that the fact to describe a blocking situation in the context 
of this use case due to the fact that we are in OWL FULL, could help 
people to better realize what to be in OWL FULL really means. My 
request comes from the fact that when i tried to find such a 
situation/example it was more difficult than i thought at first

Sure, as long as for any "blocking condition" that someone claims is 
caused by being in OWL Full, we also include blocking conditions 
which result from being in OWL DL/Lite (there are many that I'm 
encoutering in my work these days) and also that we explore some new 
paradigms that are yet relatively sparse -- for example, Mike Dean 
had some nice examples (I think it was at a DAML meeting) of the idea 
of, essentially, taking the OWL DL subset of an OWL Full document and 
it using it for some reasoning (classification) tasks.
   Again, what I ask is that we remember we're in largely unexplored 
space and we need to be very careful of being judgmental -- I have 
met many people who believe in the future OWL DL will cease to exist 
and everyone will just use something called OWL, I have met many 
people who believe in the future OWL Full will cease to exist and 
everyone will just use something called OWL, and I've met many people 
who think it will continue as current - with perhaps more OWL 
profiles growing over time (for example, the Gene Ontology folks have 
been thinking about how to interact w/OWL, given they consider 
part-whole to be the most important kind of representation for the 
applications they run) -- in short, predicting the future is always 
difficult and we should be careful to embrace multiple views
