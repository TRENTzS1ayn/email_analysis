I agree - its a very clear and well presented document! a great start:)

Regarding the approaches covered, I have an additional approach (a variant
of approach 2) that seems reasonably intuitive to me. So in the current
document, we define 'LionImage' as an Instance of Class 'AnimalImage' -
why not make it a subclass of 'AnimalImage' instead? (i.e. define a set of
all images that have Lion as subject) and instead of having a separate
subject hierarchy (approach 2, option 2), have an image hierarchy where
the subjects are restricted accordingly..so the class definitions would
be:

<owl:Class rdf:ID="AnimalImage">
<rdfs:subClassOf>
<owl:Restriction>
<owl:onProperty>
<owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="dc:subject"/>
<owl:allValuesFrom rdf:resource="#Animal"/>
</owl:onProperty>
</owl:Restriction>
</rdfs:subClassOf>
</owl:Class>

<owl:Class rdf:ID="LionImage">
<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="#AnimalImage"/>
<rdfs:subClassOf>
<owl:Restriction>
<owl:onProperty>
<owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="dc:subject"/>
<owl:allValuesFrom rdf:resource="#Lion"/>
</owl:onProperty>
</owl:Restriction>
</rdfs:subClassOf>
</owl:Class>

Thus, one could create instances of 'LionImage' referring to specific
photos and have their 'dc:subject' point to specific 'Lion' individuals, which seems like a
natural thing to do. Also, one could directly retrieve 'only images of Lions' this way (i.e.
instances of class 'LionImage'), rather than search through all AnimalImage instances instead

Also, I'm not entirely clear on the third point of consideration for
approach 2 - why would creating an instance of class lion be 'inconsistent with the
interpretation'? If the 'Lion' class is completely defined by what is stated in the document, then maybe
that holds, however, given that the complete ontology would have other properties of 'Lion' and
other classes that point to it, why would I need a separate Lion class to
represent a specific lion at a zoo?

Finally, maybe we should mention somewhere in the document that using
'allValuesFrom' restriction on property 'dc:subject' in the cases shown
ensures that an 'AnimalImage' can only have its subject as 'Animal'
and nothing else..hmm, makes me wonder if someValues is a better option -
since it covers photos where we need to describe something more than just
the animals in it (such as surroundings etc) - which would typically be the case?

Thanks,
Aditya
