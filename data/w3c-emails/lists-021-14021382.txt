For those of us that expect to attend WWW in New York city in May, there is an chance to have an F2F.

Two options come to mind:
1.a general meeting with all task forces
2.task-force specific meetings

IF YOU ARE GOING TO WWW in NYC, please send me (not the whole group) an email indicating which task forces you are involved in.  I will collate this and send the summary to the group.  Then TF leaders and/or representatives can choose to organize themselves.

I'm most interested in TF meetings for OEP and WRLD. If anyone feels strongly motivated to have an overall meeting, then feel free to step forward to organize it.

Mike
