Dan, after our discussion today this idea gelled with me further when it 
connected to some discussion I had with the HTML WG last week and a 
question I asked there:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2003Jul/0011.html
  2. It would cool that if instead of an RDF application only accepting 
  a particular syntax, it had a MANDATORY mechanism (i.e. XSLT) that 
  enabled it to transform any XML to a suitable serialization prior to
  consumption. (I  actually don't know if there's any definition of
  conformance for an RDF application? Does RDF 1.0 only specify a format?)

In the creative commons case, one would want to move from:

<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/"><img
alt="Creative Commons License" border="0" align="left"
src="http://creativecommons.org/images/public/somerights.gif" /></a>The

"work") are licensed under the Creative Commons <a
href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/legalcode">Attribution-NoDerivs-NonCommercial
1.0</a> license, in summary:</p>

To something in the HTML that indicates a the URL of an XSLT that would turn 
this into:

<rdf:RDF xmlns="http://web.resource.org/cc/"
    xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
    xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
<Work rdf:about="">
<license rdf:resource="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/" />
</Work>
</rdf:RDF>

That shouldn't be too hard as the only real bit of "meaning" here is the 
identifier 'http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/'. However, it 
might get hairier in more complex situations...

Also, you mentioned the use of a profile, akin to what you've proposed in 
[1], but today we noted that we might want to have *more than* transform 
associated with any given XHTML document (one for yeilding the creative 
commons, another for the calendar, etc.), but you can only have one profile 
in the html:head element, right?
