Agreed. Since this is such a sensitive area, we need to be 
particularly careful with terminology.

Let me suggest that rather than say that something is "in OWL-Full", 
it would be better to say that it is not in OWL-DL. That is, the 
important negative aspect of the simple solution is that it puts one 
OUTSIDE the DL subcase.  This gets the key point across, and also I 
think places the focus on what is going to be for many users the key 
issue, which is whether or not the ontology will be rejected by 
DL-restricted tools.

Also, on a more general pedagogic point, the sooner more people get 
used to thinking in terms of expressiveness/functionality trade-offs, 
the better. This issue, in one form or another, is the central one.
