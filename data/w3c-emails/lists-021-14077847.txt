This is not quite correct. Logic itself does not have any 
prohibitions or limitations on talking about individual values such 
as numbers, and neither does RDFS or OWL-Full.  Datatypes are just 
names (or, arguably, terms involving datatype functions) in a purely 
logical model. The prohibition on restrictions which mention datatype 
values is entirely an artifact of OWL-DL, imposed by fiat by its 
designers. (For good computational reasons, but not for logical or 
semantic reasons.)
