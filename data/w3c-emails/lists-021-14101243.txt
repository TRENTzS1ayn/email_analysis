Possible TF Additions

  On "Human-friendly Syntax":

  Jim: Focus should be on real world priorities.

  Jim: We should reuse existing N3 or OWL syntax (vs. writing our own).
Students should learn to read the N3/OWL syntax.
  
  Natasha: Used syntax generated by Protoge; was not a problem.
  
  Jim: N3/Turtle syntax is ok since existing tools support it (Python).
  
  Guus: To reiterate; this was proposed because it is hard to represent some
of the elements of the Abstract Syntax.
  
  <Scribe> RESOLVED There is no strong support to creating a special
human-friendly syntax TF now, so postpone indefinitely.
  
  On Tom Baker's remarks at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swbp-wg/2004Apr/0025.html:

  <Scribe> RESOLVED Discuss next time (Tom Baker regrets)

 
World TF
  
  jhendler: discussions have begun but no progress made as of yet.
  
  <Scribe> ACTION: Jim report back on short-term plan for World Task Force.


OEP (Mike, Deb)

  Guus: Pro/con approach is good.
  
  Guus: Numeric and quantity contraint issues candidate for OEP note
  
  Mike: Show hybrid issues
  
  Natasha: Examples should cross reference with links

  <Scribe> ACTION: Natasha to update the note and summerize email discussion
   
  <Scribe> ACTION: Libby and Brian propose repository for apps based on
test-repository


WordNet TF

  Guus: Discuss this in more detail next time.

  Guus: Should organize telecons so that invited experts can listen in on
the pertinent part of the conference.

to WNET.
