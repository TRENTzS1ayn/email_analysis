Pat,

I'm quite sure we don't understand each other to know whether we agree or disagree, but in this case, I'm going to guess there is no substantial disagreement. I think we are using the word 'standard' differently (oddly enough). Many people regard the Dublin Core as a standard, and they choose to refer to the terms there-in.  Similarly, many people choose to use meters to measure distances, it is convenient if we all use the same standard, but we can't always agree to use the same standard.  

Mike

Michael, WHAT the hell are you taking about? What 'existing standard 
definitions' ?? Even if they exist (I know of no such case, where 
there is a single existing standard definition of any concept in any 
ontology. RDFS and OWL disagree about the exact meaning of 'subclass' 
for example.), WHY would we want to use them?

Might be better to worry about what to say when the oceans freeze over.
