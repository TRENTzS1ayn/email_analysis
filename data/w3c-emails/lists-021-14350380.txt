TEMPLATE Task Force Description

NAME XML Schema Datatypes and Semantic Web

STATUS: "Considered"


COORDINATORS:
Carroll + nominee of XML Schema WG

MEMBERS
approx 2 additional from SWBPDWG
and 2 additional from XML Schema WG


OBJECTIVES
This TF will consider two issues:
- what URI should be used within RDF and OWL for user defined XML Schema
Datatypes
- what is the relationship between the value spaces of the various XML
Schema built-in simple types when used within RDF and OWL

Resolution of these issues MUST be with consensus of
both SWBPDWG and XML Schema WG
A failure to reach consensus on either issue should be documented in a WG
Note.

DELIVERABLES
A WG Note describing the issue resolutions or the failure to resolve
An OWL Ontology describing the value spaces of the XML Schema builtin simple
Datatypes.

TARGET AUDIENCE & USE CASES
OWL and RDF Platform developers.
OWL and RDF ontology authors.
XML Schema Datatype library code developers (particularly those aiming at a
reusable datatyping component not solely targetted at XML Schema)
