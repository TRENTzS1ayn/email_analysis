you are right -- I'll fix this.

In this particular case, it means (and DL folks, please, correct me if 
I am wrong) that DL reasoners such as RACER simply won't accept this 
ontology or will ignore the property values that are classes.

I agree with you that we probably need a document on implications of 
moving from OWL FL to OWL Full but this discussion is probably out of 
the scope of the "classes as values" document.
