Good information, thanks for making those points.

it seems to me that your syntax is indeed intuitive and
also quite similar to

:diameterValue a owl:ObjectProperty;
               rdfs:domain :Wheel;
               rdfs:range :LengthQuantity.
:Quantity a owl:Class.
:value a owl:DatatypeProperty;
       rdfs:domain :Quantity;
       rdfs:range xsd:decimal.
:unit a owl:DatatypeProperty;
      rdfs:domain :Quantity; 
      rdfs:range :Unit.
:LenthQuantity rdfs:subClassOf :Quantity;
               a owl:Retriction;
               owl:onProperty :unit;
               owl:allValuesFrom :LengthQuantity.
:myWheel a :Wheel; 
         :diameterValue [ a :LengthQuantity; 
                          :value "15"^^xsd:decimal; 
                          :unit "cm"^^:Unit].


which is Turtle N3 [1][2] but which has the indispensable
feature that it has qualified names which are resolved
to URI's using

@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>.
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>.
@prefix : <http://example.org/eg#>.


and it fullfills your above points 1. and 2.
i.e. there are tools and it includes all of OWL Full.
