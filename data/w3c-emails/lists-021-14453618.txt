I think Alan meant to send this to the SWBPD list.

In response to his comment.  UML Associations are typically binary and
scoped to the classes at both end-points (so in this sense they are innately
qualified).  However, Association names must be unique within a Package. It would 
take an intelligent mapping to aggregate semantically similar Associations together 
into OWL ObjectProperties, although I agree that this is the "right way" to do it.  
The mapping rules that I have seen recently in fact do the opposite, they even 
mangle DatatypeProperty names for corresponding UML attributes by pre-pending them 
with a UML class name.  

Regarding work arounds for qualified cardinality:  Cannot one get the
expressiveness of Qualified Cardinality by using subProperties of a 
common property and placing local restrictions on the cardinality of those?
Is that ugly or problematic?

All

One minor point.  The absence of qualified cardinality constraints means that translation of some UML and, I suspect, STEP constructs into OWL is necessarily lossy for any case in which a UML diagram uses the same relation with separate cardinality constraints to two or more entities.

The work around is ugly and incomplete.  Translation to DAML+OIL with QCRs, by contrast,
is straightforward in this regard.

Regards

Alan
