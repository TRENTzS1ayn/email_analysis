An additional note about deliverables

Personally, I would like the TF to publish a first version of the note very 
quickly (e.g. one month after kick-off, late June maybe, assuming a 
kick-off over a beer in new york).
This first version would:
- describe the two issues
- describe one or more possible solutions
- ask for public feedback, possibly with a deadline

After the deadline, the TF would propose a resolution with rationale for 
consideration by both WGs - if this proves acceptable the TF succeeds, 
otherwise it fails. Either way it documents the result in second version of 
  note.

I guess I could redraft with such a plan and schedule explicit.
