However, I have to say publicly that I had read, and reread, the

If I misinterpreted it, then it is an honest and informed misinterpretation.



Alan - sorry, I really shouldn't have implied you didn't read the 
paper - I knew you better than that (and your private comment makes 
it clear) -- forgive me for over-reacting in the heat of argument. 
This is about the 3rd time my research papers had been cited as 
evidence that I was somehow being inconsisent or such, and I snapped 
at you unduly.

p.s. This apology is indeed being made in public as Alan deserves that.
