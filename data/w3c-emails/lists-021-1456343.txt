Greetings,


      This issue certainly needs to be dealt with by some group, I agree.
At the most recent plenary meeting, an informal solution was proposed by
Michael Sp-McQ. The proposed solution, as I recall, was not perfect, but
did seem to be workable and to address the most immediate and important
issues. Perhaps this solution should be cast into a formal proposal to W3C,
which could then determine "on whose plate" responsibility for the eventual
solution lies.

Regards,

D-

As you know, I've been chasing the thread of what exactly happened to the
"character entities without DTDs" issue as documented in [1]. When I asked
the XML Core WG about it recently, Paul Grosso responded "I am aware of no
currently open task on the XML Core WG's task list associated with XML 2.0.

There are therefore no associated dates." [2]

It's certainly a difficult technical issue, but I know sometimes the
emergent tendency is for the problem to become obfuscated in bureaucracy
rather than keeping it clearly identified as an open but difficult issue on

*some* plate somewhere that occasionally gets reconsidered or resourced. (I

like that about the TAG issues.) Consequently, the only thing I can
recommend in this case is to re-raise the issue with Core and ask that it
explicitly be added to [3] -- as an active or future task -- with an offer
to help when the time comes along.
