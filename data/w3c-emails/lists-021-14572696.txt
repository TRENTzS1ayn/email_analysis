i need to plan my schedule next thursday and i wanted to confirm the 
time of next week's telecon.

i have not seen minutes of the last meeting so i looked in:
http://www.w3.org/2004/04/15-swbp-irc

and i saw two statements of the next telecon time  but this one was last.

14:19:42 [jhendler]
    next meeting, 29 APRIL 2004 at 1800 UTC

    then i looked at the world clock and put in 3 time zones beyond UTC
    time for pacific time, eastern time, and western europe (it only
    allowed 3 entries)  and i got:


UTC-time San Francisco <city.html?n=224> Boston <city.html?n=43> 
Amsterdam <city.html?n=16>

Thursday, April 29, 2004, at 6:00 PM 
</worldclock/fixedtime.html?year=2004&month=4&day=29&hour=18&min=0&sec=0> 
Thu 11:00 AM * Thu 2:00 PM * Thu 8:00 PM *

is that right?


i have not seen a mailing about next week's meeting time  so could someone either confirm that this is right  or correct me?

thanks,
deborah
