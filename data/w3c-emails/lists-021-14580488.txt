Problem in notation./labelling.  I was meant "LionImage" to indicate the actual image resource in Natasha's drawings.
I should have called it something like "ThisImageOfALion" rdf:type (Image and restriction(someValuesFrom xxx:subject
someValuesFrom Lion))".

Or given it a proper URI to make the intention clear.
