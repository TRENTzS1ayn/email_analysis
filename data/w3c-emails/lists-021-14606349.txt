I thought I would have a more complete response ready by now be events have intervened.
Just a few comments below on your comments.

but the intention as I understand it also includes

      "...dc:subject value(Shakespeare)"

for a picture of Shakespeare.

In which case what is meant is literally that it is a picture of Shakespeare.  If there is another
property for this case, please correct me.

I accept that the case of a "Book about Lions" is a ambiguous.

There is quite a bit to say here which I will illustrate in a later email.
However, we don't want people to have to understand all that before they use the Semantic Web.

I think we need two clear guidelines

    One for those who want to stay with OWL-DL,
    The other for those who want to use OWL-Full

With luck, if we can stick to only one guideline each for OWL-Full and OWL-DL, then we can suggest standard transforms to get from one to the other with a minimum, well defined, distortion of meaning.

I'll argue for my suggestion  for the OWL-DL case in a subsequent email supported with ontologies and examples.

My point is partly that what I suggest works in OWL DL smoothly and achieves
exactly what you want - that any picture of a Lion is also a picture of Mammal, an Animal,
etc. I'll attach the ontologies when they are fully annotated and screen shot.

NO.  It doesn't say anything about any specific Lion.  It only says that
in the specific KB with the picture, that picture is an instance of a
"picture of a Lion".

The advantage of this version over your case in which you instantiate individuals is precisely
that it leaves the individual indeterminate.  Any KB can point to the reference ontology and
indicate that some resource is an of type "image of a lion", e.g.

    zzz:myResource rdf:type (yyy:Image and restriction(xxx:subject someValuesFrom yyy:Lion))

where xxx is the namespace for the reference property, e.g. Dublin Core, and yyy is the name space for the reference ontology, and zzz is the namespace for the referring KB. (Obviously we could name the target class something like "Image_of_a_lion", but I have written it out in full here.)

Anyone with access to the KB at namespace yyy will be able to infer
that zzz:myResource is also or type  image of a Mammal, a Carnivore,
a Ferocious_animal, or whatever other superclasses are in the ontology at xxx.

The point is - we don't care which lion; just that it is 'a lion'.   (or 'some lions').

Furthermore, if they have another picture of 'a lion' or 'lions' they can reference it to the same point unambiguously.

I hope this is clearer.

Alan
