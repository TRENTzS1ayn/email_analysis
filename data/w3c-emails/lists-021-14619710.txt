At the workshop announced in the below message, we had the opportunity, with Alistair
Miles, to present ongoing work in the SW, including SWBPD and SWAD Europe, and relevancy
of SW technologies to deal with the environment terminology issues. There was a great
interest in those presentations from workshop participants (40-50 people).

The output of this very fruitful meeting was the creation of a new entity called ECOTERM
(legal status and charter pending) of which objective will be to provide tools and
framework for coordination, interoperability and availability on the Web of KOS legacy
(thesauri, vocabularies, ontologies ...) in the domain of environment at large.

Most interestingly, part of the consensus was to consider Semantic Web technologies and
languages as most relevant tools to achieve those goals, and interest in
cooperation/liaison with SWBPD WG has been formally expressed in the meeting final
agreement document.

IMO, this is an extremely interesting opportunity to test SW in a large, real world,
multilingual, multidisciplinary and general interest use case.

To be continued ...
