In theory, I agree with you. In practice, let's just take it on a case 
by case basis and see what we want to say when we encounter this 
discrepancy (which we probably will, but I don't think we have just 
yet). In practice, we may often find out that the purist's solution 
makes a lot of sense. But again, this discussion would be more grounded 
if we had a specific problem.
