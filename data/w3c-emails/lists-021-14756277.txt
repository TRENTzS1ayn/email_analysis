I support this idea. Natasha already promised a revised 
"classes-as-values" note for the next telecon. Mike/Deb, could you 
provide a summary of the other OEP debates for discussion on the telecon.

I would like to have a discussion on the telecon for the short-term 
results we could produce in OEP, next to the classes-as-values note.
