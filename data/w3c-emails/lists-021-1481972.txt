I thought part of the problem there is that the schema validation comes well 
after XML1.0 entity processing/parsing... I'm unfamiliar with MSM's 
proposal from the last plenary (reference?), and I've seen a proposal akin 
to:
  <html xml:entities="xxx"><p>now I can use &eacute;...</p>....</html>
but this would require a new XML attribute and maybe new version of XML, and 
it wouldn't be backwards compatible. (These might be ok, just seem to be 
the issues that arise in my mind.)
