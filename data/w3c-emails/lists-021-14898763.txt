I agree with Jeremy that length limits often do produce better documents. It is a question of judgment, whether to leave something out because it is rambling vs. legitimate and very useful extra detail giving people deeper insights into an issue.

Length limits often are a good discipline for being concise and getting 
to the point. (I am not sufficiently informed to have an opinion on the 
specific note in question)
