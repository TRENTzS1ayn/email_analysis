Not so:
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/struct/global.html#adef-profile
"""profile = uri [CT]
This attribute specifies the location of ***one or more meta data
profiles, separated by white space***. For future extensions, user
agents should consider the value to be a list even though this
specification only considers the first URI to be significant. Profiles
are discussed below in the section on meta """

(note that the XHTML Modularization definition implies only 1 URI, but
that the current draft of XHTML 2 explicitely allows more than 1 URI).
