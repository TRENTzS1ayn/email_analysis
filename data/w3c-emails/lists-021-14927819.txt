> Hi everyone,
> 
> By way of an introduction to myself:
> 
> I'm a research associate at CCLRC [1] and have been there for almost 2
> years now.  I've been working on the Thesaurus Activity of the SWAD-Europe
> project [2], which is developing to SKOS schemas, as well as reports,
> guidelines and the beginnings of some best practices for porting thesauri
> to the semantic web.  The rest of my time at CCLRC is spent working on the
> Pellucid project [3], which is developing a platform for experience
> management for organisationally mobile empoyees.  The Pellucid work has
> involved ontology development and some hacking of agent-based systems - I
> talked the project team into using OWL and RDF as the framework for the
> ontologies and agent communication.   
> 
> Before CCLRC I spent 2 years as a consultant developing Java GIS web
> applications and services, and before that I graduated Cambridge with a
> degree in Zoology, so I'm young, fresh, and have a fairly unique
> perspective!
> 
> In my experience so far of meeting members of communities with a big stake
> in things like thesauri, terminologies, classification schemes etc. it
> seems that there is a really big opportunity for people like ourselves
> with an intimate knowledge of semantic web technologies to add some value
> for these folks.  I hope we can continue to gather momentum in this area
> through the Thesaurus task force proposed for this working group.
> 
> Yours,
>
