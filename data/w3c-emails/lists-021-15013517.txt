Sorry, resending this correcting some N3 syntax mistakes ...

I believe the best way to express the fact that a particular image depicts a
thing which is a member of the class of Lions would be to say (this is the
FOAF model):

LionImage
aAnimalImage;
foaf:depicts[aLion].

Lion
aowl:Class;
subClassOfMammal.

Mammalaowl:Class.
AnimalImageaowl:Class.


The alternative way of expressing similar information is to use the
dc:subject property along with the SKOS model [2] for describing concepts
that are intended to act as 'subjects' or 'topics' for information
resources.

LionImage
aAnimalImage;
dc:subjectLionConcept.

LionConcept
askos:Concept;
skos:prefLabel'Lions';
skos:broaderMammalConcept.

MammalConcept
askos:Concept;
skos:prefLabel'Mammals';
skos:narrowerLionConcept.

The SKOS vocab already defines a class 'Concept' and a set of properties for
organising concepts into a hierarchy, without demanding that the hierarchy
implies a subclass relationship.  I refer the WG to the document [2] which
outlines the SKOS-Core schema, although you should currently ignore the
final section on 'using SKOS-Core with DC and FOAF' as this will change
shortly to be in line with the model of usage that I have briefly described
here.

Yours,

Alistair.
