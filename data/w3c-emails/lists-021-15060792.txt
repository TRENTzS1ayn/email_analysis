For 'best way', I'm reading, 'most appropriate idiom' rather than 'best
RDF property'. There will likely be various other RDF vocabs that adopt
a similar approach. The basic idea with foaf:topic is to be able to say
that some Document is 'about' (has as a subject/topic/etc) some
particular thing. We recently extended this by creating
foaf:primaryTopic, for cases where a Document has a very obvious
dominant topic.

Yes. I think the work we do here in the THES/PORT tf will need to do two
things. We should articulate a vocabulary in the broader/narrower/etc
tradition that is sufficient to represent thesauri *as thesauri* (SKOS
is an excellent candidate there imho), but we
should also go deeper into an explanation into these two fundamentally
different (and complimentary) approaches to topic description.

The thread I started on public-esw-thes yesterday picks up this line of 
enquiry too, using a geographical example. 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-esw-thes/2004Apr/0021.html

This reminds me, I was going to propose to the WG that the
thesaurus/porting tf adopt that mailing list as it's main home, with 
periodic reports back here. Al, everyone, what do you think?

ps. http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/talks/200404-synthesis/ is my 
brief talk from tuesday's SWAD-Europe meeting. Has a few more notes on
these issues.

pps. does someone have a pointer to the latest work here on
wordnet-in-rdf?
