I believe one original thought about our documents was that we would 
have a template that we would use to write up many different discussion 
topics.
i had originally thought that it could be viewed as one large running 
(interactive hyperlinked) document  that would have an overview section 
and pointers to each of the detailed discussions.
as it does seem that we will be doing some detailed discussions with 
writeups such as the one that natasha has led, it now seems most likely 
that we might consider a web publication of the discussions in note form 
probably saying in the introduction of each one that these notes are 
expected to be a part of a larger document and may evolve. 
one reason i say they may evolve is that both
- we might expect feedback from their publication
- we might find that we want to add new segments to our template as we 
evolve more of the discussions.

i also agree that we want to have an executive summary of any note that 
gets long   but having detail available for those who are really using 
our documents for a lot of guidance can be useful.
