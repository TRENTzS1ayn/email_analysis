thanks for the work and the update.
i have been in meetings and traveling for the last few days so have not 
gotten to look at this in detail.
one thing we might discuss briefly is if we are going to use the basic form:

problem description   (including background   and observations could fit 
in here as well)
use case example
abstracted solution
owl solution
implications
references

for the write ups and if so, make a small modification to accomodate this.

you also provided additional sections that we might want in all notes or 
might make optional but encourage.
