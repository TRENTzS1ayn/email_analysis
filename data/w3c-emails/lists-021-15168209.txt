Syntax Proposal:
It has been moved that we adopt the following conventions for SWBPD syntax usage.
1. In the main content sections of all formal published notes, Turtle/N3 will be used. This meets the requirements that the syntax be both human- and machine-readable. 
Exception: In some cases, the subject matter is best communicated using a different syntax (e.g. the RDF/XML Task Force). This is deemed acceptable on a case-by-case basis for the main content sections of formal published notes.

As appropriate, additional syntaxes may be presented in appendices to the notes.
OPEN QUESTION: 
?should we make it a requirement that, say all notes at least have RDF/XML in an appendix? -or-
?should this be entirely up to the author's discression?  

2.For regular email exchanges, use of Turtle/N3 syntax remains the recommended  convention, but is not required to the extent that it causes undue inconvenience. For example:
?one's favorite tool may not export Turtle/N3. 
?there are times when one may wish to dash off a quick example and just type it in some ad hoc informal notation. 
?the subject matter may be best explained using alternative syntaxes (as above).
