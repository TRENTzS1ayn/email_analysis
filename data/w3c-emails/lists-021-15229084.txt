that's right and as I couldn't attend todays telecon
it is indeed very helpful to read the irc chat log at
http://www.w3.org/2004/04/29-swbp-irc
(which are very clear notes btw :))


as a matter of fact, I read in there

[[

      Back to XML Schema Datatypes
18:54:44 [Natasha]
      Participants: Ralph, Jos?
18:55:05 [Natasha]
      ACTION: Jeremy? to check with Jos if he is participating in the TF
]]

and I would volunteer to participate in that TF
(did some related work a while ago at
