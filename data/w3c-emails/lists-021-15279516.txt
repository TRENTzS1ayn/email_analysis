I believe that a statement of general policy, with extensive discretion, 
is the best way forward. This allows any reviewer who cares to easily 
challenge author discretion when it goes against the main thrust of the 
policy. Otherwise we need to over-engineer the letter of the policy, 
rather than gradually come to a shared understanding of the spirit

(e.g. I think having examples in Turtle and RDF/XML, in-line, like in 
the OWL Test Cases, fits the spirit, without fitting the letter of 
Mike's proposal - I don't think this is worth discussing except on a 
case-by-case basis)
