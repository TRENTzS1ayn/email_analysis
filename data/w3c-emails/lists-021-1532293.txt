And the present "trackback" stuff, which is actually RDF associated with 
*parts* of an HTML document.

Yes, this coincides with the current bias of:
  "Authoring, the solution MUST enable ...
  RDF authors to be copy an arbitrary serialization into an XHTML 
  document (hand authoring the RDF serialization in NOT a 
  requirement)"

PROPOSAL

To consider this proposal in light of requirements (these are not 
"judgments" about the requirements, merely asking if I understand it 
correctly in light of requirements):
1. Does this actually permit easy copy and paste? Does this proposal require 
a known document structure document for the XPath expressions to be valid 
across all documents? For instance, in CC, if the document SHOULD have a 
dc:author, then this value MUST appear elsewhere in the page. However, this 
might not be already present, or it might appear in different places for 
all of the pages a CC statement might be associated with?

2. This proposal satisfies the "simple scenarios" regiments, but not the 
more complex one?
