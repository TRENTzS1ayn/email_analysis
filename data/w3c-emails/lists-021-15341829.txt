I'm glad that this has been recognized and that care is being taken to
keep the two cases separate. It can be massivly confusing to mix them
up.

Mike's argument is the same I held for WordNet. One thing is 
considering wordnets, thesauri, terminologies as informal ontologies, 
and then reengineering them to get full-fledged ontologies, and 
another thing is trying to describe their current structure. The 
second one can have interesting uses, provided that we do not mix 
ontologies and structures in the same domain. In the WordNet task 
force, we have decided to give recommendations for both things, and 
explaining the different results, advantages, and uses.
