Hi all,

There's a discussion going on right now on the public-esw-thes@w3.org list
re deciding some sort of policy or reasonably clear recommendation to offer
to thesaurus owners who are deciding on URIs as identifiers for their
thesauri and thesaurus concepts.  There was some prior discussion (see the
archives [1] ) then I put up a suggested way forward [2] and the discussion
is ongoing.  

It would be really good to have some feedback from the WG on this issue.

Alistair.
