Better "intriguing" that GOOD or BAD :))

The devil is in the (modulo) indeed. Real world is not simple, but is not real world what
this WG is about now?
But in this very case, I think that e.g. "The African Lion" and "Denny the Lion" are
simple enough at a decent level of semantic granularity, IOW if we don't make them too
difficult to grasp by looking too closely at them.

Sure.
