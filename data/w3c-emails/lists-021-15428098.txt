As promised at the last telecon, I am forwarding the message I have 
received from Philippe Martin (one of the WordNet experts the I have 
contacted on behalf of the WordNet Task Force), who comments on the 
issues raised so far.

>I do not think that people should have to explore a hierarchy of

>modules to search, re-use, extend or merge, especially since
>these modules may be conflicting, redundant and complementary.
>Imagine someone wanting to search or add some knowledge about certain
>kinds of "neurons", or "cats" or "feet". There are (too) many domains
>this knowledge can be categorized into and (too) many tasks it can be
>useful for. People should be able to use a general knowledge server to
>find the different meanings of (categories for) "neurons", "cats" or
>"feet", and explore their specializations (or other related categories)
>until they have found the right category (or the closest).
>Ideally, the knowledge statements (or the "data" for a database related
>analogy) associated to a category should also be organized via
>categories, e.g. a category #Siamese_cat might be linked to a
>category pm#health_issues_of_siamese_cats.
>If the URL of a specialized knowledge server is associated to a
>sufficiently adequate category (e.g. via a link "serverFor"), the user
>should continue its exploration on this specialized server (if there are
>several possible specialized servers, ideally they mirror each other to
>share the same knowledge about this category, i.e. the same collection
>of statements related to that category). When the creators of a
>specialized server register to have their server associated to a
>category in a general server, they commit to try to collect and
>structure as much knowledge as possible about that category (e.g.
>about pm#health_issues_of_siamese_cats, or more ambitiously, about
>#Siamese_cat; the server about #Siamese_cat may of course refer to the
>server about pm#health_issues_of_siamese_cats). (In a commercial
>environment, it is in the interest of the creators of a server to do
>some checking and refer only to the most comprehensive of more
>specialized servers, hence easing users' information retrieval).
>In addition to permit search by navigation, a server may also permit
>querying and hence may exploit more specialized servers for that.
>
>I should also note that since in a knowledge server the source/creator
>of each piece of knowledge is stored, knowledge modules can be
>re-generated. Actually, arbitrary complex queries on the knowledge
>(its content plus its creators and their characteristics) can be used
>to generate knowledge modules. However, it is easier and better to make
>additions to the knowledge base of a knowledge server by creating a
>static module (a Web document), submitting it to the server and refining
>it until its content is stable and accepted by the server (and commited
>into its knowledge base) than trying to do incremental on-line additions
>and removals (a loose analogy of that would be trying to develop a large
>shell script via the shell command line, i.e. without text editor).
>Furthermore, the links to those static modules may serve various
>purposes: documentation of the knowledge, regeneration of the knowledge
>base in case it gets corrupted, etc. Thus, modules (distributed static
>files) are useful but their content should be developped and exploited
>via knowledge servers (i.e. some means of centralization) to permit
>knowledge sharing/re-use.
