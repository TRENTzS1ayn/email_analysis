Deborah may know for sure, but I think that the Ontolingua version of ther Gruber physical dimensions and units of measure ontology already has been translated to DAML+OIL and thus should be an easy matter to translate into OWL.  It is another matter to look at the 'mess' the translators may have made :-). It might need a re-think as to how best it might be done in OWL.

Mike

I agree that Gruber's ontology is the place to start.  A useful task would be to render it into OWL in a way most could agree on and post it.  I'm not volunteering for that, although I'd happily comment.

The sort of compromise you suggest seems sane to me and just in need of a tidy up.

Regards

Alan
