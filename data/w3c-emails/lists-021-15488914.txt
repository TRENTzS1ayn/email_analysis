I would prefer the 'abbreviated' version of 
Ntriples that was used in the RDF documentation 
(ie allowing qname forms for URIrefs). This is 
reasonably readable but has the merit that it 
shows exactly the triples in the graph, and 
requires one to be explicit about labelling 
bnodes.

Notations  (like RDF/XML and Turtle) which gather 
together triples with a common subject distort 
the logical form and lead to misunderstandings, 
and in fact seem to me to be less readable than 
'flat' notations which exhibit the graph 
structure more explicitly.

I therefore vote against this motion.

Turtle is neither, seems to me.
