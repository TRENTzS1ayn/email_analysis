Awesome, I've added it to [1] and I've tried to assign it as evidence to 
various requirements.

[1] http://www.w3.org/2003/03/rdf-in-xml.html

Is my assessment with respect to scope correct? Is the RDF/XML about the 
resources it is within? (Or to ask a hairy question, is the RDF/XML about 
the URI that happened to, when resolved, yielded that particular resource?)

I don't follow. Do you mean it can't be validated as XHTML 1.0, or that 
somehow it's impossible to create your own composite DOCTYPE/DTD? (If so, 
how, I'm missing the connection as two why the human *and* machine readable 
description precipitates this.)
