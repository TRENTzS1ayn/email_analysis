Dear all,

[short email, as I'm officially on holiday]

Today W3C has announced the new Semantic Web Activity, including the 
Best Practices Working Group, see:

   http://www.w3.org/2003/12/swa/swbpd-charter

The public mailing list is

   public-swbp-wg@w3.org

with an archive at:

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swbp-wg/

Ralph, could you confirm we should be using this mailing list from now on?

Best, Guus
