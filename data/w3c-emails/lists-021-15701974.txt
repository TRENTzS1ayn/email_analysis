[previous message sent prematurely, my apologies]

Greetings, all.

mailto:public-swbp-wg@w3.org is the mailing list for participants
in the W3C Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment
Working Group.

If you have received this message directly it is because you have
registered as a  "Working Group Participant" for the 4 March 2004
meeting in Mandelieu la Napole during the W3C All Working Group week.
I have populated the distribution list with the addresses of everyone
who has registered as a WG Participant.

This list has a publicly-readable archive in [2].  There were a small
number of messages sent to the list before this one which you
might not have received directly; please check the archive to catch up.

Please know that this Working Group is one of the first to commence
operation under the W3C Patent Policy [1], as approved by the W3C
Membership.  Formally, this Policy comes into action when and if
the Working Group decides to publish Working Drafts on the W3C
Recommendation Track.

The Policy has an impact on us as we start, however.  Participants
must be added to the group by your corresponding Advisory Committee
representative in a two-step process.  In the first of these two steps,
your AC rep agrees on behalf of your organization to the provisions
of the W3C Patent Policy.  In the second step your AC rep adds
individuals as participants.

The Call for Participation in the Working Group is expected to
go out very shortly.  It will be essential that your AC reps follow
the steps described in that Call for Participation before we declare
you formally a WG Participant.  Meanwhile, that will not alter
your ability to participate in the meeting next week.

Thank you for your interest in this important task to further the
Semantic Web and for your forebearance thus far as we get
rolling.

As a reminder, the meeting agenda is [3].
