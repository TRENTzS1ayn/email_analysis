[cc'ed DanC]
I've been thinking/discussing our 3 points and here they are...

[[
hands-on support for developers of Semantic Web applications

o repository of test cases using existing standard vocabularies
  (e.g. healthcare UMLS, OpenGALEN, NCI, ICD9, MeSH, DICOM, HL7, ...)
  also by using an ontology in which one can say things like
  "this is something which is called xyz by that standard/body"

o test results page covering different implementations for
  those test manifests and using a test results ontology with
  a more specific result:output ontology

o X feeds data into Y using controlled vocabulary
  Y performs actions which should be verified
  results are fed back to X using controlled vocabulary
  e.g. physician order entry
]]

but we'll think further :)

If you're willing to do it, I think it's a good idea (well known fact that
"brainstorming" is much better when people have thought about it first).

Hello all

Some comments on the agenda on practical points.

9.15. - 10.00
Introductory round (all participants)

- Would not it be a good idea for each participant to send beforehand a
short introduction and interest focus by e-mail?
BTW will there be any mailing list set for the WG before the F2F?

11.00 - 12.30
Flash talks by participants? Participants are asked to prepare a very short
(5 min) talk on their top-three priority list for this BPD Working
Group(all)

- Why not have those priorities sent beforehand through e-mail, e.g. along
with member introduction? We could have a slide show gathering them, so
that each member will just have to comment on one's three bullet points. I
volunteer to prepare the support, if folks agree on the principle. Would
save time and bring clarity IMO.

Looking forward to see you in Cannes.
