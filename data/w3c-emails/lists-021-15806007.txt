I think my top three are about how to present the semantic web and 
'doing' stuff to people who have taken the conventional library 
approach and think of static cataloguing as some sort of end in itself. 
I'd like to be able to show them that their efforts are able to be 
rewarded by a lot more value added when they can use relationships 
between things.

So I think my top three are about good examples of sem web activity 
that is expressed in language that will make it attractive to people 
who will want their developers to give them the cool functionality - 
and so will help create the context for a lot of the good work that is 
being done.

I am also interested in how we can combine user profiles and interests 
with resource types to provide flavours of information and services 
that suit users. (Accessibility for people with special needs comes 
first here, but it can be extended to everyone, I hope.)
