incase it makes sense to co-locate a f2f with the american association 
for artificial intelligence conference in july in san jose, california 
let me know.
I am program chair this year and could work with aaai to get  a room at 
the conference location if it is during the conference workshop time.
the senior program committee meeting is  this saturday and we will be 
working on logistics and scheduling so if this is desirable, it would be 
useful to know on friday.
I probably will not be on the telecon when you are discussing the next 
f2f as that will be in the middle of the night my time.

Deborah
