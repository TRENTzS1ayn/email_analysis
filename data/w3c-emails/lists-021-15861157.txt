i agree that we should not give instruction from on high.
At the same time, I think it is important to have more examples of how 
ontologies have been written in semantic web languages and used in some 
applications that people might relate to.
We do not need to present the work as religious doctrine  but instead 
present it as something that we have done after considering other 
options, optimally present some other options and say what the tradeoffs 
were, and then give examples from which people might be motivated (or 
even cut and paste) and build their own.

The "living with classic paper"  was a very early attempt to do 
something like this.  It provided a methodology that we used for 
building an ontology that was used in the wine and food domain.

It tried not to say this is the only way or even the best way   but it 
did try to say, here are some tradeoffs and here is what we did and it 
worked.
