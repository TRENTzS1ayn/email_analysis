Thanks Phil, I hadn't noticed that URL before, and my hopes are now dashed 
that some cool solution had appeared that made the RDF validate  -- instead 
of the validator being content negotiated to. <smile/>

Given that I seemed to have assessed your requirements correctly te 
[Trackback] annotations on the requirements stand [1], I hope to gather 
more scenarios/comments from other members of the task force, and also to 
hear back from some HTML folks about possible plans (both short term, and 
potential long term) for addressing some of the requirements.
