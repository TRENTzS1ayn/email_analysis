Right. To clarify my meaning, that 'living with Classic' is exactly 
the kind of thing I meant by 'severely pragmatic' . I agree this kind 
of thing is useful and the more of it we can get (or provide forums 
for people to contribute to) the better. For an example of the kind 
of thing I think isnt so likely to be useful, try reading 
http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mereology/
which is a lovely article on its stated topic but really not a good 
guide to practical ontology-building.

BTW, if anyone wants to debate my opinions on mereology and relevance 
to the SW, lets do it off-line, I suggest (or maybe it could be a 
Task Force??  Nah...)
