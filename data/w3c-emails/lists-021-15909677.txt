Well, its rather vague, but imagine that someone publishes an 
ontology of, say, aircraft, or people, or agent actions and policies, 
and it turns out to be useful so that the concepts in it get used by 
others. Now the originators realize that they want to change 
something. Strict W3C-grade Web etiquette requires that they make no 
change to the document at the published URL. But if they produce a 
new version at a new URL, all the old URIrefs in all the other 
ontologies will need to be upgraded. It seems more reasonable to 
think of a Web ontology as something more like a 'moving resource' 
which can get upgraded from time to time, have bugs fixed, be 
generally made better and so on, and still be the 'same resource' in 
the REST web-architecture sense, just with its state brought up to 
date from time to time. OK, but then what KIND of changes to an 
ontology are reasonable for it to be in some sense the 'same 
ontology' ? Im not sure, but I think the question needs to be 
addressed: and I don't think that 'no changes allowed' is a 
reasonable default. It ought to be more like "barring error 
correction, you can still infer the same stuff you could infer 
before" , maybe. Or perhaps there should be a category of 'moving 
ontology' (? Brentano would have liked this...) which when accessed 
gives you an ontological snapshot of the current state of something 
at the access time (the weather forecast rendered into RDF): those 
would obey different rules as they would be expected to change. (Or 
maybe not: maybe we ought to encourage such moving ontologies to 
invent new properties which once invented are eternal, such as 
...#weather030420041646USCT rather than updating the value of 
#weather, so that a moving ontology is always seen as a growing 
ontology, at least conceptually(?) .)  Maybe there are other kinds 
that one would expect to obey still different rules.  And so on. In 
general, there ought to be something identifiable as 'the intended 
meaning' of the ontology which is stable in some sense and which is 
what one can reasonably expect a given URI to go on identifying. 
This certainly isn't the syntactic form of the document, and it isn't 
going to be the strict model-theoretic interpretation in all cases, 
either. I'm not sure what it is, but I have a hunch we need to figure 
it out well enough to write best practice guides to it.
