Dear Guus Schreiber,

in the charter of the W3C Best Practice working group I find:

The Working Group may choose to create or contribute to an index of:
links to course materials
links to introductory texts: e.g. "Ontologies for Dummies"
collections of worked-out examples, covering a broad range of fields
pointers to knowledge-elicitation techniques

I draw your attention to my recent working paper

http://www.ipsi.fraunhofer.de/~fischer/NCIReview18Feb04.pdf

Its title is
?    Converting a Thesaurus to OWL: Notes on the Paper ?The National
Cancer Institute's Thesaurus and Ontology?

Perhaps that may contribute to some of the aims cited  above.
I write to you, following a suggestion of Carole Goble.

Regards
D. Fischer
