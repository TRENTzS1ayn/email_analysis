I'm actually inclined to a bottom-up approach...
(grass doesn't grow by pulling at it...)
Taking common/proven cases and semwebize them shows
what kind of additional cases can be made explicit
and so "you can still infer the same stuff you could
infer before" but you could also have the benefit of
additional inferences.
