I took an action to explain methods of dealing with attachments etc in W3C
lists.

The following describes some policy,

http://www.w3.org/2002/03/email_attachment_formats.html

which in summary is

  plain text is best
  html or xhtml is second best


The harder case that is not explained in full is what do you do when you
have content in some proprietary format, particularly if the files are
large.
e.g. I had a document in a proprietary format that I wished to send to the
www-rdf-interest list.

Step 1) Create a PDF (if necessary this might been creating a postscript
file and then converting that with ghostview)

Step 2) send PDF as attachment to www-archive@w3.org
This mailing list is public but no natural subscribers, and is intended for
large attachments, amongst other purposes.

Step 3) Find URL of attachement by looking at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/

Step 4) Send URL to the intended mailing list e.g. see
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2004Feb/0231

where I note the long URL got mangled ...

Reviewing the policy I probably could have created an xhtml version with
only a little more effort than the PDF and that would have been better.

It is particularly important to use this technique of sending to www-archive
when the attachment is large.

If you wish to send something with member confidentiality to a public list
the same technique can be used by sending to w3c-archive@w3.org which is
archived at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-archive/

If you have a complex set of interlinked files in the same directory it is
possible to send them all as attachments to www-archive and the links will
be maintained. Example is:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2004Feb/att-0071/
