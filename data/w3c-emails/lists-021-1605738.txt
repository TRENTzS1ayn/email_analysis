You mean the -- ironically enough -- comment about escaping ampersands?

  <p>Phil, since this is slightly on topic: EntryEditLink now escapes 
  the &'s to &amp;'s.  Hope this helps.</p>

The wdg validator didn't complain about that either, but Amaya did.

One of my concerns is that this discussion can get a little weird (e.g., 
removing RDF just for the sake of the validator). Isn't the validator a 
means to an end and not an end in and of itself? But that then begs your 
question of "what kind of validity" we are talking about.... We want 
conformance to specifications for the sake of interoperability and 
consistent/good user experiences across environments. Without tipping into 
philosophical questions about conformance, a pragmatic take is to at least 
improve the present situation (e.g., permitting rdf-in-XHTML, making it 
easy to find bugs in one's html, app interop, and ensuring consistent 
experiences for the user).

Regardless, in [1] we have some requirements, and a few scenarios, and I'm 
also hoping to here what sort of potential solutions the HTML community is 
thinking about. What's the status of Steven's proposal, or your non-DTD 
work? Any chance that would be adopted? If so, why not? (I think at the 
plenary Steven mentioned something about a lack of internal user defined 
entity support?)
