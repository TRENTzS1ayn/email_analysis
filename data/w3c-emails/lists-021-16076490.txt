At the F2F I said something about liking a WD before publishing a note.

It was minuted thus in the log:

http://www.w3.org/2004/03/05-swbp-irc#T13-59-18
[... discussion of publication of WD then Note... patent implications of
WDs...]

I withdraw my comments concerning IPR.
I retain the desire that there be a clear point for public review of the
documents we publish.

(I am advised that what I said was incorrect legally ...)

Sorry for any confusion.

Jeremy
