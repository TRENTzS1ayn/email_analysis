All

1) I'd support Natasha's suggestion.  I agree we can't come down from on 
high, but having just taught a course in using OWL, there are many 
common errors - in the sense that people don't actually succeed in 
representing what they intended to and can't understand the result. 
 There are also some patterns that work well and produce modular 
ontologies, some that seem to work for a while and then break down (e.g. 
using universal restrictions rather than existential restrictions), and 
others that are just plain surprising.

Judging frmo the semantic web list there are also questions about how to 
represent things that keep coming up again and again.  We need to get a 
way of presenting issues and options for addressing them.

We'll try to get some of the stuff out for comment.

2) The second thing I want is lists of tools with comments and ideas for 
new tools.  This is quite deliberately self serving.  We are working on 
new tools in conjunction with Stanford - see the OWL plugin on 
protege.stanford.edu-->plugins-->backends and the www.co-ode.org 
websites for the first results.

We'll try to get some of the stuff out for comment.

Regards

Alan
