I think the latter of these two (i.e. the questions that keep coming 
up) are the really important ones to work out..  I agree w/Pat that 
we need to be very careful or we will teach how to build non-Semantic 
Web ontologies fooling ourselves into thinking that the linking isn't 
important (or is somehow bad) and etc.  My instinct is if we start by 
keeping things pretty simple and teaching the representational stuff 
a little at a time, we'll end up in pretty good shape.

well, as long as thing are open this could be okay -- but remember 
that if you try to keep out my tools, I'll try to keep out yours (and 
then multiply this by a hundred) -- we need to make sure that we're 
not trying to procribe rather than teach
