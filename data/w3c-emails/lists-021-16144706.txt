I agree that we shouldn't be making or considering changes to OWL in this 
WG, however it is important to point out representational limitations of 
OWL and how (when possible) to work around them - agreed?

Re: Qualified Cardinality Constraints








I am uncomfortable with the idea that the SWBPD group is an appropriate 
forum for revisiting language design issues.

For example, I am looking at some of the RDF design issues in the 
*interest* group, with an expectation that if successful these 
explorations 
might hit the standards track in a number of years ...

I also suspect that we can get a wider uptake of SemWeb technology my 
focusing on easy cases to do with correct use of RDF and RDFS rather than 
spending too much time and effort on more sophisticated aspects of the 
best 
use of OWL. I suspect there is a lot of common ground in best practice 
across the range of SW technologies.


My view is that the QCC issue is best left until an OWL2 WG, which will be 

much more likely if the SWBPD WG succeeds in getting OWL and RDF to be 
widely adopted.
