Alan, Pat,

At the f2f, we formed a task force within the working group called 
"Ontology Patterns and Engineering" (OPEN) which will focus on publishing 
ontology design patterns and general "meta ontological" (for lack of a 
better term) design principles (the notion of a "backbone taxonomy" for 
example).  Current members are Deborah McGuinness, Aldo Gangemi, Oscar 
Corcho, and Mike Uschold.  And me.

We agreed at the f2f to TRY and put [OPEN] in the subject line for task 
force communication, and members will be expected to write and review some 
patterns/design principles.

I think you two would be very good additions to the group.  I'm not sure 
there is any formal membership process for task forces (Guus - is 
there???), but I suppose it would be useful for us to know who considers 
themselves to be participants - so please let us know if you'll join.

-Chris
