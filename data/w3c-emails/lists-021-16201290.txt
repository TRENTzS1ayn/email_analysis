I meant to add:
 
Meta-ontological analysis and design principles are one important aspect
of ontology engineering, but not the only one. There are plenty of other
issues regarding how to go about building ontologies. They can be
broadly categorized into how to build *better* ontologies (which is what
the meta-ontological stuff does), but there are other guidelines which
may help to build the same quality ontology, in a better way (say
faster).  This is a question of scope for this effort.

Alan, Pat, 

At the f2f, we formed a task force within the working group called
"Ontology Patterns and Engineering" (OPEN) which will focus on
publishing ontology design patterns and general "meta ontological" (for
lack of a better term) design principles (the notion of a "backbone
taxonomy" for example).  Current members are Deborah McGuinness, Aldo
Gangemi, Oscar Corcho, and Mike Uschold.  And me. 

We agreed at the f2f to TRY and put [OPEN] in the subject line for task
force communication, and members will be expected to write and review
some patterns/design principles. 

I think you two would be very good additions to the group.  I'm not sure
there is any formal membership process for task forces (Guus - is
there???), but I suppose it would be useful for us to know who considers
themselves to be participants - so please let us know if you'll join.
