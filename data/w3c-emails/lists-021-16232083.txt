As decided during Cannes meeting, below is a draft message proposal to be
sent by SWBPD WG to the standard body in charge of Topic Maps standard,
namely ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG3.
See http://www.isotopicmaps.org for more information about this WG.

The message is specific, but my view is that it could be used as a
'template' for dealing with other groups, organizations or communities,
when we think their work is relevant to the SW, and would like to trigger a
process of collaboration.

on behalf of W3C Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment WG

To : ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG3

Gentlemen

The new W3C Working Group 'Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment' [1]
has put Topic Maps on the list of (many) legacy and technologies that it
would like to be made
interoperable with the Semantic Web infrastructure and languages.
For those technologies, the SWBPD WG purpose is to identify and promote
best practices for interoperability.
The intended process needs to involve participation of qualified experts,
assuming organizations and communities of users have expressed interest in
the Semantic Web initiative.

Relevant preliminary work has been made in recent years in the TM
community, including various proposals for TM-RDF mapping. But this work
has never been endorsed by any of relevant standard organizations (W3C and
ISO).

This message is intended to trigger a process in this direction, provided
you agree on :

- A common declaration of interest in collaboration at the organizational
level, respectively W3C SWBPD and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG3. ( Consider this
declaration is made from our side through the present message. )

- Definition of a task force, including people proposed by ISO/IEC
JTC1/SC34/WG3 as invited experts.
This task force would have as first objective to deliver a Technical Note
on best practices for TM-SW interoperability, endorsed by both W3C and ISO.

We are looking forward for a positive feedback.

Regards

Remarks:

- A TM-RDF workshop mentioned by DanBri during Cannes meeting
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/events/2004-tmrdf/
could it be used as a place to kick-off this process ?

- The most relevant expert in RDF-TM interoperability is AFAIK Lars Marius
Garshol
See : "Living with topic maps and RDF"
http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tmrdf.html

- Some personal contribution can be found in the paper
"Ontology-driven topic maps" I will present next month at XML Europe
