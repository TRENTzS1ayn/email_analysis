stylistically this is more formal than I would have made it, but that's no 
big deal ...

I am not entirely comfortable with the word 'endorsed' used twice - I am 
not at all sure that any of our WG Notes constitute endorsement by the W3C. 
My understanding is that the Rec track process is for that.

Suggest the following changes:

1) delete sentence

[[
But this work has never been endorsed by any of relevant standard 
organizations (W3C and ISO).
]]

(Or alternatively replace 'endorsed' by 'followed through')


2) modify
[[
  endorsed by both W3C and ISO.
]]
to
[[
   potentially jointly published by both W3C and ISO.
]]
