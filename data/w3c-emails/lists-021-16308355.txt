I share the concern about the 'OPEN' acronym. People will surely forget
to use [], so it might be a good idea to change the acronym to say:
OEDP Ontology Engineering Design Patterns  or OEP: Ontology Engineering
and Patterns

Yes.  I am very interested.  In fact I am trying to write up our
teaching  experience in terms of "issues", "patterns" and "operations"
as we speak and getting together a Manchester effort to pool our
teaching experience. 
I agree with Chris that I would prefer to avoid "Meta-ontology" which
risks being seen, or worse becoming, too abstracted 
Also, trivia - OPEN is a great acronym, but on its own it risks being
filtered by headers for other open source lists unless we are sure we
stick to "[OPEN]" in the subject header with both square brackets.
Without the square brackets it's likely to get lost.

Alan, Pat, 
At the f2f, we formed a task force within the working group called
"Ontology Patterns and Engineering" (OPEN) which will focus on
publishing ontology design patterns and general "meta ontological" (for
lack of a better term) design principles (the notion of a "backbone
taxonomy" for example).  Current members are Deborah McGuinness, Aldo
Gangemi, Oscar Corcho, and Mike Uschold.  And me. 
We agreed at the f2f to TRY and put [OPEN] in the subject line for task
force communication, and members will be expected to write and review
some patterns/design principles. 
I think you two would be very good additions to the group.  I'm not sure
there is any formal membership process for task forces (Guus - is
there???), but I suppose it would be useful for us to know who considers
themselves to be participants - so please let us know if you'll join.
