Hello,

As it has been said during the meeting this is a mail to inform the WG
that i won't participate in the next telecon.

Even It's not yet 100% sure (so it's subject to change), I think it's better to say this now than a the last moment.

Thank you for your understanding,

Best regards

MArco NANNI
