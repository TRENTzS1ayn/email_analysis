[Deb, don't look]

I am ostensibly on the organizing committee of a AAAI workshop on 
"ONtologies and controlled vocabularies".  The topic is not actually 
something I'm active in myself, but it appears to have been a bit too 
narrow for sufficient participation at AAAI, and the organizers have 
decided to broaden the scope in order to gain enough participants to hold 
a workshop.

If you are interested and willing to attend AAAI, let me know.
