Mimasa, thank you for the informative email!

Do you mean technically, or from an ecology point of view? If I understood 
Sean's proposal in [a] it appearred possible to write a RDF-in-XHTML DTD 
Modularization. It's unsavory, from an ecology point of view, because one 
doesn't want to do this for every XML combination. However, in the shorter 
term, this task force needn't solve that larger problem. Could the W3C 
issue a RDF+XHTML DTD modularization while we also worked on a solution to 
the larger problem?

That is certainly cool.

Cool too!

Do you mean DSDL VCSL would provide a better solution to the "semantics" 
problem? If so, I've looked at [a] and don't follow.

I looked at [12] and wasn't sure what you meant, and searched for "recurs" 
and "nest" and didn't see the relevant text?

If that's an unrelated problem, all the better (keeps things simple), but my 
understanding was that the XHTML community would resist XML Schema 
proposals, akin to what you've already proposed [5] and stated "For XHTML 
2, I have hope". So I'm trying to understand how well grounded that hope is 
and if there's technical objections to it. <smile/>
