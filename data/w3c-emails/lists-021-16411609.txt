There is no action item for another telecon time.
7am pacific time will not work for me and I expect for most people on 
the west coast of the united states.
That is a problem since I am co-leading one of the task forces and i 
would like to continue doing that.

I sent email to the list about this yesterday which was the first time 
there was anything on the list about this time but i do not see it on 
the agenda to collect conflicts/suggestions for telecon time.

I will am willing to collect email conflicts.
I also made a proposal since there is a fair amount of overlap with the 
webont group and that group is winding down its needs for telecons to 
consider taking over that telecon timeslot.  that is 9am pacific of 
17:00 UTC on thursdays.  if Thursday does not work, how about other days 
of the week at this time?

thanks,
deborah
