Hello all,

Since we missed the kick-off in Cannes, I'd like to introduce myself and 
my CWI colleague by email.  My name is Jacco van Ossenbruggen, and I'm 
affiliated with CWI, the Dutch national research center on computer 
science and mathematics, Amsterdam.  I've a background in document 
engineering and was a member of the W3C SYMM WG during the development 
of SMIL 1.0 and SMIL 2.0.

My colleague Frank Nack will serve as my alternate (starting with 
tomorrow's telecon).  Frank has a background in computational semiotics 
and got his PhD on automatic generation of humorous film sequences 
(think of the meta data involved in that project :-).  Frank also served 
on the MPEG-7 committee, where he was one of the architects of the DDL 
(Data Description Language).

I hope Frank and I can contribute to this working group in the area of 
best practices for, and deployment of multimedia annotations and 
intelligent media applications. We also look forward to work with Marco 
on the SemWeb/MPEG link.

Regards, Jacco van Ossenbruggen
