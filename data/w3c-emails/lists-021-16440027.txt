This was a difficult issue because we have members from the extreme points 
on the globe (Australia, Japan, California), and there was no time that 
worked for everyone.  There was only one west coast representative there 
at the time, Mike Uschold.  I was sitting next to him and my sense was 
that he was resigned to agree that this time was simply the best choice 
given the constraints.  It is midnite for Japanese and Australian 
participants, so making it any later forces them into the AM hours.

The decision was to try this time for two months and see how it works.

Re: ALL: agenda 18 March telecon







There is no action item for another telecon time.
7am pacific time will not work for me and I expect for most people on 
the west coast of the united states.
That is a problem since I am co-leading one of the task forces and i 
would like to continue doing that.

I sent email to the list about this yesterday which was the first time 
there was anything on the list about this time but i do not see it on 
the agenda to collect conflicts/suggestions for telecon time.

I will am willing to collect email conflicts.
I also made a proposal since there is a fair amount of overlap with the 
webont group and that group is winding down its needs for telecons to 
consider taking over that telecon timeslot.  that is 9am pacific of 
17:00 UTC on thursdays.  if Thursday does not work, how about other days 
of the week at this time?

thanks,
deborah
