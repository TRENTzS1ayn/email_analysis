Here is a new version of the draft message, taking into account Jeremy's remarks
about abuse of 'endorsed'. See original message for context.

Gentlemen

The new W3C Working Group 'Semantic Web Best Practices and Deployment' [1]
has put Topic Maps on the list of (many) legacy and technologies that it
would like to be made interoperable with the Semantic Web infrastructure and languages.
For those technologies, the SWBPD WG purpose is to identify and promote
best practices for interoperability.
The intended process needs to involve participation of qualified experts,
assuming organizations and communities of users have expressed interest in
the Semantic Web initiative.

Relevant preliminary work has been made in recent years in the TM
community, including various proposals for TM-RDF mapping, but this work
has not been formally followed-up by any of the relevant standard organizations 
(W3C and ISO).

This message is intended to trigger a process in this direction, provided
you agree on :

- A common declaration of interest in collaboration at the organizational
level, respectively W3C SWBPD and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG3. ( Consider this
declaration is made from SWBPD side through the present message. )

- Definition of a task force, including people proposed by ISO/IEC
JTC1/SC34/WG3 as invited experts.
This task force would have as first objective to deliver a Technical Note
on best practices for TM-SW interoperability, 
potentially jointly published by both W3C and ISO.

We are looking forward for a positive feedback.
