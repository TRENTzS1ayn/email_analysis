A possible example issue/ use case has shown up in www-rdf-comments [1], 
which I've summarized in [2] and tentately suggested might be of 
interest to this WG.

I'd like to check whether folks think the SWBPD WG the best place to own 
this specific issue, and others of a similar ilk?

But more relevant to this agenda item, would we envisage setting up a 
task force to deal with each incoming issue?  Are task forces to 
accepted issues 1-1?  If not, we'll need a mechanism to track issues as 
well as task forces.
