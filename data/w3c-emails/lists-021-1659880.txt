Sorry, I was traveling for an HTML WG FtF meeting and couldn't read
e-mail regularly.

Both.

Note that I was specifically talking about RDF/XML, as defined by
the RDF/XML Syntax Specification.  It is apparent that the current
RDF/XML syntax is not fully expressible by DTD nor XML Schema, and
the RDF Core WG seems to have rejected the XML Schema WG's comments
to develop a single canonical syntax which could be more XML Schema
or DTD friendly [13] as "beyond the scope of RDF Core's current
charter".  So, I see no chance to define a generic RDF/XML DTD, in
which case there's no chance to define a generic RDF/XML-in-XHTML DTD.

Of course, if we agree to restrict the syntax of the XML serialization
of RDF, we could define something, as Sean illustrated.  But it's not
RDF/XML as currently defined.

That largely depends on the RDF Core WG.  The HTML WG can offer help
to combine DTD modules, once an RDF DTD module becomes available.
However, the HTML WG is not the right group to decide which sort of
(restricted) serialization format for RDF is appropriate.  We need
input from RDF folks.

No, it won't solve the "semantics" problem, either.  The scope of DSDL
VCSL is validation only.  But DSDL VCSL could give us possibility to
use different kind of schema languages for different "islands" of
a document, e.g. RELAX NG for XHTML 2 part and RDF Schema for RDF part,
as opposed to an XML Schema-based approach, which requires all schemata
need to be written in XML Schema.

James Clark's recent Namespace Routing Language (NRL) [14] proposal is
an another input to DSDL VCSL, and a sample implementation in Jing now
supports RELAX NG, XML Schema and Schematron, which is a good step
forward.  I'll show you NRL-based approach in a separate message.

Look at the abstract definition.  The content model is now something like
this, which means a meta element can include one or more meta elements
(note: this is not DTD-compatible syntax).

    ( ( PCDATA | Inline )* | meta+ )

"meta and RDF" section will be updated when we (presumably this TF)
decide an appropriate way to serialize RDF through this syntax.
But remember, this is for XHTML 2.0.  There's no plan to do something
similar for earlier versions.

It's not an unrelated problem, but a separate problem.  Most things are
more or less related, and we cannot solve all the problems at once.
We don't necessarily have to satisfy everyone by only one solution.

Technically it is still possible to "use" character entities together
with XML Schema or other schema languages, independent from a particular
document type definition, as noted in "An XML Core WG View" [15].

For XHTML 2, no way to get away from XML Schema.  We've also adopted
RELAX NG as well, and there might be a good chance to give up DTD, as
I'm pretty sure that there're quite a few aspects of XHTML 2.0 which
DTD cannot express, and having a DTD for XHTML 2.0 would be rather
harmful than helpful.  Even if we (well, *I*, as an editor) provide
something, I seriously doubt its normative status.  You might still
have some possibility to use character entities, but that should be
separated from the document type definition.
