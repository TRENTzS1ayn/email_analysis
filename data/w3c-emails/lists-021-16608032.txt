Hello all,

My name is David Norheim from Asemantics S.R.L [1], a European start-up 
focusing on Semantic Web technologies and solutions with offices in 
Italy, the Netherlands and Norway. I will be involved in this working 
group from our company. Currently I am based close to Milan, but 
alternating to Scandinavia.

We joined W3C just in time for the Cannes meeting, and therefore I have 
not been involved so far, however some of you may have met my colleague 
Dirk W. van Gulik from us at the Cannes meeting.

I am from Norway, and my background is in masters in 
engineering/computer science focusing on Web technology since 1996, 
working as a consultant at Cap Gemini, researcher for Joint Research 
Center (JRC) of EC and as a Market and Technology advisor for the 
Norwegian government and industry based in San Francisco. I have worked 
on federated databases, GIS, earth observation, near-real-time Web 
information aggregation and Web services.

Asemantics has participated in various Semantic Web. We recently became 
a W3C member and are participating in this WG as well as the Data 
Access WG. We have a very pragmatic view on the Semantic Web and have 
already deployed several project to major clients using SW 
technologies. We have also got a lot of experience from the business 
case of Semantic Web. We would like to share our experience with other 
people in the Working Group.

I'm looking forward to participating, and starting with the 
teleconference today. My colleague, Dirk W. van Gulik, will serve as 
alternate.

best regards,
David
