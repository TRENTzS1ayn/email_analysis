My earlier introduction when I joined RDF Core in Aug 2001 can be found here:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2001Aug/0075

Since then I have been fairly heavily involved with the Semantic Web activity 
in the W3C, being co-editor of RDF Concepts and OWL Test Cases.

I have championed internationalization issues in both groups.

On the development side I have contributed the Jena OWL Syntax Checker, and 
been one of the architects of Jena2. These are described in the following two 
technical reports:

http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2003/HPL-2003-146.html

I have also done work on RDF Canonicalization.

I am currently working on named graphs, which I presented at the Semantic Web 
interest group meeting:

I live in Italy where I am a visiting researcher at CNR (Pisa)
