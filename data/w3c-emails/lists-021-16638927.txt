Hi all,

I wasn't able to be at the tech plenary, so I'd like to introduce myself to
those WG members who I haven't met previously.

I'm a researcher on the Advanced Knowledge Technologies[1] (AKT) project at the
University of Southampton. AKT's goal is the development of technologies and
techniques for knowledge management, particularly within an organisational
context. My work has focussed on the use of SW technologies to this end; as part
of this, I have been involved in the construction of a large-scale SW
application, CS AKTive Space[2], and was a member of the W3C WebOnt WG[3].

My background is in knowledge- and agent-based systems, and I have a strong
related research interest in Web-based open hypermedia systems

My alternate is likely to be Steve Harris, who will be representing the
University of Southampton on the RDF Data Access WG.
