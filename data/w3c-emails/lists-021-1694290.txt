Accepted.

My sense in talking to RDF folks is that no new syntaxes (even restricted 
profiles?) should be expected, but perhaps they could correct me.

Understood.

Right, and it appears they have "postponed" the "canonical serialization" 
issue:

Ah, I hadn't noticed that before. Did the HTML WG respond? The Core position 
relies upon the presence of a DTD, "The existing mechanism, DTDs, is 
entirely adequate to the purpose. " [15] Of course, if you don't want to 
use a DTD, they don't address the issue.
