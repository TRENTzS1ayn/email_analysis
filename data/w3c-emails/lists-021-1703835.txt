That's my feeling, too.  Therefore, if "the RDF MUST NOT have to be
reformatted from RDF/XML" is still a requirement and if they still
want some kind of validation, we are stuck in a difficult situation.

One caution on this message is that the HTML WG will NOT define
generic syntax.  That's beyond the scope of the HTML WG charter, too.
Our scope is restricted to improve the meta element in XHTML 2.0,
and nothing more.  It *could* be used to encode RDF in XHTML 2.0, but
expressing every possible RDF with this syntax may not be the goal.
Abstract section of the XHTML 2.0 spec clearly says as follows [16]:

   ... it does not attempt to be all things to all people, supplying
   every possible markup idiom, but to supply a generally useful set
   of elements.

We'd try to satisfy 80% of people's typical needs with simple markup.
Supporting every possible corner case is not our design goal.  And
again, this is for XHTML 2.0, not for earlier versions.

Quoting Ann Navarro, we are "so glad that they can declare things with
such absoluteness" [17].  It's like saying "existing methods suffice
to put RDF in XHTML, there is absolutely no need to introduce a new
mechanism".  We can solve the problem by declaring that there's no
problem.  You can read through the public responses to their "view"
on XML-DEV, starting from John Cowan's announcement [18].
