Ok, hopefully the RDF folks are paying attention. <smile/>

Entities and well-formed internal subset parsing are a place where I easily 
get confused, so I:
1. added my own entity declaration (<!ENTITY ent1 "Hello">) and used it 
(&ent1) in an xhtml document; your schema considered the instance valid.
2. used an entity (&ent2) in an xhtml document that wasn't declared; your 
schema *still* considered it valid.

Of course, I'm not convinced that the Schema Validator's parser actually 
considered my entities actual entities, but I'm surprised both documents 
were considered valid... (I suppose my confusion relates to Schema's lack 
of "support" of entities: does that mean it will consider them invalid (I 
now think not) or it simply considers them to be character data?)

Regardless, in trying to track what's still going on:
1. Just last month the Schema WG asked about using schema for 'XHTML + 
MathML + SVG Profile' and you responded there's reluctance because of a 
lack of entity support in Schema:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html-editor/2003AprJun/0085.html
2. However, you've also noted that XHTML2.0 will be using Schema?

If I understand that correctly, are these reconciled in an expectation that 
something will come along as you work on XHTML2.0 that will provide you 
with an equivalent of entities?
