<sound_of_rdf_person_waking_up/>

Huh. Hmm. wazzat? Did someone mention RDF? ;)

My understanding that we already have a generic metadata syntax, ie. RDF/XML;
I'm hoping we'll find a way to allow XHTML 2.0 documents to be enthusiatically
deployed with embedded islands of full RDF/XML (eg. in a <meta/> 
element or elsewhere), rather than have to wait for XHTML 3.0. 

Is that a reasonable goal? The NRL demos seem to be heading in that
direction...
