It really depends on how exactly you wrote your document.  If you didn't
include any document type declaration and used an undefined entity,
it's not a validity error, but a well-formedness error.

That's a secondary issue, and largely because of MathML, which has
much larger collection of character entities than XHTML.  The same
reasoning doesn't necessarily apply to RDF or XHTML 2.0.

I've been arguing to drop mandatory support for character entities
(and mandatory requirement to include a document type declaration
in a strictly conforming XHTML 2.0 document) from XHTML 2.0 for
a long time, partly because I believe supporting RDF is more
important than requiring support for a fixed set of character
entities.  It's been a long debate, and I have to say I'm not on
the majority side.

At the very least entitiy definitions should be separated from grammar
definitions.  Using a document type declaration doesn't necessarily
mean you have to use a specific document type definition.
