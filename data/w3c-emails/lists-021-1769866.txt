b. is a non-starter at all.  Unlike HTML 4, the content model of
the script element in XHTML 1.* is #PCDATA.

I have XHTML schemata in RELAX NG and already demonstrated an MNS schema
for XHTML2+MathML+SVG+EGIX+ContactXML+HLink+RDF+XMLCharEnt.

  cf. http://www.w3.org/People/mimasa/test/schemas/rng/hybrid.mns

It's fairly easy to write up an XHTML 1.* version instead of XHTML 2,
probably using NRL instead of MNS.

Actually I would say specifying an "open" schema is a bit tricky issue.
You have to specify exactly where you want to allow extensions, and
that needs careful consideration.  Personally I'd much prefer opening
up a closed schema through NRL or something similar.

More precisely it will be defined by the abstract definition and may be
implemented in various schema languages, including XML Schema.

We've already normatively adopted RELAX NG for XHTML 2.0, partly because
RDF/XML was only defined in RELAX NG.
