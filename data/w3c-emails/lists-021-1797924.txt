I mean a consensus on behalf of that community has failed to materialize.

I'm not sure what you mean by "scenarios", I'd consider them "approaches", 
but to enumerate how one might implement the validators for various 
approaches:

1. My experimental validator uses Sun's Multischema Validator to validate a 
test Creative Commons page. This will go away at some point.
http://policy.w3.org/xsd-xhtml1-validate
http://policy.w3.org/cgi/xsd-xhtml1-validate?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpolicy.w3.org%2Ftest-cc.html

2. Now that I've learned about the most recent XSV update, the XSV validator 
can also easily validate instances against the XHTML(valid)+RDF(lax) 
schema. This is nice because we wouldn't have to set up or maintain any new 
service.

3. The more rigorous XHTML(valid)+RDF(valid) would need a Web Service 
implemented on Jing. The latest Jing supports RNG, XML Schema (via a 
Xerces-J wrapper), Schematron and NRL. This would give more power, but NRL 
isn't mature yet (it's a proposal to a ISO Committee) and means that we 
have to maintain it as a service.
