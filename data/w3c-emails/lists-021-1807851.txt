I agree that we should punt on this. However I'll note that this will mean 
that we don't support the Trackback scenario of associating metadata with 
fragment identifiers. But that's a really complex architectural issue and 
it just means a Trackback needs to specify/understand its RDF in XHTML 
context, it won't be inherent to the XML itself -- yet.

I'll also note that it still also leaves the question of which of the 
following [1] do we support:
 3. Scope
  a. The RDF MUST be semantically context free and inherits no
     context from its container document. (If it is metadata about
     that document, it should state rdf:about="".)
  b. The RDF MUST apply only to its containing document. [FOAF]

The DC approaches that Dave discussed seem to be of type "b", but I don't 
think that will be good in the arbitrary RDF case, where it's much better 
to be explicit if I have "non-flat" assertions. I'd advocate for A. What do 
you think?
