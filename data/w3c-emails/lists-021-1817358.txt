Thanks Dave, I've tried to reflect this in:
  $Revision: 1.22 $ on $Date: 2003/06/26 20:47:28 $ GMT 
  http://www.w3.org/2003/03/rdf-in-xml.html

My reading of you email didn't focus on the scenario so much as the fact 
that the scenario of "flat" meta-data has already been addressed, so that 
really shouldn't be the requirement that we constrain ourselves to. I've 
also tried to reflect some tweaks from our phone discussion but I probably 
failed in many bits (the validation axes is still awkward). So suggestions 
are still welcome. The document is also now updated to account for the 
discussion on the list, with the potential deliverables and dominate 
requirements tweaked accordingly.
