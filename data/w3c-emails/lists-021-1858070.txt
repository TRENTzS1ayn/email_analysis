Well, we might have a XHTML+RDF document type by then! <smile/> But since 
we're on the topic, we've been trying to understand the various 
requirements of the scenarios, an in CC's case, are your properties "flat"? 
If so, why didn't you use the meta encoding techniques that Dave described 
[1]? For example,

<link rel="schema.cc" href="http://web.resource.org/cc/"/>
<meta 
  name="cc:license"
  content="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/legalcode">
