Dan, during the Semweb CG call today [1] you expressed an interest in the 
RDF+XHTML document type specifying (1) how the RDF is extracted from the 
XHTML and (2) that the validation service yield triples. This exceeds the 
present "dominant" requirement that "The RDF metadata  MUST be well-formed 
XML but need not be valid XML (RDF validation is left to the discretion of 
the RDF application.)"

Did I understand you correctly, and if so can you speak to the motivation 
for your requirement or provide any pointers to how such a validator could 
be layered on top of [3] -- if you are familiar with it?
