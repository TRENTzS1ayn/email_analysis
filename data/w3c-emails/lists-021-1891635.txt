Mimasa,

In [1] you noted that the XHTML specification alludes to a "not-so-strictly" 
conforming XHTML document, of which the RDF-in-XHTML might be of. Just to 
be clear, I would presume that we do not use any new namespaces (that would 
be an annoying), but I was wondering then how does one distinguish between 
such conformance levels? Do you expect there should be a new FPI? I noted 
that [2] provides "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0 plus SVG 1.1//EN". 
But that is a case of [3] and we aren't doing XHTML DTD-based 
modularization...?
