Maintaining Activity:  Semantic Web CG[1] and HTML WG[2]


Purpose:

    The task of the RDF in XHTML Taskforce is to:

State requirements for representing metadata in RDF within an
        XHTML document.

Evaluate proposed solutions against those requirements.

Recommend to the HTML CG and the SW CG how to proceed to achieve a
        common, widely accepted way of representing RDF metadata within an
        XHMTL document.


The task force is expected to report 2 months after it begins. Discussions
of the task force will be public. The chair of the task force is Joseph
Reagle. Membership of the task force is open to all those interested in
facilitating the above tasks.
