The list exists! [1] I know folks are busy with conferences and travelling 
this week, so I'd like to propose the following. By the end of next week 
(May 30) have a look at the (rather small) requirementsin [2] with an eye 
towards:
A. Did I miss a requirement axis completely?
B. Should a requirement be introduced that opposes another?
C. Do you have scenarios or evidence that an existing requirement should be 
dominant or deprecated over opposing requirements?
D. Are you aware of an activity or specification that will soon satisfy an 
existing requirement?

Also, let me know if you need more time, but at the end of this kickoff, I'd 
like to be confident we have a good understanding of the requirements and 
their characteristics (e.g., "weight", evidence, proposals, etc.). Thanks!

BTW: I haven't done a big recruiting campaign for list membership yet. I'm 
happy to keep it relatively small (again for requirements and dependencies) 
at the start, but if you know someone who might be willing to volunteer, 
please let me know. Present list membership is:

 bwm@hplb.hpl.hp.com

* I will be travelling May 22/23, and attending OSCOM3 May 28-30. 
I will not be as responsive during these periods but will 
respond to any email as soon as possible upon my return.
