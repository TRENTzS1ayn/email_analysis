Hi,

While the HTML WG is working on how to deal with combining DTD and
Schemas for validation (cf  Hypertext CG minutes of Oct 27 [1],
Member-only), I propose that we start to look at a possible solution
involving XSLT to embed RDF inside XHTML, as proposed earlier by Dan
Connolly.

In that purpose, I have started a rough draft of a possible
specification of such a system:
http://www.w3.org/2003/11/rdf-in-xhtml-proposal
with a demonstration of the system at:
http://www.w3.org/2003/11/rdf-in-xhtml-demo

While the draft has already a few identified issues, I'm mostly
interested on feedback on the idea as a whole, namely:
- does the group think it is worth pursuing it?
- which requirements/use cases are not addressed by this solution?

DanC, since this is based on the proposal you made, I'm especially
interested in your feedback.
