Aside, from the architectural issues of composing XML and DTD/schema stuff, 
DanC's proposal really did grow on me as the best pragmatic offering. My 
primary question was would RDF applications be willing to take this 
requirement on? 

Also, does an XHTML document only get one profile? Perhaps its best not to 
grab that attribute if not necessary? Via the XSLT 1.0 or other versions, 
I'd say 1.0 for simplicity, but the mechanism could also be generic (akin 
to xmldsig transormations, but I'd recommend against that).
