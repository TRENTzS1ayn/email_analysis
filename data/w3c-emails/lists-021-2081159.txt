The proposal's looking very nice, although unfortunately I can't get the
demo to work (or Dan's CC example). It would be helpful to have a few more
examples of source XHTML (alongside extracted RDF) to see what's going on.

Yep. My guess is the 80% stuff would be shallow trees about the XHTML doc
itself - authorship (DC, FOAF?), rights (CC) and bibliographic info (DC)
standing out. An interesting use case might be fleshing out the metadata of
the bibliography of a paper, so the embedded RDF is a slightly deeper
structure (random thought - could citation anchors in the page be recycled
somehow?).

Given the power of XSLT, I suppose potentially *any* RDF could be embedded
and extracted as RDF/XML, assuming there were suitable slots in the XHTML
profile for the parts of statements, e.g. along the lines of Tim Bray's RPV
(though one would hope rather less ugly).

For the shallow stuff about the doc itself, I wonder if something of the
'headless triples' idea [1] might be resurrectable?

Another consideration is how XHTML files with profile-embedded RDF might be
interpreted by other tools (not XSLT). It might be nice to hook up a SAX
parser to an RDF API and see what happens...

Cheers,
Danny.
