Joseph, 

Sorry if I missed prev mail on this. Just taking a look at your
"Transitional Validator" at http://www.w3.org/2003/06/xhtml-rdf/ 
-- wanted to try it with 
the FOAF namespace at 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/' (mix of XHTML and
RDF). It just seems to be hanging when trying to contact policy.w3.org.

Is the service dead now? (it was flagged as temporary...). What would 
it take to bring it back? Can others help, take it over etc if you don't 
have time nowadays...?

cheers,

Dan
