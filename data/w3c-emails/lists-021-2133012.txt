Do you have any new input on the various topics related to XHTML in RDF
Task Force, namely about:
- the conformance/validity model of XHTML2 (based on DTD/schemas/other?)
- the possibility of having XHTML2 schemas flexible enough to allow
inclusion of RDF while maintaining a validation model
- the interferences of XHTML entities with such a possible model
?

Thanks,

Dom
