Concerning my earlier post as to security 
problems with the link rel="transform" part 
of GRDDL it might be better to have a 
defined grddl grammar that would be 
interpreted as a literal result element 
stylesheet, i.e.

<grddl xmlns="some url that ends with grddl 
probably" 
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transfo
rm"
 xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
  xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-
rdf-syntax-ns#"
xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<rdf:RDF
  xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
  xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-
rdf-syntax-ns#"
  >
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="">
    <dc:subject><xsl:value-of 
select="/html:html/html:head/html:meta
[@name='DC.Subject']"/></dc:subject>
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>

</grddl>

Although this makes the xsl-t less powerful 
it does reduce the security concerns (there 
are still some but they are rather minor 
ones) and it could be that the grddl format 
itself could be extended to be more 
powerful.
