Hi,

While working on the GRDDL demo [1], it occurred to me that GRDDL can't
be bootstrapped as of today; indeed, the GRDDL mechanism only applies to
namespaces of root elements, and the GRDDL namespace [2] is only used in
the context of an attribute on a root element, or of an XHTML profile
[well, possibly also in an element when used as an RDF property, but not
as root element].

The question then is, should it be bootstrappable? I think it would be
neat if it was, but that's more an elegance kind of thing that a hard
requirement for me.

One possible mechanism would be to say that
<dataview:namespaceTransformation> can points to an XSLT that would
handle any node in that namespace (i.e. any element or attribute in that
namespace, independently of its position), but at the cost of making the
design of the said XSLT much more tricky; we could also create a
different property to handle this type of XSLT, and keeps the root
element case separated. 

Comments/suggestions welcomed.
