Maybe legal documents and contracts, electronic funds transfers, etc.
Right now people fax, email Word Docs, or fed ex stuff back and forth...
Lots of this is at least semi-structured.

Every time I see court filings at groklaw.net; I think hmmm... foaf to
specify the parties/persons involved, docbook variant for the main body.
Specialized RDF for some of the definitions, and other boilerplate
parts. I know there is a ML about putting RDF in XHTML. I wonder if some
of there results/findings could be applicable to embedding RDF in other
XML documents like Docbook?

Just imagine if a lot of the legal references(laws, precedent cases) 
were hyperlinks. They also love to search for things... Witness westlaw,
LexisNexis, PACER, et al.
Also could make some of the discovery things easier, if a lot of a
companies business related docs were RDF or at least bare XML.

Also open your wallet, look at the forms you fill out with the
government... Lots of semi-structured documents there.
