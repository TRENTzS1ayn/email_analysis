I am not very up on GRDDL but get the impression that you are not using the 
stylesheet PI, despite it having been explicit created to give an XML 
mechanism corresponding to the HTML link attribute ....

[[
Style Sheets can be associated with an XML[XML10] document by using a 
processing instruction whose target is xml-stylesheet. This processing 
instruction follows the behaviour of the HTML 4.0 <LINK 
REL="stylesheet">[HTML40].
]]

As is, any XML format wanting to use the grddl attribute has to explicitly 
permit it, whereas PIs can be added to any format.
