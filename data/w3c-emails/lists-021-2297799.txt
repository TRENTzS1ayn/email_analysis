Hmm... I'm not sure anybody has sent mail to this task force
about plans to connect to a new Semantic Web Best Practices
and Deployment Working Group...

"The Working Group will be the sponsoring group for the RDF in XHTML
Task Force [charter, work plan], currently chartered under the Semantic
Web Coordination Group. The Working Group will, in conjunction with the
HTML Working Group, provide a solution for representing RDF metadata
within an XHMTL document."

If all goes well, we'll be connecting in person in France next
week:

  09:00 - 10:30
  RDF-XHTML task force.
  Includes presentation on GRDDL by
  Dominique Hazael-Massieux / Dan Connolly
