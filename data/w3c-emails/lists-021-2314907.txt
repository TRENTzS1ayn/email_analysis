At http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2004/02/xhtml-rdf.html is a discussion document
about XHTML and RDF from the HTML working group.

The aim is to be able to generate RDF triples from XHTML, be GRDDL
compatible, allow XHTML documents to validate, and offer authors the ability
to add semantic information to their documents without the need for HTML to
be continually extended with new semantic elements such as <person> or
<number> etc.

Comments welcome.

Best wishes,

Steven Pemberton
For the W3C HTML Working Group
