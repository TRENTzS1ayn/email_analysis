I've had a read through and I like the approach;  I recall this being
outlined last year.  It is analgous to the rdf/xml style of a 'frame' of
properties about a single subject.  Here the <meta> stands for
the frame of subjects about the doc, and the inner <meta> are
the properties.

So where I had this example in the RDF/XML syntax doc:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-syntax-grammar-20040210/#example5


<rdf:Description rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar">
  <ex:editor>
    <rdf:Description>
      <ex:homePage rdf:resource="http://purl.org/net/dajobe/"/>
      <ex:fullName>Dave Beckett</ex:fullName>
    </rdf:Description>
  </ex:editor>
  <dc:title>RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised)</dc:title>
</rdf:Description>

It would become (if embedded in http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar):

<head>
  <meta property="ex:editor">
    <link rel="ex:homePage" href="http://purl.org/net/dajobe/" />
    <meta property="ex:fullName">Dave Beckett</meta>
  </meta>
  <meta property="dc:title">RDF/XML Syntax Specification (Revised)</meta>
</head>

(I assume an implicit 'about this document' applies)

I could probably translate more of those examples into this form.

<meta> inside a <meta> always implies a blank node in between, never
one with a URI, correct?

Looking at the above, using both rel and property attributes with
qname attributes values on the link and meta elements respectively
does not look like it'll be something people will remember.
