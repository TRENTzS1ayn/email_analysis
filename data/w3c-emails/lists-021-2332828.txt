Interesting work. I think it does compliment GRDDL. My reading of this
is that it, in effect, consists of a proposal for an alternate XML
encoding for RDF graphs (or perhaps, for some subset of RDF graphs).
This syntax is motivated by issues from the RDF-in-XHTML world, but the 
encoding could presumably be used in other contexts. The main features
of the syntax are (i) XML regularity: elements/attributes are
predicatable in advance; terms from misc RDF vocabs appear only as
content; (ii) extreme simplicity of parsing vs perceived expense of full
RDF.

Is that a fair characterisation of what you're trying to do here?

re subset, I guess this syntax doesn't deal with bNode-heavy graphs that 
have loops in, and I don't think (from quick skim) it handles RDF
datatyping. Is the intention to offer a complete encoding for arbitrary
RDF graphs or just capture a commonly useful subset?
