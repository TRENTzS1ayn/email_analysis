Didn't you already do that, essentially, with HyperRDF?

[[[
a link relationship name whose prefix matches the id attribute of the 
head element denotes the URI resulting from the concatenation of the 
profile URI (in absolute form) and the local part of the link 
relationship name
]]] - http://www.w3.org/2000/07/hs78/

If you don't now like the binding mechanism that you employed in 
HyperRDF, here's a similar alternative:

<head profile="http://.../profile-binding-profile
                http://example.org/pqr
                http://example.org/stu">
<meta name="import" content="http://example.org/pqr foo bar" />
<meta name="import" content="http://example.org/stu baz quux" />
<link rel="foo" href="..." />
<link rel="quux" href="..." />
</head>

I realise, however, that is doesn't fix the problem that one can't 
specify which mechanism is used first unless one interprets the HTML 
4.01's specifications "special" nature of the first head/@profile as 
meaning "all-overriding".

So if you really want to go nuts:

<head profile="http://example.org/pqr
                http://example.org/stu">
<meta http-equiv="Profile-Import"
    content="from http://example.org/pqr use blargh, something;
             from http://example.org/stu use different, another" />
<link rel="blargh" href="..." />
<link rel="another" href="..." />
</head>

You can do import-with-rename too. The problem with this is that 
http-equiv is a horrid attribute, and you'd have to be able to pick up 
the Profile-Import from the HTTP headers too in any implementation. 
And XSLT parsing would start to go beyond the realm of ease.

Note that I've read *all* of the pubrixt archives [1] backlog tonight, 
and have spent a couple or few hours commenting on them on #rdfig [2].

I will endeavour to present further considerations of the matters 
discussed on this list in the form of a single document write-up, 
possibly to be completed before Dom and DanC present GRDDL on the 5th 
of this month.
