I took a quick look at the task force proposal and wanted to make a 
suggestion about the task force reporting back.  As well as details of 
the proposed solution I suggest it would be useful to have a summary of 
requirements, solutions considered and why the proposed approach was 
adopted.  I think such a document would be useful to bpwg if/when they 
take up the work.  I personally would prioritise this over filling in 
more detail of the proposal on the grounds of making sure we have 
captured the gold we already have, before digging for more.
