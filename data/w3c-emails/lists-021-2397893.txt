Thanks for the link! FWIW, the text that you quote from the proposal is
intended to be informative, in the same spirit as what's evoked in this
document:
"""Typical behaviors of an agent may be very useful to explain the
intent non-normatively."""

I'm not sure; I've put a new version of the document:
http://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/spec
trying to use a more declarative style, than procedural, but I may have
failed to do so as expected by you and Tim; if so, I suggest you show me
an example of what should be done based on this new version of the text.

Done

Do you mean the title should be just "Koala" or something along
"Embedding RDF in XML and XHTML: the Koala proposal"?

In addition to the changes evoked above, I've also started to add the
generalization to XML, plus the definition of the RDF property Tim
requested to link an XML Namespace to an interpreter; let me know if you
think I've captured it adequately.
