At the XML 2003 "Practical RDF" town hall meeting...
  http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/2003/12/12/2003-12-12.html#1071189051.231090
James Clark gave similar feedback; i.e. why not generalize and
do this for all of XML, not just XHTML? TimBL gave similar input.

And so...

I'd like your take on this, Mark. Or...

Can you point me/us at a few of these? I'd like to see if the design Dom
and I are working on works with them.

Hmm... good to know.

Yes; that was on the list for XSLT 1.1; I was disappointed when
they decided to skip to 2.0; hmm...

Yes.

Hmm... yes...

If/when you do, please let me/us know.
