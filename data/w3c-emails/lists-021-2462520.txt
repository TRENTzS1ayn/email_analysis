Hi Danny,

> I was wondering if anyone had a bit of code that did something like this

I had a quick go and I think the attached stylesheet should do what you're  
asking. Also attached is the "atomish" xml document I tested it against  
(I'm not following the Atom syntax debates at all so I based it on your  
example).
