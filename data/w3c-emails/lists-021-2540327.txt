I think it would not be difficult. (I still have my concerns about XFN 
;) ) but yes in RDF would be quite easy.

XMDP yes, definitely, but would deserve a larger forum.
XFN, not really.

I completely agree with that.
I think one thing that could be very useful is to have the "rel" 
attribute on any kind of element in XHTML 2.0.

So you could add a poor semantics but still useful to element, it would 
help to leverage a bit the semantic Web and profiles would become an 
ontology for the "poor", but a lot easier.
