Thinking a little more about implementing this, I find that I need a 
resolution mechanism to determine what script to run given the namespace 
of the XML root element.

Hold on while I prepare a fox hole to duck into ...

What I'd rather have is the url of the transform right there in the xml 
document, and I wonder about using the same machanism as browsers use to 
specify a stylesheet, i.e a processing instruction.

Diving for foxhole now ...
