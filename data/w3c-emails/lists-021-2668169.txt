<sbp> consider glean.py testing and pyrple porting on my weekend todo 
list. I've been rather productive these past few days
<DanC> [...] I look forward to your feedback next week, sbp

I didn't manage to test glean.py yet (still planning to do so), but I 
did manage to port it to pyrple, and make a few changes to the script 
along the way:

http://inamidst.com/grddl/garner.py
- A GRDDL client implementation using Pyrple
(Date: 5th of June, 2004; License: W3C Software License)

Requires xsltproc and pyrple [1]. Note how much nicer optparse is 
compared to getopt! There are some other more subtle differences too.

I also set up a webservice that uses the script above:

http://inamidst.com/grddl/demo
- GRDDL Demonstration (using Pyrple and garner.py)
Source: http://inamidst.com/inside/grddl/demo

Append "&format=ntriples" to the results for N-Triples output. I ought 
to run a graph isomorphism test/rdfdiff program on my ./demo output and 
the W3C's grddl-demo output.

Cheers,

[1] http://infomesh.net/pyrple/ Quick installation:
