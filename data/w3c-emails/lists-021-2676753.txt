Dan, Sean,

Please correct me if I'm wrong, I haven't had time to pore over the source:
Both glean.py and garner.py discover and apply a series of XSLTs to the 
source XHTML, reading the resultant RDF/XML into a triplestore/model. 
The merged model is then serialised out as RDF/XML.

Can't the same result be achieved without the Redland/Pyrple dependency? 
Isn't a purely syntactical merge possible - just top & tail ('deroot') 
the individual RDF/XML results, then glue them back into a common root. 
I would guess XSLT could do this whilst retaining all the required 
namespace declarations.

Feasible?

Cheers,
Danny.
