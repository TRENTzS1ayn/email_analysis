Mark,

That was nifty stuff you presented last week.
  http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/2004/02/xhtml-rdf.html
I think one of the names you offered was RDF/XHTML.
That works for me, at least for now...

I saw you chatting with Jos and a few others
about an XSLT transformation from that syntax
to triples.

Dom brought up an issue about XSLT and Qnames
http://www.w3.org/2004/03/05-swbp-irc#T09-32-39

I'm curious how that's handled too.

Do you have details to share?
