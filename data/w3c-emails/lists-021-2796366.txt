Hi Mark,

This does seem to fix up much of the potential for problems, though  I'd 
be interested to hear whether you've got a way around the situation 
where the XHTML gets passed through XML processing (minimal case - XML 
indent pretty printing)  where the prefix/namespace mapping within 
attributes can get lost.

---
Just a thought - in most cases there won't be too much risk of naming 
clashes within XHTML+RDF docs, so perhaps there might be an another 
route where the terms used  are exhaustively listed, something like:

<link href="http://purl.org/*dc*/elements/1.1/title" rel="title" />
<link href="http://purl.org/*dc*/elements/1.1/description" 
rel="description" />
...

<item property="title">The Three Bears</item>
Once upon a time there lived three very conventional bears, <item 
property="description">Mummy Bear, Daddy Bear and Baby Bear</item>...



Cheers,
Danny.
