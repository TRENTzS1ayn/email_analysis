I implemented only the namespace document case; see
http://www.w3.org/2004/01/rdxh/grddl-xml-demo and specifically the "P3Q"
example.

So do I; I believe it's fairly easy to add in GRDDL (and the associated
software) and would have big benefits for already deployed profiles.

I may be a purist, but I really think that's too much of a kludge to be
acceptable... That looks to me as going against one of the TAG
principles:
"Specifications that use QNames to represent URI/local-name pairs SHOULD
NOT allow both forms in attribute values or element content where they
would be indistinguishable from URIs."
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-webarch-20031209/#qname-uri-syntax

Although rel is not specifically a QName in the HTML data model, it's a
simple URI which seems to have the same kind of problems as those
triggered by mixing QNames and URIs. (besides, the HTML WG proposal do
use qnames in rel IIRC).

Quite. Meanwhile, I don't have a good solution to this specific use
case.
