I haven't heard any mention of Trackback for quite a while: am I right in
thinking that its problem (needing to associate multiple bits of RDF with
named anchors for fragments of quite-possibly invalid HTML, needing to do it
in the body of the page rather than the head, and as currently implemented
needing RDF serialized as exactly the specified XML) is too ugly to have a
reasonable solution?
