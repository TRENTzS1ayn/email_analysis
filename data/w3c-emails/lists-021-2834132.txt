Hmm... I've sketched it out in my head a few times, and I thought
we could do something useful about the trackback case with GRDDL.
But I haven't found time to work out the details.

The solutions I have in mind do involve *some* markup in the head,
and they can accomodate "RDF serialized as exactly the specified XML"
and "needing to associate multiple bits of RDF with
named anchors for fragments" just fine.

Can you clarify "quite-possibly invalid HTML"?
Maybe this check-box applies?

[ ] We rely on HTML that isn't XML, so neither of these
        proposals works for us

I'm not inclined to endorse anything that isn't well-formed XML,
but I'm aware of various approaches for coercing tag soup into XHTML
(tidy and derivatives) and I'm not going to stop anybody
from applying those techniques to bridge the gap between
what's out there and what XSLT processors can read.
