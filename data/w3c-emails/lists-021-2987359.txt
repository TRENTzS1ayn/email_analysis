Maybe two years, you would have find none. The validity of Web sites is 
increasing, and because many people are making a lot of effort to 
improve that, I would not encourage the slippery slope of 
"quite-invalid". There will be no reasons to improve the tools, which 
are improving.

Look at WordPress engine,
look at MovableType engine,
look at DotClear engine,

There are all weblogging tools which do great jobs for the XHTML 
validity.
