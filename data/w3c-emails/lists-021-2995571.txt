The last example in "XHTML and RDF" [1] :

[[

<span datatype="xsd:date" val="1940-06-04">Yesterday</span> in Parliament the <span resource="p:WinstonChurchill">Prime Minister</span>
said that we will fight on the beaches ...
                                

This would create the following triples:

<> xhtml2:reference "1940-06-04"^^xsd:date , p:WinstonChurchill .
                                

]]

What was confusing me was the spanned text. What's now puzzling me is 
why you would bother with:

<span resource="p:WinstonChurchill">Prime Minister</span>

when all you're getting is

<> xhtml2:reference p:WinstonChurchill .

which you could say anywhere with:

<span resource="p:WinstonChurchill" />

(assuming that's legal XHTML2)

so why not add

p:WinstonChurchill rdfs:label "Prime Minister" .

?

Cheers,
Danny.
