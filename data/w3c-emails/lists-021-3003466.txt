Quite. I'm also not sure why the XHTML 2.0 group might incorporate 
Birbeck's RDF in XHTML, as I believe it works on top of the current 
XHTML 2.0 spec so there's no dependency the other way. I suspect it 
would be a little premature to adopt this approach in any case - the 
proposal has gone down very well with a lot of RDF people, as this has 
been something we've  needed for years. But I think it's likely to hit 
resistance when presented to regular XML folks who've known problems 
with QNames in attributes before (to the extent of calling them evil! 
[1]) , and coincidentally have had issues with RDF syntax in the past. I 
think he's probably on the right lines, but I think it would be reckless 
to jump on the first version that vaguely works as the final answer. As 
far as I can see there are other issues - something that would work 
fully with XHTML 1.0 would be nice for a start, and the relationship 
between the text content and the metadata is limited. But I'm sure with 
a few short cycles the RDF in XHTML proposal could be made palatable for 
a considerably larger number of people.

Cheers,
Danny.
