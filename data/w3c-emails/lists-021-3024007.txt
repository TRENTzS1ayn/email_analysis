My problem for not reading closer, the doc is clear. Thanks for this 
response, and for providing interesting reading material!

That is an advantage for sure, it just seems like for external 
processing it's leaving some of the available information (the 
referenced text) behind.

Right, I see what you mean, there should be nice UI things available there.

Just as a side thought, re. your emphasis on location - as well as 
providing the literal text in triples, might it not be possible to 
include in the extracted RDF the positional info? The position could be 
passed on as XPointers (or at least XPaths) in the same way Annotea uses 
them.

I guess there can be different levels of extraction from the same 
document, with just the <title> at one end and total fine-grained 
XPointer to every <span>'ed quote at the other.

It hadn't occurred to me in that way, what could be done in (browser) 
context, but I've a feeling there's low-hanging fruit nearby.

Heh, it's funny, I was thinking in terms of what's not extracted 
(p:WinstonChurchill rdfs:label "Prime Minister") and your response is 
looking at what's not left in by separating the original triple 
(position of <> xhtml2:reference p:WinstonChurchill). I'm not sure which 
of us is the optimist...

Yep, cool potential.

Cheers,

PS. wget isn't a bad Semantic Web browser
