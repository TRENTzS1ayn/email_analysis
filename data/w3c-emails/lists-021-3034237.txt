TODO: peeking-into-profile-docs (working; need to update reference docs)
TODO: general XML support
TODO: peeking-into-namespace docs
TODO: better command-line arg parsing/ordering

ISSUE: I'd rather use pipes than temp files,
 but spawn() is more secure than popen()
 since it allows args to be parsed individually
 rather than as one command string to be parsed
 again by a shell.
