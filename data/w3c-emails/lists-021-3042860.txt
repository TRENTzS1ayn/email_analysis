Tantek, you may recall discussion of XFN and GRDDL...

Re: XFN on the GRDDL [was: Profiles attribute...]

Since then I have been thinking about enhancing GRDDL
so that XFN docs would work with GRDDL as-is, once
the XFN profile has been modified to point to a grokXFN.xsl
transformation.

I got around to implementing the idea this week.

If I run:
$ python glean.py ,f.rdf http://www.w3.org/2003/g/td/friends
  (i.e. http://www.w3.org/2003/g/glean.py)

I get some RDF that says I xfn:met you.

That friends doc doesn't point to the real XFN profile,
but rather to a GRDDL-enhanced work-alike:

 http://www.w3.org/2003/g/td/xfn-workalike

What do you think about changing the real XFN profile likewise,
Tantek?

EricM, you and I discussed the same sort of thing
for the dublin core profile
  http://dublincore.org/documents/dcq-html/

Do you think you could get that profile changed?

I haven't yet updated the GRDDL spec and profile doc
yet, but I intend to presently, especially if I get
some positive feedback.
