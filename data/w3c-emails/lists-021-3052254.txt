Bravo! Very nice indeed.

The only thing that concerns me, I assume it's come up before - how does 
one deal with multiple profiles, where the order in which the XSLT is 
applied makes a difference? (I suspect this could be generally avoided 
unless there was a naming clash, but I'm not sure).

Cheers,
Danny.
