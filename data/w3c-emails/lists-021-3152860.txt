Hi all

There is now a mailing list, public-rdf-ruby@w3.org for collaboration on 
RDF and related tools (OWL, XML...) in the Ruby programming language. See 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-ruby/ for archives.

List address is mailto:public-rdf-ruby@w3.org 

To subscribe to the mailing list, send a message:

    To: public-rdf-ruby-request@w3.org
    Subject: subscribe
(to unsubscribe, send a msg with subject:  unsubscribe to the same address)

For those unfamiliar with the charms of Ruby, see:
http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ or http://www.rubycentral.com/book/ and nearby

My immediate goal for the list was to progress the RubyRdf work I began at 
http://www.w3.org/2001/12/rubyrdf/intro.html in a more collaborative manner
(which might include starting over from scratch). The wiki page linked from that
url might be another useful way of keeping shared notes on RDF and Ruby.

I would like to hear about other RDF work in Ruby; the list is for more than 
the current RubyRdf library. I'm in particular interested in fostering 
discussion on what a good solid and Ruby-friendly RDF API might look like, 
as well as in collaboration on RDF parsers, database/query tools and suchlike.

I expect there might be significant overlap with Python, Perl etc APIs, but 
the current task at hand is figuring out how to get Ruby's RDF support to be 
more mature. 

cheers,

Dan


ps. English, Japanese or any other language is welcome on the list...
