Samizdat 0.5.1 "Paris Commune" release is out
---------------------------------------------

This release is dedicated to 133rd anniversary of the Paris Commune.
Main feature of this version is i18n support, with Russian translation
already in place. Other improvements include ability to work as plain
CGI without mod_ruby, support for Windows/Cygwin, massive speed
increase, and a long list of bugfixes. Database schema is changed again,
but this time it is trivial to migrate from the previous version.

About Samizdat:

Samizdat is a generic RDF-based engine for building collaboration and
open publishing web sites. Samizdat will let users cooperate and
coordinate on all kinds of activities, including media activism,
resource sharing, education and research, advocacy, etc., by allowing
everyone to publish, view, comment, edit, and aggregate text and
multimedia resources, vote on ratings and classifications, filter
resources by flexible sets of criteria (see design-goals.txt). Samizdat
intends to promote values of freedom, openness, equality, and
cooperation.

What's new in Samizdat 0.5.1:

- i18n: install Ruby/Gettext and Samizdat will offer you a choice of
  interface languages; currently, English and Russian are available

- portability: Samizdat is untied from Apache/mod_ruby specifics and can
  work on platforms where mod_ruby is unavailable, such as Windows/Cygwin

- speed: performance of the RDF engine was improved on all levels from
  query parsing to SQL schema, providing for as much as 20-fold speed
  increase for sites with tens of thousands of resources; see the
  changes in database/*.sql to get the idea how to juggle indexes,
  constraints, and triggers to migrate your site from 0.5.0 to 0.5.1

- other: this version contains a lot of minor bugfixes and improvements,
  including automatic upload format detection, Konqueror CSS fixes, page
  numbering for long paged listings, and more.
