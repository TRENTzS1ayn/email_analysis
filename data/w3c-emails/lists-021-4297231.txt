The "use" command in kbx is for telling it what server to use. Such as:

desc> use http://tap.stanford.edu/data/

Note also that kbx is typically a testing tool for me, so there's little
in the way of documentation. In the same directory you'll find kb.cgi which
is a version of the HTML KB browser on tap.stanford.edu, you might want
to use that instead.
