I was attempting to follow the directions in http://tap.stanford.edu/docs/client.html.
Is there another "tutorial" document which tells me how to use tapache GetData?

  The "use" command in kbx is for telling it what server to use. Such as:

  desc> use http://tap.stanford.edu/data/

  Note also that kbx is typically a testing tool for me, so there's little
  in the way of documentation. In the same directory you'll find kb.cgi which
  is a version of the HTML KB browser on tap.stanford.edu, you might want
  to use that instead.
