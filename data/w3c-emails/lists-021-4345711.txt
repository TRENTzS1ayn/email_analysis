The display programs all seem to be working as you advertised.

But the KB downloads have some errors.  
I downloaded the "problem files" twice with the same result, 
so I think the problem is in the download program download.pl
(or in http://tap.stanford.edu/data).

These downloaded files (without instance data) contain one or more "</0>", 
and seem to have some lines missing before the "</0>".
