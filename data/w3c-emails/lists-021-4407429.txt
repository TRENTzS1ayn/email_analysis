It does work using quotes & semicolons

$ java -classpath ".;../../tap.jar"  ex9

I won't dump WinXP Pro now.  Compared to my Linux machine,
my WinXP Pro machine has 10xCPU speed, 10xRAM, 6xdisk capacity.
Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX 3.0 gives me most of the advantages of Linux.

  I would certainly agree with dumping Windows, but you might try:

  c:\> java -classpath .;..\tap.jar ex9

  it might work.
