 This is to announce the availability of version 0.5 of the TAP Software 
toolkit, including

   --- TAPache, an apache model which makes it very easy to make your
               RDF data available to others via GetData
   --- The TAP client in perl
   --- The software for doing semantic search for the W3C website
   --- preliminary documentation

All of this is available at http://tap.stanford.edu/docs/

This is a preliminary release and is being made for the purpose of 
getting feedback, etc. So, please do help us in getting to something we 
will all be happy with!

Welcome to the Data Web.

thanks,

Guha  & Rob McCool
