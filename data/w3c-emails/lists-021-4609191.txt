It's unfortunate, since I just fixed the exact same thing for someone else
(Joseph Rajkumar). Just finished it yesterday, in fact. I also made it work 
with Apache 2. Thanks for catching these problems.

I haven't seen this one before. I'll investigate.

If you just go to /data/ it should work. Where is the link?

This is with download.cgi on tap.stanford.edu, right? That program is old 
and needs to be replaced with its updated version.

Sure. Let me know what else needs fixing or improvement. I'll be putting out
v0.71 soon which incorporates the fixes for Solaris and Apache 2.x.
