Sorry for such a boring message but I tried to download the TAP client v0.6
(Java, Perl).  I get back a web page with the TAP menu bar inserted, then
the binary for the tar.gz (I tried IE, Mozilla and wget).  Unfortunately the
binary seems to be corrupted as cutting it out of the web page does not give
a valid gzip tar file.  The same happens with the server tarball.
