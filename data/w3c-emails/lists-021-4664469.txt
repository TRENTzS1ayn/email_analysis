I notice that TAP names often carry the (or a) type for the named thing as
part of their name / ID.

I can see many cases where this might be a very useful optimisation, but
wonder about the consequence for long-term use of these IDs.

I'm currently for eg listed in TAP as

http://tap.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/kb.pl?node=W3CPersonBrickley%2C_Dan&op=show&syn=10&browse=all

ie Resource ID: 'W3CPersonBrickley,_Dan'

I don't expect to be a W3CPerson my entire life. What's the TAP plan for
identifier persistence? Should I expect to stop using
W3CPersonBrickley,_Dan as a tap-name for me, if/when I eventually move on
to life after W3C? Will TAP-based systems be encouraged to unpack these
structured names and conclude that anything named W3CPerson*,* will have
certain characterstics (such as working for W3C)? In which case I'm wary
of using your ID for me, since it'll cause no end of problems a few years
down the line.

Sounds like a cataloguing rules and 'best practice' issue rather than a
deep technical problem. Filing me as PersonBrickey,_Dan would seem less
likely to cause semantic bit-rot...

What's the plan? How have things worked to date?

cheers,

Dan
