It wasn't intended as an optimization, it was simply a convenience; we had
to pick something and that's what we picked. We were working largely with
public figures, and products, in those days. These things do not change type
as often as other things.

No, the ID's are most definitely NOT intended to be automatically packed or
unpacked. They're human readable for the same reason that URLs are human
readable, to facilitate easy copy and paste, and to enable them to appear
in print without looking like gibberish.

It probably would have been more consistent to pick 
ComputerScientistBrickley,_Dan since that's less likely to change than the
fact that you're at the W3C.

This is probably a better long-term plan.

Thus far we've been largely working with celebrities and popular figures,
whose types don't change all that often. So it hasn't come up just yet.

There is another question here, which is the persistence of facts in TAP.
TAP has no notion of time or former roles. If I want to represent Henry
Kissinger as a former Secretary of State, there isn't any notion of this
at the moment. You're either the Secretary of State, or you're not. TAP is
still evolving so we're creating conventions for these sorts of things
as they come up.
