Sounds great!

Things to look for in tap.rdf for examples are:

MusicianJackson,_Michael

This will show you the TAP Musician node, as well as typical arcs for
a Musician. For locations, try the following:

CityChicagoIL

You'll see that it's a UnitedStatesCity, and that it's locatedIn 
IllinoisState. If you look at IllinoisState, you'll find that it's
locatedIn CountryUnitedStates, and so on.

There are probably more examples that will come up, so I expect you'll
have more specific questions :)
