1. MKE 6.0 has a much improved interface to the TAP KB.
Using MKE, and comparing the results to the online Perl
browser, I have identified some new GetData bugs/features.

2. Take a minute to browse the MKE - TAP session:
http://rhm.cdepot.net/applications/SemanticWeb/TAP/tapbug.html
I have retrieved various properties of Michael Jordan,
Resource, Property.

Here's a summary of the bugs/features.

3. "Resource" info. must sometimes be retrieved using "Node".
Likewise, "Property" must be called "PropertyType".
For now, I have programmed this translation into the shell script
http://rhm.cdepot.net/GetData

4. subject has ?;  # GetData subject domain yes
does not return all of the properties.  Note that Michael Jordan
has four properties, and none are returned by GetData.  Most
properties (with values) can be retrieved by name.
    $. has type = Athlete;   # $. isu Athlete;
    $. has title = "Michael Jordan";
    $. has plays = SportBasketBall;
    $. has playsForTeam = SportsTeamWashingtonWizards;

5. subject has title = ?;  # GetData subject title no
always fails.
