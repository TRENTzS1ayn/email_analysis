I'm embarrassed.  The first directory name is missing in both URLs.
The correct URLs are

  Subject: MKR interface and GetData bugs/features


  1. MKE 6.0 has a much improved interface to the TAP KB.
  Using MKE, and comparing the results to the online Perl
  browser, I have identified some new GetData bugs/features.

  2. Take a minute to browse the MKE - TAP session:
  http://rhm.cdepot.net/applications/SemanticWeb/TAP/tapbug.html
  I have retrieved various properties of Michael Jordan,
  Resource, Property.

  Here's a summary of the bugs/features.

  3. "Resource" info. must sometimes be retrieved using "Node".
  Likewise, "Property" must be called "PropertyType".
  For now, I have programmed this translation into the shell script
  http://rhm.cdepot.net/GetData

  4. subject has ?;  # GetData subject domain yes
  does not return all of the properties.  Note that Michael Jordan
  has four properties, and none are returned by GetData.  Most
  properties (with values) can be retrieved by name.
      $. has type = Athlete;   # $. isu Athlete;
      $. has title = "Michael Jordan";
      $. has plays = SportBasketBall;
      $. has playsForTeam = SportsTeamWashingtonWizards;

  5. subject has title = ?;  # GetData subject title no
  always fails.
