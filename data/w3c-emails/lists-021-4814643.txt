Can you try this against my development server at 
  http://panic.stanford.edu/data/
and see if these problems have been fixed? The server on panic uses a newer
data set and I think I fixed all these irritating issues.

Can you show me the query that you're using to ask for the properties,
so I can try to reproduce it?

You may need to use "label" or "rdfs:label" here, we've been standardizing
toward the rdfs version of "what's this called" and not the Dublin Core 
version.
