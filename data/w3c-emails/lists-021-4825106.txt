Yes, I will try your new system & let you know.

GetData shell script is called as
    GetData subject property inverse prefix suffix
Actual Java program is shown in http://rhm.cdepot.net/bin/GetData.
Note that I am using your SuperClass and SubClass search flags.
In each case, the subject is "AthleteJordan,_Michael".
For retrieving all the properties, property is "domain" and inverse is
"yes".
For retrieving the individual properties, the properties are
"type", "title", "plays", "playsForTeam" and inverse is "no".
GetData is called by http://rhm.cdepot.net/bin/mkrGetData, whose
arguments are an MKR question minus the terminating semicolon.

I will try some variations on these names.
