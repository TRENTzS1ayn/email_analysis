1. It looks like a URI problem.
I'm beginning to make some progress by using GetResource
to find the right URI.  It's a pain trying to keep straight
whether it's rdf or rdfs or dc, for example.

2. Do you have a Qname capability, e.g. rdfs:subClassOf,
in your new system?  I'm 100% in favor of Qnames for a 
user interface instead of long URIs.  Even better, when
possible (which is most of the time), would be unqualified
names, with the URI being looked up in a local dictionary.

So far, 
GetResource (your GetResourcesNamed) works,
but GetData does not.  

Does "panic" work with my current TAP 0.75?
Do I need to use rdf:,rdfs:,owl:, etc.?
Do I need to use URIs instead of short names?
???
