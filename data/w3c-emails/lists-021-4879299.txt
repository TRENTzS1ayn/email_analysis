Yes, if you ask for rdfs:subClassOf or tap:AthleteJordan,_Michael, then 
a system called the Abbreviator expands "rdfs:" to the actual namespace.

The abbreviator also takes care of remembering which are rdfs: and which
are rdf:, and other such hassles by managing a set of "standard tags". You'd
gotten away earlier by putting the TAP namespace on everything, and frankly
I did that for a long time too, but we have to be more compliant now. 

The way to tell if a tag doesn't need a namespace is to call the Abbreivator's
IsStandardTag static method. So in GetData.java, you'd do something like this:

  if(!Abbrev.IsStandardTag(tag)) {
      tag = "http://tap.stanford.edu/data/" + tag;
  }

Off the cuff, the tags I use the most that require no namespace are 
rdfs:Class, rdfs:subClassOf, rdfs:label, rdf:type, and rdf:Resource.
For these tags, if you just say the tag, such as "Class", the system will 
automaticall put the "rdfs:" on for you.
