1. As I do more TAP examples, I see more examples
such as

    FashionModelMacPherson,Elle
    ActorMacPherson,Elle

which should be declared

    FashionModelMacPherson,Elle  owl:sameAs  ActorMacPherson,Elle

So, the big question is: will TAP support such
*essential* OWL constructs, or will TAP stick
with just the RDF/RDFS constructs?

2. The MKR equivalent is

    "FashionModelMacPherson,Elle"  is  "ActorMacPherson,Elle";

I *don't like the quotes* for MKR, but they are *required* to
distinguish a single resource from a list/set of two resources.
For example, I can say

    "AthleteYounger,Jordan", "AthleteOlder,Jordan"  is
"AthleteJordan,_Michael";

which indicates three names for the same resource.

3. Because of 2, I would like to see TAP do away with the
commas embedded in names.
