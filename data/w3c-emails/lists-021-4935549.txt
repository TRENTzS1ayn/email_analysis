The plan is to stick with RDF/RDFS and have a post-processing 
system run over the KB periodically to merge equivalent nodes
using some set of guidelines. There are literally hundreds of
these examples (Tom Waits and Suzanne Vega are two obvious ones).

What about using a \ in the MKR system, something like
  AthleteYounger\,Jordan, AthleteOlder\,Jordan is AthleteJordan\,_Michael

We could change to do away with the commas, or to percent escape them,
but I'm reluctant to change it with preparations for a release underway.
