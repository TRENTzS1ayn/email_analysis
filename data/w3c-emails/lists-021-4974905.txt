I'm just wondering if you have a SuperClass/SubClass
option for the java method GetResourcesNamed().

My basic shell script is

    GetResource genus name

where "genus" is the type/Class of the resource, and "name"
is a pseudo-attribute matched against "label", "plural",
"adjective", ...

Here's an example of what concerns me.
The command "GetResource Resource Paris" returns 
23 resources including 2 cities, 4 books, 10 musicians,
and more.  The 2 cities are

    CityParis,_France
    CityParisTX

But if I use "GetResource City Paris", I get only

    CityParis,_France

This is because U.S. cities are a subClassOf City.
Using "GetResource UnitedStatesCity Paris" returns only

    CityParisTX
