Thanks. I'm doing work on integration of web-based data now, in addition to
what Rover comes up with from Yahoo news. A listing of the various sources
of data we're drawing from is on the What's New page:

  http://panic.stanford.edu/reggie

The classes in bold are the ones that are added to the KB each night when a
crawl happens. Currently the main KB does not have this data yet because of
the problem you mentioned earlier, when Tom Waits shows up as both an Actor
and a Musician when in fact they're the same person. This data should start
showing up within a couple of weeks as I get things sorted out.
