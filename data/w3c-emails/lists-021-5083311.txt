Sorry for the duplicate, I forgot to send this to the list as well.

Try running this command:

ulimit -n 8192

or:

ulimit -a

You need to raise the per-process file descriptor limit past its default
of 1024. You will probably need to be root when you do this. You may also
need to poke around in /proc, the relevant entry is /proc/sys/fs/file-max.

Note that you may find some scalability problems at this level of use; the
largest number of files I've tested with is 286 DAML files I downloaded from
daml.org.
