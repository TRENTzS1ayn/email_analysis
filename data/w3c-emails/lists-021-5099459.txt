Thanks for letting me know where these are, I'll test with them.

We had a lot of trouble with XML parsers choking on bad character sets early
on, and it appears I made the Perl code to fix the problem too aggressive. 
it seems to have turned your title into nonsense.

I'll look at fixing and hopefully will have a fix later this week.

Yes, but there's a problem in 0.72 which may cause the server to not notice
the changes. I have a patch in the as-yet-unreleased 0.75 but I'll wait until
later in the week to try and release these two fixes together.
