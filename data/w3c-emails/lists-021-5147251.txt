Glad to hear you got the MKR system working with GetData!

To query the available properties of a node, ask for "arcs". To find the
fooOf arcs, as for "arcs" with the flag "inverse=yes".

DomainOf is an inverse property, so to ask for the domain of Person is to ask
for the inverse. To see an example of this, edit ex8.pl (or ex8.java) and
change CountryUnitedStates to Person.

I saw this a couple of months ago; we renamed Node to Resource to be more
RDF friendly. I thought I'd fixed it. It seems there are still some issues 
to resolve, I'll try to take care of those this week sometime.
