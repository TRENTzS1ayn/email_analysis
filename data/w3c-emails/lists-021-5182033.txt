Thanks for the clarification.  I'm now using "domain", "inverse=yes" instead of "domainOf".
I've made some more improvements in mkrGetData -- it's getting closer to what
I expect the ultimate interface to look like.

A quick question about "instanceOf".
In RDF. "instanceOf" (isa) subsumes "individualOF" (isu) and "subClassOf" (iss).
Is that also true in TAP?  I noticed you don't have "individualOf".

  Glad to hear you got the MKR system working with GetData!

  To query the available properties of a node, ask for "arcs". To find the
  fooOf arcs, as for "arcs" with the flag "inverse=yes".

  DomainOf is an inverse property, so to ask for the domain of Person is to ask
  for the inverse. To see an example of this, edit ex8.pl (or ex8.java) and
  change CountryUnitedStates to Person.

  I saw this a couple of months ago; we renamed Node to Resource to be more
  RDF friendly. I thought I'd fixed it. It seems there are still some issues 
  to resolve, I'll try to take care of those this week sometime.
