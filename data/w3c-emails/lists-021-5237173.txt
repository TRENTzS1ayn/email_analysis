Do you want to use my high-level ontology, which distinguishes property types
        property         example
    ========         ======
    part             Hand
    attribute        homePage
    relation         subClassOf
    action           plays
    interaction      Event

If so, I can supply the KB.  
The only thing you would need to do is backup the current KB, 
in case you want to restore it for any reason.
