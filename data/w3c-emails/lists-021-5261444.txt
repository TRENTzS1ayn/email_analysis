I got this error on my Linux system, and I thought it was because I only had 48 MB RAM.
But now I'm getting it on my WinXP Pro system, which has 512 MB RAM.

$ . ./kbtrans.env
$ r java
java kbtrans -i tap.rdf -o tap.mcf
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError
$

Do I need to split tap.rdf into smaller pieces to process it?
