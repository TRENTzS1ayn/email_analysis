Hello,

 

I installed TAP in my server  (http://marte.dsi.uminho.pt/data), and I
downloaded and put Places.rdf from stanford to my "data" directory.

 

Now I want to run the examples (ex1a, ex1b,...) over my server, but
always I received a "null" like an answer.

 

Any suggestion?

 

Thanks,

 

CEsar Ariza
