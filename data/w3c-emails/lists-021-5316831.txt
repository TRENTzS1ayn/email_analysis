Hi

Does TAP's use of SOAP for query make use of the (cachable, URI-linkable
etc) HTTP GET method, or is it over HTTP POST?

http://tap.stanford.edu/tap/getdatadetails.html left me unsure.

http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part2/#soapinhttp documents SOAP 1.2's HTTP 
binding, and http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part2/#WebMethodFeature 
the oddly named 'SOAP Web Method Feature', which as I understand it is 
SOAP's way of allowing SOAP services with GET-like semantics to use 
HTTP's GET method.

Maybe I should be asking two questions: TAP's GetData in the abstract, 
vs the Stanford implementation of it...?

Anyway, further clues gratefully received,

cheers,

Dan

ps. for an RDF protocol that does use GETs, 
http://www.joseki.org/protocol.html might be of interest.
