Not that I know of. It's relatively simple: the names of each ?name=value
pair are properties, the value is the desired value of that property in the
request description. In the first case, the properties you want the values 
for are specified by name=value pairs where the name is "prop".

Abbreviations are allowed, or full URLs. tap:Actor is equivalent to 
http://tap.stanford.edu/data/Actor and there are default namespaces also,
such as "rdf:type" and "rdfs:label".
