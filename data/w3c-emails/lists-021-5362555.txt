Hi Richard,

Which part of the TAP material did you extract this from? I can't find a
schema containing the terms to which you refer. I'm a little confused by
your queries, re. disjunction/exclusion, as I was under the impression that
TAP used base-level RDF and hence disjunction wasn't an option.

Cheers,
Danny.

  Subject: [KR-language] are there any disjoint subClasses in the TAP KB?


  As I started to formulate definitions of the Classes in the TAP KB, I soon
began to question whether my assumptions about disjoint subClasses were
valid.  A hierarchy outline (subClass relations) of the top levels of the
TAP KB is given in
      http://rhm.cdepot.net/knowledge/application/SemanticWeb/TAP/tap.ho

  Looking at this hierarchy, several question come to mind immediately.
  For example:
  1. is Agent a subClass of Tangible? or is it excluded by "definition"?
  2. is Class a subClass of Intangible? or is it excluded by "definition"?
  3. is PopularCharacter a subClass of Intangible? (they all seem be
fictional)

  I would appreciate some guidance on the rationale behind the current set
of Classes.
