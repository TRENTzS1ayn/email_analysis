What version of TAPache are you running? If it's 0.6, can I convince you to
try 0.72? 0.6 has some problems with indexing and the "Pure virtual" message
above is one that should only be found in 0.6.

If you do upgrade, you'll need to run "rm .*.rdfc" in the DataDirectory to
clear out the older index files. 

Can you try this and let me know if it helps?
