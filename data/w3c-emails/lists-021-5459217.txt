The server. I've restored it, though the data sources have decayed 
significantly since the last time I looked.

A development version of TAP 1.0 is on http://panic.stanford.edu/sail

This system is actively maintained and we will be switching the demos page
on http://tap.stanford.edu/ to use it within the next month or two. The
current plan is for TAP 1.0 and a package I'm calling "Semantic Search in 
a Box" to be released around then.
