Hi Danny
Sorry to be so late in replying -- I hadn't checked the web site 
for the last month.  I'm now working with mkrPutData to do 
some KB editing.

All the Classes that I mentioned were found by browsing 
and checking the TAP knowledge base, mostly using MKE 
on my own downloaded copy of the TAP KB.  They are part 
of the "added" knowledge, not part of the schema.

I realize that RDF can't specify disjoint Classes, but I am 
trying to formulate genus-differentia definitions which use 
disjoint Classes. 

P.S. I just added TAP email to my Syndirella feeds.
