tkb is either "Target Knowledge Base" or "This Knowledge Base" depending
on whether it's found in a request (target kb), or a response (this kb),
or a document (this kb). In this case the kb doesn't have a URL and so this
comes out empty.

Yes, TAP should be changed to avoid this particular utterance of XML. I will
get this fix in with the other 2 going into 0.75.
