Yes, I thought I'd fixed that and was about to send a reply saying that I 
just hadn't updated that KB fragment in a while (we don't get much data on 
ear drops these days), but it turns out that the Perl code still had something
in there to generate it. I fixed that but I haven't regenerated the KBs yet.
Thanks.

Yes, we're sprinkling it everywhere and it's going to be very hard to remove,
so you should consider it dereferencable for a long time.

I haven't updated the SDK or the KB downloads in a while, partially because
there hasn't been much interest, and partially because it takes effort. Is
there interest now? I suppose if I just update them that may create some
interest.
