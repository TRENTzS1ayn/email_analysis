Lots more. Thanks for sharing the new version. I like that the new
version exposes the source of the claims. Very neat. 
I'd still be interested to see a definition (just plain old prose, 
not FOL/OWL etc) for this class.

Ah, that explains the slant. They're in the news today btw:
http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=83F3C459-47EE-4A24-82943B3856E793F0

[[
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell has acknowledged that a recent
government report on global terrorism contains errors and will be
corrected.

The report, called "Patterns of Global Terrorism," concluded that in
2003 the number of terrorism attacks worldwide was at its lowest point
in 34 years. Bush Administration officials had offered the finding as
proof the war on terror was going well.

The finding however was criticized by academics and intelligence
analysts, who said a number of terrorist attacks were omitted, including
attacks in Turkey and Chechnya that claimed several hundred lives.

Mr. Powell denied accusations that the data had been manipulated for
political gain. The secretary said mistakes by a new terrorism data
collection office contributed to an undercount of attacks.

Looks interesting, I think I saw this or a draft before from Guha.
I'll have a closer look...

Ah that was the one I saw. Will re-read.

I was thinking at a different granularity. It's more than people like me
who have other RDF vocabs that TAP could fit nicely into might be warier
of endorsing its usage (in tools and software) if it appears to have too
much stuff scraped from dodgy US govt sources. In particular, a lot
of Europeans are particularly sensitive about such things in the last
year or so. TAP's got a reasonably good chance of being the first big 
and cross-domain instance-oriented RDF data source that people start to 
base things around. But the more controversial pieces there are, the 
harder it is to claim TAP as a common base for everyone to build on.

Yep, Wikipedia seems to be doing pretty well on this front.

BTW re collaborative data production, have you seen MusicBrainz? The 
project seems to be maturing nicely. They have RDF-friendly data model
and Web service interfaces, and CD/Album/etc track listings for a lot of
artists, as well as TRM digital fingerprints of audio recordings.

http://www.ldodds.com/blog/archives/000130.html is draft of a schema.
http://www.musicbrainz.org/MM/ outlines the data exposed, with examples
and protocol detail (HTTP-based).

Some data dumps can be found in
ftp://ftp.musicbrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz although I can't connect right
now.

I wonder what the overlap is between TAP and MB...
