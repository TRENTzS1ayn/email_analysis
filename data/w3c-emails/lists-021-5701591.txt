    Hi all,

    First of all, my name is Paul - Alexandru CHIRITA and I am doing my
Ph.D. on Web searching in L3S (Learning Lab Lower Saxony), Germany. Raluca
is one of my master students and she will be trying to extend the TAP system
in the next few months. We are still in an initial phase, so please excuse
any too simple questions we will probably ask.

    An initial question would be "how could somebody extend the actual
knowledge base of TAP"?... And of course, how was this initially built? Are
there some tools to build it automatically? I suppose yes, but I don't know
any of them. Of course, for now we can and will start with the KB provided
on the TAP site, but it would help a lot to know how it was actually
built...

    Finally, are there any other resources or tutorials,etc. on the GetData
interface, except for the ones on the TAP site?

    Thank you very much for the big help,
    Paul - Alexandru CHIRITA.
