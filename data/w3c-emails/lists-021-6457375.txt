Hi Andrew.

Well, typically a requirements document comes first.

Its about using SVG for print - not just 'print this SVG file i am
viewing' but also 'generate SVG in print driver for sending to
SVG-enabled printer'. This may or may not require a separate profile.
It could also be a set of efficiency guidelines, color matching
guidelines, and information for optimising workflows.
