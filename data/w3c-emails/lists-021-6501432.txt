Dean,

Just a quick procedural/bureaucracy question.

In the "Status of this document" section ... which nobody else reads :) ... 
it says that the document will eventually be published as a W3C Note.

Typically, Requirements documents in the recent past are just left as Working 
Drafts. Is targetting a Note a new W3C standard procedure? Or an SVG WG 
innovation?
