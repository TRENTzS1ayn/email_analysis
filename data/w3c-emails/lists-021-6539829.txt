Jon,

thanks for pointing this out :-)

I like what I see....this looks like it will fit my needs.

SVG just keep getting better and better....I glad to see SVGP moving forward. I have been telling my Graphic Design Pre press people.....They are becoming more interested :-)

Hi Robert,
The SVG spec says that you print SVG files as if the animation elements
