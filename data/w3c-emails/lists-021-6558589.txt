This can be done already by specifying the width and height of the
image, and also providing a viewBox that sets up the map-coordinates
to physical-coordinates relationship.

Another thing that is useful in that context is the SVG mapping
metadata:

RRegf> French Ministery of Transports

Any publicly accessible use of SVG there that you could point me to?
Its always good to see real-world examples, especially from industry
and government.
