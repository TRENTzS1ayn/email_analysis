Oh, yes, I agree you can have a complete control on what part of the drawing
the user will see, in terms of drawing coordinates or even of geographic
coordinates in SVG1.1. 

But on the subject of printing, I think that's not enough to manage
rendering scale : you also need to have complete control on or information
about physical aspects of the support, e.g. at least a way to map your
drawing units to paper units.
 
You may answer that it's not SVG's responsability to take care of this, but
from an user point of view, I think there is a need for this.

I'd be delighted to give you this kind of thing, but unfortunately there
isn't yet.
From what I'm aware of, there are two projets under developpement running
here :
- one is about an intranet application for managing highways maintenance
- the other is about distributing public information about traffic
conditions, like this :
http://www.bison-fute.equipement.gouv.fr/tigron/tigron6.htm (currently based
on Java applet). But this one isn't going on very quickly...

Bye,
