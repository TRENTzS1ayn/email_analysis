I found a few grammatical errors in WD-SVGPrint-20030715.

In the sentence ?As of this publication, the SVG Working Group are not aware
of any royalty-bearing patents they believe to be essential to SVG,? ?are?
should be ?is?.

In 1., ?e.g? should be spelled with two periods (?e.g.?).

In the sentence ?The public are welcome to comment on any aspect in this
document, but there are a few areas in which the SVG Working Group are explicitly
requesting feedback,? the ?are? after ?Group? should be ?is?.

In the sentence ?The SVG Working Group believe that collaboration with other
print standards bodies may help to determine some design decisions,? ?believe?
should be ?believes?.

In 2.1, ?formalises? should be spelled ?formalizes?.

In 2.2, ?modularisation? should be spelled ?modularization?.

In 3.3, in ?Note, that legacy content which lacks any streamable attribute,
must be treated as if streamable is set to 'false',? both commas should
not be there.

In 4.2, in ?The final choice for SVG Print devices is left to vendors, the
following sections describe some available bundling options for consideration,?
the comma should be a semicolon.

In 4.3.1 and 4.3.3, ?utilising? should be spelled ?utilizing?.

In 4.3.3, ?Multipex? should be spelled ?Multiplex?.

In 5.1, ?minimises? should be spelled ?minimizes?.

In 5.1.1, ?accomodate? should be spelled ?accommodate?.

Thanks,
