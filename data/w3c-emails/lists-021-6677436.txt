Let us introduce ourselves. We are one of a small study group that mainly
focused on the printer controller, driver, connectivities and its printing
related subjects. The group is composed by printer vendors, software
vendors and
other developers in locally.  Recently, we have an opportunity to review
the
proposed SVG Printing Requirement. After our preliminary study, we have
several questions regarding the usage scenarios and special printing
considerations.

When printing some variable data (spreadsheets) or profile such as personal
or
confidential information, we believe that SVGP files can easily be seen by
the
viewer and if it is stored or saved, the data may be possible to hacked by
the
third party since that contents or data are XML written. To solve such a
cases,
the PDF is secured by password protection but how SVGP could avoid or
manage
this issue?

Also, it is known that the SVGP is text and is easy to altered or modified
its
data.
It is necessary to have some way to prevent against such alteration or
modification since the security or confidentiality of original data or file
should be kept in order.

We would appreciate it if you could study our concerns.

Thank you.
