Are you asking at a specification level or an implementation level?

At the spec level the answer is 'of course' since nothing prevents
this. The svg has already been moved from server to client; it can
clearly be saved locally and further manipulated.

At the implementation level the answer is 'ask the svg implementor,
the web browser implementor, and the word processor implementor'. The
crucial part is the browser since that implements the 'drag selected
image to desktop' functionality which is not defined in any spec..
alternative ways such as 'save svg' 'save as...' are also implemented,
for example. And then you would need a wordprocessor that either
implements SVG or allows plugins/activex/publish and
subscribe/bonobo/some other component architecture to allow
wordprocessor files to contain foreign formats that are handled by
some other code.

That would require more functionality, but is still something that
could be implemented.

Ah. Talking of printing and accessibility... Is it possible to take all
(pr part) of a .doc image and paste it into a word processing
application other than the one that created it?
