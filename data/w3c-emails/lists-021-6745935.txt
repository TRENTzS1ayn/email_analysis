Chris,

thanks for replying,

well yes:
teaching staff visit peepo.com copy images from the site and paste them 
into a word document which they then print. Students who cannot read 
then follow the list of graphics to navigate to the relevant website 
'independently'. We are studying whether and how well this leads to 
student directed independent browsing at peepo.com. More able students 
with minimal reading skills, and even some able readers use peepo.com 
independently already. examples created by staff using this process are 
here: http://www.learningdifferently.com/develop/worksheets/.

this ability to repurpose the partial content using copy and paste 
should be part of the original SVG standard.
It is slightly complex, would <g></g> and <svg></svg> be natural 
divisions? at least to start with. One would then need the option to 
copy page, or copy image(group)
Could amaya implement this? I've sent an enhancement request to the 
Amaya list. perhaps you could comment there?

thanks

Jonathan
