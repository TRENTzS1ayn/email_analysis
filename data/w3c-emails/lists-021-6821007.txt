I have created a svg document by setting document size (width, height)
in millimeters.
I displayed that in an explore 5.0 browser and took a print out.
 
The width and height is different to the actual size. The height is
incremented. Width is reduced.  When I convert that to jpeg and take the
print out in similar manner, document is printed with correct width and
height.
Do I need to set specific settings to take a print out of svg document
from browser.
 
Please help me
Thank you
