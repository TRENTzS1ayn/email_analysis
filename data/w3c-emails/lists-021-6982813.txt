SVG itself has SVG fonts as a native type of font.  If you were
embedding glyphs for a CJKV document, you can do it via the use
of SVG fonts.

If you mean downloading OpenType or similar fonts, this is a vendor
specific issue.  I expect that individual vendors would mandate how
that is done - most probably via some form of job bundling using
JDF or similar.

Hope that helps.

Alex
