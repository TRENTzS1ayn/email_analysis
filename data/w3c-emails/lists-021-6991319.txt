I wasn't aware that there is a spec for font outlines described via SVG.
Sounds nice - but it seems to have to write another converter
(TTF/OTF/PS Type1/BDF/PCF) --> SVG-Font... ;-(

Two questions:
- Is there already such a converter available somewhere ?
- IS there any utility which supports SVG fonts (to test the output of
my converter code) ?

It seems that the "SVG fonts" option is the way which should be used for
SVGPrint, otherwise the neccesary support code within devices such as
printers would become much larger just to support another bunch of font
formats (and the SVGPrint spec would need to specify a standard for
downloading such "alien" (e.g. non-XML syntax based) font formats).
