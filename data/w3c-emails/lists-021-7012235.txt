Hi Roland,

I believe there is a converter for TrueType somewhere, I can't remember
where though.

The Adobe & Corel SVG plugins & Batik's Squiggle viewer will support
display of SVG fonts.

Yes, also SVG fonts allow for exactly reproducable results on all
implementations and have good support for Unicode as well.
