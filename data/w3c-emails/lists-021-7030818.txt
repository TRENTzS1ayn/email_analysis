I played around trying to get Freetype2 to export SVG fonts.
The SVG bit is fairly easy. For some reason I was having trouble
with Freetype (probably using the wrong APIs).

The truetype->SVG convertor Alex mentioned is part
of the Apache Batik project http://xml.apache.org/batik

There is another convertor here:

Support for SVG font (outlines) is required for conformance to
any profile of SVG (Tiny, Basic or Full). So, lots of viewers
support it (eg. the BitFlash and ZOOMON mobile viewers).

Batik is Java, so it runs on Solaris and Linux, and has source
code.

The Adobe viewer also runs on linux and solaris.

We are considering adding hinting in SVG 1.2, but we can't promise
it yet.

There is also the alternative to embed the OpenType (or whatever format)
font within the SVG using base64 encoding and the CSS Web Font
facility. Illustrator does this, with an Adobe specific font
format called CEF.
