Take a look at
http://xprint.mozdev.org/lxr/http/source/xprint/src/xprint_main/xc/programs/Xserver/Xprint/ps/psout_ftpstype3.c
- that's a very very simple FreeType2--->PS Type3 outline font converter
- does that help somehow ?

Nice... seems I have lots of tools for testing my code... :)

What about doing the reverse, e.g. adding features from the OpenType/AAT
(Apple Advanced Typograph) repository to the SVG1.2-Fonts feature list ?

Questions is whether this is wise since this will add extra complexity
to the code in the destination device. It may be better to say
explicitly "NO" to non-"SVG font"-based fonts to avoid that implementors
all do their "proprietary" font formats, making it hard to exchange
SVGPrint documents without running into font format mismatch problems
between generator and viewer (one alternative would be to create a
SVGPrint version of Adobe's PPD (again, more complexity, more fun for
the people who have to implement this and more pain for the enduser
<example>who doens't understand why his laptop SVG viewer refuses to
load a SVGPrint document while the mobile phone can display it</example>
=:-)).
