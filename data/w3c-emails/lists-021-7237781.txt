I don't think that this is particularly useful.  What happens if a URI is
used in contradictory fashion?  Does this make *the* meaning of the URI be
a contradiction?

Well, this would certainly lead to a nice denial of service attack on the
Semantic Web.  Just use lots of URIs in unusual ways, thus polluting *the*
meaning of these URIs.

Hmm.  Perhaps a different metric would be useful.  If a URI does not reach
contradictory status then it probably wasn't good enough in the first place.

One nice aspect of this theory of meaning is that the naming authority has
no special powers.

Not so useful.
