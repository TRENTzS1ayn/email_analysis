Certainly not.

If you don't know the meaning of a word....do you ask an authority or do you
look it up in a dictionary?

[Since natural language dictionaries reflect the current common use of 
the words of a language, wouldn't it be nice to have URI-dictionary
services on the Web?]

Either way you gotta be careful which (RDF-)documents you trust
and which not. Or do you suggest to only use those issued and
controlled by the authority? What if an under-paid employer that
happens to be the Web master goes nuts and publishes millions of
of contradictory RDF statements?

So while this is definitely a semantic Web issue, it is not
limited to my suggestion.

Even better: it has responsibilities (if it cares for it's URIs)!
