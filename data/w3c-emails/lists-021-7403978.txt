This all makes a lot of sense to me.   But...

This is what it looks like, from a distance, but the RDF specs
themselves neither support nor advocate this approach.  It's just
something that some RDF users like to do.  The hash has as much
meaning in RDF as does the capitalization of the first letter (ie,
none to the machines).

I once proposed they make this split real [1], but RDF Core declined.
(More formally, as I recall, they simply didn't chose to decide
anything about it, in the days right before Last Call #1, and I never
raised it as a Last Call issue.)  Also, when I tried to implement it,
I found it rather painful, so since then I've focussed on how to live
with one shared context; I've found it surprisingly possible.  Some
notes near [2].
