Thanks, and the following is intended in a spirit of 
getting-things-clear-by-debate rather than as hostile.

Exactly. Though that word 'context' often comes with some unfortunate 
baggage (which I don't think you intend here.)

If I follow you correctly, I think this is rather like saying that we 
should adopt arithmetic in order to do our sums.  Semantics just IS 
context-dependent in this sense: we don't need to adopt anything, we 
just need to wake up and smell the coffee.  That is what Ive been 
yelling about.  (Not that Im exactly *disagreeing* here, you 
understand...)

Right...but....

Why?? You have just said that this is the *operational* meaning. I 
agree. But that doesn't restrict the *denotation* at all. It could go 
on having that operational meaning and denote anything we liked it 
to.  Consider it practically: suppose its embedded in some OWL and an 
OWL reasoner draws some conclusions, but never invokes the http 
protocols using it. So what? Nothing is thereby damaged and no harm 
is caused to anything. Conversely, suppose someone pings the URI and 
http fetches some html for you: the OWL reasoning doesn't give a damn 
about that and may not even know it has happened.

Obviously it would be handy if we could have some kind of 
relationship between the two, but it isn't *necessary*. And we have 
some freedom in deciding how best to do it, if we want to try.

Well, we could say that, I guess, but Im not sure that is the best 
thing to say in all cases. We all need to discuss this in more 
detail, preferably with a good range of examples of what those 
'results' might be. (And, I thought that the proposal on the table 
was that the bare URI would denote the actual REST-resource, the 
thing at the end of the path, not whatever that resource emitted when 
you http-poke it. )

My problem with this is that it begs a central question: when does a 
description identify something? Most descriptions (formal or in 
English) don't identify single referents uniquely, and it has been 
notoriously hard to state conditions on the form of the descriptions 
which can guarantee that they do. So I worry that unless this is more 
fleshed out, it will be meaningless while seeming meaningful, which 
is a dangerous combination.

Well, not exactly. There's no assumption that the URI#s are doing any 
'identifying'. They denote something, and whatever they denote, it 
had better satisfy the RDF/OWL assertions made using it. But that's 
about all you can decently say, and all you really need to say, as 
far as RDF/OWL is concerned.

I really don't think this is how it works. The ontology machinery 
does not in any way depend on URIs having unique referents.  Hardly 
any of them do, in fact.  Like, for example, NONE of the RDF, RDFS or 
OWL reserved terms have unique referents (except possibly 
owl:imports, at any given instant).

And that is *uniquely* defined, in *every* possible interpretation? 
Are you sure? How was that done?

Well, take your example: doesn't that idea of a 'namespace' reside 
ultimately in usage among a community? I don't think there is a 
machine-readable definition anywhere, or even what it could possibly 
look like. Ive never even seen a tight English definition.

You are here *assuming* that there can only be one meaning, though. 
But different protocols can use the same URI differently. There's no 
doubt about what you get when you give an http: URI to http.  But 
calling that 'the meaning' kind of begs the central question, since 
it sort of presupposes that there has to be a single 'the' meaning. 
But that's the point: maybe there doesn't. Then this whole issue just 
turns out to be a boojum.

Hey, that's OK, I can deal with that much overloading. In fact I can 
write code that can deal with that much overloading, and I bet you 
can too.

PS. modulo all the above carping over words, I think that we are kind 
of in general agreement on the essentials.  Encouraging.
