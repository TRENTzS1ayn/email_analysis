This is an off-the-cuff response, made in ignorance of the follow-up 
discussion...

It seems to me that the RDF/OWL-ish analogue to content-type labelling is 
class membership.  It operates at the resource level (as opposed to a 
"document" level), survives graph-merging, and can be used to sanction 
subsequent processing.  (Allowing, of course, that class membership can be 
inferred from the use of a property with known domain and/or range.)

I think some of Tim's work in CWM using (level-breaking?) properties like 
log:semantics may be indicative of this.  Hmm...
[[
semantics       The semantics of a document is the formula acheived by 
parsing representation of the document. (Cwm knows how to go get a document 
and parse it in order to evaluate this.)
]]
-- http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/CwmBuiltins.html

Begs the question, *how* does CWM know how to parse the document?  Does it 
assume it's N3 or RDF/XML?

Ah, I see you later suggest something similar:

But later:

Which seems to drag us back into the kind of regress that led us to throw 
out the "social meaning" elements of RDF.  I'll think some more about this.

If a community of users decide to get together and do just this kind of 
"abuse", I can't see how we say it's invalid RDF.  And their applications 
might work just fine within their private walled garden.  Just not so well 
in the wider Internet.  It's this extra-logical notion of consensus again.
