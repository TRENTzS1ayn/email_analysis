That a term refers to a document doesn't seem, to me, to really tell you 
what it means in any definitive sense.  The remainder of your message seems 
to reinforce this uncertainty.

One thing we can do about URIs that reference documents is make statements 
about them that the web community would generally hold to be true; e.g.

    HTTP-GET(some-uri,other parameters) == (some bag-of-bits)

In another message, you said:
[[
Anyway... I think the general case is that a
URI has meaning to the extent that there's consensus
in the Internet Community about what it means, as expressed
in Internet protocol messages, especially messages that
express a relationship between a URI and a representation
of what it means; and that the HTTP/DNS case is, while very
common, a special case where the Web Community has delegated authority
to one party

I's find it easier to agree if this said:
"... to the extent that there's consensus in the Internet Community about 
what statements containing it are true ..."
and a feature of the qualifications you add, I think, would be that 
corresponding statements are testable in a Web environment.
