The recent furore over some (large and powerful) company intercepting (some 
might say hijacking) unassigned DNS names might be illustrative here.  In 
this case, they were eventually pressured by ICANN to take down their 
service that was supplying (arguably) bogus DNS information, because it was 
perceived as eroding the integrity of Internet architecture.  The debate 
continues.

Which seems like your point 6.

I don't believe there can ever be an entirely technical solution to this 
potential problem of evil-OWL.
