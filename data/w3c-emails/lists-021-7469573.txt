While I agree with these messages, I'm not sure how they help with respect 
to dealing with the full spectrum of meanings that might be attached to SW 
expressions.  Except, maybe, from dissuading us from talking about the 
meaning of URIs?

Is there some analogue for "nonlinguistic context of the conversation" that 
might be applicable to SW agents?  Possible candidates might be:
- assumptions built-in by the programmer
- application conformance to non-formal statements in imported documents
- acceptance as truth statements some given oracle(s)
- conforming behaviour over given test suites
