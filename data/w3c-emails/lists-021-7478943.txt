I think this is fine, and useful, as a description of 'SW meaning'.

But I'm not sure that SW meaning has sufficient "meaning" to usefully 
relate SW application behaviour to user's expectations.  Under what 
circumstances can a user regard the output of a SW application as being 
correct, and when so, to what question is it the correct answer?  I don't 
see 'SW meaning' telling us any of this.

Yet application writers need to understand how programs interact with the 
world of their users.  Maybe you're right that it's not our role (as 
technologists) to define that, but I think that we (a) are reasonably 
involved in the debate, and (b) should try to clarify the boundary (and 
your description of SW meaning appears to help do that).
