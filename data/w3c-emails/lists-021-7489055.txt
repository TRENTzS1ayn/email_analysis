In passing, I would like to avoid this terminology where we talk 
about *kinds* of meanings, if we can possibly manage to do so. It 
suggests a kind of botanical classification of meaning-species, and 
this tends to encourage a kind of Balkanization which we already have 
a tendency to fall into, where each of us with various agendas feels 
compelled to protect the rights of one kind of meaning over the other 
upstarts. Maybe this is unavoidable, but we should try to avoid it as 
far as possible. I am convinced that these different 'kinds' of 
meaning are all aspects of one notion, and that we should be able to 
find a way to make that clear. Blind men and the elephant, you know 
the story.
