None of these seem incommensurate, so they could do them all if they 
felt it was necessary or useful.  It might be a good idea to take 
down their old URL and put a warning-redirect there to the new one. 
All the same options seem to be available to people using HTML to put 
up a website which is widely referred to, and who then wish to make a 
change, and feel some responsibility to let the world know about it. 
Nobody feels shafted by changes made to HTML websites, though, so 
this doesn't seem to be such a big issue there. Why are *we* making 
such an issue of it, then? If the Web had had to wait until a 
solution had been found to the Problem of Changing Website Content, 
there wouldn't be a Web. Maybe this just isn't going to be a problem, 
so we shouldn't be trying to solve it.
