Hmmm... I feel there is a qualitative distinction between that which can be 
deduced by formal means, and statements that are consensually acknowledged 
as truths by a community of people.  I'm entirely content that these should 
not be seen as "different kinds of meaning", but I think we need some way 
to talk about the distinctions and boundaries and interactions between them.

If we can somehow glimpse the whole elephant, I think that would help.
