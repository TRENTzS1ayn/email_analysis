Hi folks,

I got permission from Michael Kifer to forward this to this list. It 
seems to fit in with some of our discussions. Hmm. at first glance, I 
thought it might support a "comments count" view, or my own point about 
the gensym fallacy fallacy, but i see that it might be more against 
axiomatic approaches.

Cheers,
Bijan Parsia.
