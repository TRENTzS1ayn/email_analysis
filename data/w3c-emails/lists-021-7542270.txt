Hmm.  This requirement is rather ambiguous, as it could apply to a
proof-theoretic semantics as well as a model-theoretic semantics.  
Futher, establishing ``overall principles of what conclusions are
sanctioned from a set of premises'' could be statisfied by exhibiting a
program that actually performs the inferences.

Agreed.

This doesn't seem right.  The purpose of model-theoretics is precisely to
provide ``shared understanding of the language constructs'' and this is why
a model-theoretic semantics is not, and is not supposed to look like, a
``complex set of axioms''.  Perhaps Michael meant to complain about
proof-theoretic semantics, a complaint I whole-heartedly agree with.

Well, sure, there should be such an informal model.  This is what a
model-theoretic semantics attempts to formalize.  (I would not, however,
use UML as an exemplar here, except as an exemplar of what can go wrong
when an informal conceptual model neither closely corresponds to human
intuitions nor is backed up with a comprehensible formal semantics.)

Agreed.  It is possible to create a model-theoretic semantics that diverges
from intuitions, which is not a good idea.

Agreed.  If the formal specifications don't match intuitions then they need
to be changed.

Agreed.
