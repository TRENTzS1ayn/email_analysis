Yes, it is ambiguous. Was intended to refer to both.

I should have been more precise. What I meant to criticize was a
model-theoretic semantics provided via a translation to a different
language, like the first-order logic. It is not really a model theory, but
some people claim that they provide a model theory to a high-level
language by axiomatizing the language constructs in first-order logic or
some other formalism that was invented for a different purpose.

I said UML-*like*. That is, a set of pictorial conventions and other notations,
which *could* have been done properly.
