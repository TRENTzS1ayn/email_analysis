Agreed.  However, this is not really a model-theoretic semantics at all.
Instead it is a translation to some other formalism that may or may not
have a model-theoretic semantics.  If the translation is intuitive (and
simple and ...) then, sometimes, a model-theoretic semantics for the other
formalism may induce a decent model-theoretic semantics for the initial
formalism.  (But then why not take the easy step of writing down this
induced model-thoeretic semantics directly?) However, such translations are
usually not very simple and thus any benefits of a model-theoretic
semantics of the other formalism do not accrue to the original formalism.

The translation for DAML+OIL, for example, does NOT provide this benefit.
Even the simple translation from SKIF to FOL is rather suspect in this regards.

Hmm.  It would be interesting to see a pictorial formalism where this
really works.  Pictures are worth a thousand words, of course, and thus it
is usually the case that it takes more than a thousand words to really
tease out what is going on in a pictorial formalism, which does not
generally lead to nice logical formalisms.  Formalisms that start out
pictorially usually end up abandoning the pictures except for
non-authoritative display purposes.  (Semantic Networks, Frames, and
Brachman's original structural inheritance diagrams have all gone this
route.)  I remember arguments about what was really going on in KLONE-talk,
a graphical interface to KL-ONE that was abandonded, largely because its
manipulations of KL-ONE graphs did not correspond to reasonable
modifications of the underlying formalism.
