For what it is worth - most of the pictorial frameworks also get 
abandoned for two other reasons -- they don't scale well, and they 
cannot usually be emailed or otherwise generated quickly and easily 
and in a machine independent way that can be read using a textual 
interface.   Another reason is that as things get more expressive 
(and all these kind of langauges did) the pictorial framework suffers 
-- consider how to draw the difference between "allValuesFrom" and 
"someValuesFrom" in an intuitive way.   UML is still often rendered 
pictorially -- but users who use its advanced features complain about 
this...
   The decision to move away from the pictorial examples in KL-ONE is 
a good example of where the neats and the scruffies both agreed it 
wasn't useable, but for somewhat different reasons.

  All that said, it doesn't actually have  much to do with the "social 
meaning" debate, so I'll shut up...
