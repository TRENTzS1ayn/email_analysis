Hmm, been thinking about this one a while - something tickling my brain

imagine the above being rendered in the proper MUST, SHOULD, etc. terms

then imagine a number of informative use cases showing expansions 
where URIs are followed or etc. in ways that do not violate the above.

Then imagine some test cases which say something like
  All tools MUST return ...
  Some tools MAY return ...
(and this is not in any way implied to be a closed set - so tools 
which include the MUSTs but have some extra also would be considered 
conforming

Then stop imagining that these are called "meaning" or kinds of 
meaning or anything like that -- rather they are given some more 
proper title ("inferences legitimized by URI use in the RDF and OWL 
frameworks"  is a bit long).

Then imagine this appears in a document that also addresses some of 
the MIME issues for RDF/RDFS/OWL (what do we expect to be served up - 
if it is not differentiated then how a reasoner is expected to 
determine the language-in-use)

Such a document would seem to me to be address the TAG issue, would 
be a heck of a contribution, and generating would give this Task 
Force a couple of clear questions to attack....
