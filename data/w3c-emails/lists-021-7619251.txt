SKIF is one name for a part of the Common Logic work (http://cl.tamu.edu/).
See http://reliant.teknowledge.com/IJCAI01/HayesMenzel-SKIF-IJCAI2001.pdf
for a paper on SKIF.  LBase (http://www.w3.org/TR/lbase) is a somewhat
similar logic.  These logics have a higher-order syntax but don't have all
the power of even second-order logic and can be (relatively) easily
translated into standard FOL.
