Ok.  Let's replace "defined" with "mentioned".

I am not proposing any such registry, so these arguments 
are as specious as they are caustic.  As I say below, 
this relation is virtual, it would have a similar status to 
"...a network-spanning information space consisting of 
resources, which are interconnected by links defined within 
that space."

I can also delete any mention of the word "meaning" from the 
proposal without harm.  It is simply a virtual association 
between two keys.

Use of this protocol would be optional, there is no suggestion 
of locking down anything or limiting anyone in any way.

I believe there would be enough utility to drive its voluntary 
use.  It is simply a summary of ways for everyone to agree on 
how to link URIs up with metadata that mentions those URIs.  
But it does so in a minimalist manner, giving it maximum 
versatility.  It would enable every user of URIs to personalize 
the metadata configuration on every web page they publish.  To 
do so lets people express themselves better.  People are driven 
to be understood. That is the utility.
