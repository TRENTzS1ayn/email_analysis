But how is it possible to keep track of this? 
Anyone can use a URI in any ontology. The very 
word 'ontology' may be misleading here, in fact, 
since we anticipate, surely, that the SW will 
largely comprise SW-style markup, i.e. 
machine-readable content at Web sites put there 
in order to render content accessible to machine 
reasoning. In this scenario, 'the ontology' could 
be any of these or indeed any subset of them, so 
the potential number of 'ontologies' could be of 
the order of 2|n where n is the size of the Web. 
That is, if, as you suggest, an 'ontology' is 
defined to be some set of downloadable SW 
assertions which *mention* a given URI.

Sorry you got a blast of impatience, fueled by 
frustration; and sorry if I read your message too 
quickly.  But I don't think the basic point is 
specious. I don't see any reason for us to invent 
protocols or really do anything other than 
describe existing, or perhaps better emerging, 
practice in such a way that we do not 
accidentally screw anything up. To try to do more 
is, at this stage, folly. The world in general 
has not yet started using SW technology 
seriously, so we do not yet know how it will 
actually evolve. Chances are it will not in fact 
go exactly how any of us envision at present. 
However, what is certain is that  much of the 
current thinking about it is based on naive or 
just plain mistaken views about semantics and 
meanings, eg. that URIs must have unique ones, 
and that these mistaken views are the primary 
motivation for wanting to make sure that things 
happen 'properly'. So even if you do not use the 
M-word, the very idea of there being a need to 
associate URIs with ontologies in some 1:1 manner 
by ANY means is, I suggest, based ultimately on a 
deeply flawed view of what constitutes the 
meaning of a URI on the SW. (I do not mean to say 
that you share this view, only that the design 
you suggest may be inspired by it.)

OK, so let me make my point in a direct way: why 
only two? What if I want to virtually associate a 
URI with, say, a particular set of ontologies? Or 
with a historical trail of ontologies, changing 
as the world they describe changes? (Rather like 
a resource as opposed to the representation-sets 
it emits as a function of time, cf. the REST 
architecture.) Or with all and only the SW 
assertions made at any present or future time by 
any employees of Thingie Corp.? Or any site 
maintained by the State of Florida? Or something 
else again, such as the people I tend to agree 
with? What if a virtual community wants to set up 
a mutually-referring group of connected sites in 
which each of them shares the burden of defining 
the meanings of their URIs with all the others? I 
thought of those in about 2 minutes: I'm sure the 
planet as a whole will come up with a few more in 
the next decade or so.

I guess I can hardly object to a system for 
voluntary use. But is it, really? Or would it be 
more like a protocol which SW tools will require 
in order to function properly. After all, TAG 
groups are understood to speak with an unusual 
degree of authority.

But only in a highly restricted way, inspired by 
a fundamentally flawed view of what the role of 
metadata on the SW is likely to be. (For the 
record, the very idea of 'metadata' seems 
inappropriate in this context.  Most SW content 
is simply data.)

Why? Because everyone just *knows* that 
domesticAnimals:dog and domesticAnimals:cat are 
disjoint? Or because this can be determined by 
machine inference processes? The former hardly 
seems sufficient for the SW, and in any case what 
if Sally never actually said that 
domesticAnimals:cat means the same as the English 
word "cat" (which would be a very risky claim to 
make, by the way, in any case.)  If the latter, 
is Sally obliged to say enough in her ontology to 
ensure that this kind of contradiction must be 
mechanically detectable?  (Almost certainly 
impossible, since Sally has no control over what 
Molly is asserting, eg Molly might have said that 
dogs are a subset of cats, or might have just 
started talking about foozles, using her own URI, 
without being precise about what phylum they are 
in. ) If not, who is to say which of Sally and 
Molly is really right?

One problem is that there is no way, even in 
principle, to distinguish between a disagreement 
over content and a disagreement over reference. 
Take the marriage example: are the devout 
christian and the pragmatic atheist disagreeing 
about facts, or about the meaning (referent) of 
"marriage" ?  There is no way really to tell; the 
only way to resolve that issue is for them to get 
together and agree on a mutually acceptable 
terminology.  Maybe Molly and Sally just use 
words differently.

Another problem is that inconsistency is labile. 
Maybe M's and S's ontologies are consistent but 
when both are added to 
Smithsonian:DefinitiveZoology they together 
produce a contradiction. Now who is wrong?

That is the fundamental mistake, right there. 
They don't, they won't, and we should stop trying 
to find ways of maintaining this fantasy that 
they should or must. To the extent that tag issue 
rdfURIMeaning-39 is based on this assumption, it 
needs to be corrected, not implemented.

So, as I suspected, this is not voluntary; it has 
become part of the architecture. Merely using a 
URI will imply a commitment to this absurd idea 
that URIs have unique meanings.

Any of these proposals will make the SW into a 
large-scale but conventional software design, 
rather than the social/semantic experiment it 
could be. That would be a shame, to put it 
mildly; in the medium to long run, it means that 
the SW will either break, or (more likely) 
blandly ignore what the TAG group has been saying.
