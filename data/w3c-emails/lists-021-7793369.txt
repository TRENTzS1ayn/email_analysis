That would be a funny question. Fortunately, i asked what the *use* of  
certain kind of symbol require, which does elide "what does the  
(correct) use of a URI (in an RDF) require....".

Hence the question, "What does using a URI (in RDF) require of me and  
my software (to be correct)?", hence the issue of "What does Tim want  
to add to the spec as a requirement on RDF spec compliant software?"

I'm a little astonished that you could read the actual body of my

Not only did you leave me believing that you endorsed the "had", but  
other people as well. Be that as it may.

You seem to have skipped the key part of my Issue analysis which  
contains an attempt to analyze a key point from your intitial Issue  
raising, to wit.

""""that use of a URI in RDF implies a commitment to its ontology, and  
if
there is doubt as to what ontology that is, the web may be used to
resolve it."""""

I still don't find a reading of this that permits for *less* than a  
MUST and an "import". Perhaps I take commitment too seriously?

Uuuuuh, this is what I've been saying since WWW, where it came up. Why  
were you arguing so vehemently with me if you agree?

What in the current specs forbids this? Are you saying you want "MAY"  
language?

There is still something you may want to forbid, which is the use of  
other ontologies which "define" the URI (see the intuition pump). I.e.,  
that an owl:imports of an ontology not endorsed by the URI owner is  
forbidden. (This is the other half of the commitment shoe pair)

Frankly, given all the different things you might pull in, for whatever  
reasons, by whatever techniques, I think it's completely mad to try to  
standardize any of it at the moment. None of these things are forbidden  
by the current specs, to my knowledge, so let's not muddy the waters.

No. Really, no. To the degree I understand it (which I don't), it  
doesn't seem to be the ontological closure any more than cwm  
--closure=st.

I don't think I get the 't' at all.

I don't see it. I need some examples. Plus, why not --closure='ot'? or  
other variants? i mean, you compared one limited mode with EVERYTHING  
mode and then made assertions about other limited modes. I'm confused.

And isn't forbidden by the current specs. Excellent. There's nothing

It seems to me that you think you've identified a critically useful  
"closure" principle. But it's not widely deployed, nor is there a lot  
of experience, nor to my knowledge is there a formal account, nor is  
there anything in the current documents that forbid it or even make it  
difficult. So, again, what do you think is missing and why do you think  
we need to put it "in" somewhere?

How does your closure stuff have anything to do with  
"meaning/denotation"? (Er...meaning and denotation aren't alternative  
terms.)

"basically"? "the same" always?

Well, if the issue is "what gets included" I stand by my procedural  
point. The connection between meaning and inclusion is tenuous (and I  
don't recall a good clear argument for it, yet, and some movement  
against it), and the connection between denotation and inclusion even  
more so.

Interestingly, I tend to radically disagree, at least in some sense.  
Well, not the last part, but that if there's to be anything distinctive  
about the semantic web qua KR system, its that it brings hypertext  
deeply inside KR (I call this "HyperKrep" :)).

But gosh, I have no idea what it even MEANS. Something about being able  
to follow links, or with using hyperlinks to represent a variety of  
structures. But, really, I don't think we have a clue.

So, please supply text that captures your intent by the "use of a URI"

Well, yes. I read your text and have tried to figure out what you want  
done with such text ("included in some spec", presumably as a normative  
constraint). If you want neither that (or a similar) requirement, nor  
that it be expressed by normative text in some spec, then, uh, what  
*do* you want?

Well, your definition of what RDF means might well constrain me, person  
who wants to work with rdf correctly, i.e., correctly wrt its  
semantics, i.e., meaning, and what I can do when working with RDF  
correctly.

I may choose, of course, to work with it incorrectly, or not at all.

Yes, but I'd like my software to conform to spec. To that end, I'd like  
the specs to specify something useful and achievable. Adding wish lists  
seems pointless. Specifying best practices seems to belong elsewhere.  
Specifying possible practices seems pointless in these specs.

Not really. Though there's a bunch that's unclear about that. If I have  
a RDF graph, however achieved, I know what I can (RDFly) conclude  
(based on its logical structure). What I can thereupon do with the  
entailments (or the explicit facts) is a totally different, application  
specific, issue. How could it be otherwise? (i'm sending another  
intuition pump for this)

Now I'm really confused. Given the set of behaviors above, it doesn't  
seem too terribly hard to operationalize the various behaviors and to  
write them down and to give them names. If it's useful, why not do it?  
Given the base state is "import nothing", why not expect at least that  
of anything with an RDF parser?

Note: I somewhat despair about formalizing all this.

Than?

OWL ontology? You mean in the OWL language? There's an awful lot of  
syntax and semantics one has to implement. Little if any of it captured  
in any ontology.

And, I believe, somewhat disanalogous from the ordinary use of URIs in  
documents.

Hmm. I don't disagree with the fact that, given a natural language  
specification of the meaning of some term (probably a collection of  
terms) I, qua software writer, have to implement some code to handle it  
(or just apply existing code, or just my own reactions, in a suitable  
way), but I don't think we're even risen to the level of RDDLesque  
solutions on the Semantic Web.

I'm trying to figure out what I meant by the yick passage...ah, yes. I  
want to suggest that natural language comments can't reasonably be seen  
as constraining the *OWL* (or RDF) meaning of an OWL or RDF document.  
In this, I hearken back to Peter's "Getting the ball rolling" message.  
The whole point of having a *formal* "meaning" is that you can work  
with a narrower aspect of "the meaning" of a sentence (or set of  
sentences). In the first order propositional calculus, *all* I need to  
care about is the (stipulated by truth table) meaning of the  
connectives and the truth values of the atomic sentences. The wonderful  
thing is that I *can* do that...I can do useful things that are  
*sensitive* to the semantics of my sentences, *without* having to care  
about all the details. This is is where we get our joy, right?

By regimenting terms into a formal system, I say of the *defined* terms  
that they have no *futher* meaning than the stipulated one.

I'm no longer sure where I'm going with this.

Yes, this is part of the problem. But absent that weakening, commitment  
to an ontology is commitment to all of it. That commitment seems to  
commit one to something analogous to an import.

There's also the question of having "alternate" definitions. And the  
"when" of my commitment (am I commited to the ontology retrievable at  
the time of authorship, or to whatever is retrieved whenever?)

Hmm. I don't quite thing so, though i see where the impression comes  
from. It's about people *disagreeing* and wanting to make their  
disagreement clear. Imagine Molly consciously decides to adopt  
sally:person *with* her redefinition: "You folks have identified a  
concept and then said false things about it".

Well, perhaps. Don't these have to be somewhat integrated? Or designed  
in light of each other?

Plus, we seem to be eliding a key point: I'm concerned with the  
intended meaning of the *author of a document*. If molly uses  
sally:person and inside her document, she supplies a definition that's  
contrary to the published sally ontology, and she fails to owl:import  
the sally ontology, I think she probably *intended* to redefine or  
override the sally definition. As I read your "commitment" language,  
the best she can hope for is to have expressed a contradiction.  
Acutally, I don't know what you think she *could* have sensibly  
intended by this. It seems to me that her intent is clear, it's  
discernable by software, and it's not silly or somehow contrary to Web  
architecture. It does have the consequence that use of URIRefs can have  
contextual meaning (or varying meanings), but that's certainly true  
over time, and if true temporally, why not contextually? You may wish  
to *discourage* that, but I just don't see how it's helpful to  
discourage the obviously possible and sometimes useful and often done  
by asserting it's impossible.

So, this is broken out of the gate, right? I mean, why "intended"? Did  
you mean, "What the current URI owner current intends"? And what if  
they intended it to refer to more than one thing? Why is the one thing  
important, anyway. (I tend to strongly agree with Pat on this. And to  
go further that I'd rather that the use of a URI mean what *I*, the  
document author, intended it to mean.)

And this seems compatible with "And I assert other things about the  
'one thing' that may or may not be consistent with what the URI owner,  
fool that they may be, sez about it. And I'm taking my 'may' rights  
very seriously and not going to chose to dereference that URI."

Not even me, document author, with the consent of my document users?

I don't understand how we got from "naive, when everything goes right,  
worry about 'security' later" to this clause.
