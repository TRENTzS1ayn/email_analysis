- It would be stored on the web by web site owners who would 
maintain it themselves, assuming that the value of doing so 
exceeds the costs.  If not, then, as you say it would be 
ignored and forgotten.
- Anyone can use a URI, but only one agent *owns* it.  The 
social meaning of a URI includes this idea "...that the 
URI ownership system makes statements by owners 
authoritative weight"
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2003Jul/0022.html
I'm suggesting a protocol that supports this notion.  It lets 
an owner emphasize his intention.
- The richness of semantic web content at a site would 
increase the value of this protocol by increasing the 
options of what can be said about a URI.
- I'm not trying to define 'ontology'. I'm summarizing a 
number of suggestions I've read on these lists about how to 
create the richest possible relationship between the current 
hypermedia web and the semantic web.

- One reason is to formalize and clarify Tim's notion that 
the RDF specification should, "...empower the writers of 
ontologies to write specifications for those ontologies.  
there needs to be a passing of the baton."
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sw-meaning/2003Sep/0041.html
- This is simply some thought experiments in email, easily 
reversible exploration.  I don't think that is folly.
- Agreed SW technology will develop in ways unforeseen by 
all of us, but it is also driven forward by the combined 
vision we all have of it.  I'm proposing a solution to 
try to reconcile some of these visions.  In particular how 
to link the existing web to the semantic web without detracting
from either, and how to connect the social, ethical ideas of URI 
ownership and intention with the formal languages being developed.
- Interestingly, some of the ideas I summarize in this proposal 
are ones I got from you in prior emails to this list.  I'm also 
trying to build on the discussion mentioned in the above email 
where Tim describes his hopes for progress on these issues, 
"One is that Pat Hayes and I had a discussion on www-tag in which we 
established that the idea of everyone meaning the same thing by a URI 
is harmonious with the concept of individual agents having sets of 
possible interpretations of a set of symbols."  I'm counting on you 
to help me prevent errors "...based on naive or just plain mistaken 
views about semantics and meanings" while pursuing the other goals 
of full web consistency and URI ownership and intention.  
- The 1:1 linking is just a point of inflection between the web 
and sw-web, it's like a cutpoint in AOP terminology, a single 
place where links from one web to the other can pass through, 
allowing aspects of the social realm to be addressed.

My proposal would support all of these, and more,
using the new machinery you and others have built.  For 
the single class associated with that URI 1:1 could be as rich
with properties as any of those you mention above.  It could 
have properties of a set of ontologies, with an historical 
trail, a list of employees, the sites in Florida, even a 
class like SandrosDigitalCameraPicturesOfKidsArchivableIndexable,
with links for human viewing, machine browsing, permanent backup, 
and host site trust information for 50 years properties.
Once you pass through SWCR, you are in SW-land, with all its vast 
potential.  I got this idea from some things you said, "Here 
we are defining a new way to describe things, so 
lets use it ourselves to describe what we want to 
describe. Dog food, right?"
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sw-meaning/2003Sep/0135.html
and further, "...Now, lets suppose that as well as there being a document that 
you get, that the document says that it refers to something.  (Eg the 
document at http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema says "This document 
describes the XML schema namespace.") Under those conditions, then, 
accepting the truth of the document amounts to accepting that it 
refers to some unique thing. It might say that more formally in some 
way, or it might not say it at all."
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sw-meaning/2003Sep/0140.html
This is one way we could say it more formally.

My example was unclear.  I intended it to read as Sally creates 
sally123 and then says sally123 is-a SmithsonianDefinitiveZoology:Cat. 
That is, Sally wants her URI to be known as a cat *according to a 
widely held and accepted public ontology*.  Then Molly, who also has 
access to the SmithsonianDefinitiveZoology ontology will break the 
protocol if she asserts that sally123 is-a SmithsonianDefinitiveZoology:Dog. 
I'm just trying to capture the idea that adherence to an agreed upon 
monadic predicate is a facilitator of communication.

This may well be true, but perhaps if we could work out 
a few of the details of what it would take to make this true, then
everyone who holds this view might recoil in horror, as you seem 
to do, at the catastrophic consequences of such draconian 
mangling of the architecture.

I may not have worked out the details correctly about how 
to make it a voluntary protocol.  One where if you want to 
take advantage of it, in order to gain value from it,
you need to abide by certain constraints. 
- It is only by agreement of interpretation, that we respect 
the right of an owner of a URI to assert that it has a unique, 
but possibly rich and complex meaning.

Well, I'm confident that, under your watchful eye,
that should never happen.
