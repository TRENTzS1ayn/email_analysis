I'm curious about exactly what each of you, or anyone else, envisions as the
problem scenarios here. Is it 

1. An owner, A,  defines a URI to have a meaning which some other author, B,
redefines or misinterprets to have a different meaning in his document, and
then a consumer, C, reading B's document mistakenly assumes that A's meaning
is intended.

2. An owner, A, defines a URI to have some meaning, and then B takes some
liberty with the use of the URI; maybe something along the lines of the use
of the word 'infinite' in the phrase 'infinite wisdom'. A mathemetician
might argue that this is an improper use of the word, but most of us don't
see it as a problem.

The reason I digress to these somewhat simple examples is that it seems to
me that once the tools evolve, these judgement calls will be made not by
computer scientists, but by businessmen, supervisors, etc. I suppose we
could build some kind of semantic consistency checker into the tools; MS
Word RDF/OWL Check?

Naively curious,
James
