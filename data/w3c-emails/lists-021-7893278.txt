Ok. ACorp creates a acorp:uri123 which is a serial 
number of one of its acorp:StandardWidget, which 
is the product ID of its standard widget and has property 
listPrice = $2.00 according to its ontology acorp:catalogue.
BCorp, thru their sw-agent, buys a batch of these including 
acorp:uri123.  Now BCorp turns around and sends the batch to 
CCorp's sw-agent with an RDF invoice that states that 
acorp:uri123 a ACorp:DeluxeWidget.  CCorp can verify that 
the list price of a ACorp:DeluxeWidget is $10.00 and happily 
pays BCorp their asking price of $5.00.

Now the RDF invoice used two of ACorps URIs to 
commit fraud.  Those URIs belong to ACorp and it was never 
ACorps intention that acorp:uri123 be called anything other 
than a acorp:StandardWidget.  How could ACorp make this 
clear to CCorp?  One solution would be to publish at 
acorp:uri123 the statement, this is <> a acorp:StandardWidget.

Note that this is a boring, trivial example.  There is no 
inference, semantic search, or other sw-interesting ideas 
in it.  I'm using it to point out that URIs have 
social meanings that will become represented and 
communicated by the Semantic Web.
