BCorp lied.  So what?  Do you really expect the Semantic Web to prohibit
lying?  CCorp accepted the information that BCorp gave it.  Do you really
expect the Semantic Web to educate fools?  

The issues are whether CCorp has to trust the information it gets from
BCorp and whether CCorp can determine whether BCorp is telling the truth.
In a situation where information about a URI need not be gathered from
``the standard place'' I don't see any reason why CCorp could not go to
``the standard place'' in ACorp's web site to determine whether the
information it is getting from from BCorp follows from the information
available from ACorp.  I similarly don't see any reason (except for the
extremely limited expressive power of RDF) why CCorp could not determine
whether BCorp's information is inconsitent with ACorp's information.
CCorp is free to do this, or not.

All the above is in the most simple case, where one would expect that using
information consistently would be most desirable, yet there seems, to me,
no requirement that everyone has to use the same authoritative information.
There may be a cost to doing something else, but there also may be
benefits.

For example, suppose ACorp put up pricing information for its
widgets?  How could anyone sell ACorp's widgets for a different price if
everyone had to use ACorp's information about its widgets?

Or suppose that ACorp created acorp:invoiceuri3.14159 which has all the
right stuff hanging off it to look like a valid invoice saying that ACorp
sent 1000 widgets to CCorp for the total price of $2000.  If everyone has
to believe ACorp about its uris mean/denote then how can CCorp even tell
anyone that ACorp is lying?  This information will have to use ACorp's URIs
and thus will be infected by ACorps lies.
