You lost me there. What do you mean by imports?
If you mean it in the OWL sense*, are you asking
about the consistency of D alone or the
imports closure of D?

In either case, the answer is clear enough from
the OWL specs, no?


* which I think is a useless and counter-productive
notion altogether.
