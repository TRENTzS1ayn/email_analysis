very nice.

Looking up? Or drawing conclusions??

? Do you mean, any owl:imports statements? (In what document?)

Well, that is very sweet, but....

... if that really is RFC 2119 language then I think this is WAY too 
strong at the present stage to put into anything as wide-ranging and 
authoritative as a TAG architectural statement.

>Following links seems to me very much like a reasoning step.

NO!!  Please don't say that. Why is it anything AT ALL like 
reasoning? This is like saying taking a book of a shelf is a form of 
reading.

What might be good is to say that following a link is a way to gain 
information, and so in a sense is reasoning (where 'gain' means 'make 
explicit'), but that generalization is too valuable (and at the 
current stage of the game, too fragile) to waste.

Its not a reasoning step at all; soundness doesn't enter into it. If 
you wanted to say, instead, that a good notion of justification may 
use the act of following a trusted link as being itself a form of 
*justification*, that would be different: I would agree with that 
immediately.  That's like saying, I believe this because Joe told me 
it, and he never lies.  (Which assertion itself might be supported by 
reasoning, of course, and require justification, and so on..) So we 
need new notions of justification which generalize and extend the 
current notions of purely logical reasoning: a new kind of proof 
theory. Right, we need that. But that's a different thing to say.

>but I think it was Bijan who first told me soundness was vastly

Soundness *in reasoning* is not over-rated. Soundness more generally 
has yet to be adequately defined.

That would certainly be very nice and probably essential reasonably 
soon. But I think there is still some basic work to do before we can 
get there.
