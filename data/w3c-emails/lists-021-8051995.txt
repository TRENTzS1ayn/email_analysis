Yes, soon. I think tags like this would be handy for many engines, in 
fact.  Our graphic RDF/OWL editor needs to keep them around for more 
mundane reasons: even for writing simple markup, the user often wants 
to be able to check where a concept 'comes from'.

Maybe that would be a good architectural principle: SW concept names 
should always 'come from' a unique resource, which we might call the 
provenance of the name.  Exactly what this means, and what 
relationships there might be between the resource they come from, the 
representations extracted from that resource using other Web 
protocols, and what the concept name should be understood to denote, 
can all be discussed at more length; but at least that would give us 
a piton to nail into the rock.
