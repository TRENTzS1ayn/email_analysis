Looking up.  Arguably "--closure" should be called "--fetch" or
"--crawl" or something.

I would think "i" would mean that adding any triple
      ?a owl:imports ?b
would cause ?b to be loaded if ?a was already loaded.  That makes it
the OWL imports closure, right?

The "o" flag seems to subsume the "i", "r", and "t" flags, since with "o"
you'd follow the object link anyway.   Is that right, Tim?

Yes, I agreee this seems more like a research conjecture than a
conclusion from years of experience in building real systems.

So what are the underlying "years of experience" principles which the
TAG *can* promulgate and which underly this code?

Sorry -- I meant it as an analogy for illustration, not that it really
was a kind of reasoning.  (Although I was starting to explore that
cave, I admit.)  Swimming really is very much like walking, ya know?
