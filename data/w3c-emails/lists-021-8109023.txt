OK, sorry I was sloppy there. We need both, actually. A lot of the 
heat in this discussion seems to come from the cases where they 
diverge, so A is asserting a triple using B's URI.

Oh, please.  Did I use the M-word anywhere in that? Ive been trying 
to find ways of completely avoiding ever saying 'meaning' when 
referring to URIs.  Provenances could be genuinely architectural. 
Meanings are another matter altogether.
