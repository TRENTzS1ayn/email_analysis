Interestingly, the formalism for SHOE (the first web ontology 
language I was involved with) was based on what we called a claims 
logic -- we essentially said that the URIs used in SHOE (and it was 
URI based) were meant to represent claims -- that is

if document D said the SHOE equivalent of
   A rdfs:subclass B
then the knowledge base was updated with something like
  Claims(D, A rdfs:subclass B)

this was routinely rejected whenever we submitted it to a conference 
because the AI folks said it was silly to use a higher order logic. 
However, it had a great feature -- the claims logic remains 
consistent even when the content doesn't (and is also monotonic) -- 
that is, there is no inconsistency in
  Claims(D, X)
  Claims(D, -X)
the inconsistency would be in
  Claims(D,X)
  -Claims(D,X)
which could not happen in SHOE (or on the web, unless one invents a 
mechanism for "not claiming" something - such as using a closed world 
assumption or the like)

just a historical note.
