Interestingly, I note the log seems to include a fair amount on the 
issue of whether the p in "s p o" is somehow more important than the 
s and o.  This is one Bijan and I disagree strongly on -- the little 
bit of logic programming training I cling to always started by saying 
the Predicates are more important than the constants or variables 
they refer to for determining how the program runs -- that is
  P(x,y).
  P(x,y) :- Q(x,z), R(z,BIJAN).
would be mainly dependent on P, Q, R -- BIJAN would just be a 
database lookup, or would require looking for a rule with respect to R
  thus, when I taught Prolog, I taught a lot about design of the 
predicates, and nothing about the design of the constants except 
"they must bind"

DanC that might be the intuition you are looking for...
