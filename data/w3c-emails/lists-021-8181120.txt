Somehow these "fools" always turn out to be our brothers and sisters, 
mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, friends and family - even me. 
Automobile manufacturers were finally required to provide seatbelts 
and airbags to protect the "fools" that drive recklessly and to 
protect us from them.  I suspect they objected at first, saying things 
like "Its not cars that cause accidents, its the fools who drive them 
carelessly that kill people.  You'll cripple transportation if you ask 
us to get involved in these problems."  

There's another argument made that considerations of such 
problems and any solutions to them don't belong in the architecture.  
In the past, buildings were designed without regard for earthquakes.  
Over the years, thousands of people died.  Now building architects 
build defenses against earthquakes into the architecture from the 
start.

Its also suggested that we don't know enough about what the Semantic 
Web will become to act now.  I thought of this argument this morning 
as I was driving to work in an intense fog that comes over Northern
Virginia sometimes.  When my visibility is reduced, and I can't see 
what dangers lie ahead, I tend to become more cautious and alert, 
rather than less.  So why does the uncertainty of direction of the 
Semantic Web argue for doing nothing?  Are we hoping that if we 
just keep quiet and leave it up to government and lawyers, maybe 
they won't come back and ask us, "Hey.  Can't you do something 
technological about this? something like quake-proof buildings 
or automobiles with airbags?"

There seems to be a sense in society that the makers of products 
should think about these things.  Is the Semantic Web different?  Are 
sw-agents products?  If not, what are they?  Are they beings, endowed 
by their creators with inalienable rights? Do they have first amendment 
rights?  Someone's going to think and act on these questions.  Why not 
us, here, now?
