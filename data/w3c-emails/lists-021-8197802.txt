Ok. We do have mechanisms for handling Fraud. I don't see that extra 
machinery is needed at the moment. (Or rather, *What* that extra 
machinery is.) IIRC, the worry Tim raised was that without addition 
specs, companies could do that *and then* claim it *wasn't* fraud. That 
seems unlikely from your example.

Well, we need to be more precise. If the Widget were damaged or 
"refurbished" you might want to call it a :RefurbStandardWidget, or if 
you enhanced it you might ....

It does seem clear that they didn't want to call it an 
acorp:DeluxeWidget.

Sure. I'm not sure why ACorp is quite in the loop. How does CCorp 1) 
make sure it doesn't get ripped off, 2) document and get remedy for the 
fraud. The former requires some sort of verification of BCorp's claims 
(and if ACorp colludes with BCorp, relying solely on ACorp seems 
unwise). No one is against that, but current Semantic Web specs offer 
nothing, and can't really offer anything in the near term (other than 
VERY foundational support, in the sense of giving unambiguous syntax 
and semantics, etc.). I mean, you could also have a "trusted verifyier" 
that watchdogs BOTH A and B corp,and you only purchase when you've 
gotten their go ahead. The latter seems already there. "Look, in this 
signed document, BCorp claim that they were acorp:DeluxeWidgets...they 
weren't."

What more (concretely) is needed? Needed *now*? Needed now and we can 
usefully specify within the scope of any current or near term working 
group?

Presumably it does have some sw-interesting ideas *in some sense* (in 
that people think that "web of trust" and other supposed sw stuff will 
*help* with these problems), but I fail to see that this is any 
different than with xml or html or human documents, and I *really* fail 
to see what we can say in an e.g., rdf doc that would at all help. 
Except maybe "caveat reasoner".

I so don't understand that sentence, and have little hope of connecting 
it back to your example. So in so far as your were using your example 
to "point out" the rest of the sentence, it failed for me.

Uh...I don't by this analogy. The main point is that there is *already* 
extensive practices for dealing with fraud and lying. They may not be 
great, but they're there. In so far that the semantic web *doesn't* 
alter the picture, we should be careful about how we either paint the 
problems or try to solve them.

One might argue that the semantic web will permit radically new forms 
or scale of fraud or damage from it. But you need a way more powerful 
argument than your trivial example and a weak analogy.

But this suggests that you'll be *vehemently* against Tim's "naive 
protocol" and only prefer "robust" ones.

The analogies have well leaked over to the hysterical. One key part of 
disanalogy is that with earthquake resistent design, there developed an 
*understanding* of how to do it. Where's our understanding? Do we build 
earthquake proof buildings in non earthquake likely spots? Are we 
needing to protect agaisnt *earthquakes* or fire? Or flood? Or bombs? 
Is *architecture* the right place to deal with this (or building codes? 
or fire detectors).

At this point I become totally annoyed by the analogies. This is no 
longer argument, and the analogies stretch all credibility.

However, there's several arguments made in this line. One is that it's 
too early for *specification*, or rather *standardization* (write all 
the specs you want). That is, we should let practice and experience 
determine what further standardization we want. We think that the 
current specs don't *block* any or many useful outcomes and perhaps 
encourage them. Some solutions (many?) are *specific* to the shape of 
how people *actually* use the web. So we *are* being cautious. We're 
trying not to break what happens. So see, your analogy supports the 
view you invoked it against.

It would be nice to *know* what those things were. I mean, I *DON'T* 
have a clue of how to rid the web of fraud, lies, or even how to make 
it automatically detectable. It's more like, "It'd be great if these 
things were safer...hit the labs and come up with something. Oh, by the 
way, the automated chainsaws to cut through the doors have a tendency 
to lop of limbs. That wasn't a good idea."

It's not a product.

Many will be. But look at how crappy consumer protection if for 
software...you expect us to do better? In a couple of months (or 
years)? With pure techonological solutions?

Gosh, I hope not this last set. Frankly, they are entirely out of scope 
of this list, I think.
