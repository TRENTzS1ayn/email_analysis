If you want to come up with some acceptable use provisions for the Semantic
Web, saying that no one on the Semantic Web should lie, cheat, or deceive,
go right ahead.  You can even, with my blessing, try to give these
provisions some enforcement aspects.

However, I will resist any attempt to require that the infrastructure of
the Semantic Web has to act as if every statement on the Semantic Web is
the revealed truth.  I will also resist any attempt to require that the
infrastructure of the Semantic Web has to act as if every agent in the
Semantic Web shares the same complete view of any particular name in the
Semantic Web.  If these are required, communities that disagree in any way
whatsoever will be unable to communicate because any attempt to communicate
will result in inconsistencies.
