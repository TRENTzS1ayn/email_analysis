OK so far.

Suggestion: lets decide to NEVER make rules that require consistency. 
What we can do is to make rules about what should be done if 
inconsistencies are detected, or about who is responsible for 
clearing up the mess, or whatever. But if we say that its wrong to be 
inconsistent, then the task of being right becomes unmanageably 
complex very quickly.  Its almost impossible to be SURE you are 
avoiding inconsistencies whenever you open your mouth (or your web 
server), even if you want to: and as Peter points out, you may well 
not want to be consistent with everyone.
