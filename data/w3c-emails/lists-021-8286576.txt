I think there's a big middle ground which switches sides between these
two options.   To take the running-code example I posted earlier,
requiring consistency just means 
     :Coconut a bio:Cat, bio:Dog
would be flagged as web-inconsistent (assuming bio says Cat and Dog
are disjoint), but it does not mean anything for querying systems.  It
doesn't mean you have to give --closure=po or anything.  It makes this
whole following links thing stay optional in querying, and only be
mandated (more or less) in consistency/error checking.

I would approach that problem with some kind of scare-quotes.  I would
probably do the same in natural language: "That thing you sent me
isn't even an invoice!  The 'invoice' was just a napkin with some
chicken scratches!"  If I leave out the single-quote marks, the
overall statement starts to look inconsistent to my eye.  

(I spent a while last night trying to show how to do this in RDF, how
log:uri isn't the right kind of quoting, but....  it's not good enough
to send.  It is tricky, but I think it's doable.)
