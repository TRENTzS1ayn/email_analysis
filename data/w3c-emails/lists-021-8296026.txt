Seems obvious. Like the difference between saying that it SHOULD NOT 
rain, and saying that you if you want to keep dry you SHOULD seek 
shelter. One makes sense, the other just seems silly.

You might not want to have the mess cleaned up, and might not care 
that it be cleaned up; which is fine. BUt if you do, then we can 
maybe give you some guidelines of how to set about doing it.

I didnt mean to imply that the presence of a contradiction must be a

to use.

taken seriously.
