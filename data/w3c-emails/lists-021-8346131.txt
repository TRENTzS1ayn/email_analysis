Why SHOULD I NOT (and MUST NOT knowingly) create an OWL document that when
combined with the OWL documents available at some location that can be
determined from doing some text processing of the names in my document
would produce an inconsistency?  There are lots of good reasons for me
wanting to do this.  I might disagree with the information in these other
documents but still want to make statements about the names in the
documents, for example.  Saying that this is a bad thing to do (SHOULD NOT)
or even an incorrect thing (MUST NOT knowingly) is just stifling legitimate
dissent.
