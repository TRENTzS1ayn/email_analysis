What *can* you make? Perhaps that I think they're not disjoint? Perhaps 
pat:Donny is a chimera and has mixed cells? Perhaps I'm just unsure?

Yes. One issue is what else have I said about bio:Dingo and bio:Cat. 
(e.g., if I say that pat:DingoCatMules  sameClass intersectionOf 
bio:Dingo and bio:Cat, I seem to be saying that bio got it wrong.)

Eh.

Piffle. Why project your fears and insecurity onto specs? If you don't 
like it, communicate with your partners. You're free to say, "That way 
of saying this irritates me. I'm avoiding that"

Plus, perhaps bio is just plain wrong. Or silly. Them being owners of 
the URI doesn't help them epistemically, overall. It may not even help 
them wrt to their own intended (or achieved) meaning.

Even if so, it doesn't necessarily help them with what they *should* 
have meant.
