We have, perhaps, both. We certainly have the latter. We also have 
applications and application specific behavior.

Sure.

[snip another 'spec spiel', my first from Sandro; tim gives me these; 
word to the wise, they haven't worked yet :)]

Y'all act like I don't do any standards work, or am ignorant of well

Or rather, that nothing more need be (at least immedately) said on this

Uh. Right. I forgot about human society. (And standards are a form of 
negotiating with partners and are involved with such.)

Oh, I thought W3C specs were "recommendations", not standards :)
