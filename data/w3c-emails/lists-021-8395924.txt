Sandro - supposing I wish to send you a graph that points out that 
NOW believes life says at birth but that the Nat'l Right to Life 
group says life begins at conception --
  nrl:life :begins med:conception.
  now:life :begins med:birth.
  med:conception owl:disjoint med:birth.
would you say I MUST NOT send you such a document?
  I'm confused
