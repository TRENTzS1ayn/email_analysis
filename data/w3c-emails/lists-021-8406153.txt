Paraphrasing the above:

FUD

I'm not arguing against the desirability of standards in communication, and
I don't believe that Bijan or Pat are either.  I, and I believe Bijan and
Pat also, are arguing about what should be said and, more importantly, what
should not be said in the standard.  Thus trying to make your point by
arguing that standards are necessary, or that the world will come to an end
if your particular standard isn't adopted, doesn't advance your point of
view one iota in my eyes.
