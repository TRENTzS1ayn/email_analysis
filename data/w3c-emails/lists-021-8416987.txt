Um, the trouble is, I think, that not negotiating with partners doesn't 
scale either.  Beyond 1.

In this respect, standards can magnify the effects of negotiation -- the 
scope of some consent -- but not create such effects in the first place.  I 
also note that standards themselves are the result of a negotiation.

My point?  I reject the implication that we can disregard negotiation 
because we have standards.
