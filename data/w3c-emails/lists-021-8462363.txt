This is more of a test case, but it has immediate consequences for the  
WebOnt and perhaps the RDF working group.

***CLAIM: If Strong (or pt restricted) Ontological Commitment is true,  
then there can be no OWL DL RDF/XML documents*, all the syntax checkers  
are broken, and a lot of OWL Test manifests assert falsehoods.

*There may be some corner cases where the DL document doesn't use any  
of the OWL or RDF vocabulary. Hmm. :foo :bar "blargh". is an OWL DL  
document encodable in RDF/XML. So I'll change it to no "interesting"  
OWL DL RDF/XML document, where "interesting" means "using the rdf, rdf,  
or owl vocabularies. Actually, if you permit rdf entailment, it's true  
for all non-empty ones, I think.

***PROOF:

Ontological Commitment requires (some form of) the imports closure of  
the used URIs in a document.

The owl document consisting solely of:
<owl:Ontology rdf:about=""/>
Thus requires *at least* the importing of  
"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl"

Thus, *at least* contains:

  <owl:Ontology>
     <owl:imports rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl" />
   </owl:Ontology>
</rdf:RDF>

(see http://mindswap.org/~bparsia/ontologies/test/importowl.owl)

This is in owl full due to redefinition of builtin vocabulary (bit more  
discussion:  
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webont-comments/2003Sep/ 
0051.html).

Q.E.D

Ok, if you say, "Wait, owl:imports only has to have the *effect* of  
concatinating the graphs", well, you still, afaict, lose. I don't think  
the schema at http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl is compatible with DL. At  
least the direct model theoretic semantics (in any straightforward way).

So there's lots of ways to fix this, change the definition of  
owl:imports, change stuff about species tests, change the document  
served up at http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl (and the rdf: and rdfs:  
ones, perhaps).

I did think that some sort of RDDL document which said that the schema  
was "informative" and the spec "normative" might help. But who knows?
