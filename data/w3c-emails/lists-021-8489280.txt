I was quite happy with your arguing against my specific proposal.  It seemed
to me that Bijan was, however, actually arguing against the desirability of
standards in communication, or at least against some approach to
standards which I was trying to use.  (I should disclaim that I am no
great expert in IETF process, but it does seem like a good approach.)
I *think* he thinks we're just not ready for anything like that, and
standardization before implementation is a bad idea.   (And that's a
fairly compelling point.  I'm more interested in figuring out how the
system can work than in writing normative language, myself.)

What kind of statement do you imagine we might produce?  Would it talk
about people and software agents and what they may/should/must do?
