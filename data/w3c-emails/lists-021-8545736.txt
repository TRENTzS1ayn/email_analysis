Agreed. Very nicely put.  One tiny comment: the idea of an SW *agent* 
is often understood to extend 'machine' in ways that some folk might 
not have previously thought about. That said, however, what this 
suggests to me is that we would make a lot more progress if we 
focused on what effects anything we might say could have on how these 
machines are expected to behave.
