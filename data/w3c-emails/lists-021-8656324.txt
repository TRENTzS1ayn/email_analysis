This idea of meaning being based in consensus also appears in the work by 
Quine that I mentioned the other week [1].

A possible difference in position would be that you talk about the meaning 
of a URI, where Quine's analysis suggest that it's not the individual terms 
but complete statements that have meaning.  (I think that's a point that 
Pat has been trying to press, too.)
