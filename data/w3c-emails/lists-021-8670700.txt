I think that individual terms _do_ have meaning for people.  For 
example, the word "gravity" certainly has meaning for me.  It may well 
be that my sense of its meaning comes mainly from a large collection of 
statments that I have heard or uttered in the past - along with personal 
experience - but nevertheless the term itself carries meaning for me.
