So it may.  But we can never be sure that the meaning it has for you is the 
same as the meaning it has for, say, me.  What we can agree on, however, is 
some collection of statements using the term "gravity" that we both agree 
to be true.  To this extent, it seems that when we seek shared meaning, 
it's easier to find it in statements than in individual terms.
