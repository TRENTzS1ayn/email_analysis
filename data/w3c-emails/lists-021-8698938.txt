Sorry about the crappy/non-existent quoting in the last message.

So what? [ED NOTE: OUCH This came out *way* too snarky. Sorry, I was 
distracted. Read it as gentle :)] I mean, you may think that, it may be useful 
to think that (e.g., in 
teaching language), but its a very hard thing (impossible, according to 
many!) to establish.

Oh wait, I was reading you a bit too strongly. see below.

You may associate meaning with the term but what *gives* it is meaning? 
In other words, in what *makes* have the meaning it does? Also, the 
Quinian notion is more that statements (or sets of statements) are the 
*primary* fonts of meaning. That's compatible with terms having meaning.

Of course, this is in tension (surface tension, at least) with the 
compositional theory of meaning, i.e., for truth functional logic that the 
truth of the statement is a function of the truth of its components.

However, I think this is a blushing herring. Holism and consensus focus are 
somewhat distinct.

So, while I agree that consensus based meaning, in some sense, is present 
in some of Quine's work, I don't agree that his Holism (or *just* holism) 
requires consensus or perhaps even uses consensus. (For example, 
sentences telling me that I'm wrong in my use of a term needn't have my 
assent, or even lack of opposistion.)
