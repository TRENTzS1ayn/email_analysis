Refers to some object *in which interpretation* ?? This nicely 
illustrates Quine's point. Terms in logic don't refer to things all 
by themselves, by virtue of their syntactic form. They only refer in 
a particular interpretation. They really aren't names: there is no 
such thing as logical baptism, no way in any logical semantics to 
rigidly attach a constant to a single referent.

Now, which interpretation should I (the listener) use when trying to 
figure out what you (the speaker) mean when you use that term? The 
best I can possibly do is to assume that we are talking about some 
interpretation which makes what you are saying (plus whatever else we 
are presuming to be commonly held beliefs, the current contextual 
facts of which we are aware, and so on) true. If assuming all that 
enables me to figure out what is being referred to in the actual 
world, then I know what you are talking about when you use 'c'. If 
not, it doesn't.

>What is the meaning of c?

The question is meaningless.  Now, if c really was a name, that would 
be a good question, and the answer would be: whatever it is the name 
of.

>Is the meaning of c ambiguous?
>How is a URI different from a constant?

For these discussions, not a lot. RFC 2396 insists that any URI 
"identifies" a unique resource, but it provides no way for a resource 
to be baptized by a URI, and a name that isn't attached to any 
referent is hardly distinguishable from a constant symbol that isn't 
a name.

The key point is that all the listener actually has is the syntax. 
The intended semantics needs to be figured out somehow; and since 
things like c don't carry their intended referents on their sleeves, 
the best the listener can do is to use the publicly known semantics 
of the *language* and the general assumptions of conversations - 
people are asserting things they believe to be true, etc. - to figure 
out a narrow enough set of interpretations that the intended meanings 
can be figured out from the remaining ambiguity.
