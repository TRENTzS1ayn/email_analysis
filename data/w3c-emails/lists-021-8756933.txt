Agreed.

There is one thing, though.  People find it easy to substitute a word 
for a phrase, sentence, relationship, or thought.  After doing so for 
some time, I suspect that they tend to forget that the word is being 
used as a shorthand, and actually think that it is the word in itself 
that carries the meaning.  The word, I suppose, has become another kind 
of sign.  When this occurs, it may be easier, and possibly even more 
precise, to think in terms of the word itself.

Something similar probably happens to phrases and sentence fragments.

Does this have any relevance for machine-understandable "meaning"?  I 
have no idea.
