so still my point about weakness about resolvable URIs for Terms. I 
think we all agree that a

Term  has Meaning because of Statement 1
 Statement 2
...
 Statement n
If I understood, in OWL

Term is an URI
and Statement(1 to n) are URIs too.

Do you think a system where

Term = MUST NOT be resolvable URI
Ex: http://www.example.org/something/nowhere/

Statement(1 to n) = MAY be resolvable URIs

It has not necessary to be in the spec but it could be a good practice. 
Or it may be stupid. Don't hesitate to tell me.
