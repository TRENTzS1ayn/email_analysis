Agreed. Do I understand correctly that an ontology is an assignment of c to an object? An ontology is an interpretation (or at least a part of one, given owl:imports)?

Exactly. Just clarifying Bijan's notion of truth and meaning of statements relying on their components. I think he may have been talking about sentential logic anyway. I stuck with FOL to stay close to RDF.

From Pat's earlier email: "There is lots of evidence that even in the simplest communications there are 
misalignments in meaning between the speaker and hearer concepts, but they do not matter." 

While you went on to say that they matter once we move into the formal world, do they really? I have two thoughts, neither of which I am asserting at this time:

a) No, they don't matter to a reasoning engine bacause (perhaps better to say 'if') the different models are equivalent structures. In so far as the engine is concerned you can't discern the difference.

b) Yes, they matter because (some) meaning lies beyond equivalence (up to isomorphism). 

Statement b) might lead to the conclusion that the SW, as constrained by RDF/OWL, only addresses equivalence up to isomorphism and cannot address aspects of meaning beyond this, e.g., social meaning.

Just fishing for ideas.
