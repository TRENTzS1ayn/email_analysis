Yes, but an interesting thing about the Web is that many of the
terms refer to documents, i.e. collections of statements.

And if you know what <http://domain/doc> means, then
it gives you a pretty good handle on what <http://domain/doc#term>
means.

My thinking on this is very much in progress... there are
complications like

  - In general, URIs refer to stateful resources, not
    documents in the sense of sequence-of-characters.

    But... is there a useful idealization that hides this wrinkle?

  - how about looking at resources as agents; i.e. GET
    is sorta "tell me (or give me a form to inquire about)
    everything you know, to the extent you can in format XYZ".

    So foo#bar is what foo means by bar.

    I spend a certain amount of time swimming around the literature
    of logics of knowledge, modal logics, etc.
