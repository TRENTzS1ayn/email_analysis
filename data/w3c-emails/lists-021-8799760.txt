This is true of the English I speak and understand as well :) But then, 
I covet a large library.

(It's not clear that a document is a collection of statements, at 
least, I would have had an 'e.g.,' rather than an 'i.e.,'. I'd *guess* 
that many, if not most, documents on the web have plenty of 
non-assertional content.

(Uhm..this was less a critical point than just an observation.)
