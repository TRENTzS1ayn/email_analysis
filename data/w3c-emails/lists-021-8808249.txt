I think so, but after just a quick read, I'm not sure if you
should have worked harder to not make up a new URI...

I'm not sure there is one.

Isn't it clear enough? By introducing a synonym, you've introduced
a cost on anybody who wants to realize that the two terms refer
to the same thing (along with various risks that they'll eventually
diverge, etc.)

This text seems clear enough to me; what are we missing?

[[[
To help parties know when they are referring to the same resource, it
follows that URI producers should be conservative about the number of
different URIs they produce for the same resource.

Thus, the parties responsible for weather.example.com should not use
both "http://weather.example.com/Oaxaca" and
"http://weather.example.com/oaxaca" to refer to the same resource;
agents will not detect the equivalence relationship by following
specifications.

There may be other ways to establish that two parties are identifying
the same resource that are not based on string comparison; see the
section on future directions for determining that two URIs identify the
same resource.

[...]

2.8.2. Determination that Two URIs Identify the Same Resource

Emerging Semantic Web technologies, including "DAML+OIL" [DAMLOIL] and
"Web Ontology Language (OWL)" [OWL10], define RDF properties such as
equivalentTo and FunctionalProperty to state ? or at least claim ?
formally that two URIs identify the same resource.

It's not clear to me that the two pages should use different
names for the thing. (like I said, quick read...)

No?

Web Arch is giving advice that's pretty widely agreed
in data management, no? http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OnceAndOnlyOnce

No, things won't halt and catch fire if you make copies,
but making copies does introduce risks of divergence, etc.
And synonyms are sort of a pain to deal with.

That too... as I say: once you make two names, you introduce risks
that their meanings may diverge.
