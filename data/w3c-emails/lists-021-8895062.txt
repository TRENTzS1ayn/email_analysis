Is owl:imports satisfactory as an importing mechanism?   (That is,
does OWL going to REC get you part 1?)

As for the translation: do you want to end up with a namespace string,
or with some document fetched over the web?   In either case, does it
work to just follow normal web retrieval: chop off the fragment string
& follow any 3xx redirects you get?
