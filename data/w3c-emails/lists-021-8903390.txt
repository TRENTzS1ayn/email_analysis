As far as I am concerned, owl:imports is sufficient.  However, OWL going to
REC doesn't solve everyone's problems.  In particular, RDF is left without
an importing mechanism.

I do agree that it would be useful to import parts of documents, but I
don't think that this is essential.

Well, there are two parts to this, of course.  Both are necessary to get
something useful, but only the first part (name to address) is specific to
the Semantic Web, and even that part looks a lot like the standard web
mechanism.  (I do not know much about going from a URI to a document
(including content negotiation).  From what I do know it looks to be
sufficient for the short term.)
