I fail to see how an importing mechanism deals with the central 
issues here. The main issue, to me, is what one should be able to do 
with a URIref occurring inside RDF/RDFS/OWL/whatever in a document. 
Should there be a presumption that the Web can(/may/oughtto) be used 
to retrieve some kind of information which might be useful to an 
agent (human or software) in drawing conclusions concerning that 
URIref? If not, URIrefs in OWL (other than in owl:imports) are just 
logical constants, so why the hell are we obliged to use URI syntax 
in these languages? If so, what protocols/assumptions are to be 
expected or invented to support the nature of these sources and how 
to retrieve and use them? I personally don't find the former position 
(importing does it all, URIrefs outside imports are meaningless) 
acceptable: it reduces the SWeb to conventional ontologies which 
happen to be on the Web, which may well be useful but isnt the vision 
of the SW that gets me excited.

On the other hand, since our primary task is to produce some words, I 
think that it is important not to say anything which would be 
*inconsistent* with the conventional-ontologies-on-the-Web view, 
since that is where the immediate industrial applications are.
