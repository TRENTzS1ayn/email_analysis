Agreed.  Well, at least to the extent that the main isssue is what one
should be able to, or must, do when one sees a name in a formal document.

Again agreed, at least to the extent of permitting/suggesting/requiring
use of some other document.

Only because the mechanisms for accessing documents in the WWW and Semantic
Web are based on URIs.  No other reason whatsoever, and here is the only
place that the particulars of the WWW and Semantic Web enter the picture at
all.

I haven't said that (the structure of) URIrefs outside document-importing
constructs is meaningless.  All I have said is that the only *required*
access to other documents is via some sort of importing mechanism.  I have
nothing against permitting the use of a document accessible after some
manipulation of the internal structure of a name, or even suggesting that
such use is often a good idea.  I do have strong feelings against requiring
the use of such documents, except in constructs that only involve such use.

Agreed.
