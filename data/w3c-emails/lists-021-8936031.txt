I don't see that it's what one should be *able* to do. I mean, you can 
pretty much do anything you like :)

Ok, we've moved to what the *presumption* should be. But let's look at 
the three variants:

*Can* the web be used to retrieve some kind of info which might be 
useful....

Well, as long as there *is* possibly useful retrievable info, then of 
course.

*May* the web be used...

This depends on context. It's *not* permitted to look at an rdf graph, 
*then* add some extra web retrieved info, *then* draw some conclusions 
not entailed by the original graph, *and* claim that those conclusions 
are RDF entailed (or simple entailed), by the original graph. (You, of 
course, well know this :))

*Should* the web...

I think the answer to this is a resounding "no". That is, I think bare 
RDF (or OWL) entailment is useful. I think adding more explicit (and 
more, explicit) import controls would be useful.

Well, it's useful for node merging when you *do* explicitly graph 
concatenation. It makes accidental name clashes rather less likely. 
That seems useful. There's interacting with other software.

I think the first is actually a pretty big deal. You can use the URI as 
a key to *ALL* sorts of documents (and to things within documents).

They clearly aren't meaningless, on any proposed position.

What's that vision? I mean, I hear the "bootstrap vision" but I just 
don't even vaguely believe it. I sorta am interested in widespread, 
fairly interoperatable and shared KR. I suppose that's a bit boring.

And is a reasonable default, I think.

Applications will want to do more and other, but it's not at all clear 
to me what they *ought* to want to do.
