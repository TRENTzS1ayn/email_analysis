To:"Sandro Hawke"<sandro@w3.org>,<public-sw-meaning@w3.org>


I would like to propose to agree to use the term "connotation" to refer 
to those aspects of the semantics of URIs and SW languages that fall 
outside the model theory.  From 
http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=connotation the definition of
connotation includes:
...
2.a. An idea or meaning suggested by or associated with a word or thing: 
...
2.b. The set of associations implied by a word in addition to its literal 
meaning. 
3. Logic. The set of attributes constituting the meaning of a term; 
intension. 

I'm using the term in the sense of 2.a. and 2.b.  I'm not familiar enough 
with the literature of logic to know whether the meaning at 3. would be 
too distracting to render this term useless in this discussion, but 
assuming it is not, here is how this term would be used.

1. It presents a simple dichotomy between formal semantics, whereby
we compute the denotation of graphs, and non-formal semantics, where 
we consider the connotation of graphs.  Consensus D. proposed below 
can be thought of in these terms.  That is, we could agree that the 
two must for now be kept entirely separate and distinct, and for now,
the connotations of a graph barely touched on.

2. The definition emphasizes associations, which bring to mind linking, 
which is fundamental to the workings of the web.

3. It both brings back a little status to those aspects of not-formal 
semantics that have been used in W3C recommendations up to now, and, on
the other hand, it suggests that these association semantics are not the 
daunting "...large research topic." suggested in the current 
RDF Semantics working draft. 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-rdf-mt-20030905/#intro 
In fact, the connotations of an RDF graph can be very structured, even 
computable, as the Dingo running example shows, and very interesting.
This is true of the current web, also, with its spiders and search 
robots, that makes much interesting information out of the structures 
and patterns of associations in the web, even without a formal model 
theory.

4. It can be used to describe the terms and propositions which the 
internet and web communities currently agree to (more or less), in 
the sense of Consensus B and C., about the what the web is and how it 
should work.  So we can talk about the connotations of a graph to a 
reasonable webmaster.  This is what I thought Tim was getting at when 
he asked Bijan what he would deduce from:

:ancestor rdf:type owl:TransitiveProperty

I think it would have been better if Tim asked, "What are the 
connotations of this string to you?"  This avoids conflating the 
formal interpretation of denotation and computation of entailments 
with the informal considerations of associative semantics.  A 
reasonable webmaster might have responded as expected by saying, 
Well, the connotations of this statement are revealed by noting 
the prefixes 'rdf' and 'owl' and, using the conventions of the
WWW, looking up those namespaces on the web.

5. Its shorter and more accurate than "social meaning".  I Think 
it also effectively covers some of the sense expressed in the 
proposed consensus B. as "...the surrounding words and the 
nonlinguistic context of the conversation,..." with a single 
term, connotation.
