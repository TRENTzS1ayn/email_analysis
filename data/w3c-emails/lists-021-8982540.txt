I object. I don't see that it clarifies anything to misuse a term.

But you aren't. Since the meaning of a URI in an RDF document isn't, 
afaik, exhausted by its model theoretic meaning (er..which is an odd 
thing to say, but anyway).

In fact it isn't. My best reading of "social meaning" in this community 
*includes* connotation, but isn't exhausted by it.

And very important, concrete aspects of the meaning of a bit of RDF 
(i.e., how to connect what software does in reaction to consuming or 
processing some rdf with the meaning of that rdf) fall outside the 
usual sense of "connotation".
