Forwarding to RDF Interest Group and RDF Core WG. I suggest 
followups from RDF IG folk would best be directed to the 
public-sw-meaning@w3.org list, archives c/o
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sw-meaning/

RDFCore WG members may want to talk about this amongst 
themselves too, since it relates to text removed from 
earlier RDFCore specs. Either way, please trim your CC:'s 
appropriately in any followup messages.

thanks,

Dan

Organization: World Wide Web Consortium (http://www.w3.org/)

In a recent telcon[18Aug], the TAG accepted a new issue on the
meaning of URIs in RDF documents. The TAG expects to work with
the Semantic Web Coordination Group and the wider community
both to clarify the statement of the issue[3Jul] and to work toward
resolution. The TAG has asked the Semantic Web Coordination
Group (via yours truely) to help coordinate a meeting of the
appropriate constituency.


As a result of a related BOF session at WWW2003 in Budapest,
there's a new mailing list that I suggest folks use
to register interest in the issue and discuss it. In particular,
if you'd like to be involved in scheduling this meeting I'm
supposed to arrange, please say so there, preferably
by this Friday.

DanBri, would you please forward this invitation to the
RDF Interest Group and the RDF Core Working Group? I'll
let the WebOnt WG know.


Please note some of the usual administrative stuff that goes
with adding an issue to the TAG issues list isn't done. I'm not
quite sure the number 39 will be allocated for this issue,
for example.
