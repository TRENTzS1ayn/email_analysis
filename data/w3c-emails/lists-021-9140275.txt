Some of us have met in one or more of these fora:

  The TAG                   http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/
  RDF Core Working Group    http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/
  The WebOnt Working Group  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/
  Semantic Web Architecture Meeting
      http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/meetings/tech-200303/
  Budapest WWW2003 BOF
     
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-logic/2003May/0039.html

The TAG has asked [3Sep] for a clear statement of "the issue" and for
"work toward resolution."  Let's see if we can assemble and make some
progress here.  Under the guidance of the TAG and SWCG we can use W3C
resources, including the teleconference bridge.

Let's start with introductions.  Please mail the list saying something
about yourself, the issue, and/or the group process.  Maybe say what
you have to offer, and what you want or expect.  Feel free to give a
bio and contact information, or dig into the subject matter with a
position statement.  It may also be useful to state your constraints
and desires for possible teleconferences.

If in a few days you you don't see an introduction from someone who
you think should be participating, you might want to privately make
sure they know about this list.
