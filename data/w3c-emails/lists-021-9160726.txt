ABOUT:
I'm a Ph.D. student in Spatial Information Science and Engineering
at the University of Maine. Sandro invited me to sit in at the BOF in 
Budapest, so I saw some of you there. What I hope to do for my thesis
is fill in the question marks at http://www.spatial.maine.edu/~jim/table1.jpg .

ISSUE:
Even though a model-theoretic semantics gives a well-defined
meaning to legitimate statements of a language like OWL, people
can and do disagree about the relevance and consequences of that
well-defined meaning once they try to work with it outside the 
computer (i.e., in the real world).

PROCESS:
I don't know how the process might work. I'll follow the group's lead.

OFFERING:
A lot of questions, along with my best efforts to help frame problems, 
resolve issues, and reach consensus on positions and wording.

EXPECTING:
1. To learn a lot.
2. To see a solid, defensible position on "social meaning" be
incorporated into the appropriate W3C document/s, where
specific issues about potential mismatches between formal
meaning and social meaning are addressed via examples.

POSITION STATEMENT:
People who want to use languages like RDF/S and OWL will also want
strong guidance from the W3C on how they might appropriately delineate 
the roles of people in the loop of formal and social meaning.

CONSTRAINTS FOR TELECONS:
I'm pretty constrained, because I'll be doing a fair amount
of unpredictable traveling in the next several weeks. Best
not to count on my participation in a telecon anytime soon.

OTHER:
My wording on the issue and position statement is not as concrete
as I'd like. I offer it now just for something to chew on.
