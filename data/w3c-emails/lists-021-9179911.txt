I've been involved in the Semantic Web for a couple of years now, doing
work on the design of first DAML+OIL and then OWL.  I've been involved in
similar representaional issues for a couple of decades now, working on
various aspects of description logics.

My interests in this topic are twofold:
1/ Ensuring that something gets done.
2/ Ensuring that whatever gets done doesn't stifle the Semantic Web.

My fear was that the Semantic Web was going to be stifled by what was being
proposed in the RDF specification.  My fear now is that nothing will be
done because there will be the impression that any weaker proposal is too
weak to do anything.


A good time for me for the first teleconference is just about anytime the
week of 15 September.  I participate in the WebOnt (noon Thursdays US ET)
and DAML JC teleconferences (4pm Tuesdays US ET) so these times are not
possible for me.
