I was fascinated by the Semantic Web vision 3 years agao. My research background is Object-Oriented Programming and the semantics of programming languages (especially the OOPLs). Currently, I'm the principle investigator of two projects on Semantic Web and Semantic Web Languages, which are supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and Jiangsu Province Natural Science Foundation (JSNSF) respectively. 

As to the social meaning issue, some framework should be established to push the semantic web vision becoming reality (more quickly and easily). The social meaning issue is related to the people (especially the developer community) with different natural language, culture and more importantly the logic of thinking. 

Technically, contextual logic (such as contextual DL) and distributed FOL maybe useful to the solutioon. Frankly, I'm not optimism to this issue. However, the research result will be definitely valuable to the next generation of the Web, and even to the novel software methodology.
