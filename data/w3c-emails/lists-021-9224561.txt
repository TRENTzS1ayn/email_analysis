Hello world,

I'm an elected member of the W3C TAG. I'm also a member of the XML
Core and XSL WGs. I was once a member of the XML Schema and XML
Linking WGs. Elsewhere, I'm chair of the DocBook Technical Committee
at OASIS and a member of the Entity Resolution and RELAX NG TCs. I've
been know to poke my nose into XML and related standardization efforts
elsewhere as well.

I work for Sun Microsystems in the Java organization where, in
addition to my role as a standards wonk, I participate in various
internal and external Java development projects. I am currently
co-lead of the JSR 206 Specification (JAXP 1.3).

My interest in RDF goes back at least a couple of years. I've used it
to manage a variety of personal information systems and most recently
at the heart of http://norman.walsh.name/, my playground for exploring
the issues that the TAG is discussing.

On the notions of semantic meaning, the range of HTTP URIs, and
related issues, I think of myself as a pragmatist. I'm often reminded
of a saying that I learned from Eve Maler when we were both doing DTD
design: "you can't legislate morality". Claims that this, that, or the
other thing are true or false in the face of a large community of
people who express the opposing view and are able to get productive
work done, strike me as untenable. But I try to keep an open mind.

Like Stuart, from a process point of view, I think we should focus
initially on trying to express the problem clearly and succinctly. To
the extent that we can agree on a vocabulary for discussing the
problem, I think that will help us move forward.

My schedule for telcons is over constrained. I'm happy to meet
periodically, but I'm reluctant to commit to a weekly meeting. Midday
is pretty uniformly jammed up. A telcon on Wednesday afternoon or
Thursday or Friday morning (EDT) would be easiest.

I'll be unavailable for telcons:

05-14 Oct, TAG f2f and vacation in UK
03-07 Nov, XSL/XML Query f2f
14-20 Nov (or beyond), TAG f2f and vacation in JP
07-12 Dec, XML 2003

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
