One key fact about me: I tackily followup to myself. But only because I 
completely forgot to mention telecon constraints.

I have prior telecons Wed. 1:30-3, Thurs 11-12:30 and 2:30-4 (all us 
eastern time), and Friday afternoons tend to be occupied.

Cheers,

P.S. I had to send this very message twice, as the stupid reply button 
isn't really smart enough for decency.
