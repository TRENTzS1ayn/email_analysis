I have been working in the Semantic Web area for several years, having
been involved in the development of all of OIL, DAML+OIL and OWL. More
generally, I am interested in the design of ontology languages,
logical underpinnings for such languages, and the provision of
reasoning support systems. This work builds on my basic research
interest in Description Logics.

My interest in this topic stems from my desire to prevent Semantic Web
research from being discredited by (amongst other things) a failure to
maintain some sense of perspective about its place in the scheme of
things.

Like several other people, I also participate in the WebOnt (noon
Thursdays US ET) and DAML JC teleconferences (4pm Tuesdays US ET),
ruling out these times for me. I also have another competing teleconf
at 2:30pm Thursdays US ET).

Regards,

Ian
