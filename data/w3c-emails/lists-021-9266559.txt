I'm Jim Hendler, a Professor of Computer Science at the University of 
Maryland, and a member of the W3C semantic Web coordination group, 
cochair of the web ontology working group, and AC member for the 
University of Maryland MIND Lab.

I've been kicking around Sem Web stuff for a while now, particularly 
in the area of web ontologies, where I have been publishing since 
1995 when my research group developed SHOE (Simply HTML Ontology 
Extensions) which was both the first web language based on URIs.   I 
think issues of coreference, meaning, etc. are important to the 
Semantic Web and any effort to overformalize these makes me very 
nervous.

Due to overcommitment (see first paragraph), I probably won't be able 
to do telecons, but will follow the email and participate as best I 
can.
