Hi all,

About me:

Exercise always a bit difficult to do. I have thought before to 
subscribe which persona I should use for this list. I decided to use 
Karl-W3C to avoid misunderstanding with other Team members on this 
list. My other persona is Karl-LaGrange and like both personae have 
interests in common like the Semantic Web, it's always a bit difficult 
to  choose what I can say in which context.

Karl Dubost
Conformance Manager W3C - http://www.w3.org/People/karl/
Co-chair of the QA WG   - http://www.w3.org/QA/WG

I'm dealing every day with the painful task of trying to make 
something, which is not attractive, attractive through the W3C WGs. I 
have been on staff at W3C since June 2000 and I have been "done things" 
on the Web since 1992. The details to contact me are on my public Web 
page. I don't like personal phone communications but you can reach me 
through mail, irc (karl/#qa on W3C server, or under the name of karlcow 
on freenode). I don't have any problems with phone calls for scheduled 
meetings.

I'm interested by a lot of different aspects in the Semantic Web.
- Cross-Cultural aspect issues when it comes to model and describe 
something. How to be sure the model will not exclude alternate views.
- Use of Semantic Web to improve the information usage through Weblogs 
and XHTML. I have written some ideas on that. How "semantics" (HTML 
elements) and "Semantics" (OWL, RDF) can interact?
- Education/Outreach of the Semantic Web: How to make it understandable 
for simple geeks. How small applications could help them to understand.


Each time an issue is raised for the Semantic Web, I would like to have 
the possibility of an article with very basic concepts, which will make 
it accessible for every people. I find often what it is produced at W3C 
is too terse, even for people inside W3C.

So take me here as a lurker, a naive, and someone who is ready to ask 
the dumb questions to make it available to the public in a more 
understandable way.

PS: I have been/am astrophysicist student, research assistant, Web 
designer, technical director of a web agency, webmaster, system 
manager, web advisor on educational projects, journalist, basketball 
player, photographer, interested by writing one day an  "Esth?tique de 
la rencontre", ...
