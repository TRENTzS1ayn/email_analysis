After chatting with Norm, Stuart, Bijan, and Sandro,
 http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfig/2003-09-17#T17-08-18
I offer to host a one hour teleconference

  Friday, September 26, 2003, at 15:30:00 UTC time
   Chicago Fri 10:30 AM
   London Fri 4:30 PM
   Boston Fri 11:30 AM
http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?year=2003&month=9&day=26&hour=15&min=30&sec=0

provided an agreeable agenda emerges 24 hours in advance.

I invite telcon chair nominations. Chair duties include
preparing an agenda, sending it out (including logistics
details) 24 hours in advance, and encouraging the group
to follow it during the meeting.

Note that sandro and I have offered to co-chair this sw-meaning
forum, but there hasn't been any particular feedback on that offer.
I'm OK with the group remaining largely chairless, but
*somebody* has to hit "send" on an agenda 24 hours before
this telcon, per W3C process (which I think is well-motivated
in at least this case).

If I'm chosen as chair for this telcon, I'm not likely to put
a lot of energy into organizing the agenda in advance.
It'll likely go like this:

  1. round the table.
     each person gets 2 or 3 minutes. You can use the time
for whatever you like, but timing will be strict.
    an IRC bot will collect agenda requests while we do that
  2. I'll briefly review the resulting agenda and sort it,
    with input from those on the call
  3. we'll discuss the items on that list in order until
    we run out of time.
