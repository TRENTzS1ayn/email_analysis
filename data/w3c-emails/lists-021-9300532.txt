http://larry.masinter.net is my web page and not me.

In my day job, I work on documents, their
representation, and software for manipulating them.

Past relevant experience for public-sw-meaning:

I've worked on URI specs since '92; I am responsible
for quite a bit of the ambiguous text that gets the
most complaints RFC 2396 (URI Generic Syntax), but
also helped with many others, e.g.,
 RFC 1738 (URL), RFC 2368 (mailto), RFC 2397 (data)
 RFC 2718 (Guidelines for new schemes)

Between ~1972 and 1986, I worked on systems for
artificial intelligence, at Stanford, Xerox PARC,
and even as 'Chief Scientist' of Xerox Artificial
Intelligence Systems. That history colors my
perceptions of the Semantic Web.
