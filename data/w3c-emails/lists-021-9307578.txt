Hmm.  Given the lack of response, are we having a telecon?
Is there even a bridge available?

I haven't volunteered for any chairing roles because I expect to be a vocal
proponent of one point of view, and I don't think that this is particularly
compatible with being a chair.  I'll reluctantly do some chairing work to
get things started, but would like to quickly go back to being a proponent.
