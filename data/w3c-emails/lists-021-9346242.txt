"I don't think the Semantic Web will come from a specification that
tells us how to name and categorize everything. But it could arise, I
suspect, from our linguistic instincts and from the social contexts that
nurture them."

I enjoyed the article.

I think it will be nifty if we can write
something down about the "social contexts that
nurture" sharing of concepts between people
and machines thru the Wemantic Web... sort
of the marketplace groundrules that catalyze
growth.
