Perhaps we should have a round where we all reluctantly offer to chair, 
or offer to reluctantly chair? :)

If so, here's my hat for hire as well.

But if I have to suggest, I would say that neither Peter nor DanC 
should chair, given that Peter has a coherent proposal and Dan 
historically has been an issue raiser. Sandro says he doesn't have a 
position to argue, so, I nominate him as chair. That way, I can still 
be gadfly :) If it turns out we need more than minimal chairing, we can 
revisit.

Cheers,
