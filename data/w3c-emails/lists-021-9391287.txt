Hi,

I do techie journalism for XML.com, where I've written about RDF and the
SemWeb more often than my editor is probably altogether happy with --
including two or three pieces about the social meaning issue. I'm also, as
of a month ago, working with the folks at Jim Hendler's lab at UMD, where
I'm helping build web sites using SW stuff like OWL, RDF, and the like.

I'd like to point explicitly to a two-part article I wrote back in late 2000
which I think has some bearing on the social meaning issue (well, where
"some bearing" is defined pretty loosely).

The Politics of Schemas
http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/01/31/politics.html

My formal education and training (all the way to a half-finished PhD
dissertation) is in the humanities, particularly religious studies &
philosophy. I've been programming computers for 5 years, a field in which I
am largely self-taught.

I'm mainly here to gather material for future popularizing articles, but I'm
also writing a book for O'Reilly about REST and web services, and this issue
impinges some of the REST stuff pretty closely.

Best,
Kendall Clark
