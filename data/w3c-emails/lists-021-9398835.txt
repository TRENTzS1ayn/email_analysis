I called this idea "UseImpliesConsent", as in:

     UseImpliesConsent is the general notion that the decision to
     use a particular URI when authoring an RDF graph is based in
     part on the web behavior (such as content served) at that URI
     and so such use of the URI constitutes a kind of consent or
     approval of that behavior. 
     
                         -- http://esw.w3.org/topic/UseImpliesConsent

but, like you, I don't actually think it works.

I explored the more general notion here on

     http://esw.w3.org/topic/FollowLinksForMoreInformation
