This makes perfect sense.

I think it would be very helpful to explain the rationale around this 
use of the HTTP: scheme in "URIs that aren't URLs but might well be 
used like URLs to retrieve metadata about the URI"

Now, I have another question: should all "URI which are not supposed to 
be URL" considered like "potential URLs to retrieve metadata about 
themselves", or this is just a subset of them?
