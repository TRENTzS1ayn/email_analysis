Hi,

I expect to primarily be a lurker on this list, but in case I feel the
need to chime in, I thought I'd send out an intro now rather than later.

My background is distributed software.  Name a distributed/network-based
architectural style, and I've probably done something with it.  Over the
past 6 years or so, my passion has been Web architecture.

I believe the problem we're here to discuss is an inherrent one in any
large scale system which uses identifiers, and as such don't believe
there's a "solution".  I also think that it's unmaskable.  So my
preferred resolution would be a note which explains what it is and its
implications, as well as providing some guidance for how developers can
deal with it.  That isn't to say that there isn't some problem with RDF
that needs to be fixed (e.g. hash vs. slash), only that I believe that
any problem that is fixed, won't fix the larger "social meaning"
problem.

Mark.
