There are at least two ways to express this rivalry: We have two 
*terms* (molly:Person, and sally:Person) each with their own, rival, 
definition, or we have two *definitions* for a single term which has an 
associated concept which the definitions attempt to capture. Your (and, 
I take it, Tim's) view is that we have multiple terms, presumably at 
least one per definition. One thing I'm trying to get at is that people 
might reasonably take Sally's term as *naming* a concept, a concept 
which she then says false things about, strictly analogous with Sally 
coining a URI for *me* and then saying that I was born in 1887. Must 
people coin their own URI for me, in order to say true things about me 
that are contrary to Sally's false statements? I hope we all agree not. 
  So, what justifies the disanalogy?

In your view everyone DOES agree about what words/URIs mean. I'm 
suggesting that people might disagree about what *sally:Person* means.

I suspect that there will be some not so easily solved cases. Perhaps 
my example was oversimple.

Ah yes :) Deliberately so, for the record :)

How do I express that Sally *tried* to capture the concept that 
planetOfTheApes:Person (only superchimps have rights) captures? (I 
guess the common factor may come into play.)

We have a way of saying what a URI actually means in a graph/document. 
What's at issue is what *else* we have to put in. For all its issues, 
owl:imports vs. uri use gives you a way of specifying the "extended" 
meaning of a URI on a fairly finegrained basis.

I fail to see it. Explain?

I feel some fatuous statement coming one...must resist...can't: 
"World-wide confusion is fine; local confusion isn't"

Of course not. They *like* the "mis"definition poor Sally gave for it. 
They are trying to hijack her intentions (with, admittedly, what she 
actually said).

They also seem free to change Sally's term any which way. Er...meaning 
stabiltiy? World wide confusion? What if they perversely *do* change 
it, can sally still publish/use her old ontology?

Er.. I'm not yet seeing the sequitur. Lots of things are nasty both 
syntactically and semantically. How does it make it a red herring? Real 
meaning of importing? I thought importing was quite clear. Could you 
separate out the issues a bit?
