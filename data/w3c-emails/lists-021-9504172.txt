Hi,

I have read this article too and enjoyed it too. But I have a more  
intermediate opinions.

Yes and no. I definitely agree that specifications which tend to impose  
to people a set of requirements without taking into account the nature  
of needs or the actual usages of people will not succeed. But there's  
another danger in the lack of a specification, which is a set of  
vocabulary imposed by the most used or most powerful software on the  
market.

I would prefer definitely to see a specification which is made with the  
largest possible community: not in numbers of participants, but in  
terms of type of domains participating.

For the categorization of information using CSS, the author has  
definitely a point and he comes very close of my silly idea of COW  
(Cascading Ontologies for The Web) where we could map OWL Ontologies in  
a markup suitable for HTML without breaking any laws of validity, by  
using class attributes for example.

There's just a need of implementation in Weblogs software importing  
real ontologies and creating a markup inside the HTML with classes.

A bit of the ideas exposed here
