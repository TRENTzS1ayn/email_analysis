Hmm? I'm trying to use it roughly as I thought Tim was. Heh. I thought 
it was something like the ontologicy assertions concerning the term 
published by the URI owner somewhere reasonably "near" the relevant  
URI.

Wow, I'm a bit surprised. Given the RDF semantics of having classes and 
properties be individuals that happen to have associated extensions, I 
thought this reading would have been natural. I'm not at all saying I 
endorse this view, but it seem rather common.

Presumably that's not why it's not strictly analogous, since neither is 
a relation.

I tend to agree, I think. Maybe not. :) But it certainly seems like 
rdfs:Classes are this way (dc:creator? dc:date?) Actually, I'm not sure 
what to make of such metadata.

Well, even if so, that's not the end of the story. Joe says that 
joe:marriage rdfs:comment "a pact between a man and a woman made before 
God" and I point out that, in fact, in his canonical ontology, he 
wrote, "joe:marriage rdfs:comment "a unity between a man and a woman 
made by God", what are we disagreeing about?

This a red herring. I was really referring to the notion of concepts as 
just more individuals to hang assertions off. Or forget that. How about 
URIs as things which I can "say anything about" (anyone can say 
anything about anything). (Perhaps we need to get 
definitions/intentions into the picture as first class objects? Why 
not! We've got most everything else :))

Hmm. That seems strong. I might not KNOW what the referent *is*. "The 
unknown soldier"

Or, I might leave my referent only partially constrained. Are all my 
defintions *finished* in the sense that no one else can refine them?

If I coin the word "flurble" which, I stipluate (and stipulation is

"that certain smell that wet cats loathe"

Let me try another analogy: What I'm arguing for is like deep linking. 
I want to use your URI, which, in fact, points to your definition. I 
want to use it my way on my own pages, say things about it (like what 
it refers to). It might not be the happiest, but I don't see it's so 
off.

How about this. I wrote the foaf ontology expecting Sally to fix up her 
definition along the lines she and I discussed. A LOT of people are 
using my ontology, but sally sold her domain name or has just gotten 
stubborn. Why can't I just *redefine* her term in my context and save 
all those poor souls from having to rewrite their documents?

If I want to use her term *as she wrote it now*, why can't I just copy 
and paste her ontology into mine and use that? If she changes it, must 
I keep track? Why?

(If all this is this way, why would I ever use anyone elses terms?)

Uh. I certainly share with you that the latter is a non-starter. Good

I've not yet advocated a view. Certainly not *that* one. I'm trying to 
describe things I think people will do or want to do.

Sally cares. I might care. I want to talk about Sally and what she did 
or tried to do. I want to say, "by *this* she meant, or ought to have 
meant *this*". Or "try changing the definition to *this* and watch the 
contradictions evaporate".

The question is can anyone else repair the damage. Or, similarly, if I 
think she's messed up, is my only choice to defer to her mess or 
refrain from using her URI?

I actually just don't believe that people own URIs. They don't. They 
own servers. They may own domain names, but I'm not sure that's a good 
idea. They certain have secured certain compliant behavior from DNS 
servers with their dollars. But URIs are just strings. I really hope 
they don't end up like trademarked strings. Has anyone trademarked a 
URI? Yeek.

>  What matters to me is to grok the meaning of what Sally actually said.

And if she's said one thing in OWL, a slightly different thing in her 
rdfs:comment, and yet a third in her documentation? Of course the only 
thing the software cares about is the OWL (well, unless someone 
implemented a program against the documentation alone). If we're down 
the path of intended meanings, where do we stop?

Hmm. No, I think it will come up when I'm trying to decided whether to 
use your term. Or it will come up soon after I've done so :)

But, uh, this works if I only use expicit imports statements, with the 
possibility that I'll end up in several different places for different 
uses of the same URI in different contexts. So?

I mean that the situation right now, as I understand it, is that there 
are no mandated constraints on the meaning of a term other than what's 
in the current graph/document. owl:imports has the explicit effect of 
expanding the graph from the mere parse of the initial document. Mere 
use of the URI *can* do that, but it's application dependent. This 
seems quite coherent to me.

Well, neither does loading up the contents of a docuemnt found by 
derefing the uri. I can find alternative documentation for a URI ("Hi, 
I'm hijacking sally:Person because when we started using it, we thought 
it made sense but now we love intelligent computers and chimps too. If 
you see sally:person in one of these docs, please use *this* definition 
rather than the one at sally's place")

That's my understanding of the difference. Load only the explicitly 
imported, or load everything used.

I think so.

I see where the confusion is coming from. There's at least two issues: 
2) If I use sally's URI, must I use it constrained by Sally's published 
ontology? (Loads of related issues, there, e.g, published *at* that 
URI?) 1) What determines the reference of a URI?

(yes, i counted down :))

I'm agnostic on this. However, I might go for that the meaning of 
Molly's *use* of Sally's URI is partially determined by those other 
assertions. Especially the presense of various owl:imports.

In Molly's documents, it's not. They're *molly's documents*, in a much 
stronger way, imho, that sally's uris are *hers*. Who the hell is Sally 
to tell Molly what to do in her documents? :)

>  - in which case, even if Molly's concept does not match with Sally's,

And what molly *implements* will affect the actual *effective* meaning 
of particular uses of Sally's URI. How could it be otherwise? A bug or 
misunderstanding, and the sale is made (or not).

Plus, I keep reading these things about how agents will bootstrap yet 
more understanding by spidering a few more documents...isn't this how 
the "web of meaning" creates ever more meaning? Or something?

I regard the "world wide meaning" of the term as possibly 
uninteresting, at least from a spec/software point of view. I don't 
think anything will acutally be able to grasp the global web-holistic 
meaning of any uri (well, maybe SUPER GOOGLE!!!). But I also think it 
doesn't matter. I think I'm fine with there being some intended 
meanings (of which we might privilege the URI owner, but maybe only the 
coining owner, maybe not), the "web" meaning (but, heck, we can't know 
what that is anyway), and the speaker/local/contextual meaning. In the 
end, only the last one matters, at least, to a particular communicative 
act. (Well, that's strong, but I'm feeling a tad bumptious.)

Bit less, than more, but yes. But *Molly's* the one, perhaps, who's 
peeved. Actually,if PVNSPFD *change* the meaning, that's going to be a 
bit frustrating for the rest of use who used the term.

But why deny people the tools to work around it?

Or, why deny people to use terms but give clearer intentions about what 
*they* meant by the term *in that context*?

I mean, really, either way is breakable. I think mine is a tad less so, 
but I don't really know. Social factors will override. But why then all 
the doom and gloom in support of your side? "NO! NOT WORLD WILD 
CONFUSION!!!!" But that's the case if people change their meanings. 
It's also annoying if people all use only their own terms.

Then we're back to my quietist position: Don't Say Anything. :) Why do 
you care if people use sally:Widget to talk about what they're 
exchanging but aren't using sally's ontology? The economic pressures 
will cause converange, etc.

That's for sure, since it's the *ground* that's rising UP!

This is no better for the other side of the vs.

I totally agree. This is part of my motivation for this example.

This is, of course, worse if mere URI use entails importation (of some 
kind).

So I think we actually are starting to converge on something.

I thought I was arguing that ;) I read Tim's "using a uri commits me to 
the ontology of the uri owner" as *being* "i must do something like a 
'fresh' owl:imports of that ontology". I'll take happy corrections.

Yep.

Here's perhaps some meat (or meet) for the first telecon: using vs. 
importing and what is it to commit to an ontology (not what *commits* 
you, but what do you have to do if you are committed).

If we could get this even begun to be sorted, I'd be very pleased.
