I'm only going to pick on one thing:

 "The entire world has to allow the owner of a URI
  to say what its referent is supposed to be"

This seems propose a theory of meaning based on
an unspecified act ('say') by an  unidentified party
('the owner') at an unidentified time.

Most URIs don't have 'owners', and owners
have no way to 'say' nor do receivers of
communications containing URIs have any way
to determine what the owner might have said,
and not superceded.

If you change 'owner' to 'utterer' you come
up with a not very useful theory:

 When party A sends a communication containing
 a uri U to party B, then U means exactly what
 A says it means, nothing more or less.
