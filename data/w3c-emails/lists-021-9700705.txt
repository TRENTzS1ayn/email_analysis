my point exactly - but you miss the importance of the reference in my 
brain dead approach -- look, two scientists can know if they are 
pointing to the same box before they look inside - however, if they 
want to be sure they have the same cat in the box, they need to open 
it - otherwise one may think the cat is dead, the other may think it 
alive (or not a cat at all).   The point I make is that "which box" 
and "what's inside" are different issues - and the first is easy on 
the web, which makes the second possible.

whereas I see this all the time - our OWL page uses lots of links to 
other people's boxes, and then displays what is there when 
appropriate -- so we have a link to the W3C RSS feed without knowing 
what messages will appear on our home page when that link is 
exercised (via a RDF Query)

well, my point on this one is simple too - I don't understand those 
either, so let's not use those words -- I still am looking for a test 
case where I don't need to dereference peter:meaning to see what 
breaks.

I mean building common vocabulary more easily because "symbol 
grounding" is an essentially solved problem - the main difference 
between KR on the Web and KR in the real world IMHO
