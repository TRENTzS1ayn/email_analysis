I wonder if we could do the following before the Friday telecon, using a 
relatively small number of words, say, 500 or fewer?

* Agree, if possible, on Peter's two points below.

* List the issues

* State, or have Tim state, "Tim's solution", succinctly.

from Peter's http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sw-
meaning/2003Sep/0059.html:

I don't know how agenda-setting works in this group, and apologies if this
email steps on anyone's toes.
