At all? Read the OWL docs.

If that doesn't help I suggest you send a comment to the OWL working 
group.

Ok, I mean that I have to concatinate the graph dervied from parsing my 
document with the graph derived from the parsing of the "imported" 
ontology. Really, of course, some sense of the transitive closure of this.

This can be weakened, perhaps, by saying that when I use the term I 
should use it *as if* I had concatinated, etc. (After all, I might be hard wired 
to that ontology. Or I might have some clever, unknownst or unimagined 
by bijan way of only slurping the *really really* relevant bits of the ontology 
on demand).

Cheers,
