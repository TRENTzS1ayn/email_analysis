Good question. "Whatever the URI's owner officially designates as the 
defining ontology for that URI" is the URI's ontology, in my parlance. I take 
the intended default to be "that ontology that's published at the URI formed 
by stripping off the hash from a URIref".

See Pat's claims that this kind of separation doesn't work for concepts and 
relations.

Plus, your reading seems pointless. Operationally, what does it affect?

My understanding, both from looking at the text (see my earlier reading) 
and from conversation, is that this is not the case.

I don't see how to read "committment to an ontology" in this context that 
*doesn't* have an effect on the formal meaning.

I mean, really, what does this "identify what the URI claims it identifies" 
*mean*? Is it even true?
