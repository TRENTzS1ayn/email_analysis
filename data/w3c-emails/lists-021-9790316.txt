That surpises me. Do you agree that use of a URI implies committment to 
the URI owner's ontology for that URI? If so, what does that committment 
require?

Well, take a simple case. Should rdf core impose upon a confroming RDF 
reasoner (i.e., an RDF reasoner which respects the RDF Semantics) the 
requirement that, given soundness and completeness, it entails all the 
consequences of the merge of the document + ontology (+...). Etc.

That's interesting. Nice extra data point.

Tim, it's perhaps time for you to step in with a clarification of the 
"commitment" thesis.
