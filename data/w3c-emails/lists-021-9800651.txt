And the level of understanding of the resource if this one is in 
natural language, it has to be understood by a human: which language, 
which pre-requisite do you impose to the reader, etc.

This can be improved, if you define that URIs should not (MUST not) be 
content negociable.
There's another problem. In an exchange of data, you have:
- What is delivered (Content Negociation)
- What is understood

The classical example of that is a book or even a poetry.

You can have a poem written in different languages and on different 
supports:
- book
- magazine
- web
- oral (in a theater, in the street, in the classroom)
This is content negociation.

and you have the readers:
- child
- man/woman
- sad or happy person
Each person will built its own interpretation of the poem depending on 
their age, their past, their desires, dreams, wishes.

When it comes to the interpretation of things, the social, emotive, 
historical, etc context is as much important as the original intended 
meaning of the poem. We are used to say that a text once it has been 
released does not belong anymore to the author in terms of 
interpretations.

An URI even without content negociation, could have different meaning 
depending on the agent receiving it and the context of it.

The fact that the two agents disagree doesn't mean, you have an 
interoperability problem. It could also mean that they have a different 
interpretation of the world, depending on the context, on the 
philosophical point of view. You create a debate.

The term reasonable will not make sense in case of conflict.

I think the meaning of URI, but I may be wrong, is more constrained by 
the context and for what applications they are used but more by the URI 
itself. Intended meaning and understood meaning are things which can 
have a lot of different shapes.
