And it's not even clear that the people looking at the Wordnet terms 
understand the same thing than Sally. If I look at Wordnet for man
http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn1.7.1?stage=1&word=man

I have 11 definitions of what's a man.

Let's simplify and says that Sally has chosen the number 1.
(1.  man, adult male -- (an adult male person (as opposed to a woman); 
"there were two women and six men on the bus")

I'm the user of Sally's Ontology
Hmmm with this definition it seems that a child is not a person. We 
have reached our first problem. The second problem, I'm french or 
japanese and I do not read at all english. How do I know what Sally 
meant in her ontology?

The problem is even bigger than that and it's the whole problem of 
social organization of the internet.
- a domain name can cost a lot for a poor person in third word country
- a domain name can be bought or stolen by a third parties, destroying 
the ontologies references or worse changing the meaning of it (If there 
was something to deference)
- the new owner of the domain name doesn't want that its domain name 
is used for this stupid ontologies thing, because he's using some of 
the same URI to sell sofa with flowers print.

I'm not sure if there's something wrong. But for sure we haven't solved 
the previous problems, just pushed them.
