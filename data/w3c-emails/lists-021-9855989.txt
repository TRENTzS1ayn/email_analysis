In the first case I guess you say that
two persons (who I guess believe in one god) choose to make pact in 
front of their chosen god.
====> Intention of persons
In the second case I guess you say that
two persons (who I guess believe in one god, but it's not even sure) 
have been united by a god.
====> Intention of a divinity.

I tried to understand the examples, if they are both not making sense 
for me because I don't believe in any kind of god or religion, but I 
tried to interpret assuming what could be said by someone who believes.
