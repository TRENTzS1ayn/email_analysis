Right, no guarantee, just social forces to discourage it.

Also, one can make the content be immutable using a cryptographic
hash, but that's probably not what folks usually want.

(Slight digression: ISBN's get reused sometimes.  See RFC 3187:
"Nevertheless, publishers do occasionally re-use the same number.")

It could easily, eg the tag: URI scheme I proposed.   But that's not
as good as HTTP, because then there would be no single, available
authority to tell you more, given just the URI.

That is, the whole point of using URIs in RDF (as far as I can tell)
is so that folks can look at a term and find out more about it,
quickly and simply, using the Web.
