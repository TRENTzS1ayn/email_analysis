Well, think about what it would mean. It makes 
sense to catalog all the books ever published, 
and maybe all the people who ever lived. What 
else can an ontology be about? Let me see, there 
are all the stars, and all the hairstyles, and 
all the sodium atoms, and all the noses, and all 
the trees, and all the left feet... in fact, an 
ontology can be about ANYTHING, right? Just as a 
Web page can be. How can one set up a universal 
WW naming system for everything? How would it be 
organized? Dewey Decimal, maybe? Or using the 
classification structure of Roget's thesaurus?

And this is just the particular things. We will 
also need universally agreed names for all the 
classes and properties that one might want to 
use...
