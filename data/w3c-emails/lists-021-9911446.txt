I was not so ambitious. :))) I didn't mean to categorize the 
information, I was just thinking about giving a reference which is not 
dependent on a domain name.

Each time an uri is created it has a reference number. I think the 
system that Sandro proposed in the past was taking into account the 
date too. if the content was changing; a kind of versioning.

My suggestion was just to escape the technical cheating on domain name, 
business interests, etc....
