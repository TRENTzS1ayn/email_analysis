This is a sticking point. I think the list is not short, and not clean 
or easy to state. And even if short, then *very* not easy to sort out.

I would like to get clear on the "use of a URI in RDF implies 
commitment to the ontology". I think that's a fine topic for the first 
telecon and given the electrons spilt already a meaty enough task. (I 
even tried framing an issue on it! :))

I would also be happy discussing Peter's document.

I would like a chair, and have proposed Sandro as chair for the first 
telecon.
