 From  
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-sw-meaning/2003Sep/0047.html:

"""Not strictly analogous, because you are not a concept. Your date of  
birth is just a fact, which can be misrepresented by a falsehood.  
Concepts are not real things that have crisp edges beyond which  
falsehoods can be discerned. If I say that marriage means a social  
union between two consenting adults, and Joe says that marriage is a  
pact between a man and a woman made before God, do Joe and I disagree  
about a question of fact or about the meaning of the word "marriage"? I  
think the latter is the only option that makes sense.""""

I read your claim as being similar to the suggestion I made that a URI  
which is, say, rdf:type owl:Class "identifies" *some thing*. The URI  
owner can make assertions about it (e.g., that it is rdfs:subClassOf  
wordnet:woman) and so can other people (e.g., that it is  
owl:complementOf wordnet:woman).

(I don't endorse this view, but I was surprised, given the RDF model  
theory, that Pat didn't endorse something like it.)

Uh...And you do think that 1 is a subset of 2, yes? Or what has RDF  
Core been doing?

Perhaps worse as i ordinarily think of meanings as getting  
*formalized*. Thus, all meaning is subject to (more or less successful)  
formal analysis.

I think this is on a wrong track.

Yes, that's what I'm after. But I want to know what those ways are. I  
wouldn't mind formalizing them, if at all possible. owl:imports (at  
least according to pat) isn't formalized (or even semantically clear).  
But it specifies SOMETHING. And it makes a difference when writing owl  
reasoners...believe me.

I'm really not sure what it *is* to "reason formally".

But it still seems red herringland. Right now, I want to know if I have  
to reason over the transitive closure of the set of documents  
retrievable by the set of URIs in some RDF document, rather than over  
the statements in the RDF document alone, or over some specifiable  
subset of that transitive closure. And then, there's the freshness of  
the closure.

It seems to me that this is the kind of thing you can put in a spec.  
"Yes, grab that closure." Yes, it's a good idea, but you don't have  
to." "No, are you nuts?" "No,not for mere use, but if you have an  
owl:imports, then yes"

Well, ok, they'll go into an unhappy spec since there's a ton more to  
figure out.

Well, I thought it arose because Tim, specifically, though that there  
was *less* such meaning :) The fear of meaninglessness!

Describing is a kind of formalizing. Specifying is a kind of  
formalizing.

Since I've not provided a formal analysis of owl:imports, consider my  
presentation to be that precursor :)

Well, that, itself, is at issue. I don't see how to read tim's issue  
statement otherwise. *I'm* not the one to be convinced! But if we don't  
beat up on the concrete proposals, especially the ones with status, we  
risk doing nothing at all. It seems to me Tim cares about his view.

Sorry, I meant yours.

But I still deny your distinction, between appeals to human vs. formal  
judgement of meaning. I don't know what the latter is.

I want to know the *practical* consequences of this notion of meaning.  
Specifically, that URIs have a meaning and that meaning is "under the  
control of the URI owner" and that I (document author or RDF software  
writer) should, in some sense *respect* that meaning.

What must I do to exhibit that respect. What does web/semantic web  
architecture require of me? (Nothing, imho, but others disagree.) What  
do we intend (as a community) to *specify* one must do to so respect  
that meaning.

Tim claims that we're engages in prescription rather than description.  
I want to know what I'm going to be told to *do*. If we're just  
theorizing about how the web or semantic web actually works, well,  
that's a different task. And, I say this as a philosopher, who cares?  
Why is the W3C spending money on this, or our member organizations that  
aren't universities? The W3C probably isn't THAT sort of research  
entity (nor does it seem especially well equipped to do this sort of  
research).
