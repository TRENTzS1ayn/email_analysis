I see that there is a broad reading of this, but I meant a much more narrow
meaning along the following lines:

If the notions of how information is recorded and gathered and how
the meaning/denotation/... of a URI reference is determined in a
particular context are given then how does one determine the
context in which to determine the meaning/denotation/... of a URI
reference.

I think that this is actually quite a bit smaller than rdfURIMeaning-39, as
it excludes issues of differing languages, inaccessible information, etc.

My solution, of course, is that under a representation regime context is
determined from an initial set of information solely by the explicit
importing constructs of that representation regime that import
web-accessible documents that are compatible with the representation
regime.
