I don't think that the web is qualitatively different from even written
natural language in this respect.  Readers of natural languages (even
software) can agree on the words in an written sentence - these are, to me,
quite similar to the boxes you mention above.

I do agree that there could be a qualitative difference between the
Semantic Web and natural languages, as the Semantic Web *could* end up with
many more ``words'' than even English.  (It could also end up with much
*fewer* ``words''.)  This could be taken as a chance to have a single-box,
single-meaning situation.  However, as Pat has pointed out, single meanings
can easily split into multiples when looked at more closely.

If by box you mean URI reference, then sure, just as people use other
people's words.  Common meaning is, I think, another situation.

Well, how about ``Different systems produce different results when given
the same initial set of information''?

[...]

Huh?  I fail to see how the Semantic Web provides any traction here at all.
I even think that the Semantic Web makes the ``symbol grounding'' problem
harder because it beings some of the thorny issues in KR closer to the
fore.  My view is that this effort should try very hard to come up with
partial solutions that don't need to open up these cans of worms (while
still not excluding incorporation of the worms into future extensions).
