So I listed the issues I saw; no one has yet said how well they match
the issues they see; there has been one complaint that listing issues
is a bad idea.

It's a nice idea, but I'm afraid we'll have to draw it out in

for everyone.  Personally, I'm happy with his presenting and arguing
for bits as they are relevant to discussing particular issues.

Anyone have any other agenda items to propose?
