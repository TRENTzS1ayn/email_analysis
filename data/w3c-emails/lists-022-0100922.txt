That's a weird way to ask the question.  You mean, is it worth doing 
the extra work to break your naturally occuring model just so that 
you can be in DL?

I would argue this is indeed a BP issue, but probably for WORLD not 
for OPEN... we need to explain why and when you would do the extra 
work (and in every case we have explored it is extra work) to make 
sure your ontology is in the DL profile of OWL.
