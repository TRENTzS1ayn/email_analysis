I think this is relevant to both OPEN and WORLD, though if pressed to
choose one, I'd go for OPEN. It seems to be more a question of how to
use the language as opposed to explaining the various language variants.
WORLD will need good examples to show the difference language variants,
this one might be considered for that purpose, if it is general enough
and simple enough.

Right.

Wow, I never imagined having to argue over doing more work.......but....


My view of World is to explain "WHY OWL and RDF are they way they are"
whereas OEP is for "HOW you do xxxx".  This seems like the latter....? 

-Chris 
i would go along with chris on this one although i will end up doing
work on both of these subgroups so can contribute from either place.
