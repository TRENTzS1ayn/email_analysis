Yes, like Bernard, I have been thinking more about this, and about Ian's 
insistence in WebOnt that classes-and-instances was almost always raised by 
people wanting to mismodel their world. (cc Ian, wondering if I have learnt 
my lessons well!, or misrepresented him)


The class hierarchy in RDFS/OWL is there to describe hierarchies of classes 
of resources. Just because you have a hierarchy of subject descriptors 
doesn't make it a class hierarchy.

It seems to be confusing the human way of thinking of analogy and metaphor 
(any hierarchy can act as a metaphor for any other hierarchy) with what is 
a logical and implementation issue about how to say what we want to say 
about our knowledge of our world in a way that machines can process it.

Thus if PhDThesis is an owl:Class what are the resources that we intend to 
belong to it? Probably my PhD Thesis with title "Graph Grammars: an 
approach to transfer based MT; exemplified by a Turkish-English system" is 
one such resource, but the copy sitting on my bookshelf is probably not.

Then if that is the case what would we mean by dc:subject linking the 
resource of my thesis with this class .... hmmm ... we mean my thisis 
belongs to that class, i.e. rdf:type.
So if we want to treat this subject hierachy as classes we really also want

dc:creator rdf:subPropertyOf rdf:type .

or perhaps

eg:creator rdf:subPropertyOf rdf:type .
eg:creator rdf:subPropertyOf dc:creator .

But if we click on dc:creator we get to:
http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/subject

<rdf:Property rdf:about="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/subject">
<rdfs:label xml:lang="en-US">Subject and Keywords</rdfs:label>
<rdfs:comment xml:lang="en-US">The topic of the content of the 
resource.</rdfs:comment>
<dc:description xml:lang="en-US">
Typically, a Subject will be expressed as keywords,
key phrases or classification codes that describe a topic
of the resource.  Recommended best practice is to select
a value from a controlled vocabulary or formal
classification scheme.</dc:description>
<rdfs:isDefinedBy rdf:resource="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"/>
<dcterms:issued>1999-07-02</dcterms:issued>
<dcterms:modified>2002-10-04</dcterms:modified>
<dc:type 
rdf:resource="http://dublincore.org/usage/documents/principles/#element"/>
<dcterms:hasVersion 
rdf:resource="http://dublincore.org/usage/terms/history/#subject-004"/>
</rdf:Property>

and we see that dc:subject should typically be a string from a controlled 
vocabulary. Thus it seems particularly poor practice to deviate from the 
preferred usage of dc:subject in order to (over-)simplify our model.

This points to the solution I was earlier advocating of using such strings, 
using hasValue restrictions to map the strings into classes and then using 
the class hierachy on those restrictions to show the hierarchical 
relationships between the subject vocab terms. To do this well, we probably 
want to specialise the dc:subject property with a subproperty eg:subject, 
specify its range with an owl:Datarange explicitly enumerating the 
controlled vocabulary, and for each term create a class using a hasValue 
restriction.
For further clarity and usablility we might want to create two related 
properties, one indicating the (single) intended subject code, and the 
other indicating all implicit subject codes formed from the class hierachy.
The former would be a subproperty of both the latter and dc:subject; the 
latter would be used to create the hasValue restrictions.

Hmmm ... quite a lot of work initially, but the end result is that the 
subject indicators are marked up using text strings from an explicit 
controlled vocab; we conform with the defn of dc:subject, even with the 
advertised best practice; we fall within OWL DL with the expectation that 
this will give us better reasoning performance, and we have been clearer 
about we are trying to say. I think the complexity can be hidden from the 
end users.
