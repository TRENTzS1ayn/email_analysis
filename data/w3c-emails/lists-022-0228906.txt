As I said in a message that hasn't been forwarded to the list (yet?), 
I agree on the dangerousness of mixing up concepts and topics.

Chris' papers are a milestone in this area (a few bucks, please!), 
and the topological approach he takes is in accordance with ways of 
conceptualizing cultural spaces (or "knowledge contexts") in 
semiotics, linguistics, and anthropology.

BTW, consider the analogy between topics as spaces, and namespaces 
... and the kinship between "knowledge contexts" and "formal 
contexts". I am going to suggest that a topic (or subject in a more 
restricted sense) is an "abbreviated" namespace or knowledge context. 
Topics work perfectly with humans, who use them to build conceptual 
spaces, but they work very poorly with machines, which have no 
context to build those spaces. Solutions are being envisaged (C-OWL 
being one of them), but the matter needs real thinking, not just 
shortcuts. Indeed, I think the success of the Semantic Web partly 
relies on a clear understanding of these issues.

It seems that I am the only one that owns several copies of those proceedings!
