Jeremy,

You can go to the top of the class :-)

I would say that there is a big difference. Like any part of the
language, subClass may occasionally be abused, but it is used very
widely and most people seem able to use it more or less
correctly. Moreover, subClass fits into a family of logics which are
theoretically well understood and for which there is considerable
implementation experience.

In contrast, classes as instances are relatively rarely used (most
forms of conceptual modelling, databases etc., seem to have managed
perfectly well without them), and hardly ever used
"correctly". Moreover, the resulting logics are much less well
understood and there is little implementation experience.
