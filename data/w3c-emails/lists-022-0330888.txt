I agree with both these points ... but that doesn't mean that any use of 
classes as instances is well-modelled, and at least in this specific case, 
remembering Ian's reservations, it seems to me that classes as instances is 
  misguided (when using dc:subject). I am well aware that many others in 
this group know much more about subject hierarchies and modelling than I 
do, but we shouldn't shy away from making judgements.

My concern was about the implied relationship between *dc:subject* and 
*rdf:type* both of which are already defined.
If, after thinking about it (which I haven't), I thought that metaclasses 
were an appropriate modelling tool for this case, I think I would need to 
use a new property instead of *dc:subject* in order to express its 
relationship to *rdf:type*.

On the 'philosophy of SWBPD' topic, I hope that Network Inference, and/or 
others coming from the DL camp will participate in this WG, since I think 
we will be less able to represent (and forge) the consensus of the 
community without input from that part of it. (Certainly I am an unlikely 
champion of that school of thought !)
