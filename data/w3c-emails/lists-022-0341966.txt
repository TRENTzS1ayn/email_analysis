My question was explicitely about the former in this thread, but my general concern is
about the latter, definitely.

I found it pretty much relevant :))

I understand quite well your example, having working myself two years ago in this field,
on a drug development model for a major company, including various aspects such as
physico-chemical properties, bio-chemical targets, clinical activity, assays of all kinds,
patents, production process, formulation ... and we've been through tricky issues
generated by so many different views of the 'same' drug in so many different contexts :
generic molecule, or family of molecules with hundreds of variant forms, or specific
batches from a specific production process, or specific formulation or commercial name ...
>From so many various viewpoints, it's obvious that a simple and fit-all representation is
very difficult to apply, 'sameness' has to be addressed at a very pragmatic level. And of
course, it includes re-use of legacy (like MeSH and the like). And sticking to DL in such
a context is barely possible.

Actually, the specific issue of class as document subject is dreadfully simple in
comparison ...

> Hope this helps.

I think it is.
