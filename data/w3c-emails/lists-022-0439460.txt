initial problems of representing subject taxonomies in DLs are discussed

can't seem to find a softcopy myself.

It seems that I am the only one that owns several copies of those proceedings!

I have a PDF version of that paper, which I am now sending to Chris 
(I believe attachments are not allowed on this list...).

Cheers,

The way to do attachments is as follows (general W3C mailing list 
etiquette) -- send a message to www-archive@w3.org (for public 
archive, w3c-archive@w3.org if you want member only) with the 
attachment.   This will create an email with a URI that you can then 
point to in this list -- i.e. you go to the W3C page for the 
appropriate mailing list ([1] is the one for www-archive) and the you 
can copy the URI for the message with the attachment.  For example 
[2] is a message with a PDF attachment that Jeremy sent to the 
archive (in a different thread)
