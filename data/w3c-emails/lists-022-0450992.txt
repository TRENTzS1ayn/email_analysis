Jim makes a good point, and it is most valid in those cases when 
alternate approaches will work well. But that is not always the case, 
and there are many gray areas. When there ARE clear arguments for or 
against a given modeling choice, then I believe it IS the role of 
this group to identify commonly arising BAD ways to model things and 
recommend to avoid them, as well as to recommend GOOD ways to do 
certain kinds of things.   We should avoid taking positions UNLESS 
there are clear arguments one way or the other, and as Jim says, 
indicate the consequences of decisions, so users can choose what will 
work best in their particular circumstances.

while I don't disagree, let me be clear -- it is rarely the case that 
one thing is right and one is wrong in the capital letter sense that 
Mike uses GOOD and BAD -- I don't mind educating in the few cases 
there may be, but I'm gonna be awfully hard to convince that somehow 
the way we built closed-world, generall small ontologies in the 
traditional AI systems is going to be the noly GOOD way to build them 
on the Semantic Web -- in fact, in teaching SW to my students, I'm 
learning new lessons all the time that counter how I've been teaching 
things in my AI courses for the last 28 years
