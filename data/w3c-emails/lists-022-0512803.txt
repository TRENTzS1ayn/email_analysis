Thanks for the detailed input, Jeremy.

I expected that in this WG all the basic misunderstanding in the SW 
would emerge, and in fact this has happened immediately, as in the 
Bernard's thread (topics vs. concepts, ontology vs. lexicon), and in 
the subClass-metaClass dispute. Here Jeremy touches other points, 
some related to the previous threads, some not.

Granted that I agree on the need to use WordNet in a common format as 
soon as possible for SW applications (it's my first step in the 
guideline list), I'd rather discuss what are we committing to. 
Jeremy, do you think the TF should  build the standard WordNet for 
the SW? Or a "minor" or "preliminary" standard? I understand we have 
to provide best practices to use or build resources, not to create 
them directly.

On the other hand, if someone suggests that WordNet (*as is*) is a 
best practice for annotating the Web, this is patently misconceived, 
but even accepting that (Jim, don't start scribbling, please :)), 
some decision must be taken on what the data contained in WordNet 
are, how can they be represented in OWL ontologies or plain RDF 
models, etc. And here comes room for the guidelines I have listed.

Guidelines are not all-or-none, but just a roadmap for an ideal, 
powerful WordNet-oriented ontology library. Some steps can be carried 
out now and what you are claiming for now is one of them. Indeed, I 
see no conflict between what you write and the notes I have sent out.

Let me put some preliminary distinctions, then I will come to the 
individual issues.

1) WordNet is ambiguous in nature:
- it is a network of words, but also a network of senses.
- it contains relations between individuals (e.g. part-of), relations 
between concepts (e.g. antonymy), and relations between words (e.g. 
synonymy, POS mapping)
- it contains both senses of concepts (classes), and senses of individuals

2) There exists a schema of WordNet as it is (as a relational 
database), but WordNet senses can be considered as a giant schema in 
itself to be exploited in SW applications.

Surveys are hardly a scope, but just the review of what has been done 
and of people that have competence on that.

Most approaches are not alternatives, but are complementary, and are 
mostly independent from WordNet reengineering (I dare to say mapping) 
to OWL or RDF (which are also different tasks, as I explain here).
OTOH, if you want now one reengineered OWL or RDF WordNet, just buy 
one of the proposals. In fact, as a first result, we can look at what 
has been done, check it against the set of guidelines the we decide 
to adopt, and then to expose the results, or even the resource, if it 
is compliant to the point we are eager to accept.

This refers to the use of WordNet as a database. In other words, 
since WordNet is a database of matadata, you are suggesting to define 
a metaontology (in the past, these were called metamodels ...) of the 
primitives used for creating wordnets.
Perfect, I agree with you (this has been a theme in many papers I 
have written!). I concede that I have not defined such a metaontology 
in OWL or RDF, and this can be the first goal for the TF.
There exists also some reusable work made by ISLE (International 
Standards for Language Engineering) that you probably know.

Rightaway, once we agreed on the schema

>+ some illustrative examples of use

That's one point: use for what? if you want just triples encoding 
hyperonymy, synonymy, etc., the instances in your triples will 
actually represent concepts, individuals, or words time to time. 
Annotating web pages with that mess would be a nightmare ...

Taken (see above)

To be precise, "word" and "sense" ("synset") should be encoded as 
classes, while "hyponym" as a property ranging on senses, and 
"synonym" as a property ranging on words. BTW, that's what you are 
asking for (the address is one I used to generate the abstract syntax 
...):

Namespace(rdf   = <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>)
Namespace(xsd   = <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>)
Namespace(rdfs  = <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>)
Namespace(owl   = <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>)
Namespace(a     = <http://www.w3.org/2004/03/WordNetSchema#>)

Ontology( <http://212.34.219.175/WN_Schema.owl.rdf>

  ObjectProperty(a:Hyperonym)
  ObjectProperty(a:Hyponym
   inverseOf(a:Hyperonym)
   domain(a:Synset)
   range(a:Synset))
  ObjectProperty(a:Sense
   domain(a:Word)
   range(a:Synset))
  ObjectProperty(a:Synonym Symmetric
   domain(a:Word)
   range(a:Word))

  Class(a:Synset partial
   restriction(a:Hyperonym someValuesFrom (a:Synset)))
  Class(a:Word partial
   restriction(a:Sense someValuesFrom (a:Synset)))
)

Hence, we'll indicate it.

I agree, but the differences are usually related to the synset 
network, rather than to the parts that are easily encodable in 
schemata like the one above.

Pull is different for someone that just wants some tag to put on a 
web page, and someone else that wants a clever coverage for her 
domain, or even for someone that wants to make automatic translation 
on the Web.

Push is something we can do wrt to wordnet and ontology developers 
rather than to basic implementors. I agree on this.

See previous comment, btw I know of many people out there trying to 
make mappings or to find a minimally good ontology

What do you mean by "annotating an OWL or RDFS class"? Wordnet can be 
used either as a source of reusable classes (sense network 
reengineered as an ontology), or as a source of lexicalizations for 
classes, individuals, or properties. Maybe you mean the second use ...

Therefore, let's define such a metaontology asap (see first point of 
my guideline list), so that we can provide best practices for more 
substantial things :)
