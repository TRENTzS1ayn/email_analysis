 From minutes of telecon:

>ACTION: Guus to propose a format for TF description
>(the following depend on the above)
>   ACTION: JimH write description of WorldView TF

although I'll wait for Guus before I send a "formal" description,  I 
have a cancelled meeting and decided to send this today while I have 
the time -- feedback is, of course welcome as are TF volunteers.


WORLD VIEW TASK FORCE
Mail Descriptor:  [WRLD]

Members:
   See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swbp-wg/2004JanMar/0100.html

Goal:
  This Task Force will develop two notes.

  The first note will be aimed at Web Developers not yet using RDF and 
OWL.  It's goal is to explain the importance thereof, to show how RDF 
integrates with the HTML, XHTML, XML, SOAP, WSDL (etc) world and to 
explain how RDF can be used in systems development along with other 
specifications (not to define an embedding, but rather to explain 
when and how it can be used with and without embedding).    This 
document is not intended to be a "semantic web architecture" 
document, nor to be a vision document (like [1]) mor a "business 
case" document like [2] -- rather, the intended audience is Web 
application developers and not the general public.

  The second note will be aimed at those already interested in using 
Semantic Web technology, but confused about how to get started or to 
move forward with development -- this note is the one we have 
jokingly referred to as the "clean up our mess" document. 
Essentially, if we were to redesign the SW from scratch, we would 
probably not come up with a world with RDF, RDF Schema, OWL Lite, OWL 
DL, and OWL Full filling various, and sometimes seemingly competing, 
niches.  However, these are the recommendations we have, and it is 
important to explain how they fit together, and to debunk the myth 
that somehow the languages form an "ordering" from least to most 
complex -- rather, we need to explain what each does, and how they 
fit together.  For example, RDF developers will need to know how 
their data may eventually be used (and even validated in some sense) 
by OWL, and OWL developers need to understand why they are using the 
rdf: and rdfs: namespaces.
