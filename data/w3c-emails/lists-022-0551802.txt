What I always will remember from DanC is

[[
If there is no way to make this issue observable
as an entailment test, then I don't believe
it's a substantive issue.
]]

So yes, I'm very much liking your ideas and for instance,
it's not a matter wether it's good or bad to have
"classes as instances" or "properties as classes or instances"
but it is a matter of "explicit assumptions" and "if something
is the case then nothing that isn't the case can follow".
