We have had exactly the same experience in using thesauri for annotating 
art  collections. For example, the value for the "style" property of a 
painting is taken by us from the AAT (Art and Architecture Thesaurus) 
hierarchy of styles and periods. Even for seemingly simple attributes 
like "color" we have found this feature: we cannot treat the color value 
as a simple instance from a flat value space, as color subtleties can be 
key issues in art objects (e.g. porcelain) and the thesauri, like AAT, 
thus contain elaborate color hierarchies (e.g. vivid-pink subClassOf pink).

[Note: some parts of the style/period hierarchy are in fact based on 
parts (periods). An important practical point however is: these thesauri 
are out there and they represent community consensus. Are we going to 
discard them because they model the world in the "wrong" way?]

Interestingly enough, we have also encountered some problems with 
putting classes as values for Dublin Core elements. The maim problem is: 
how do you define the value type for the Dublin Core slot. Our tool uses 
this to present the annotator with the right subtrees in the thesauri to 
choose a value for this slot. One way to do this is to define for every 
slot a metaclass that has the top nodes of the subtrees as its 
instances. But that does not lead to the intended semantic 
interpretation which is: all classes in the subtrees are valid slot 
fillers. In other words, there seems to be no way to express in OWL the 
Protege notion of "AllowedClasses", in which you define the value type 
of a slot through a set of classes, with the intended interpretation 
that all subclasses of these classes are legal slot values.

The approach we have recently been using actually avoids the use 
classes-as-instances. Take this example:

   <rdf:Property rdf:ID="style/period">
     <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="&dc;coverage"/>
     <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="&dc;subject"/>
     <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#VisualResource"/>
     <rdfs:range>
       <owl:Class>
         <owl:unionOf rdf:parseType="Collection">
           <rdfs:Class rdf:resource="&aat;50111078"/>
           <rdfs:Class rdf:resource="&aat;50111079"/>
         </owl:unionOf>
       </owl:Class>
     </rdfs:range>
   </rdf:Property>

This is a piece of our OWL ontology for VRA [1].

[NOTE: VRA is a specialization of Dublin Core for visual resources [2]. 
The VRA spec defines the VRA elements as specialization's of DC 
elements. This is reflected in the OWL ontology through subproperties, 
thus allowing for DC's dumb-down principle. Note that if the DC elements 
have been defined as OWL annotation properties, this piece of OWL is 
actually not OWL DL but OWL Full.]

The value type of "style/period" (see the union) is specified here 
through the two top nodes of the relevant subtrees in the AAT hierarchy 
(&aat;50111078 and  &aat;50111079). Assume we have a painting for which 
we want to define the style/period value of "Cubism". Cubism is a class 
in one of the subtrees, so it would not be a legal value. Instead, we 
store an anonymous instance of "cubism". In fact, there is something to 
be said for this solution: the style of a painting is not cubism but 
some expression of cubism. Likewise, a painting is not "blue" but some 
expression of blue.

Sorry if this is confusing. We have had many long internal discussions 
about this, and it is difficult to summarize. Some of these 
considerations you can also find in our KCAP'01 paper "From thesaurus to 
ontology" [3]. For examples of the annotation tool see [4].
