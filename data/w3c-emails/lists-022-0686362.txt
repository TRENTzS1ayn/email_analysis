I see the logical part as easy, but persuasion and consensus are more 
a matter of social technique than of logical technique ...

I think we can suggest best practices in various forms. The first one 
is providing a schema for wordnets, and the first obvious case is 
Princeton WordNet. Other best practices can suggest ways to use 
wordnets as ontologies, as linkages between ontologies and lexica, 
etc.

I see both

We do not denigrate anyone! Princeton WordNet is good and 
accomplishes the tasks for which it has been created. Being a 
resource for the Semantic Web was far beyond the imagination of 
George Miller when he conceived it ... anyway, Christiane Fellbaum 
has already expressed interest in our TF activities (communicated as 
a list of issues similar to the one that I have sent).

Of course. So I can witness that using good practices to understand 
WordNet's schema and transforming it into ontologies has been an 
invaluable help in the completion of the Fishery Ontology Service 
project with my Lab and the UN-FAO.

OK, I include this question in the message I am going to send to 
wordnet maintainers

Are you offering to investigate on this?

This is part of the reason why I'd rather focus on wordnets rather 
Princeton WordNet only. But let's stay with it for a first 
case/objective.

I certainly want use cases, I only wondered about what's the use of 
annotating documents without a clear idea of what there is in 
wordnets. But it seems we agree, considering the rest of the message.

Wait wait ... WordNet as an ontology (the synset network) is stable, 
and versioning is Princeton's work. When anyone takes it, should 
mention which version is using, what parts are used, etc.
The researches aimed at "changing" the synset network (in the best 
cases) do not modify WordNet arbitrarily, but "remap" some synsets in 
order to make it compliant to some other resource. WordNet's 
structure is still there, but it is  "aligned" to something else 
(check the projects I have mentioned). The benefits of these 
remappings are quite well known and described, and have applications 
(cf. the FOS project I have mentioned above: without alignment, we 
couldn't use WordNet for that task).

On the other hand, there is also progress and improvement acting 
there. For example, EuroWordNet took Princeton WordNet and 
added/changed part of it for the English part of it, while still 
maintaining explicit links. Links are also kept in the versioning of 
the original WN (typically, by someone outside Princeton).

Maybe I am incorrect here in guessing the possible nuances of 
push/pull in English usage, so let me define my ontology here :).
By push, I mean "suggesting a best practice or resource, even though 
this is not widely required, provided that we can demonstrate its 
usefulness with concrete examples".
By pull I mean "recognizing a best practice or resource that fulfils 
widely shared requirements".
So I do not intend to tease people or loose friends! I simply assume 
that SWBPD implies either recognizing a BP or creating/suggesting 
others that can even be less widely known.

OK. I want to be as practical as possible, that's why I started 
mentioning people interested and things that can be done. I would 
like to send out a message including a description of who we are and 
what we want to get in a reasonable time, then asking directly 
(besides comments) what are the plans/needs/availability of each 
interested party to arrive to a common WN schema for the SW, and to 
contribute to the definition of guidelines for 
improving/remapping/linking wordnets for the SW.

I hope to circulate a draft message before the next telecon.

Ciao
Aldo
