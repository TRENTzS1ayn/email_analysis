I could offer a variety of reasons, but perhaps it would not be 
helpful at this point.

And Pat agrees with you, Jim.

I had written a rather acerbic response to Chris' message, but rather 
than just keep on quarreling, let me suggest that we try to adopt 
some criterion for giving best-practice advice. If anyone wants to 
say that some technique or style is 'bad', let them rather phrase the 
advice in the form 'if you use this technique or style, the following 
consequences may arise, which could be undesireable because the 
following could happen..' The 'following' might include: failures of 
interoperability with other techniques or styles; dangers of 
misunderstandings arising; failure to conform to one or more existing 
standards (particularly ones in widespread use); inability to make 
use of existing engines or inference techniques.  But I would suggest 
that reasons based on philosophical opinions, or which amount to 
little more than 'people that I know and admire have tended to always 
do it that way' should not be offered as pest-practice advice; and 
that in cases (which may well include the classes-as-instances issue) 
where it seems that entire communities disagree, then we should say 
that, and give the pros and cons in both directions.

What is driving me crazy is this simplistic view that one can clearly 
distinguish 'good' and 'bad' here. Can we try to adopt a more nuanced 
form of words, and try to avoid the (ultimately simply ridiculous) 
posturing about being an Authority on how to write Good SW content? 
The fact is, this has not really ever been done before by anyone, 
including us. We are like writers of essays on literary style setting 
out to give advice on how to write hypertext before there were any 
web pages. A little humility might be a useful thing to wear at this 
point.

Ditto. And I would say that it would be better to do nothing rather 
than set out to write a definitive manual of how to Do Things Right 
on the the Semantic Web.

For myself, I do not agree with that last statement. I don't think 
that there is such a thing as an incorrect way to model anything. 
There are ways of modelling which violate various assumptions and 
might cause various problems in certain settings, and we can and 
should document these; things like this are objective. But to 
classify any technique as 'incorrect' is not objective: it is merely 
an expression of a personal opinion. There is no science to back up 
such an opinion. If we as a group find ourselves with a unanimous or 
near-unanimous opinion, I guess we can offer it to the world: but 
even there, we ought to clearly distinguish between opinions we all 
hold and matters of actual fact that we think people ought to know.
