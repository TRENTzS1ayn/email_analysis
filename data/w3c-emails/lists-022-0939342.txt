I am offering to suggest to the Jena team that we should provide some 
support for a WordNet schema if there was *one* to support. (The range of 
choices is our main current obstacle).

I don't think we have the time to do much work on this ... the normal level 
of support we provide for such things is pretty minimal - a Java class with 
the schema property and classes as member fields - but that is quite useful 
and not very much work. I would be surprised if we would do more than that 
in the short term, (there are some Jena-team discussions that suggest we 
might want to do more).

I wouldn't want to take the lead here (in terms of what other software 
teams might do), I suggest that the message you're drafting includes a 
specific part for tools developers asking what support for WordNet they 
might include. If so I promise a response from the Jena team.

The penny began to drop here ... I had not realised this complexity, and 
begin to see the need for 'phase two' (in my terms). That looks hard.

We're making progress ...
