Dear www-tag,

This is a summary of the TAG's activity from 12 Mar 2003 (end
date of the previous summary [1]) to 3 Apr 2003.

The TAG had three teleconferences during this period. Summaries of
those meetings are linked from the TAG home page [2].

1) Issues

  Details about discussions and related actions are available in
  the meeting minutes linked from the TAG's home page. The TAG's
  issues list is available at: http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ilist

  The TAG accepted one new issue during this period:

    abstractComponentRefs-37: Definition of abstract components
    with namespace names and frag ids

  Although the TAG did not close any issues during this period,
  it made progress on the following issues:

   URIEquivalence-15: When are two URI variants considered
   equivalent?

   IRIEverywhere-27 : Should W3C specifications start promoting
   IRIs?

   contentTypeOverride-24: Can a specification include rules for
   overriding HTTP content type parameters?

   namespaceDocument-8: What should a "namespace document" look
   like?

   xlinkScope-23: What is the scope of using XLink?


2) Findings

  As part of issue URIEquivalence-15, the TAG discussed the draft
  finding "How to Compare Uniform Resource Identifiers" [3]. The
  likely future of this finding is that it will be incorporated
  into the next version of RFC2396, currently in development
  in the IETF. The TAG expects to track the progress of the
  revised RFC and make additional comments on the issue in that
  forum.

  More information about TAG findings is available at:
      http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/findings

3) Architecture Document

  The editor published the 26 Mar 2003 Working Draft of
  "Architecture of the World Wide Web":

   http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-webarch-20030326/

  List of changes:
    http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/webarch/changes

4) Communication

   The TAG instituted a new mailing list
   (public-tag-announce@w3.org) for announcements from the TAG of
   minutes, meeting summaries, findings, new issues, resolved
   issues, and drafts of architecture documents. These
   announcements will also go to www-tag; public-tag-announce is
   intended for subscribers wishing to receive a subset of mail
   sent to www-tag.

5) Upcoming events.

   1. The TAG does not expect to meet face-to-face in May,
      but rather to hold an extended remote meeting around
      May or June.

   2. The TAG does plan to report on its activities 
      to the Advisory Committee at the May AC meeting 
      in Budapest. There will also be a segment on the TAG
      as part of the W3C track at WWW2003 (21 May). For
      more information on the W3C track, please see:

        http://www2003.org/t_www.htm

   3. The TAG did resolve to hold a face-to-face meeting
      in Japan in November 2003, in conjunction with the
      AC meeting.

For co-Chairs Stuart Williams and Tim Berners-Lee,
Ian Jacobs
