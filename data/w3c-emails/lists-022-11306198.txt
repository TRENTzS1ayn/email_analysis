Hello,

The 1 August 2003 Editor's Draft of "Architecture of
the World Wide Web" [1] is now available. This draft
included a lot of changes [2], most of which were based
on TAG discussion at their recent face-to-face meeting
in Vancouver (minutes not yet available; expected early
next week). A diff file [3] is available but not tremendously
useful.

 - Ian
