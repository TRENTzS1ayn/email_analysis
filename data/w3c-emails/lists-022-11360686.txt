Dear www-tag,

This is a summary of the TAG's activity from 9 July 2003 
(end date of the previous summary [1]) to 10 Aug 2003.

The TAG held three teleconferences and one face-to-face meeting
(in Vancouver) during this period. Many thanks to Antarctica,
Schemasoft, and BEA Systems for co-hosting the face-to-face
meeting. Summaries of those meetings are linked from the TAG home

3) Architecture Document

  The TAG spent most of its time during this period walking
  through and revising the Architecture Document.  The TAG
  published three Editor's Drafts of the Architecture Document
  during this period, the most recent being the 1 August 2003
  Draft [3].

  In July, the TAG notified [4] the AC of its Last Call
  publication plans. At the Vancouver face-to-face meeting, the
  TAG identified further work on the document that we want to
  complete prior to issuing a Last Call. The TAG is aiming for a
  Last Call before November 2003.
