   Ian

         1. Withdrawn action IJ 2003/10/08: Starting from DO's diagram,
            create a diagram where the relationships and terms are linked
            back to the context where defined. Ensure that the
            relationships are in fact used in the narrative; any gaps
            identified? With DO, work on term relationship diagram.
         2. Completed action IJ 2003/11/15: Add a column to the TAG
            issues list about the version of the document in which we are
            expecting to address the issue.

  Walkthrough of Tim Bray review of 28 Nov draft

   [17]TB review comments

     [17] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2003Nov/0076.html

   [Ian]

          1.2.1. Orthogonal Specifications
          TBray: CL and I had some back and forth on this.

   [Chris]
          and http-equiv="refresh now"

   [Ian]
          TBray: I like the motherhood and apple pie language before the
          bulleted list.

   [TBray]
          " The HTML specification allows content providers to instruct
          HTTP servers to build response headers from META element
          instances. This is a clear abstraction violation; the developer
          community deserves to be able to find all HTTP headers from the
          HTTP specification (including any associated extension
          registries and specification updates per IETF process).
          Furthermore, this design has led to confusion in user agent
          development. The HTML specification state

   [Ian]
          TBray: I think the first sentence needs rephrasing. The HTML
          spec supplements HTTP servers.
          CL: In fact, the HTML spec is an instruction for HTTP servers,
          which is universally ignored. That's evidence of a problem
          having arisen.
          TBray: Perhaps a bit of phrasing "This doesn't work in deployed
          servers as specified!"

   [TBray]
          3rd bullet: " Some authors use the META/http-equiv approach to
          declare the character encoding scheme of an HTML document. By
          design, this is a hint that an HTTP server should emit a
          corresponding "Content-Type" header field. In practice, the use
          of the hint in servers is not widely deployed and many user
          agents peek inside the HTML document in preference to the
          "Content-Type" header field. This works against the principle
          of authoritative representation m

   [Ian]
          Action IJ: Salt this text to taste to emphasize that problems
          have arisen.

   [DanC]
          emph " servers is not widely deployed "

   [Ian]
          RF: There are servers that implement it, FYI. [Some] Content
          management systems do this.

   [Chris]
          content magagement systems, and the discontinued GN server
          yes, i agree that a sentence of introduction would be helpful

   [Ian]
          TBL: The gist is missing: It's not just enough to make an
          extension language, you also need to make it so that not only
          old documents members of the new language, but also that new
          docs, without much damage, can be interpreted in the old
          language. Ok that extension is inverse of subset. Missing text
          is that you need to ensure that a doc in the extension language
          can be interpreted in the old language with predictable
          results.

   [Roy]
          "second" and "first" is ambiguous

   [Ian]
          TBL: Should be in para about "Language extension".

   [DanC]
          I note "we", the TAG decided on whatever timbl, daveo, and Ian
          agree to.

   [Ian]
          TBL/DO's text came from:
          [18]http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2003/webarch-20031111/tim

     [18] http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2003/webarch-20031111/tim

   [timbl]
          "Clearly, an extension language is better than an incompatible
          language, but in practice greater compatability is needed.
          Ideally, an instance of the superset language, in many cases
          can be safely and usefully processed as though it were in the
          subset language. Extensability the property of a langauge that
          allows this. The original language design can accomplish
          extensability by defining, for predicable unknown extensions,
          the handling by implementations -- for

   [Roy]
          Language A' is an extension of language A if and only if A is a
          subset of A'.

   [Ian]
          TBray: I think CL and I agree that most of the issues are
          probably not controverial.
          CL: I agree with TB's assessment.

   [Chris]
          my response at

          1.2.4 Is the 2nd sentence of the first para, about the
          longevity of
          messages, new in this draft? It doesn't have anything to do,
          not in
          the slightest, with the actual point being made in this
          section.
          TBray: Propose to lose that sentence.
          CL: Fine to drop.
          Action IJ: s/messages exchanged/technology shared.

   [Chris]
          "the technology shared among agents in the Web may last longer
          than the agents themselves" would also be fine.

   [Ian]
          TBray: I propose that second para be dropped.
          First sentence only?
          TB proposal: Rewrite first sentence per CL proposal.

   [Chris]
          So, I agree with Tim about loosing the last para, but also
          suggest deleting "not in terms of APIs or data structures or
          object models, but in terms of protocols,". Make a positive
          point about the benefits of message based interop, its not
          necessary to knock other approaches to make the point.

   [Ian]
          Resolved: Accept TB's sentence.
          Proposed: Drop third para.
          Resolved: Drop third para.
          TBray: 2. Would anyone else like to tighten up the first para
          by retaining just the first and last sentences? It would be
          immensely clearer I think.

   [TBray]
          Parties who wish to communicate must agree upon a shared set of
          identifiers and on their meanings. Thus, Uniform Resource
          Identifiers ([URI], currently being revised) which are global
          identifiers in the context of the Web, are central to Web
          architecture.

   [Ian]
          CL: I'm ok with losing second sentence...

   [Roy]
          /me diff's are so much clearer

   [Chris]
          I am fine with Tim Brays text

   [Ian]
          I note that this value bit comes back later in the section on
          ambiguity.
          DC: I meant "network effect" sentence as motivation for first
          constraint.

   [Zakim]
          Ian, you wanted to talk about https if we get there. and to
          comment.

   [Ian]
          IJ: There's a tie-in in 2.3 in section on ambiguity.
          DC: I don't like first para of 2.
          CL: +1 to TB's proposal.
          TBL: Delete 2nd sentence, leave third.

   [Chris]
          yay!

   [Ian]
          Resolved: Delete sentence two of first para of 2.
          TBray: I don't understand "Of particular importance are those
          messages that express a relationship between a URI and a
          representation of the resource it identifies. "
          DC: Those are "200 Ok" responses.
          TBray: Then please send that.
          IJ Proposal: Clarify intent of sentence in question as last
          sentence of para of 2.2.

   [Roy]
          seems redundant to the sentence following it

   [Ian]
          DC: The point is that the way URIs take on meaning is that you
          get representations back when you deref the URI; 200 Ok
          reponses are thus key.

   [TBray]
          yes, but doing well I think, have covered most of my hot-button
          issues

   [Ian]
          DC: I'm ok to lose the sentence, having heard RF.
          Proposal to delete "Of particular importance are those messages
          that express a relationship between a URI and a representation
          of the resource it identifies."

          okay

          3.2. Messages and Representations
          TBray: I propose change to read: "A messsage may include: data,
          metadata about the data, and metadata about the resource."

   [Chris]
          Some is about the resource, some is specific to a particular
          resource representation.

   [Ian]
          CL: My point was that some is about the resource, some about
          the representation.: E.g,. content-language is about the
          representation.
          TBray: Change to "metadata about the representation data"

   [Chris]
          we need to say both - resouece and representation metadata
          'Vary' for example is about the resource

   [Ian]
          TBL: Simplify to metadata about the resource and the message.

   [timbl]
          may include data and metadata about the resource and the
          message.

   [DanC]
          by "general" do you mean "typical"?

   [Ian]
          IJ: I moved "resource metadata" out of ordered list since not
          the general case.

   [Stuart]
          message ~= message metadata, representation, represenation
          metadata and resource metadata?

   [TBray]
          may include representation data as well as metadata about the
          resource, the representation, and the message.

   [timbl]
          Propose: A message may include data, and metadata about the
          resource and the message.

   [Stuart]
          +1 to TBray's draft

   [Ian]
          CL, DC: We prefer TB's proposal.

   [Chris]
          prefer tbrays one

   [Roy]
          prefers TBray's draft

   [TBray]
          A message may...

   [Chris]
          consensus!

   [Ian]
          Resolved to accept TB"s proposal.
          TB Proposal: Lose GPN just before 3.5

   [TBray]
          Lose GP at end of 3.4.1

   [Ian]
          TBray: We say the same thing in preceding para (as in GPN)

   [Chris]
          "Server managers MUST ensure that resource metadata is
          appropriate for each representation."

   [Roy]
          This is not the responsibility of server managers.

   [timbl]
          s/appropraite for each represnetation/correct

   [Stuart]
          how about s/approriate/accurate/

   [Chris]
          s/each/all

   [TBray]
          s/each/all the/

   [Ian]
          CL: My point is that if your metadata says something about a
          resource, make sure it works for all representations.
          RF: I don't think this is appropriate at all. It's not the
          server manager's responsibility. A server manager is incapable
          of knowing all the resources in the server namespace. The
          metadata depends on how the author intends a resource to be
          used (through representations).

   [Zakim]
          timbl, you wanted to point out that we can't really go into the
          disnction between different parties in the publisher.

   [Ian]
          TBL: I think that RF's distinction is between different parties
          within the publisher (abstraction).
          IJ proposal to either add "metadata, especially that applying
          across representations" and deleting GPN.

   [Chris]
          +1 to what Ian said
          ok now to drop the box

   [Zakim]
          Chris, you wanted to argue that distinguishing between resouce
          and representation is the crucial thing; drop 'server manager'

   [Ian]
          Proposed rewrite of sentence before GPN: Furthermore, server
          managers can help reduce the risk of error through careful
          assignment of representation metadata (especially that which
          applies across representations)." And delete GPN.

   [DanC]
          so RESOLVED.

   [Ian]
          3.5 Why the new XForms plug? It adds nothing to the example and
          creates confusion because people are going to wonder if this is
          special and different and couldn't have been done with
          old-fashioned HTML forms. Must be removed.

   [Roy]
          suggestion: Resource owners must manage the resource's provided
          metadata as carefully as they manage the data, ensuring that
          they remain consistent with the intended semantics of the
          resource.

   [Ian]
          TBray: Move back from Xforms to HTML forms. Might make people
          think that you need Xforms to do this.
          CL: Propose "for example" around Xforms.
          TBray: I'm fine with that.

   [Chris]
          add "for example' right before xforms

   [Stuart]
          +1

   [Ian]
          Proposed: "Built with, for example, XForms")
          RF: I think the idea is good, not sure it improves readability.

   [timbl]
          (built with XForms ro HTMl forms)

   [TBray]
          OK with TBL's too

   [Roy]
          simple is better

   [Ian]
          TBray: Propose to lose parenthetical

   [timbl]
          Could we see the text we agreed on at the f2f in the 111?

   [Ian]
          DC: +1 to lose parenthetical
          RF: +1 to lose parenthetical
          Resolved: Lose parenthetical re: xforms.

   [Zakim]
          Chris, you wanted to say it makes a link to a finding

   [Ian]
          DC: Finding is cited in last para of the section.
          4.2.2 "must understand". I totally don't agree that "must
          understand" is limited to markup from another namespace. XHTML
          could for example have applied a "must understand" policy to
          new XHTML elements (they may have, for all I know). All you
          need to do is /markup from an unrecognized
          namespace/unrecognized markup/
          DO: That's correct.
          CL: Namespace can be relevant.:You could have different
          handling whether in or out of namespace (and unrecognized).

   [Chris]

     [20] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2003Nov/0074.html

   [Ian]
          TBray: CL's example is deceiving. It's a particular example,
          less simple.
          DO: +1 to TB
          TBL: +1 to TB.
          Resolved to accept TB's proposal.
          4.3 The para beginning "Note that when content, presentation,
          and interaction are separated" is *very* fuzzy and I think
          could just be nuked. I don't remember discussing this, is it
          the output of TAG discussion?

   [DanC]
          TBray proposes to delete para "Note that when content,
          presentation, and interaction ..."
          CL drafted it, Ian rewrote it

   [Ian]
          TBray: I withdraw my comment.
          4.5.2 is the TAG comfy with being this much in favor of
          XPointer? I'd need to hear a few explicit "YESes"

   [TBray]
          To define fragment identifier syntax, use at least the XPointer
          Framework and XPointer element() Schemes.

   [Ian]
          TBL's text was this: "XLink is an appropriate specification for
          representing links in hypertext XML applications." (4.5.2)

   [Roy]
          Please condense all four paragraphs of 4.5.2 into one.

   [TBray]
          +1 to Roy

   [Ian]
          TBL proposal: Move "XLink is an appropriate specification for
          representing links in hypertext XML applications." to 4.4

   [Chris]
          I think that 4.5.2 is fine as it is

   [Ian]
          Support for move: TB
          TB, CL: Leave where it is.

   [Chris]
          better where is is

   [Ian]
          TBL: Proposed change title of section to 4.5.2to "Hyperlinks in
          XML"

   [Chris]
          Propose moving "XLink is an appropriate specification for
          representing links in hypertext XML applications." to before "
          XLink allows links to have multiple ends"

   [TBray]
          Middle of 1st para of 4.5.2

   [Ian]
          TBL: I think that makes sense..........

   [Chris]
          establishes a hypertext context

   [Ian]
          IJ proposes louder back link to hypertext section

   [Roy]
          editorial: s/( in | for ) XML// for all section headings 4.5.*

   [Ian]
          IJ summarizing proposed changes to section 4.5.2:

         1. s/use at least/consider
         2. move third para to first para per CL proposal.
         3. Link back to hypertext links section.

   [TBray]
          +1 to Roy

   [Ian]
          TBray: +1
          TBL: +1
          SW: Don't use "consider" twice in same para.
          [Editorial]

   [Chris]
          yes we do

   [TBray]
          =================>Ian

   [DanC]
          "specifically" might help, yes.

   [Ian]
          Resolved: Accept IJ proposal.
          4.5.5 2nd para, 2nd sentence is COMPLETELY WRONG. Yes, you can
          convert back & forth between qunames & URI/local-part pairs.
          What you can't do is go back & forth from qnames to URIs; which
          is clearly what Norm meant.
          TBray: Yes there is. What there isn't is qname -> URI.

   [TBray]
          There is no single, accepted way to convert a QName into a URI
          or vice-versa.

   [Chris]
          There is no single, accepted way to convert a QName into a URI.

   [TBray]
          don't lose vice-versa please
          OK chris?

   [Ian]
          SW, TBL: Qualified names and QNames are different.

   [Roy]
          First sentence defines them as same.

   [Ian]
          TBray: I think SW is right.

   [Stuart]
          Propose s/("Qnames")//

   [Chris]
          section is called "4.5.5. QNames in XML" so no ambiguity...

   [Ian]
          IJ: I am confused seeing qualified name , then qname, then not
          understanding the relation.
          TBray: Nuke "QName", then insert a sentence explaining
          relation.

   [Roy]
          /me I need to go, but please continue without me

   [Ian]
          TBL: "Qualified names were introduced by XMLNS and are
          represented in XML by the "Qname" construct."

   [DanC]
          thanks, roy

   [Ian]
          IJ: I understand the proposed change the goal of ensuring that
          text is not inconsistent.

   [DanC]
          PROPOSED: to fix QName stuff to the satisfaction Lilley and
          Williams

   [Ian]
          TBray: +1

   [DanC]
          so RESOLVED.

   [Ian]
          Action IJ: Do another draft by Thursday, 4 Dec..
