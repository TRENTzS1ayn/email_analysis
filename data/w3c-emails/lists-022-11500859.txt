  The TAG is pleased to report that it started a Last Call review

2) Issues

  The TAG accepted two issues during this period:

   ultimateQuestion-42: What is the answer to life, the 
                       universe, and everything?

           [Note: This issue was accepted in good humor; cf.
                  the works of Douglas Adams (1952-2001).]
                  
   DerivedResources-43: How are secondary resources derived?

  In addition to those issues, the TAG decided the following
  issues: rdfmsQnameUriMapping-6, errorHandling-20, and
  contentTypeOverride-24.

  on architecture topics of mutual interest.
