Hello,

I have made available the 9 July 2003 draft of 
"Client handling of MIME headers" [1], which addresses
TAG issue contentTypeOverride-24 [2]. This draft incorporates
suggestions based on reviews of the 25 June 2003 draft [3].

Changes in this draft include:

 - Section 3: changed "meaning" to "interpretation" per Stuart
   Williams comments.
 - Section 3: Some text moved around to make this section
   easier to read. In particular, the parts about 
   self-describing formats were moved to a new subsection 3.1.
   The paragraph in 3 following the first ordered list has
   some editorial changes based on TBL text. Section 3.1 also
   has some additions (regarding when self-describing is 
   "not enough") based on TBL comments.
 - Section 4: Deleted second security scenario based on SW
   comments.
 - Created a new subsection (4.1) out of existing text.
 - Section 5: Based on feedback from SYMM IG, changed
   "architectural error" to "outmoded" regarding the type
   attribute in SMIL 2.0.
 - Section 5: Based on discussion of XHTML 2.0 and with
   the Voice WG, added to example a use of the type attribute
   as a preference in client/server negotiations.
 - New section 6: Based on suggestions from Rob Lanphier,
   added edited version of his text with advice for server
   management to reduce risk of inconsistencies.
 - Section 7: Per 7 July 2003 TAG teleconf, changed
   "SHOULD" to "MUST" in bullet two of conclusion points.
   Also, deleted bullet three.

A diff file is available [4].

I expect that the TAG is close to approving this finding,
but will be reviewing the new section 6 and other changes
in this draft.

Thank you,

 _ Ian
