Hello,

I have made available the 9 July 2003 draft of 
"URIs, Addressability, and the use of HTTP GET and POST" [1], which
addresses TAG issue whenToUseGet-7 [2]. This draft incorporates
suggestions based on reviews of the 9 May 2003
draft [3].

Changes in this draft include:

 - Per 23 June 2003 TAG teleconf, incorporated sentence in 
   abstract that finding limited to http uri scheme and HTTP 
   protocol (based on Larry Masinter comment).

 - Fixed two references to RFC2616 (per Larry Masinter comment).

 - Per 7 July 2003 TAG teleconf, created future work section
   to postpone discussion of PUT semantics.

 - Updated section 6 (ongoing work on GET in Web Services)
   by synthesizing text from David Orchard and Noah 
   Mendelsohn.

A diff file is available [4].

Thank you,

 _ Ian
