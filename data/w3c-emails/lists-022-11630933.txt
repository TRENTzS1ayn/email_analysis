Hello,

The 15 July 2003 Editor's Draft of "Architecture of
the World Wide Web" [1] is now available. 

The changes [2] in this draft (see also diff [3]) were:

   * 2. Identification and resources: Per comments from Karl Dubost and
       Paul Prescod, added some characterization of how one might
       establish that a resource is "important"
     * 2.4 Frag ids: Per comments from Karl Dubost and Chris Lilley,
       added "or the format he usually prefers."
     * 3 Representations: Per comments from Roy Fielding, distinguish
       metadata about representation/message from metadata about data in
       a representation.
     * 3.2.2.4 Extensibility and versioning: Added text from David
       Orchard, but with substantial editing.
     * 7.3 Non-normative references: Added EXTLANG and SOAP12.
     * General: Per comments from Stuart Williams, made several
       changes to eliminate the phrase "meaning of a resource"
     * General: Per comments from Roy Fielding, made some changes
       regarding usage of "MIME type", "content type", and
       "Content-Type".
     * General: Per comments from David Orchard and Dan Connolly,
       decided to eliminate the phrase "on the Web" since not critical to
       understanding the architecture.

My understanding is that this is the draft the TAG will discuss
at its upcoming face-to-face meeting.

 - Ian
