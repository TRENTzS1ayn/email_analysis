Hello,

The 16 July 2003 Editor's Draft of "Architecture of
the World Wide Web" [1] is now available. I made a few
editorial changes to yesterday's draft based on some
input from TAG participants. I do not expect to produce
another draft before the face-to-face meeting next
week.

The primary changes [2] in this draft (see also diff [3]) 
were:

      * 2: Editorial change to first sentence of paragraph based on
        comments from Stuart Williams.
      * 2.4.1: changed "URI makes sense" to "client can do something
        useful with frag id."
      * 2.5: Based on comments from Stuart Williams, changed "operations
        are defined by" to "available operations depend on."
      * 2.5.2: Based on comments from David Orchard, inserted an
        Editor's Note about "on the Web"
