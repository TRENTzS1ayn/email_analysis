I still owe an example of a simple use of WordNet ...

this wasn't quite the one I had in mind, but has the advantage of being 
more real:

http://norman.walsh.name/knows/where#dk-copenhagen

is described as having RDF type

http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/City

clicking on the above URL gives an RDF/XML download ....
and uses words from WordNet as RDF classes ...

I think what Norm is trying to do is simply say that his copenhagen URI is 
a resource which belongs to a class with some (strong) relationship to the 
english word city in wordnet 1.6 sense 1 with description 'a large and 
densely populated urban area; may include several independent 
administrative districts; "Ancient Troy was a great city"'

This use of WordNet is fairly naive (in the sense that non-experts can do 
it) and does not depend on any of the relationships between words.
