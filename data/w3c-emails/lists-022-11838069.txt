Hello,

The 16 June 2003 Editor's Draft of "Architecture of
the World Wide Web" [1] is now available. 

There were a number of changes [2] in this draft, primarily
based on the addition of a new section 3 from Tim Bray
and extensive comments from the TAG's walk-through of the
document at the 2 and 9 June teleconferences.

Comments welcome,

 - Ian
