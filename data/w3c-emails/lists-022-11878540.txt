Hello,

At their 16 June 2003 teleconference [1], the TAG accepted
the following issue.

 _ Ian

[1] http://www.w3.org/2003/06/16-tag-summary.html

putMediaType-38 : Relation of HTTP PUT to GET, and whether client
headers to server are authoritative

Some scenarios that this issue concerns:

      * Client PUTs representation to server without content type
        information; what is proper server behavior?
      * Client PUTs representation to server with content type
        information, but server ignores. Is this architecturally
        incorrect?
      * Client PUTs representation to server with detectably
        inconsistent content type information. What is proper server
        behavior (e.g., signal error and not silently ignoring)?
