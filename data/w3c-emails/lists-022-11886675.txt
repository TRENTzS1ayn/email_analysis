Hello,

The 23 June 2003 Editor's Draft of "Architecture of
the World Wide Web" [1] is now available. 

There were a number of changes [2] (see diff [3]) in this 
draft, primarily incorporation of comments on section 2 
from Dan Connolly and Stuart Williams, the addition of a 
new section 3.2.4 from Norm Walsh, and an introductory 
paragraph in section 4 from Roy Fielding.

Comments welcome,

 - Ian
