Hello,

The 25 June 2003 draft TAG finding "Client handling
of MIME headers" includes a number of changes that were
suggested on www-tag, some of which were discussed
at the TAG's 16 and 23 June teleconferences. As the
status section of the draft finding states:

  "Changes include the addition of security examples, discussion of why
separating metadata from data can improve efficiency, discussion of why
servers must not provide encoding information unless known with
certainty, addition of SMIL 2.0 as an example of a Recommendation with
an architectural error, and a new section on future work."

A diff file [2] from the 5 May draft is available.

Comments welcome,

 _ Ian
