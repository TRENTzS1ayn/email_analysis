Hello,

I've made available the 21 Mar 2003 Editor's Draft
of "Architecture of the World Wide Web." This draft
reinstates the introduction that was part of the 
6 February draft (and earlier). It also adds a scenario
to the introduction (which might be moved or cut). There
aren't any other substantial changes [2] since the 
21 Feb draft.

Stuart, I hope that at our 24 Mar teleconf we can make 
progress on deciding what the next TR page draft 
should look like.

Thank you,

 - Ian
