Hello,

The first public draft of a new TAG finding "Client handling
of MIME headers" [1] is now available. This finding attempts
to address TAG issue contentTypeOverride-24 and to a lesser
extent issue errorHandling-20. 

The TAG invites comments on this finding on www-tag. More information on
TAG findings is available at [2].

Thank you,

 _ Ian

--------
Abstract

The architecture of the Web depends on applications making dispatching
and security decisions for resources based on their Internet Media Types
and other MIME headers. In this finding, we review the architectural
design choice that MIME headers be authoritative. We also examine why
client behavior that misrepresents the user or server is harmful.
Finally, we consider how specification authors should incorporate these
points into their work.
