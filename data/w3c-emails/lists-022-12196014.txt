Hello,

The first public draft of a new TAG finding "How should the problem of
identifying ID semantics in XML languages be addressed in the absence
of a DTD?" [1] is now available. This finding summarizes discussion on TAG
issue xmlIDSemantics-32 .

This finding does not suggest a preferred solution, it merely lists
the options which arose from discussions and tries to summarize the
pros and cons of each.

The TAG invites comments on this finding on the public list
www-tag. More information on TAG findings is available at [2].

Abstract

The architecture of the Web benefits from being able to label or point
to information at a granularity finer than a complete resource. For
XML Media Types, the identifier mechanism has to date been the
declaration of identifiers (IDs) using DTD or Schema mechanisms which
are, however, optional for conformant XML processors. There is thus an
issue when it is desired to have ID-like functionality for parsers
which do not fetch an external DTD or Schema, or in the complete
absence of a DTD or Schema. This document is a rough draft TAG finding
for the issue xmlIDSemantics-32, How should the problem of identifying
ID semantics in XML languages be addressed in the absence of a DTD?.
