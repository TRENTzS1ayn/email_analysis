Dear www-tag,

This is a summary of the TAG's activity from 3 Apr 2003 (end date
of the previous summary [1]) to 12 May 2003.

The TAG had four teleconferences during this period. Summaries of
those meetings are linked from the TAG home page [2].

1) Issues

  Details about discussions and related actions are available in
  the meeting minutes linked from the TAG's home page. The TAG's
  issues list is available at: http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ilist

  Although the TAG did not open or close any issues during this
  period, it made progress on the following issues:

   URIEquivalence-15: When are two URI variants considered
     equivalent?

   IRIEverywhere-27 : Should W3C specifications start promoting
     IRIs?

   contentTypeOverride-24: Can a specification include rules for
     overriding HTTP content type parameters?

   xmlIdSemantics-32: How should the problem of identifying ID
     semantics in XML languages be addressed in the absence of a
     DTD?
  
   abstractComponentRefs-37 : Definition of abstract components
     with namespace names and frag ids

   namespaceDocument-8 : What should a "namespace document" look
     like?

   uriMediaType-9 Why does the Web use mime types and not URIs?


2) Findings

  The TAG published three draft findings during this period. These
  findings do not represent the consensus of the TAG. The TAG 
  invites review of these drafts.

  "Client handling of MIME headers"

  "How should the problem of identifying ID semantics in XML
   languages be addressed in the absence of a DTD?"
     http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/xmlIDsemantics-32.html


  "URIs, Addressability, and the use of HTTP GET and POST"
     http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/whenToUseGet.html
