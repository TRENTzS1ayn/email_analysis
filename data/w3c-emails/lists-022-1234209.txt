i support the position that in our documents we should be clear about:
stating options   AND
stating implications of taking an option  (and adding more prose if 
necessary to help people understand the tradeoffs involved).

Knowing how you are going to use an ontology when one creates the 
initial model is important and that impacts how i do a lot of my modeling.
If i am modeling for use with a reasoner - and note - that could be with 
non-dl reasoners but may be with other logical reasoners, i make sure i 
have as much information as possible represented in constructs that are 
first class objects and have clear semantics.  Many times this is not 
the case with meta information so I typically avoid putting anything in 
meta classes that i want to reason with.

i would however make updates to the information in the included message 
below that makes it sound like one only avoids meta classes if one is 
trying to do dl reasoning. 
a possible restatement is that having information modeled using 
constructs with unambiguous semantics that are first class objects in 
the modeling system facilitates integration with theorem provers.  (the 
theorem provers may be fol reasoners that want to utilize the semantics 
of the underlying logic for their reasoning and they could be dl 
reasoners that are presumably used for their computational efficiency.

There are many things that i end up taking into account when i design an 
ontology including at least:
what kind of reasoning i may do with the ontology
who will maintain the ontology  (if i have a staff of high school kids 
or one phd in kr radically changes how i model things)
what other applications am i interacting with
what background do my users/maintainers have - sometimes different 
equivalent models are more natural for one type of user over another
etc.

i expect we will have sections including many of these issues  and we 
will probably make progress more quickly and come to consensus faster if 
we just
present options, implications, and tradeoffs and try to stay away from 
judgements either way.
