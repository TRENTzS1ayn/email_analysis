Hello,

The 28 November 2003 Editor's Draft of "Architecture of
the World Wide Web" is now available at:
   http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2003/webarch-20031128/

This draft includes changes based on discussion at the
TAG's ftf meeting, and reviews from Tim Bray, Tim Berners-Lee,
and Stuart Williams.

Complete list of changes:

At the TAG's ftf meeting, they agreed that:

 * Where the TAG has approved a finding, include a link to the
   finding from the relevant place in the arch doc.

 * For other issues the TAG intends to address in this document,
   include links to the issues list.

I did not make changes in this draft to conform to that plan.
Also, I was to work with TBL when revising the SVG story in
section 3.1; I did not have the opportunity to do so.

Thank you,

 _ Ian
