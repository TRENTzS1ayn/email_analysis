Correction: The URI is 
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-webarch-20031001/


It was also pointed out to me that this link is 
broken:

http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/xmlIDSemantics-32-20030804.html

The latest version link works:
   http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/xmlIDsemantics-32.html

I'll give the author a heads-up.
