> In a recent telcon[18Aug], the TAG accepted a new issue on the
> meaning of URIs in RDF documents. The TAG expects to work with
> the Semantic Web Coordination Group and the wider community
> both to clarify the statement of the issue[3Jul] and to work toward
> resolution. The TAG has asked the Semantic Web Coordination
> Group (via yours truely) to help coordinate a meeting of the
> appropriate constituency.

> As a result of a related BOF session at WWW2003 in Budapest,
> there's a new mailing list that I suggest folks use
> to register interest in the issue and discuss it. In particular,
> if you'd like to be involved in scheduling this meeting I'm
> supposed to arrange, please say so there, preferably
> by this Friday.
