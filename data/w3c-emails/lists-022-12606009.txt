Hello,

I've published the 11 Sep 2003 of '"Deep Linking" in the World Wide Web'
[1]. From the status section:

  "The only change in the 11 Sep 2003 finding is the addition of a   
reference to a court decision in Germany that relates to deep 
   linking. The TAG decided to add this to the finding at its July   
face-to-face meeting."

I added a new section (9) entitled "Policies" for references
of this sort.

At the July ftf meeting, the TAG agreed that this revision
could be published without requiring an additional review
and decision by the TAG since it only involved addition of a reference
to a policy decision. Nonetheless, I welcome review of that (very short)
addition to ensure that it is correct, especially since it is a
reference to information in German.

Thank you,

 - Ian
