No, but if the descriptors is a taxonomy or a generalization 
hierarchy then it is quite natural to identify it with the 
corresponding subClass hierarchy. I agree this is a simplifying 
identification of two things that can be kept conceptually distinct, 
but its often handy to do that, especially if you don't have anything 
very elaborate in mind. .

Now you are getting into an orthogonal issue, distinguishing between 
types and tokens of texts. Like, Moby Dick the novel (only one of 
them) vs. all the printed copies of Moby Dick (each of which has many 
other attributes than the novel and in fact is a completely different 
kind of thing, eg you can burn one of those but you can't burn a 
novel. But this is orthogonal to the class/instance issue: you can 
have a class of types and a class of tokens (they are disjoint). In 
fact, the class of classes of abstract texts such as novels might be 
a handy metaclass.
