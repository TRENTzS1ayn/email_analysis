Hello,

I've made available the 22 Sep 2003 version of the TAG finding
"URIs, Addressability, and the use of HTTP GET and POST" [1]. 

The TAG has accepted this finding. From the status section:

  "This is the 22 September 2003 revision of this finding. It 
   has been accepted by the TAG. At their 15 Sep 2003 
   teleconference, the TAG decided to accept this finding if there
   were no strong objections to the previous draft. The 22
   September 2003 revision supersedes the 10 June 2002 version of 
   this finding, which the TAG had previously accepted."

There were no changes between the 19 Sep draft and this
version, other than changes to status information and
two spelling fixes.

Many thanks again to all those who made valuable
comments on this list!

 _ Ian
