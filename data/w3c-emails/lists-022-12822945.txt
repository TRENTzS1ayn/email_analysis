Hello,

At their 26 April 2004 teleconference [1], the TAG approved a revision 
of the Finding "Internet Media Type registration, consistency of use", 
which I have published as the 30 April 2004 version [2]. This
version takes into account new processes for W3C Working Groups to 
register media types with IANA and the publication of another 
TAG Finding, "Authoritative Metadata" [3], which subsumes some
of the material previously in this Finding.

Thank you,

 _ Ian
