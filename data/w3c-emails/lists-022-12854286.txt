Hello,

At their 2 Feb 2004 teleconference, the TAG accepted a new
issue [1]:

xmlChunk-44: Chunk of XML - Canonicalization and equality

The XML architecture has tended to be built according to a motto that
all kinds of things are possible, and the application has to be able to
chose the features it needs. This is fine when there are simply the XML
toolset and a single "application". However, real life is more
complicated, and things are connected together in all kinds of ways. I
think the XML design needs to be more constraining: to offer a
consistent idea of what a chunk of XML is across all the designs, so
that the value of that chunk can be preserved as invariant across a
complex system. Digital Signature and RDF transport are just
intermediate parts of the design which need to be transparent. This
required a notion of equality, and a related canonical serialization.
