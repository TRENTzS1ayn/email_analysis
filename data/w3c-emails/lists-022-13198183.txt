Hello,

I've made available the 8 June 2004 Editor's Draft of the Architecture
Document:
 http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2004/webarch-20040608/

This draft includes a number of changes based on the
TAG's discussion at the 12-14 May face-to-face meeting
in Boston. A diff from the 10 May draft is available [1].

I still plan on doing the following in short order but
decided to announce publication first:

 a) Updating the list of changes [2].
 b) Updating the LC issues list [3] with new proposals that
    are part of this draft.
 c) Informing reviewers about changes related to issues they
    raised.

Thank you,

 _ Ian
