   "Using Qualified Names (QNames) as Identifiers in Content"
   http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/qnameids-2004-01-14

  The TAG continues to work on a number of other draft

4) Communication

  The TAG had a busy week during W3C's All Working Group Week.
  In addition to holding a face-to-face meeting on 2 March, the
  TAG met with a number of groups to discuss their comments
  on the Architecture Document and other issues shared by the
  groups. The TAG appreciated its technical liaisons with
  these groups: XML Core, XML Schema, Voice Browser, 
  Internationalization (I18N), Web Services Description (WSD), 
  and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

  In addition, the TAG participated in two panels during the
  Technical Plenary Day. The first was run by the TAG itself, on
  issues of Web Architecture: Web Identifiers (Roy Fielding) and
  Versioning and Extensibility (David Orchard). Links to slides
  available from the agenda:

  Chris Lilley sat on the second panel, which was on the topic of
  mixed namespace documents.
