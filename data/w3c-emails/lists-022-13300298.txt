Hello,

At their 2 March 2004 ftf meeting [1], the TAG approved
a revision of the TAG finding "URIs, Addressability, and the use of HTTP
GET and POST" that I have published as the 21 March 2004 draft [2]. The
only change from the previous approved draft was the addition of a link
to ongoing work in the W3C Web Services Description Working Group, in
section 6.

 _ Ian
