Dear www-tag,

The TAG held three teleconferences during this period. Summaries
of those meetings are linked from the TAG home page [2].

1) Architecture Document

  The TAG continues to process Last Call comments on the
  Architecture Document. 
    http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-webarch-20031209/
  
  The Editor made available the 7 May and 10 May 2004 Editor's 
  Drafts, which take into account TAG decisions from the 
  past couple of months as well as editorial suggestions. The
  10 May draft is available at:
    http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2004/webarch-20040510/

2) Issues

  The TAG did not accept, decide, or discuss any general
  issues during this period.

  Details about discussions and related actions are available in
  the meeting minutes linked from the TAG's home page. The TAG's
  issues list is available at: http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ilist

3) Findings

  The TAG approved one revised finding during this period:

   "Internet Media Type registration, consistency of use"
       http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2004/0430-mime.html

  The TAG continues to work on a number of other draft
  findings. More information about TAG findings is available at:
    http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/findings

4) Communication

  The TAG continued to discuss architectural considerations
  around Internet top level domains (TLDs), specifically the
  proposed TLDs ".mobi" and ".xxx".

  The TAG also responded positively to an update from the
  Web Services Description Working Group about the inclusion
  of a "safety" property in WSDL 2.0, in response to TAG
  issue whenToUseGet-7 [1]. The TAG expects to continue to
  liaise with the WSD WG on this matter.

5) Upcoming

  The TAG meets face-to-face in Boston from 12-14 May to
  continue to resolve Last Call issues raised about the
  Architecture Document, but also to make progress on
  other general issues.

  Several TAG participants will also be attending the
  May 2004 Advisory Committee meeting where they will
  present an update of the TAG's work.

  Ian Jacobs will give an overview of the Architecture Document
  as part of the W3C Track of WWW2004. More information about 
  the W3C Track is available at:
