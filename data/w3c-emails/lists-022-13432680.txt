Hello,

The first draft of the minutes from the TAG's 12-14 May
face-to-face meeting in Cambridge, MA (USA) are available:
   http://www.w3.org/2004/05/14-tag-summary.html

I have not included them as text below since this is a lengthy document.

I have updated the TAG's general issues list in light of 
meeting discussion;
   http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html

Still to do (in the next day or two):

  * Update the last call issues list in light of discussion.
  * Publish an agenda for the 24 May meeting highlighting those
    issues where actions were taken.
  * Announce issue resolutions to reviewers.

 _ Ian
