I need to go away and investigate how you get this to work, i.e. what the DTD / XSD would look like. 
 
GA: No need to worry about DTD/XSD; just assume it is no problem. Better to focus on vocabulary and semantics. 

One final wrinkle:

what would be the impact of: 

<par>
  <seq>
    <cue select="id(T27)" dur="3s" use="a1"/>
    <cue select="id(T28)" dur="3s" use="a2"/>
  </seq>
  <cue begin="1s" dur="2s" use="a3"/>
</par>

I.e. an attempt to modify the style partway through the sequence. 

What would the 3rd animation be limited to - just that inside the <par>?

GA:  There is no problem in principle to this (although you need to select some content with the last cue). We can use the additive and accumulate animation attributes to determine combinatorial effects and we can define implicit additive semantics as well. See http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/animate.html#AdditionAttributes as an example.
