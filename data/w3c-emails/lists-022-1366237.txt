MFU> Actually, while there are some key views we do not share, often the differences are more apparent than real. For example in this note, I'm not wedded to the abstract syntax in particular, it is just one example of a user-friendly syntax.  We both seem to agree that a reader-friendly syntax would be helpful in some situations. I can live with N3 far better than raw OWL/RDF.

I object to this strongly -- that syntax is neither reader friendly 
nor actually a part of the recommendation.  Much more importantly, we 
should be creating fragments that people can cut and paste into their 
documents (and edit) -- forcing them to figure out the mapping from 
the so-called human readable syntax into actually RDF or OWL (XML or 
N3) makes no sense.

MFU: in cases when it is likely that cut and pasting fragments is likely to done, the actual OWL fragment should be available, but I prefer it at the end in an appendix, and to keep the flow of the text more readable and more quickly understood.  Recent exchanges which had varoius OWL fragments, I think are very unlikely to be cut/pasted and parsed.

I advocate use of "turtle" - which should be the first document this 
WG approves as a working note (if Dave is willing)

what is parser friendly?

well, we could get into whether this is a voting issue for a WG (be 
careful when you use words like "majority" in a W3C group) but my 
vote is for N3 (Turtle) which is a nice compromise - or else to stick 
w/the RDF/XML for cut and paste reasons
