Agenda

1. Action Item Review
2. Open Issues

************************************************************************
Administrivia
************************************************************************

[GA] Notes WGBH is now W3C Member; Geoff Freed is primary rep.

[GA] Notes that Patrick Schmitz will no longer be listed as TTWG member
but will remain as lurker on member mail list in order to field answers
on SMIL timing and synchronization as required.

************************************************************************
1. Action Items Review
************************************************************************

Action: [GA] Investigate how to force line break before or after an
element via style property in a context where CR/NL are being treated
as whitespace for the purpose of automatic wrapping. Q: how to
implement in XSL the following:

e:before { content: "\A" }
e:after { content: "\A" }

when e is an inline element in a block context that performs linefeed
normalization (to space) and does auto wrap?

XSL has break-before and break-after properties, but doesn't take
a "line" value (takes "column", "page", etc.).

Resolution: Use break-before and break-after with new "line"
value. Close action.

Follow-Up Action: [GA] Ask XSL-FO Subgroup on their opinion on this
decision (to use break-{before,after} with value "line").

Action: [MG] Investigate need to add endsync parameter to R403.

Resolution: Add endsync to R403. Close action.

Action: [TM] Investigate need to add repeat, restart, fill parameters
to R403.

Resolution: Add repeat, restart, and fill related timing
parameters to R403. Close action.

Action: [DS] Will contribute a 3GPP Timed Text example.

In-progress.

Action: [SH] Will contribute SAMI examples.

Done.

Action: [DK] Will contribute spec on AML and example. Will check on
guidelines document.

Done. Expect guidelines documentation to be updated and can distribute
to members in perhaps a few weeks.

Action: [SH] Will cook AML example as SAMI as a variant example.

Waiting on example to be posted.

Action: [MG] Will contribute Daisy time text example.

No input yet.

Action: [GA] Will contribute some examples showing generic timed text.

Ongoing.

Action: [JB] Will check if he can contribute examples.

Ongoing and [GA] will follow-up with John.

Action: [TM] Will contribute generic example.

No input yet.

************************************************************************
3. Open Issue Review
************************************************************************

Issue (I0306-001): Should we support any "float" related style
properties since we allow embedded inline and block graphics?

Resolution: Support float related properties in vocabulary, probably
not support in simple profiles (i.e., simple TT document types).

Close issue.

Issue (I0306-002: Whether to enhance R403 to include repeat, restart,
fill, and endsync parameters?

Agreed to incorporate into R403. Close issue.

************************************************************************
Next Meeting
************************************************************************

[GA] and [MD] unable to participat next week, will hold next meeting
on 2003-07-17.

*** RESOLUTIONS ***

Resolution: Use break-before and break-after with new "line"
value.

Resolution: Add endsync to R403.

Resolution: Add repeat, restart, and fill related timing
parameters to R403.

Resolution: Support float related properties in vocabulary, probably
not support in simple profiles (i.e., simple TT document types).

*** OPEN ACTION ITEMS ***

Action: [GA] To construct table of features/requirements for which we
need a volunteer to provide example(s). Also solicit examples based
on existing systems, such as 3GPP, AML, SAMI, etc.

Action: [GA] Change second para of last note of S001 to change
"hearing impaired" to "deaf and hard of hearing".

Action: [GA] Add note under S001 saying that some communities use the
term Subtitling to encompass both uses described here (i.e.,
captioning and subtitling per S000 and S001).

Action: [GA] Ask SVG WG to comment on TT AF REQ WD.

Action: [GA] Craft new text for R221 based on above. Remove
vocabulary.  Leave in informative note refering to TEI as possible
source.

Action: [GA] Remove editorial notes under R501-R503 without any
further change. These notes are part of the process of defining
solution space.

Action: [GA] Add display style property to R505, and add note that
animation of some properties require reflow (relayout) of content,
e.g., display property.

Action: [GA] Close issue I004; resolution: permit animation of styles
that cause reflow.

Action: [GA] Add note to N506 explaining that "animation of content"
means to change element content via animation, e.g., adding/changing
text() or element children nodes.

Action: [GA] Add note under introduction "Don't Panic! You may not
have to deal with complicated feature X because we plan to profile
via documents types." [Sean's suggestion.]

Action: [GA] I005 is closed by virtual of removal of R606.

Action: [GA] I006 is closed by virtual of removal of R607.

Action: [DS] Will contribute a 3GPP Timed Text example.

Action: [SH] Will cook AML example as SAMI as a variant example.

Action: [MG] Will contribute Daisy time text example.

Action: [GA] Will contribute some examples showing generic timed text.

Action: [JB] Will check if he can contribute examples.

Action: [TM] Will contribute generic example.

Action: [GA] Ask XSL-FO Subgroup on their opinion on this
decision (to use break-{before,after} with value "line").
