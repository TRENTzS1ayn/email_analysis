************************************************************************
Agenda
************************************************************************

1. R209 - Whether to include or exclude paragraph item

Resolution: Leave paragraph in R209.

2. ISO Standards Update

[DS] ITU-T SG9 adopts in J.123 ISO MPEG4 Media File Format and 3GPP Timed
Text, adopted a minor extension to permit software wrapping; MPEG4 also
has a stream format for timed text; some people at 3GPP would like a RTP
format for timed text; question, should there be a general format that
can take different types of timed text or only for 3GPP TT? In future,
we probably want to do something to support a binary payload in RTP.

3. Action Items

[GA] Doesn't have materials to do full review today (on the road);
reminds [EH] regarding input on changes to "Description" use-case
scenario. [GA] is in process of incorporating other errata from [EH].
Will try to have an outline for the draft spec *real soon now*.

4. F2F Reminder

[TM] Requests [SH] to send logistic info for meeting and reminds
participants to register.
