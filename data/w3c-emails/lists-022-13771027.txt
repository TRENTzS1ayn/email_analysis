If you are happy to use a SMIL wrapper to sequence and time the presentation,
you can use the digital talking book specification and you don't need TT-AF
which will be a more lightweight specification for marking the timing in the
file with the text content, IIRC.

http://www.loc.gov/nls/niso/

Secondly, the best practice is not to apply the style inline in the timing
script, but it would be natural to associate a stylesheet cascade with each
channel or display region.  But you still want to put a well-articulated
display-mode-independent basis for the styling in the markup of the text 
itself.

Why does the text have hard line breaks?  Typical cases are lists and poems.
The text markup should identify the list or poem and its sub-items the
stylesheet can then break the lines accordingly.

To indicate the rhetorical role of text subsets, use element types to the
fullest extent that they are defined to express this and class attribute
values for refinement beyond what can be expressed in the element typology.

Review the use of types and classes in the talking book DTDs for examples
of this good practices.

CSS provides facilities to apply styles by ID-keyed selctors but this is
should be avoided.  Talk with someone else to help you articulate the
rationale for the style.  Then encode the basis for the styling decisions in
[elements and attributes in] the content markup, and key the result to the
encoded basis by the selector in your separate style rule.  This will give
you a rule you can lift and reuse.

Yes, this is an important rendering decision.  However, a separated approach
would still put the rationale for the presentation decision in the content
markup, and key the presentation effect to this in a style rule as above.

Compare with the overflow-related properties in CSS3 box model.  String-search
for 'overflow' in

  CSS3 module: The box model
  http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/

What a text fragment between timing marks is played into is a box again,
just in screen-by-time and not just screenX-by-screenY.

By analogy with these properties we can come up with a
rendering-in-space-time processing model and allocate the encoding of the
necessary control information to TT-AF and separate style sheets in the
context of the elaborated processing requirements.
