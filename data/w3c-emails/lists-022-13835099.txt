Thank you for the thoughtful response.  There's a lot of agreement, 
here.  A few
clarifications inline below.

Absolutely.  Most of what they have you don't need.  But most of what you need
has a precedent in there somewhere.  [And some of what they have you may 
need and
not have articulated the need yet.]

Yes.  This is one of my major points.  And I don't think that either SMIL
or HTML give us a precedent we can 'just use' and meet the needs of the
future world where multimodal interaction and device-independent authoring
are intrinsic in the web technology.

Among the variations in 'delivery context' that are used by people with
disabilities there are variations in the pagination/chunking and
pull-vs.-push balance in the dialog.  I see this as a re-engineering
requirement because the precedent in HTML is for the content document to
cite its proper stylesheets, whereas the correct decision flow is that the
style policy is decided based on the content and delivery context, jointly.
The content document should cite the rhetorical ontology used in classifying
the content, not the style policy repertory appropriate for presenting the
content.

In tactical terms it could mean that there are pure and adapted forms of the
content in the process flow.  An XSL transform that inserts the style refs
appropriate to the delivery context of the moment.  But it is clear that
the content maintenance form is the pure.

The display and the user enter into the decision as to which timing should
be used.  In the long run we may be able to get the user's need articulated
and uploaded for server satisfaction.  But in the mean time the user may be
browsing options and interactively selecting an option that works for them.

The Device Independence authoring discussions have been good in terms of
factoring the enumeration of the _presentation decisions to be made_, the
_delivery context factors affecting the decisions_ and the _content factors
affecting the decisions_ into three spaces that then get composed in the final
analysis.

Saying that will earn you the undying opposition of the accessibility 
community.
[emphasis often cues that subliminally you understand that you have a weak 
position...]

The "authoring format" must accept as a prior and external constraint that it
composes well with post-authoring changes in styling decisions.  Compare with
the W3C Recommendation known as

  User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0
  http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/

in particular

  1.6 User control
  http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/intro.html#user-control

  4. Ensure user control of rendering
  http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG10/guidelines.html#gl-user-control-styles

Even 'though 80% of the use of the TT-AF may be to drive delivery contexts
such as analog TV where the user's entire control over the caption pane is a
boolean 'present/absent' control, the format must be architected for a
universe of modes of use which include user-directed re-styling of the
content which has been captured in the authoring format.

The decision flow is roughly that the User Agent gives the upper hand initially
to the author in setting style decisions, but in the end to the user.  We 
talked
this through to a mutually-tolerable detente with the SMIL group concerning the
'override' attribute.

Because it gives zero information for the creator of an alternate style, and
because it is a missed opportunity to create a reusable style rule.

A unique styling is still usually rationalizable based on a unique
conjunction of content factors and delivery context factors.  The problem is
that articulating the underlying factors is a knowledge engineering task
that takes getting "out of one's box" which in practice takes a second set
of eyes -- passing the work by another person.  That doesn't come free.
There have to be Enterprise Integration payoffs to make this level of
rationality affordable, but in business contexts the EI payoffs are
generally lurking in the situation.

Content modeling is difficult.  So it may seem messy.  But the correct
factorization into style vs. content includes more in the 'content' than
what people will at first recognize as their content.  The difference can be
roughly described as articulating the rhetorical roles of sub-parts of the
content.  It takes some push-back, extra effort, to get the content fully
articulated with rhetorical-role properties in place.

What I am saying should be articulated as _content_ aspects or properties is
not the style including indents and fonts.

But the basis for the style, such as: class="new featured"

  class use - innovations only, pls.
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/2001JulSep/0491.html

Then in the stylesheet one selects the domain of a style rule by articulated
content features.

The point is that where there are variations in the styling, there is an
underlying rhetorical shift.  Get the rhetorical shift and the content model
supports multiple adapted views, not just the one that you envisioned.  If only
one presentation is worked through to completion, the factorization into 
content
and style is generally a failure.

>It's a triumvarate
>
>Style + Content + Timing. Ideally none should be intermixed with the other.

An ideal that breaks down on close examination, but still a direction to try
to move in.  Actually the reality is that there is presentation which if we
are lucky is factored reasonably well into some sort of resource base and
[one or more] presentation transform[s].  Until there are actually multiple
views in play and checked in the authoring, it is a fiction anyway.
Consider the mso practice of using style names as class tokens.  This is not
the accessible practice.

But timing couples with chunking couples with [in interactive spaces]
navigation couples with styling.  So the schema for the 'content' model
has to be iterated on until successful multi-view presentation is reliably
achieved.  What I am talking about are the pre-style content properties
that are a sufficient basis to key the selection of appropriate styles
in different presentation spaces from a caption window to a voice browser
dialog.

The architecture of the future web, particularly for authoring, is an
architecture for authoring the content model that supports extraction in
multiple views, a model that is appropriate to multiple delivery contexts.
