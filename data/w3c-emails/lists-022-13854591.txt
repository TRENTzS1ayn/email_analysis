Glenn,
 





The last cue does not select content because I want the animation to affect
the content already selected by the previous two cues.

 
GA: this would still require selecting content. It would be awkward to have
an implicit selection.
 

[JB> ] I don't have a problem with selecting the content - I can see how
implicit slection could cause complications witrh inherited style etc.

 
in your example reproduced below....
 
<style>
  p { display : none; color: blue }
</style>
<animations>
  <animation id="a1">
    <set attributeName="display" to="auto"/>
  </animation>
  <animation id="a2">
    <set attributeName="color" to="red"/>
  </animation></animations>
<par>
  <cue select="id(p1)" use="a1"/>
  <seq>
    <cue select="id(w1)" use="a2" dur="1"/>
    <cue select="id(w2)" use="a2" dur="1"/>
    <cue select="id(w3)" use="a2" dur="1"/>
    <cue select="id(w4)" use="a2" dur="1"/>
    <cue select="id(w5)" use="a2" dur="1"/>
    <cue select="id(w6)" use="a2" dur="1"/>
  </seq>
</par>
</par>
...
<p id="p1">
  <span id="w1">Scooby</span>
  <span id="w2">dooby</span>
  <span id="w3">doo</span>,
  <span id="w4">where</span>
  <span id="w5">are</span>
  <span id="w6">you</span>?
</p>
 
Can we dispense with the spans, i.e. is there a way that the select can
extract from a single element. BTW Your spans lost the whitespace - unless
there is some assumed mechanism for re-inserting it?.
 
<p id="p1">
  Scooby dooby doo where are you?
</p>
