My experience is that relying upon whitespace in marked up content is problematic for a variety of reasons. It is much better to use xml:space=preserve and then subsequently perform whitespace normalization during formatting in combination with explicit markup or style properties to indicate forced line breaks.
 
The WG recently added "force line break" to the requirements for content vocabulary as well as adding break-after and break-before style properties that take a "line" value. The WG sees these as the prefered ways to indicate line break semantics.

[JB> ]  Yes - you're right - I did forget the newlines. I think for subtitling/captioning you'd want a fairly verbatim transcription of the content of the <p> element into the displayed region. So I'd expect:
 

  <span id="w1">Scooby</span> <span id="w2">dooby</span> <span id="w3">doo</span>, <span id="w4">where</span> <span id="w5">are</span> <span id="w6">you</span>?

To produce the output  
Scooby dooby doo, where are you?

and 
  <span id="w1">Scooby</span> <span id="w2">dooby</span> <span id="w3">doo</span>, 

  <span id="w4">where</span> <span id="w5">are</span> <span id="w6">you</span>?


To produce the output  
Scooby dooby doo,
where are you?



Which I assume it would :-)
