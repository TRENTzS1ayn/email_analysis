We would have to extend XPointer to handle ranges that involve words or lines. At present, ranges demarcate their endpoints using character offsets or element offsets, e.g., from 2nd to 4th character, from before element E to after element F, etc.
 
Doing a line selector is problematic unless it is based strictly on forced line breaks in content, which would require the authoring system to predetermine line breaks and which would not work well if UA or device could change fonts or layout region. It might be possible to introduce a form of "pseudo" selector that makes selection based on units that are not determinable by lexical content. CSS provides such selectors.

I think I prefer the range selector functionality over a word selector - since it wouldn't stop there - you'd also want a line selector, a character selector...
