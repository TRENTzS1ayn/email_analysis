Mike,

I strongly support your suggestion about this.
I recently sent an email to the protege discussion list about this
(see [1]).

- Protege's OWL pluging is already able to export the Abstract Syntax,
- they are about to make a new tab for it which allows you to copy/paste
  the abstract syntax from the screen
- there is an on-line service in Manchester which translates the XML/RDF
  syntax to Abstract Syntax (see [2])
  (all we need is a convertor in the other direction (should be easy)
- all examples in our new textbook (<http://www.semanticwebprimer.org>)
  are also given in abstract syntax,
- see [3] and [4] for a long example (the infamous wildlife example)
  in both raw RDF/XML and Abstract Syntax, and see the difference

Frank.
