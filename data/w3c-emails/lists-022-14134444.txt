[JB> ] CSS wrap-option property does not have a value that produces balanced
lines. Justification properties do not appear to help either. 

GA: What do you mean by "balanced lines"? If you mean left and right block
justified, then the text-align property would be used to specify justify.
Whether to perform soft layout, i.e., UA line wrapping, is independent of
the alignment of line areas in the containing block area.

[JB> ]  No I don't mean block justified. It's an issue of where in the lines
to put a line break. 
 
So given a content of "Scooby dooby doo where are you?" a typical line break
mechanism might break this as follows for a 22 character 2 line display (for
ease lets assume a fixed font - as in Teletext).



Scooby dooby doo where 
are you?

The more balanced lines would be
 
Scooby dooby doo 
where are you?

From Australian Caption Centre guidelines
 
" Where possible, caption lines should also be similar in length because
this makes them much easier to read." 

 

YMMV

 

There are a number of other 'rules' regarding line breaking that may or may
not be desirable. However most of these require a detailed understanding of
grammar....which I think is probably straying well outside the remit....
