The type of line break behavior you refer to below is considered to be an advanced typesetting feature only available in fairly high-end pre-press systems (it is known in typesetting as "river control"). I can't imagine that any subtitle/cc user agent would implement it.
 
See http://www.coathook.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/comp/comp3a.htm for some discussion of river control.
 
Also, clearly a UA is not going to perform sentential analysis to determine line break points.

[JB> ] CSS wrap-option property does not have a value that produces balanced lines. Justification properties do not appear to help either. 

GA: What do you mean by "balanced lines"? If you mean left and right block justified, then the text-align property would be used to specify justify. Whether to perform soft layout, i.e., UA line wrapping, is independent of the alignment of line areas in the containing block area.

[JB> ]  No I don't mean block justified. It's an issue of where in the lines to put a line break. 
 
So given a content of "Scooby dooby doo where are you?" a typical line break mechanism might break this as follows for a 22 character 2 line display (for ease lets assume a fixed font - as in Teletext).



Scooby dooby doo where 
are you?

The more balanced lines would be
 
Scooby dooby doo 
where are you?

From Australian Caption Centre guidelines
 
" Where possible, caption lines should also be similar in length because this makes them much easier to read." 

 

YMMV

 

There are a number of other 'rules' regarding line breaking that may or may not be desirable. However most of these require a detailed understanding of grammar....which I think is probably straying well outside the remit....
