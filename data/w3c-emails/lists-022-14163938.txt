Glenn,
 
Interesting, I was unaware that there was a type-setting term for this. I'm
not surprised though.
 
[GA] I can't imagine that any subtitle/cc user agent would implement it.
 
It's true that the majority of current distribution formats assume that
there is little or no UA re-layout of content, that's because these formats
are distribution formats. TT-AF is not. I anticipate that there will be a
requirement to translate TT-AF into distribution formats for many
applications - not just subtitling / captioning. Since these distribution
formats may well implicitly impose various display limitations (e.g. fixed
line lengths, colour limitations, font sizes), the inclusion of mechanisms
within TT-AF to hint at the preferred end results would be useful.
 
Line balancing is hardly rocket science...
 
BTW - I'm not suggesting a sentential analysis of the content.
 
But certain basic rules.
 
1) In a fixed size region - move words from line to line until line lengths
balance.
2) avoid short (i.e. 1 character or 2 charater words at the ends of
sentences)
 
e.g. 
She was annoyed because
I didn't ask her to come with us.

 

is preferred over

She was annoyed because I
didn't ask her to come with us.

The type of line break behavior you refer to below is considered to be an
advanced typesetting feature only available in fairly high-end pre-press
systems (it is known in typesetting as "river control"). I can't imagine
that any subtitle/cc user agent would implement it.
 
See http://www.coathook.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/comp/comp3a.htm
<http://www.coathook.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/comp/comp3a.htm>  for some
discussion of river control.
 
Also, clearly a UA is not going to perform sentential analysis to determine
line break points.
 
G.

[JB> ] CSS wrap-option property does not have a value that produces balanced
lines. Justification properties do not appear to help either. 

GA: What do you mean by "balanced lines"? If you mean left and right block
justified, then the text-align property would be used to specify justify.
Whether to perform soft layout, i.e., UA line wrapping, is independent of
the alignment of line areas in the containing block area.

[JB> ]  No I don't mean block justified. It's an issue of where in the lines
to put a line break. 
 
So given a content of "Scooby dooby doo where are you?" a typical line break
mechanism might break this as follows for a 22 character 2 line display (for
ease lets assume a fixed font - as in Teletext).



Scooby dooby doo where 
are you?

The more balanced lines would be
 
Scooby dooby doo 
where are you?

From Australian Caption Centre guidelines
 
" Where possible, caption lines should also be similar in length because
this makes them much easier to read." 

 

YMMV

 

There are a number of other 'rules' regarding line breaking that may or may
not be desirable. However most of these require a detailed understanding of
grammar....which I think is probably straying well outside the remit....
