While it isn't rocket science, it isn't trivial either. It basically maps to the integer programming problem, which requires backtracking. Keep in mind that you would have to balance over a potentially arbitrary number of lines and you would have to parameterize how unbalanced to permit a given line.
 
In a former career, I developed hyphenation and justification engines for the pre-press industry, wherein I implemented river control. I can assure you it is non-trivial, and I would not expect any AF to DF (distribution format) transcoder to implement such a feature simply on the basis of cost to benefit ratio.

Glenn,
 
Interesting, I was unaware that there was a type-setting term for this. I'm not surprised though.
 
[GA] I can't imagine that any subtitle/cc user agent would implement it.
 
It's true that the majority of current distribution formats assume that there is little or no UA re-layout of content, that's because these formats are distribution formats. TT-AF is not. I anticipate that there will be a requirement to translate TT-AF into distribution formats for many applications - not just subtitling / captioning. Since these distribution formats may well implicitly impose various display limitations (e.g. fixed line lengths, colour limitations, font sizes), the inclusion of mechanisms within TT-AF to hint at the preferred end results would be useful.
 

Line balancing is hardly rocket science...
 
BTW - I'm not suggesting a sentential analysis of the content.
 
But certain basic rules.
 
1) In a fixed size region - move words from line to line until line lengths balance.
2) avoid short (i.e. 1 character or 2 charater words at the ends of sentences)
 
e.g. 
She was annoyed because
I didn't ask her to come with us.

 

is preferred over

She was annoyed because I
didn't ask her to come with us.

The type of line break behavior you refer to below is considered to be an advanced typesetting feature only available in fairly high-end pre-press systems (it is known in typesetting as "river control"). I can't imagine that any subtitle/cc user agent would implement it.
 
See http://www.coathook.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/comp/comp3a.htm for some discussion of river control.
 
Also, clearly a UA is not going to perform sentential analysis to determine line break points.

Glenn 

[JB> ] CSS wrap-option property does not have a value that produces balanced lines. Justification properties do not appear to help either. 

GA: What do you mean by "balanced lines"? If you mean left and right block justified, then the text-align property would be used to specify justify. Whether to perform soft layout, i.e., UA line wrapping, is independent of the alignment of line areas in the containing block area.

[JB> ]  No I don't mean block justified. It's an issue of where in the lines to put a line break. 
 
So given a content of "Scooby dooby doo where are you?" a typical line break mechanism might break this as follows for a 22 character 2 line display (for ease lets assume a fixed font - as in Teletext).



Scooby dooby doo where 
are you?

The more balanced lines would be
 
Scooby dooby doo 
where are you?

From Australian Caption Centre guidelines
 
" Where possible, caption lines should also be similar in length because this makes them much easier to read." 

 

YMMV

 

There are a number of other 'rules' regarding line breaking that may or may not be desirable. However most of these require a detailed understanding of grammar....which I think is probably straying well outside the remit....
