[GA>]  and I would not expect any AF to DF (distribution format) transcoder
to implement such a feature simply on the basis of cost to benefit ratio.
 
[JB>]
Yet the present set of CSS properties [JB> ] effectively  preclude the use
of 'river control' even if an AF to DF transcoder implements it as a matter
of customer requirement. I notice that the line-break property in CSS3
Candidate Release is commented as follows:
 
"This property selects the set of line breaking rules to be used for text.
The values described below are especially useful to CJK authors, but the
property itself is open to other, not yet specified settings for non-CJK
authors as well. (This is an area for future expansion.)"
 
bold is my emphasis.
 
I wonder if there isn't a window of opportunity to suggest that a 'auto'
value be included for this property - such that the UA can make it's own
choice of line-break strategy? The 'normal' value has no specified behaviour
for non CJK text - but I personally feel that a UA which implemented
river-control for non CJK text for line-break="normal" would be contrary to
most users expectations.
