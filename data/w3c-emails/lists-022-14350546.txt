----- comments: 

Nokia has reviewed the current Working Draft "Timed Text (TT) Authoring Format 1.0 Use Cases and Requirements" of Sept 15 [1]. We request the TT WG to address the following comments when producing the next Working Draft:

NOK-1: The TT AF should not duplicate functionality that can already be found from existing or upcoming W3C Recommendations. Instead it should adopt useful functionality from W3C languages such as SMIL, XHTML, SVG or CSS. We request adding such a requirement to section 4.1. 

NOK-2: Use of the TT AF in combination with SVG and SMIL are very important and should be mentioned as a requirement. For instance, it should be possible to use the TT AF as a 'textstream' media object in a SMIL presentation.

NOK-3: Use of the TT AF as a distribution format is insufficiently represented in use cases and in requirements. It appears that the TT AF is primarily intended as an authoring format that serves as input to a transcding process into a proprietary distribution format. Use of the TT AF as distribution format should be at least equally important as serving as an authoring format.

NOK-4: A "Basic" language profile of the TT AF should also be defined that is suitable for distribution to constraint embedded devices such as mobile terminals. We request adding such a requirement to section 4.1. 

NOK-5 It must be possible to author TT documents in a device independent way. We request adding such a requirement to section 4.1.
