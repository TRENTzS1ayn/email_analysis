I am one of the latter (people who argue that it must be easy for machines).

I think that people's height or people's age might fall into this category.

Many people, particularly important people, will spread disinformation on 
these basic issues.
Thus in the virtual world it perhaps is simply not the case that people 
have a unique height or a unique date-of-birth; virtual people are more 
ambiguous than real people.

My seven year old son has worked that out: he now has three or four 
different identities at lego.com; he's still shying from making one of them 
female but, he will get there soon.

(You may note that my view of the Semantic Web is a virtual world, not 
dependent on an underlying physical world in which Osama bin Laden does 
have a unique height and my son does have a unique gender: I should 
probably try and articulate that within the work of Baudrillard or Derrrida 
but ...)

Even if Jim's funders could find the man and took TV pictures of him 
standing upright with a ruler (showing *the* correct height), many people 
(outside the US) would still be suspicious and suggest that the pictures 
were faked. I don't think it is possible to successfully and convincingly 
validate the virtual world against a real one.
