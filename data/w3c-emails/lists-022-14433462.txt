This is essentially the situation in TV subtitling - the display
resolution is known and fixed. All subtitling is performed using bitmaps,
(open is a bitmap burnt over video, Teletext use a pre-rasterised font in
the decoder chip of the TV, DVB uses bitmaps that are RLE encoded).

I totally agree.... in the emission context there is a fair
probablility that conversion to a bitmap form will occur prior to emission
for TT (simply because of prior art). It is one of my companies current aims
to add the ability for bitmaps to be propogated through the chain from
authoring to display, for channel identification, logos etc. Whilst these
usages may not fall into the TT charter, the ability of TT to carry bitmap
data would IMHO considerably enhance its utility in the contexts in which it
is likely to be used. Unicode does not cover every conceivable character -
and there are always notations that are private or not in common use that
may require transmission by TT. Some of these may not be efficiently carried
by SVG.

Personally I feel that in most cases the cause is lost for existing
**emission systems** (e.g. TV, DAB, DVD) adopting TT. However, for new
applications there is an opportunity provided that the TT standard is
flexible enough. For me, the major role for TT will be in the authoring,
storage and data exchange contexts.

Certainly if TT were to be adopted for subtitling for our purposes
it would need a parallel or extension mechanism to carry timed graphic data.
Current multimedia standards (eg SMIL) are generally not appropriate for
subtitling.
