Sorry, in subtitling the start of presentation of a subtitle is referred to
as its on-air (or in-cue), the time at which the subtitle is removed from
display is the off-air (or out-cue). On-air and off-air are probably more
correctly used when talking about Open subtitling (where the subtitle is
burnt in to the video image prior to transmission) - although 'we' also tend
to use on-air and off-air when discussing DVB rendering of subtitles
(conversion to bitmap form and encapsulation in PES packets). In the
authoring environment the terms in-cue and out-cue are the norm - and refer
to the timecode at which the subtitle is desired to first appear and the
timecode at which it must disappear.

I must admit I find this a sublte distinction - do you anticipate there
being a major difference between the format of an access unit and a
presentation unit for TT? (encryption and compression issues aside).

<LOL>
I wish this was the case in DVB decoders. Recalling previous emails about
hanging subtitles - this is part of the issue. The decoders we have
encountered (and I doubt there are many we haven't) - all generally decode
subtitle data packets strictly in order of reception - regardless of whether
the presentation time has passed even - then when they get behind they drop
packets! A classic case of implementing only the bare essentials....
