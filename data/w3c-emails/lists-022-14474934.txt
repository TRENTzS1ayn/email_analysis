So do you see the form of the presentation unit as always being a bitmap? I
would favour not defining the presentation unit at all - since its form will
be largely dependent upon the qualities of the display surface. I see that
there is a useful distinction to be made between the two however, not least
to illustrate any overheads and implications in converting from access units
to presentation units.
