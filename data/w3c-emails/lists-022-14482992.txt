I concur that we probably would not define the form of a
presentation unit as such. However, it is useful to have
this term defined in an abstract system model.

if the access unit were a compressed image, e.g., JPEG, PNG, 
etc., then there would be a non-zero decoding time. Further,

and non-zero decoding time as well. 
  

So do you see the form of the presentation unit as always being a bitmap? I would favour not defining the presentation unit at all - since its form will be largely dependent upon the qualities of the display surface. I see that there is a useful distinction to be made between the two however, not least to illustrate any overheads and implications in converting from access units to presentation units.
