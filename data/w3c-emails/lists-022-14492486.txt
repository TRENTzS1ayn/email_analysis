I should have added "In the UK and Europe...." :-)

Geoff is absolutely correct in that NA makes a stronger differentiation
between Hard of Hearing captioning and Language translation subtitling.
Although the term captioning is sometimes used in the UK, the tendency is to
refer to all text representation of speech as "subtitling" - and to
distinguish the equivalent of  NA captioning as "subtitling for the hard of
hearing" or "own language subtitling".

There are other differences between NA captioning and UK/European subtitling
(including hard of hearing subtitling). In the UK it is I believe more
common to use Snake and Add-on modes for subtitles. Also generally
subtitling enjoys a higher data rate in UK/Europe, as hard of hearing
subtitling is predominantly carried in Teletext (which allows more bytes per
video frame). Language translation subtitling is carried in both Teletext
and DVB bitmap. (It is uncommon for DVB to carry hard of hearing
subtitling).

I'm not sure we need get to concerned about defining captioning vs
subtitling, since TT should be agnostic to the 'higher' meaning of the text
being transmitted :-) I would suggest that the terms subtitle and caption do
not appear in the TT standard - since both carry a number of connotations.
(In the UK a caption is the label to a picture).
