Actually, I think we should define this terminology
very clearly in our work, as there has been much confusion
because of variant usage.
 
In a recent working document in SMPTE, these have been
defined as follows:
 
Captions
 
Text that is a representation, often in the
same language, of dialog and audio events occurring during
scenes of a motion picture. (Generally associated with
dialog and audio event translation for the deaf and hard
of hearing.)
 
Subtitle
 
Text that is a representation, in a different language,
of dialog occurring during scenes of a motion picture.
Generally associated with dialog translation for localization
of a motion picture in a particular territory.
 
I would suggest we adopt these definitions for our
working language unless and until we need to clarify them
further.

I'm not sure we need get to concerned about defining captioning vs subtitling, since TT should be agnostic to the 'higher' meaning of the text being transmitted :-) I would suggest that the terms subtitle and caption do not appear in the TT standard - since both carry a number of connotations. (In the UK a caption is the label to a picture).
