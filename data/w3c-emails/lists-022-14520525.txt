Well, at least for the purpose of defining requirements, I believe
the distinction provides additional insight. I'm not prepared to argue
either way for the inclusion of formal definitions in the ultimate
product of the group; however, my inclination would be to provide
at least an informative glossary where we make the distinction apparent.

I feel that these definitions **need not** form part of a TT standard document (unless the TT standard uses captioning or subtitling as an example of a TT application). Can you explain why you feel a distinction is necessary for the purposes of defining a TT standard?
