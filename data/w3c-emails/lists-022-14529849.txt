SMPTE's definitions leave room for ambiguity.  Captions are always in the
 same language as the program audio, for example, and they aren't limited to just
 motion  pictures.  I propose the following definition for captions:

"Textual representation of dialog, narration and other audio events, in the same
 language as the original presentation."

And for subtitles:

"Textual representation of dialog or narration in a language different from the
 original presentation."

We should also provide examples in the final recommendation, something we
 don't necessarily need to deal with right now.
