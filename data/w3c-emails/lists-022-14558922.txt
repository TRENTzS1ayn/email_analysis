I think we should be careful about re-defining terms that are perhaps
already adequately defined by standards organsiations :-)

Captioning is NOT always in the language of the program audio - for example
in the UK it is perfectly feasible on DTT (digital terrestrial TV) to have
English subtitles AND English captions (as separate user selections) for a
Welsh language (audio) program. To adopt the above definition would mean
that any 'foreign language' program that is **not** dubbed could only be
termed 'subtitled' - regardless of the inclusion of audio events and
narration (which are indicative of captioning cf subtitling).

I agree that the scope of the definition could be widened in the TT standard
to include all video and audio material (not just motion pictures).
