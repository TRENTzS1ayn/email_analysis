Talk about head-spinning...

It is becoming apparent that we should consider a broader definition of subtitle vs
 caption.  That is, not differentiating subtitles from captions based on language, but
 based on content:

-- captions contain additional information (sound effect cues, identifiers)
-- subtitles contain no additional information

In other words, the language of the original soundtrack *could* 
become irrelevant. 

Arguments?
