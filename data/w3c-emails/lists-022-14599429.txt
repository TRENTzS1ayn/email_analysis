But aside from texture, there is the granularity of comparison in

It has always been true that subtitles are NOT verbatim. There are
limitations in the number of characters per second that can be displayed via
any subtitling mechanism - not to mention the issues when multiple speakers
are simultaneously speaking. Part of the art of subtitling (by which I mean
the process of creating subtitles for a program) is to capture the essence
of what is spoken in a succinct form. In captioning there is a greater
tendency towards a verbatim transcript. (SMPTE definitions used).

However these distinctions are IMHO far removed from the requirements of a
TT standard - which should be to define an agnostic mechanism for the timed
delivery of text. Using XML, tags to provide distinction between the text
categories (for want of a better term) should be optional, but undefined by
the standard. The TT standard should IMHO only **define** tags that are
necessary for the temporal control of the display of text.
