I'm not so sure we can get away with this.  There are examples today of multi-level
 line-21 captioning (e.g., verbatim vs edited to a specific reading level), with no way
 to easily indicate what's in the data streams.  We could perhaps solve that with
 metadata that defines at least two types of data...

verbatim:true/false
level: x, xx, xxx, etc., where x=editing level, reading speed, whatever

...indicating to the user that two or three or four streams of data exist.  Of course, this
 opens up the problem of defining levels.  I'm not sure that's appropriate for this
 group.  But we could at least leave space for the options.
