Here's my understanding:

    Subtitles

        - Intended for all viewers who speak a given language*

        - Displayed by default for those viewers

        - Includes dialog only

    Captioning

        - Intended for hearing-impaired viewers

        - Displayed on request** by those viewers

        - Includes both dialog and audio events
          (generally visually differentiated by style, color, etc.)

    *For example, English translations of French dialogue for English-
    speaking viewers, which are unnecessary for French-speaking viewers.

    **Why isn't there a "I am hearing impaired" system preference?

This needs to be defined as part of the standard since content may include
both subtitles and captioning (although they will generally be exclusive).
