Geoff, I think we are discussing the TT standard with largely different
perspectives, in that I am hoping for a standard that defines a mechanism
**just** for the transport of Unicode characters together with timing
information that controls when and for how long it is displayed.

From your comments it appears to me that you anticipate the standard to
define markup that categorises the information carried. 

I am hoping that the standard does not include semantics for the text being
transported - yet provides the option of carrying private or proprietary
tags for semantics if desired. Similarly I am hoping that the style of the
displayed text is defined by an optional mechanism (e.g. style sheets) and
that the end presentation of the text is primarily the responsibility of the
**viewer** implementation (and could be much different to the authors
conception). I am hoping that the TT standard is **unlike** SMIL,
RealPlayer, Quicktime. These existing standards IMHO already provide
competent solutions where the **authors** intended presenation of the
material is preserved totally through the transmission chain to the display
surface.

In some respects I see TT as more of an XML schema than as a new protocol or
format, but hesitate to support an XML representation as I am unsure how
certain aspects could be implemented. Further I think the single hierarchy
that XML enforces could overcomplicate a TT format.
