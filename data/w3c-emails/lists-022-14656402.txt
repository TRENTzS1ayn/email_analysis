In Digital broadcasting multiple subtitles are transmitted in parallel for
multiple languages. Thus any viewer within the footprint can select any
language and the display of subtitles in digital broadcasting is a viewer
choice (since multiple choices exist). 

In UK/Europe, subtitles that are not visible until selected by the viewer
(Teletext and DVB) are termed 'closed'. If subtitles are displayed by
default for all viewers (that is they are 'burnt-in' to the video) they are
termed (in UK/Europe at least) 'open'.

IMHO the distinction is simpler:

    Subtitles

Text that is a representationof dialog occurring during scenes of
a motion picture.
Generally associated with dialog translation for localization of a
motion picture in a particular territory (see captioning).

    Captioning

      Subtitles intended for hearing-impaired viewers.
      Typically includes both dialog and audio events.

Note I have removed the restriction on language - since when multiple
languages may be carried it becomes less relevant - further there are
possibilities that subtitles may be used in the language of the speaker
(e.g. strong regional dialect or accent, reading of statements etc). For the
purposes of discussion in this forum - the SMPTE definitions are IMHO
adequate.

Again, I see no need for markup differentiating the type of text - why is
this felt necessary?
Further, it is certain that subtitles and captions will **co-exist** within
the same TT file. In Digital broadcasting, files for playout of subtitles
contain multiple language streams of subtitles, captions are just another
language stream. Of course this is largely an operational issue, but it is
convenient to have all the 'subtitle' and 'caption' material for a given
transmission in a single file.
