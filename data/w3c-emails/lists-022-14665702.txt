But these issues are surely outside of the scope of the TT charter? How
could any standard predict all the potential markup tags required to define
the semantics of text? I have no problem with providing a mechanism to
associate **private** semantic tags with text data, but as to indicating
what is in the streams - this is surely the role of an index or table of
contents? In DVB subtitling, where multiple subtitle streams exist, the
viewer is presented with a list of available streams from which they may
select the subtitles of their choice. This list is created by the 'decoder'
from information carried within the stream. The exact implementation of the
list and the selection mechanism is up to the 'decoder'. Some decoders do
not provide subtitles at all!
