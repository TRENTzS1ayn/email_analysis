I would prefer to state my position :-) as

"semantic markup vocabulary should be avoided where possible"

It may be necessary to include markup that has semantic implications, for
example hidden text that provides definitions of terms, expansions of
acronyms etc. 

The M.D.<hidden-hover>Managing Director<\hidden-hover> of Blah corporation
today....

Such a tag would have a meaning to the viewer implementation yet is also in
effect converying semantic information about the text it encompases. So I
tend towards a more mechanistic view - that the tags should represent
mechanisms involved in TT delivery and display (but not STYLE :-) - not the
semantic of the text itself. So TT should perhaps support layers of text
presentation - yet not in a way that implies what those layers are for.....
