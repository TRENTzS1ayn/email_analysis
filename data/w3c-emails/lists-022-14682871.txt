Have to agree - an XML representation might bring advantages - but it should
not be a pre-requisite. Would it be possible to have an XML representation
(with external documents?) that has a streamable format that is more
efficient and elegant than its XML representation?

If the representation is XML - then XML should be fully utilised - but TT
should IMHO support multiple language streams.

Somewhere in the charter it says that font is something to be left out of
TT. TT should require support for Unicode **characters**.

Could motion be part of the style rather than the text?

Absolutely, though it would be nice to be able to transfer glyphs that have
no unicode representation by some mechanism within TT (e.g. trademarks and
logos). Could this be by private data inclusion? Reference to external
streams?

AFAIK SMIL also doesn't allow the implementation of all of the buffering and
timing models (outlined by Glenn A. Adams) that are probably required.
