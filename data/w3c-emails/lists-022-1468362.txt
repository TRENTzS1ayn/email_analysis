Synonym, hypernym and hyponym aware free text search.

This is something that can clearly be done with WordNet on its own with or
without the semantic web.

It may however be interesting to be able to add controlled vocabularies,
e.g. the cancer ontology, to a general WordNet based text search engine, so
that we could determine the synonym, hypernym and hyponym relationships
between the 'labels' attached to concepts in the ontology.
