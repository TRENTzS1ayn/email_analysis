I think putting the burden of text-display characteristics on the viewer is an unfair
 one.  I am not against viewers overriding author choices, perhaps by using style
 sheets to control the style characteristics of the text, but I think it's incumbent on the
 author to provide captions or subtitles that convey information in a logical manner.
  ("Logical manner", of course, will differ from author to author and agency to
 agency, but that's another story....)  If viewers want to change the appearance of the
 captions (just as they can change the appearance of a Web page today), fine. 
 Otherwise authors might as well just provide a plain transcript and nothing more.

I, too, am hoping for a format unlike RealText, QText and SAMI.  Yes, they provide
 competent solutions for the display of text, but they're incompatible with each other.
  It's a real pain creating three different caption/subtitle files for a single presentation.
