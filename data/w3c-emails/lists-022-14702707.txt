External namespace support should be mandated.

BTW, SMIL2 supports this, so that for example display extensions can be 
loaded by SMIL viewers (though currently only real player has a useful 
implementation of this).

??? Can you explain this more John - I don't get what you just said :-)

The reduced format would be derivable from the XML format by using XSL to 
transform the document into whatever format was requested by the client.

But not *require* them I would have thought.

This is a function of the encoding used in XML documents, and is specified 
in the document declaration on the 1st line of conforming XML documents.

*All* display attributes should be external to the document IMO.

This could do with  including positioning (% of display height and width 
for example) for open caption devices. All of this sort of thing can be 
specified in css by linking the stylesheet to the document.

I think theres a data: url scheme which might work for some small snippets. 
Anybody got other ideas ?
