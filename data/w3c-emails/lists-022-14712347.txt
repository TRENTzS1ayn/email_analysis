I tend to agree with the NOT-STYLE comment : With that "hidden-hover" tag 
for example, the possibility should exist within a text stream for generic 
markup : But it should not actually specify the screen representation : 
that should be left to css.

The specific CSS support is then left to the displaying device.

For example some UAs may wish to render this as display:none, others as 
display:block.

One person may set up a user-stylesheet to render hidden markup as bold, 
another as a particular colour (because for example they have a degree of 
colour blindness). Some people may not wish to see the semantic markup at 
all, while others may want terminology explained and displayed differently 
(eg the <dt> tag in HTML).

These can all be handled by css without specifying the actual display type 
inline in the code.

Cheers,
Neil Smith.
