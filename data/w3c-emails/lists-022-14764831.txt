Yes.  For example, English-speaking viewers would receive subtitles for
English-speaking viewers, while French-speaking viewers would receive
subtitles for French-speaking viewers.

An important difference between subtitles and captions -- one of several
reasons why we must differentiate between them -- is that subtitles aren't
necessary for content already in the viewer's native language.  Captions
are.

The distinction is that you classify captioning as a type of subtitle
because you own "subtitling.com"?   :O)

Seriously, they're for different audiences (subtitles are dialog intended
for all speakers of a given language, captions are for the hearing-impaired
and contain more than just dialog) and have different mechanics (subtitles
should be displayed for all viewers who speak a given language, while
captions are specifically for the hearing-impaired), and TT must
differentiate between them unless accessibility is not a goal.

Between my last two posts on the topic this should be clear, but I welcome
specific questions.
