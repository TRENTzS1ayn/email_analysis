> I would prefer to state my position :-) as "semantic markup
vocabulary should be avoided where possible"   

[GAA> ]Is your concern that (1) all useful semantic markup can't be
predefined; or (2) no semantic markup should be defined.  If
it is the former, then that can be dealt with readily by proper
use of namespaces and schema validation.
[JB> ] I certainly agree with 1.

[GAA> ]My present view is that if there are a small number of
common semantic attributions that can be defined and that
support existing usage, then we should consider their inclusion.
[JB> ] But the use of this markup should be optional. If that was the case
then I would have no issue with it's inclusion, but would question its
usefulness, since optional tags **tend** to be ignored.

[GAA> ]One way we may handle your desire to have something specify
*only* the timing aspects is to produce our results in a modular
form, so that for those applications that only want timing, then
they could make use of only the module that defines it (along
with any prerequisite framework module).
[JB> ] Sounds interesting - would this be along the lines of the MPEG
profiles?

implications, for example hidden text 
that provides definitions of terms, expansions of acronyms etc.

[GAA> ]This is stylistic mark, not semantics markup). 

[JB> ]  Apologies for the poor example :-( 
The semantic meaning was intended to be 'this is a definition'
The stylistic meaning was intended to be 'this text is displayed in style
hidden-hover'

I'll try another :-)
The markup <caption> could IMHO have both semantic and stylistic
implications.
