(Sorry, I didn't proofread well enough.  Here's the real example.)

<seq>
   <tt:p begin="0s" dur="5s">One</tt:p>
   <tt:p dur="10s">Two</tt:p>
   <tt:p begin="1s" dur="5s" class="important">Three</tt:p>
</seq>

"One" displays immediately, at the start of the sequence, and ends 5
seconds later.  (Specifying a begin time of 0 seconds is optional, since
the default begin offset is always 0 seconds.)

"Two" displays 0 seconds (the default) after "One" -- i.e. 5 seconds
into the sequence.  It ends 10 seconds later, at 15 seconds into the
sequence.

Three" has a begin offset of 1 second, so it begins 1 second after "Two",
and has a duration of 5 seconds, so it ends at 21 seconds into the
sequence.  Visually, it is displayed using the "important" style.
