Absolutely - TT will hopefully be ideal for authoring, storage, QA and
pre-transmission manipulation.

By subtitling I am referring to my admittedly narrow perspective of
subtitling and captioning of broadcast video. I have looked at SMIL and
Quicktime and cannot see how to reconcile the timing aspects of these
standards with the timecode in an external broadcast signal (where the
timecode may be discontinuous due to advert insertion). Comments please?
