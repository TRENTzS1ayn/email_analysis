OK, I'll bite:

....
TCIn 01:03:28:18TCOut 01:03:30:00 "Jack, je tenais ? vous
pr?venir."
TCIn 01:03:32:05 TCOut 01:03:35:10 "Elle va mal. Son ?tat
s&apos;est beaucoup aggrav?.
TCIn 01:03:35:24 TCOut 01:03:38:04"Je lui ai donn? des
calmants."
....

Now an advert break occurs at 01:03:30:00 and lasts for five minutes. This
must be catered for. I.e. the TT must be able to refer to absolute external
timestamps (not 1 sec per sec 'real times'). Simlarly off times need to be
expressed wrt the program material, so even if specified as durations they
would be re-calculated by adding the duration to the TCIn value.
