Between subtitles two and three, above, there's a pause of 14 frames.  For such a short pause, I don't see a need to require an out time to erase the 
display
.  Instead, simply let the third subtitle replace the second.  That's how many captioning agencies do it today, and it's a good model.  Captions that are
 sequenced with tiny pauses between them cause the viewer to blink, and that's annoying.  If you need to pause between captions-- e.g., if there's 
nobody speaking-- *then* erase the display with an out time.  Otherwise it would be best to simply let the captions appear smoothly 
one after the other with no pause.
