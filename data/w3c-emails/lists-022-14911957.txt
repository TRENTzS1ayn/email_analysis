I'm not going to argue the case either way for timing between subtitles /
captions. It's entirely a matter for
the author and intended audience to resolve. I've seen it done all ways :-).
In the European market subtitles tend to be spaced. For add-on and snake
subtitling, sub second intervals for subtitling would be required.

Regardless, for TT to be universally useful, restrictions on duration or
timing accuracy should be avoided.
