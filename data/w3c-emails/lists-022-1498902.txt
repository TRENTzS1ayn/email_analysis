I think this is a very promising area, and could perhaps be generalized 
into a system that was given the URI of a word or document or a Literal 
(i.e. a node or small graph) and returned a graph containing related nodes.

Incidentally, Google are starting to play with blatant semantics 
alongside their latent semantic PageRank :
