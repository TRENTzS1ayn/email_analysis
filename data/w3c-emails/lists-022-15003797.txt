Good point. In my view the timestamp should be an external attribute to
the subtitle, that can for example be assigned by the transport or by
the application that is in charge of the play-back. Each subtitle may
have some internal attributes to define its temporal behavior, such as
duration and "scroll-time", but its presentation time should be assigned
by means external to the subtilte itself. 

Best regards,

Jan van der Meer

Absolutely - TT will hopefully be ideal for authoring, storage, QA and
pre-transmission manipulation.

Hmmm!

By subtitling I am referring to my admittedly narrow perspective of
subtitling and captioning of broadcast video. I have looked at SMIL and
Quicktime and cannot see how to reconcile the timing aspects of these
standards with the timecode in an external broadcast signal (where the
timecode may be discontinuous due to advert insertion). Comments please?
