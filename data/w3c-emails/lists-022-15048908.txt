Dear TT folks,

I feel that narration and transcription are two terms that should be
included in the TT discussions. Captions and subtitles clearly are part
of what needs to be specified, but also these two applications.

(not formal definition)
narration -- The text of a document (book) and the synchronization of
that text with an audio recording.
Example: Digital Talking Books www.daisy.org

transcription -- taking an audio and/or video segment and adding the
text that is synchronized with the audio and/or video.
Example: News broadcasts, testimony.


Best
George
