I am less than convinced - for a very big, or infinite ontology, this is a 
*necesary* practice (good or bad) since otherwise any use of the ontology 
requires a huge (possibly infinite) download.

I am currently working on an ontology for language tags, based on RFC 
3066bis, which is infinite - I was thinking of using a similar approach to 
the one above to give finite views of relevant parts of the ontology, so 
that any use could be achieved by downloading all the URLs constructed with 
language tags actually present in your data.

If all you want to know about is City then the City download is a good one, 
  if you want to know about more than that, maybe you need the full 
download (wherever that is).
