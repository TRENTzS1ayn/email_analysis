Hi,

I've been following the discussion here and I'd like to point out that
Timed text could also be used in SMIL documents, that if small (about 
1MB) don't have to be streamed. A one minute long Multimedia page, where 
all the media can be prefetch and then played is something I prefer.
Hesitations and hiccups in a presentation ruins the experience IMO.

Time text as a non-proprietary RealText replacement is what I hope comes 
out of this Working Group, a language that everybody can use. In fact 
the way things are heading with PC's merging with TV's, I can see SMIL 
content played on a little Web (home network) consisting of images in 
lossless tiff format, audio in lossless flac format, rich in color and 
sound. Right now what's missing is a open 'timeless', textual format 
that will match the other media formats in quality and longevity.


just my 2 cents,
Jose Ramirez
