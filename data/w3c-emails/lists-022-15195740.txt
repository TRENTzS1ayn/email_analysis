It would be an interesting choice to burden TT with a new format that's not
well-understood, doesn't have wide support in authoring tools, languages and
OS vendors, etc.  I know that I won't personally have any use for TT if it's
not XML-based, and in my experience most people will feel the same way.

The requirements of /the TT format/ for realtime-captured text are actually
much simpler and more straightforward than those for "authored" timed text
presentations.

A file format can't support realtime collaboration, but tools that use that
file format can.
