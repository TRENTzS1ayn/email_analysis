Well, Windows and Mac OS X support SMIL out of the box.  That's pretty
good.  RealNetworks is first with SMIL 2.0 support.  It's pretty popular
too.  And although you don't need an authoring tool to author SMIL,
there are many, many XML and SMIL authoring tools available.

I think you're confusing XML with some XML applications you may have seen.
 Can you elaborate?

Proposal 0.0 separates content from presentation.  Can you describe the
problem you're trying to solve so that I can show you how it might work?

Are you familiar with HTML?   :^)   Seriously, (1) this is basically a myth
(modems compress text content exceptionally well), (2) HTTP 1.1 supports
compression on top of that, and (3) since it's based on XML, standards
under way for XML compression will work with TT as well.
