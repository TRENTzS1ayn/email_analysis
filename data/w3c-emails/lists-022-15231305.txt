It's pretty trivial.  Let's say you want to show the word "foo" for 5
seconds, 10 seconds from the start of a commercial.  Still assuming
Proposal 0.0, it would look something like:

<seq>
   <tt:p begin="10s" dur="5s">foo</tt:p>
</seq>

If the commercial is played at 01:03:28.720 (we don't need to know this time
a priori), then the text appears at 01:03:38.720 and ends at 01:03:43.720.

Time is the /only/ thing that's of use, believe me.  You may believe that
God's Atomic Unit of Time is 1/29.97th of a second, but George Lucas' is
1/24th of a second, and someone encoding PAL source for the web might
consider it to be 1/12.5th of a second.

Right, and Proposal 0.0 does that to your satisfaction?
