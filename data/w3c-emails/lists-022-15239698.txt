Possibly :-)

Well - let's see - In XML, AFAIK, everything is under a single root. So in
proposal 0.0 you can only have one structure to the document, one hierarchy.
This means that in order to find and manipulate the document- you have to
search it from an end. I can believe that this restrictive structure might
bias the implementation of a flexible TT format - since it is based on an
assumption that the document is read from top towards the bottom....

There appears to be a view that TT is a linear format - but I see a need for
more random access.

e.g.

<program>
<langA>
<subtitle>
<\subtitle>
<subtitle>
<\subtitle>
<subtitle>
<\subtitle>
<\langA>
<langB>
<subtitle>
<\subtitle>
<subtitle>
<\subtitle>
<subtitle>
<\subtitle>
<\langB>
<\program>

It's not so much a specific problem - rather a feeling based on experience -
that suggests to me that if it is possible to separate the timing of
elements - in the same way that style is separated - then that will lead to
a better format.

Yes, it's obvious that a text based human readable format will compress well
for transmission - but it has to exist in an uncompressed format for
manipulation.... HTML uses <p> <\p> <\br> style tags, **most** XML I've seen
tends towards a much more verbose tagging.
