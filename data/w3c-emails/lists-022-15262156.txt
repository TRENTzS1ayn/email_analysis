Attached please find a rough stab at the scope of the "timed text problem", 
at least as I understand it (which is surely incomplete).

The first slide shows some author/capture on the left and some general 
decoder applications areas on the right.  Subsequent slides show the 
existing decoders in each of the application areas (the ones I know about, 
anyway).

I've added interface specifications in italics where I knew what they were, 
and "?" everywhere I either did not know, or is not defined.  Most of the 
"?" are opportunities for standardization by this group.

I think it would be helpful if we can fill this out completely.

After that, then what problem are we trying to solve, exactly?  It is 
highly unlikely that the decoder inputs deployed today will be 
replaced.  That is certainly true of television, and perhaps the others.

         Mike
