You can forget about SMIL, although I think that understanding what it is
a useful prerequisite for anyone who wants to contribute.

Unless I'm missing something, Proposal 0.0 works just the way you would like
-- subtitles in one file, video and audio in another.

In my previous post I described how this would work.  (Please let me know
if the explanation didn't make seise.)

I've explained a few times why time (rather than frame-based timecode)
must be used.  As two examples, the TT should still work when taking a
24fps film source to NTSC, or to the web via a QuickTime movie with a
default timebase of 600 units/second whose video content is encoded at
12fps.

I know you're not serious, but I don't get the joke.

Exactly, and that single format is time.
