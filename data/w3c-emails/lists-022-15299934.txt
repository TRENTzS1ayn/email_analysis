If exact sync with a frame of video is a requirement, then your clock will 
have to be much more precise than you may be thinking - has to do with how 
analog television timing works (it's not really 30/25Hz frame rates - there 
is an error of 1/1000).  That's one reason why "time" in television is 
actually {time, frame} (aka SMPTE 12M), where time is only to the second 
and frame is the frame within the second.  If you don't do this, then at 
some point you will indeed get off by one frame.  But if you relax the 
requirement to +/- 1 frame (way better than is done in practice by the time 
the viewer actually sees the text), then simple timelines work fine.  But 
on the otherhand, why not permit multiple timelines and avoid the 
argument?  In addition to SMPTE 12M, there is the new SMPTE ATR.
