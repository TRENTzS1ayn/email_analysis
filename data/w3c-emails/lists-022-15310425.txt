Hello Mike,

Good to hear you here as well. I like your picture and your question. 

>After that, then what problem are we trying to solve, exactly?

It is my understanding that the objective in the TTWG is to define an 
"authoring solution" that can be used as input to the specific formats for 
transport that you indicate in your pictures. In that sense, the TTWG 
outcome should be orthogonal to these specific formats. 

On the other hand it could be very useful to define certain profiles for 
the TTWG outcome, to ensure that "mapping" to certain specific formats is 
possible. For instance it may be possible to define one "simple profile" 
for mapping to the formats used in ATSC, DVB and DVD and a second 
"enhanced profile" for mapping to the 3GPP timed text format (which has 
richer functionality than the first three mentioned formats).

Best regards,

Jan van der Meer

        Classification: Unclassified



Attached please find a rough stab at the scope of the "timed text 
problem",
at least as I understand it (which is surely incomplete).

The first slide shows some author/capture on the left and some general
decoder applications areas on the right.  Subsequent slides show the
existing decoders in each of the application areas (the ones I know about,
anyway).

I've added interface specifications in italics where I knew what they 
were,
and "?" everywhere I either did not know, or is not defined.  Most of the
"?" are opportunities for standardization by this group.

I think it would be helpful if we can fill this out completely.

After that, then what problem are we trying to solve, exactly?  It is
highly unlikely that the decoder inputs deployed today will be
replaced.  That is certainly true of television, and perhaps the others.

Mike
