Right, so with this timing model things can be controlled to the
millisecond, so the text may start up to half of one millisecond from the
video or audio frame you're trying to sync it to if the system allows for
that sort of resolution.

I expect that many systems will not handle between-video-frame events, and
will put the text at the nearest frame.
