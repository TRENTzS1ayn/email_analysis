Remember who is our 'customers' here, the syntax should rather help 
them than us. In most cases I believe that the 'customer' will be 
engineers trying to build systems using RDF/RDFS/OWL, me being one of 
them. These people are usually already quite familiar with XML and 
possibly RDF, and it is actually easier using an RDF/XML syntax.

Cut and paste reasons was actually very useful in HTML.
