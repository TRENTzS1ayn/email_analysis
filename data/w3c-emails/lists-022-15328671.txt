Hello Jan-

Always a pleasure....

My personal view is that there are probably two distinct interchange points 
that could benefit from a standard by this group:

1. File exchange format (probably suitable for authoring and some distribution)
2. Streaming format (probably suitable for some distribution and maybe 
upstream capture)

It is not clear to me yet that these solutions can be merged into a single 
design, although there minimally has to be a mapping between them.

The latter could be pretty easily created as an abstraction of the union of 
functionality of all the existing capture and decoding systems listed in 
the pictures - starting with the comparison chart that was circulated by Glenn.

And, whether we have 1 or 2 designs, I suspect we may also need 
application-specific profiles as you suggest.  Although we need to be 
careful here as one of the requirements as I understand it is to be 
somewhat decoder-agnostic, certainly in the file exchange format.  That is, 
a single format should be targetable to DVD as well as Television and 
RTP.  So, the profiles may only apply to the streaming format?

Best regards,

         Mike
