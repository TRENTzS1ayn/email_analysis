I think we need to be careful to distinguish the time-layout of the 
text itself, from the temporal composition of that with other media. 
The question of aligning text events to time-code events in the video 
is a composition question, and not strictly related to text at all.

The definition of a time-line for the text can be independent of the 
question of how that time-line is aligned with others.

This may be obvious to others...
