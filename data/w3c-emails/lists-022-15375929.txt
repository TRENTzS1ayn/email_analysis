On the contrary.  Given a document with relative durations, inserting 
or deleting a segment is easy;  everything naturally moves up and 
down when you do that.  If the document uses absolute values, rather 
than relative, this is painful.

One of the simplest uses is a timed-text file with relative 
durations, displaying (for example) captions, layed into a SMIL 
presentation in 'par' with the video and in a separate region.  This 
ought to work...

I don't disagree that perhaps SMIL needs some concept of how to align 
time-codes in two 'par' media, but that is a composition question 
that ought to be addressed in SMIL.
