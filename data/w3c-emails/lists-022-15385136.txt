Jan is spot on.  My feeling is that we ought to be able to define 
something in w3c which represents a reasonably good set of 
functionality, which could be

a) made into a binary format inside mpeg-4, if they wanted to;
b) if profiled, made into the 3G format;
c) made into a streamed text format in RTP, if there were such;

I think we're all looking for an interchange syntax here from the w3c.
