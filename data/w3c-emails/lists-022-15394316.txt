One idea I just thought of that sounded possible was to use percentages
between scenes. A possible problem with this would be that all
players/encoders would need the same (or very similar) definition of a
scene change... or perhaps have it be a vague definition made more
specific by a setting in the TT stream/file. Another problem would be
that it could take a while for some applications to calculate the length
of a scene especially for streaming. And the possibility of a endless
stream would also need a solution.
