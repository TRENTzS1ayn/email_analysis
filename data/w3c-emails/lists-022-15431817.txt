Glenn,

I am very happy with that. In my view, TT is something like :

- a concatenation of text strings;
- each text string has a start and end time;
- each text string may have some dynamic behavior in time, such as 
scrolling, colour changes (Karaoke), etc.

So what I think is needed, is to express the above in XML, while using a 
notion of time that needs further discussion. 

Best regards,

Jan

Overruled. There is no "point of order" in this discussion context.

As I have previously said, the *primary* format defined by this group
*will* be an XML format. Others may be defined as well (or may not).

Discussion closed.
