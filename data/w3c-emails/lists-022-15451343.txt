It is possible to embed media using a "data URL".  Our SMIL 2.0
implementation handles these.  The format is (roughly):

    src="data:[mime type],[data represented as syntactically-valid URI]".

and is more precisely defined here: ftp://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2397.txt

Example:
  <ref dur="10s" region="r1" src="data:text/plain,This%20is%20some%20text."/>

I've seen this used for (small) images, RealText, and plain text, to
avoid the client-server overhead you mentioned.
