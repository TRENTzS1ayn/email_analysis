A new par-like construct could be designed where the second stream 
(TT) is locked to the first (video). The video can be stopped, 
started, rewound, played at variable speed, have ads inserted, etc. 
The corresponding parts of the TT stream are displayed in sync (cued 
in and cued out as required).

This could probably be seen as syntactic sugar for "pure" SMIL, but 
would be much more compact since all the triggering is implicit.
