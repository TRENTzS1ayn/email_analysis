I agree it's not the whole model - but if I'm to use TT for what **I** do
 - this is the functionality I need!

Yes, that's certainly a valid viewpoint - the problem is that broadcast
video is 'striped' 
with timecode - not Roman numerals etc :-)

Seriously - I think that what might be required for TT is a 'timesheet' that
allows 
the definition of triggers and 'real world' matches as you describe. These
real world matches
could be times, events or detected conditions etc. 

Consider the following possible use for timed text:

A washing machine display.
We wish to display on an LCD the progress of the wash cycle, 
and possibly instructions to the user (e.g. insert conditioner now).
We wish the display to cycle between time remaining and the current cycle 
(e.g. washing, spinning, rinsing etc)
We might also wish periodically to display the chosen program. (cottons,
delicates etc)
All of these text strings might need display for different durations.
Some of the text is variable (e.g. remaining time).
We want a multi-language capability where the user can select language.

I think TT should be able to handle this scenario as easily as
captioning/subtitling.
