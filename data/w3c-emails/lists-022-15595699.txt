and a timecode stream.  If we are talking about discontinuous 'tags' 
it is much better to talk about it as a timecode stream, in my 
opinion.

ah, it's more subtle.  He wants to be able to edit, not the whole 
layup, but just the a/v/timecode part, and then lay in the text 
stream, and still have it line up with the right timecodes.

I see 2 very much as a composition (temporal composition) requirement.
