Using a timecode stream is a solution. I think I am not yet at this 
level of specificity.
What is this discontinuity thing ? You just want to specifiy a list of 
segments to play, period.

Why is it different from an edit list (using the QT terminology) ? Or a 
list of segments to play (using the MPEG-4 OD terminology).

I fully agree, but it is a requirement at the movie level, not at the TT 
level. The same is true for audio and video. A solution for the 
audio/video thing can be applied to the AVT triplet.
