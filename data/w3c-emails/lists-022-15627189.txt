By request, a text description of the PDF slides posted to this list on 11-Feb:

There are 6 slides total that attempt to show the potential problem space 
for "timed text".

Slide 1 contains the overview of the system showing encoder inputs on the 
left side and decoder applications on the right side.  Between the two, and 
connecting everything to everything, is a "cloud" of the distribution 
between encoding and decoding.  There are two encoders: "authoring 
software" and "real-time capture" which feed into the distribution 
cloud.  The decoder applications that emerge from the cloud are: Internet, 
DVD, Digital Cinema, Television and Mobile.  Each of these is expanded in 
the following 5 slides.

Slide 2 expands on the decoder applications for the Internet.  It shows the 
Internet as 4 specific decoder technologies along with their encoding 
technologies (shown in parenthesis in the list that follows).  They are: 
Quicktime (Qtext), Real (RealText), Media9 (SAMI),  and Unknown (Time-Lined 
Static Media in RTP).

Slide 3 expands on the decoder applications for television.  It shows 
Television as 6 specific decoder technologies along with their encoding 
technologies (shown in parenthesis in the list that follows).  They are: 
NTSC (EIA-608), ATSC (EIT-708), PAL/SECAM (EBU), DVB (EN300-743), ARIB 
Analog (?), and ARIB Digital (?).

Slide 4 expands on the decoder applications for mobile and lists the only 
known one: Phones (3GPP).

Slide 5 expands on the decoder applications for digital cinema (DC) for the 
two know works in process. They are: SMPTE DC28 and BKSTS/SEKAM.  Both of 
these groups have work in process and no specific technology has been 
defined or deployed.

Slide 6 expands on the decoder applications for DVD, which includes only 
the worldwide standard for DVD text authoring, using DVD subpictures.

Regards,

         Mike

>I've added interface specifications in italics where I knew what they 
>were, and "?" everywhere I either did not know, or is not defined.  Most 
>of the "?" are opportunities for standardization by this group.

>I think it would be helpful if we can fill this out completely.

>After that, then what problem are we trying to solve, exactly?  It is 
>highly unlikely that the decoder inputs deployed today will be 
>replaced.  That is certainly true of television, and perhaps the others.
