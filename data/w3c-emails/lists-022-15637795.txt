Well, that appears to be what happens, but alas, is not.  What you'd 
like to know is "play from 0 to 10 minutes", "play from 12 to 15 
minutes", and so on.  What you actually get is a continuous program 
where those edits have already occurred.

Happily, the timecodes get edited with the video and audio; that's 
why I say that it is a stream.  If you look at the timecodes going 
by, you can work out what edits happened.  If there is a text tag 
with a time-code value of "13 minutes" as its trigger, that will play 
12 minutes in (minute 11 being missing).  If the trigger said "11 
minutes" then that text element will never display as that timecode 
was edited out.

agreed.  composition is a 'movie level' thingy.
