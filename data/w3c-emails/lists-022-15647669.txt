Dear John,

They are conceptually different: 1 is more a requirement of the 
specification of the content, and 2 is a specification of the player of 
that content. It is all about the same content, yes, but it feels like 
different levels to me.

I agree with the 'tunnel vision' ;-))

A few more elements may be required.

Just as the absolute time code seems horrible to us (PC people) because 
it seems like you have to change the timecodes everytime you play the movie.

OK, this means another requirement:
the TT stream maybe sent separately from the rest, even if it has to 
stay ABSOLUTELY synchronized, whatever editing is done on the rest of 
the movie
