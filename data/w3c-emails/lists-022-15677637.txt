If a timecode for the start of a movie is 10:00 as I saw in a previous 
email, I understand that as: this movie shall start at 10:00pm tonight.
If I want to play it at another time, I need to do some retiming.

Again, this is a specification (or a bug) of the player.
You can specify the player to play all frames whatever the cost in time 
slips, or specify that the player shall drop frames.

Whenever you have video lipsync with audio, even on PCs, the audio 
renderer clock will drive the whole system and video frames will get 
dropped if necessary.

Does this mean that the 10:00 does not refer to actual wall clock time ?

I do not understand this question, but I am not sure it is important.

Indeed but it is two different mechanisms.
In MPEG-4, the CTS and DTS of each access unit in each stream allow the 
system to keep the lipsync, while the starts and stops are dealt with at 
the level of the scene (MediaControl node).

Probably there are implementation differences ;-), but nothing 
conceptually different.

It is a lot easier to implement the management of a list of edits, 
because you can anticipate better than when you are just listening to 
timecodes and detecting a jump. The jump can be detected only quite 
"late", whereas the edit list can be sent a long time in advance.

This is a very strong requirement, and it means the edit list *has* to 
be sent with the movie, either as the time codes, or as a higher level 
list of segments (of the original, full movie) to play, the time codes 
being just a discrete way of representing the edit list.
