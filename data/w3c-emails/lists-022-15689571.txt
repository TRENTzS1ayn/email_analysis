No - this is not correct. Timecode on a movie (or indeed in a 
GOP of an MPEG file) is **not** the desired play time. 
Often **by convention**, movies are timecoded from 10 hours 
- that is every movie timecoding starts at 10:00. Adverts and 
other inserts are typically timecoded from a different start 
point eg. 1 hour. This helps broadcast engineers detect the 
material type **just** from the timecode (which is often
displayed on the front panel of broadcast 'tape' players).

The timecode doesn't even necessarily reflect the runtime 
of the movie. That is - even if the timecode on a movie video 
recording starts at 10:00, and the movie lasts for 1 hour 
the last timecode on the movie could be 13:00 as
there could be jumps in the timecode track. 
These jumps occur during the editing of a movie (or interuption of
its playback - e.g. newsflash / adverts).

Generally speaking however - after editing a Master Tape will be restriped
so that the timecode is continuous. Any jumps detected by
playout equipment are caused by playback interruptions - this
allows the use of timecoe as a reference to the frame within the master
tape.

The timecode is at best a unique reference to a frame of video 
within the movie.

That's right - timecode is a frame reference (but not a frame number)

Ahhh... but you **never** get the edit list. That's the problem.
In broadcasting there are many situations where equipment has to 
**follow** the video signal (and the timecode inside it) 
that it is 'sitting' on.

That's it - quite a good way of looking at it in fact - the timecode
is an edit list - but you only see it when the edit is upon you :-)
The timecode is there to allow you to detect an edit.
You will very rarely get broadcast video (inside the broadcast environment)
without timecode, but it is almost always stripped off prior to broadcast, 
since the part of the signal it lives in (VBI or [audio for LTC]) is often
re-used
for something else (Teletext, Closed Captions, or audio etc)

OK purists please note I know I've played fast and loose with frame and
field in here, 
not to mention ignoring frame rate issues etc.
