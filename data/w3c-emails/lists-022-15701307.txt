At its 02/13 teleconference, the TT WG resolved the following:

1. The TT WG will produce an authoring specification. The
specification will allow for transcoding and transformations to
streaming formats.

2. Any specification for a streaming format will be deferred to a
later time (if produced at all).

Regards,
Glenn
