As I read the resolution, it still requires that the authoring formats be 
translatable into the many streaming formats.  It is therefore my 
assumption that if there is a function in stream encoding X, then it is 
minimally a candidate for inclusion in the authoring format.  The authoring 
syntax and encoding may be entirely different of course, but the function 
has a right to be considered such that it is translatable.
