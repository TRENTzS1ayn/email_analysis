A proposal is being formulated regarding requirements on semantic markup as
well as other metadata, such as scene changes. The TT WG will be discussing this
at its face to face meeting next week and, hopefully, will have a draft of
a requirements documnent will be available for public review shortly thereafter.
 
If you have any specific requirements you would like to propose, feel free to
do so to this reflector.
 
Regards,
Glenn

Subject: Logical notations in TT



Along with whatever display attributes are included in TT, will there be a pre-defined (or extensible) set of ancillary information that can be included with items of text.  Item #16 talks about speaker identification via the IDREF attribute.  Would it be appropriate to include other information in TT as well (for example, scene changes could be useful for organizing blocks of subtitling/captioning) -- or would this information be better stored in a separate file linked via the timecodes?
