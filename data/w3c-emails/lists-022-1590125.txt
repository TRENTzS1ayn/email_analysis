Ahhh - the root of a lot of our disagreements becomes clear -- in my 
world view, reasoners are not likley to be a major force on the Sem 
Web, and those that are are not likely to last very long if they 
cannot handle inconsistency -- I won't make the argument here, I've 
done it lots of times in many other forums and in print (see my talk 
at ISWC last year [1] for one example) -- thus, I think that the 
claim "being able to prove anything at all" is clearly just plain 
ridiculous for any tool that has any chance of working on the Web. 
So in that light, I have no objection to consistent stuff, I just 
don't see it as the single most important thing to always worry 
about...   but notice Mike, we' ve just turned this into a trade-off 
discussion - so where you said we sometimes have to take sides, I 
just basically think this is harder than you think....

I doubt I could agree to this - I have no idea what "all other things 
being equal" means in a dynamic changing system like the Web.

In case anyone hasn't figured it out by now - I THINK IT SHOULD BE 
OUT OF SCOPE FOR THIS TASK FORCE TO WRITE ONTOLOGY ENGINEERING 
DOCUMENTS HAT ARE NOT RELATED TO THE SEMANTIC WEB as part of this 
Working Group.  If you'd like me to state it clearer, let me know 
what to addd

Yes, but it wouldn't be a SEMANTIC WEB langauge, and thus I would 
argue (see above) this WG should not spend time discussing it

They ARE central to the design of OWL, in the sense that OWL is 
specifically FOR the Web, and thus had to have a few things that 
typical KR/O languages lack.

Yes, and strangely, this makes them SIGNIFICANTLY new and different, 
and this WG, being part of the W3C SEMANTIC WEB activity should 
primarily be concerned with the new aspects.  For all the other 
stuff, we can point them at entire books full of decriptions of best 
practices, and I don't see why we would waste our time as a Working 
Group replicating 50 years of AI work
