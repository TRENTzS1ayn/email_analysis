Normally I like to lurk on new lists, but since nobody's chimed in yet (why,
it's been over three hours!)...   :^)

I know that QuickTime supports this.

My main experience with this is related to EventStream, an XML-based
language we created for Cleaner 5 that allows content authors to define
timed text, buttons, timed URL triggers, etc. in a format-agnostic fashion.

EventStream text was encoded very differently depending on the destination
format (QuickTime, RealSystem, Windows Media), and streamed very differently
as well depending on the format and the protocol (HTTP, RTSP, MMS) used.

I guess what I'm asking is, does this group need to define how TT is
streamed using all potential standards-based and proprietary protocols and
distribution formats?  That would be a challenge (he said understatedly),
and doesn't intuitively strike me as the place that a TT standard adds
value.
