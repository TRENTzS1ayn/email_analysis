Thanks for confirming.

I think you must mean RTP, not RTSP, correct? Since RTSP is just
a command/control protocol.

Of course we can't define all possible distribution formats;
however, our charter does explicitly charge us to "develop an XML
based format used for the representation of streamable text
synchronized with some other timed media". So we need to address
this at some level. It may be that we simply indicate, by example,
how "one may stream" the format, without actually specifying the
streaming format itself. But, in designing the representation, this
has obvious implications on how information is organized. For example
this would preclude us from designing in some constraint that
requires parsing the entire content of the stream in order to
effectively interpret and use some well-defined portion of the
stream (call this an "access unit").
