In which way do you think that having to wait for an empty line to come to erase 
the text is easier and safer? I would tend to think that those two lines might 
be split into two AUs, and that if for some reason the second one were dropped 
(which isn't all that unlikely in a number of streaming transports, especially 
unidirectional ones) the text might linger there forever (well, until another 
line comes which could be immediately or in a long time).

I would see no reason not to be able to support both duration and overwrite 
approaches though, it should be simple enough.
