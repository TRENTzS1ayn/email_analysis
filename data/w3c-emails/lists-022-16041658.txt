Good questions, which I can't answer yet, though I'm sure the
WG will come to an eventual conclusion.
 
I do have some doubts about whether we should try to support
XDS or other "data tunneling" mechanisms that are found in 
608/708, since, strictly speaking, these are unrelated to
our charter.

I guess where this is going is should TT files include the ability to address multiple types of consumers in a single/file stream; or would it be better from a design, implementation and consumption standpoint to limit each TT file/stream to a single type of consumer; or to support heterogenous types of consumers in a single TT file/stream?
