Not by the client when it's streamed, since you have no idea what the rest
of the file looks like.  The server can enforce well-formedness, though,
and anybody using TT for the wire format as well can either send TT
before streaming content (this is similar to a common technique for
QuickTime) or stream well-formed TT chunks in realtime as necessary.

This strikes me as a near-perfect summary.  Another way to put it might
be to say that TT is a streamable file format rather than a streaming file
format, since it's going to enable /so much more/ than just sending the TT
file format down the wire.

I assume that contributors should be very familiar with current methods in
order to better steal their best aspects.  Here's what we've got so far:
