Actually, I can imagine a number of ways to handle this and still
satisfy XML well-formedness rules. Here are some ideas:

1. Each "access unit" could be a complete XML document. In this
case, WFC and VC could be checked on each access unit.

2. An unbounded sequence of access units could be construed as an
external entity, where each access unit constitutes an entire
top-level element. [External entities can have multiple top-level
elements.] An XML document template that implicitly references
that external entity could be implied in the client, e.g., (making
up some temporary vocabulary):

<tt:stream-wrapper xmlns:tt="...">
&stream;
</tt:stream-wrapper>

where one would effectively have:

<!ENTITY stream "
<tt:access-unit>...</tt:access-unit>
<tt:access-unit>...</tt:access-unit>
<tt:access-unit>...</tt:access-unit>
...
">

In this case, WFC and VC are, by definition, satisfied on the
implied wrapper, and WFC and VC could be checked on each
access-unit independently over time as they arrive.

Comments?
