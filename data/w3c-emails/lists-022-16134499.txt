I think what I am hoping will come out of this is a flexible file format 
covering possible timed [text] events across all realisable media formats.

The implementation (ie translation) from that format to proprietary formats 
can be done using XSL as I am doing now. So we just need the most flexible 
XML format possible to be defined, one which can be extended for future 
unforseen developments. Let the stylesheets handle conversion.

Practically, I wonder if this talk of streaming implies an eventual 
*requirement* for an event based parser rather than a DOM solution for 
specific schema translations? [Thinking about it event based would seem to 
be an obvious direction LOL].

Cheers,
Neil Smith.
