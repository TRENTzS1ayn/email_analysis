Aye, me too.

Same here.

This is where XSL comes in of course - a generic format supporting 
translation of essential and optional characteristics of a text stream is 
exactly where the TT group will be heading. I guess they are at the stage 
now of RFC from the captioning community.

Fonts are going to be an optional component I guess, but CSS is definitely 
the way to express these characteristics - CSS3 has aural stylesheet 
support for example, extending 'styles' well beyond what can be rendered 
visually.

Its important to separate content from presentation (as always :-) and so 
if a generic  XML description of streamed text is accomplished, we can 
convert that to any acceptable text format for a variety of output devices.

For example, I have developed an internal XML format which I parse using 
PHP and / or XSL depending on whether the client or server is doing the 
work.The output is translated easily to QTText, SAMI, Realtext and 
accompanying SMIL files (in addition, transcripts, WAP and other formats 
are possible and planned).

Equally, I will be able to use XSL to convert any agreed standard to the 
internal representation used by my scripts without fuss. Its just important 
to get all the possible attributes of a text stream represented some way.

I think a generic standard containing the essential and optional components 
of a presentation should be mandated.

For example - QTText needs to know the length of a presentation for the 
final time tag [this is not a requirement for SAMI and RT]. So, this should 
be included as an optional component of a prerecorded presentation - but 
how to determine this for an open-ended, live presentation ?

SAMI likes its output formatting as CSS, whereas RT likes font size & color 
tags. Quicktime of course is a law unto itself - and as you say some output 
formats have no concept of fonts, but the information should be optionally 
available. The possibility to indicate various formatting styles should be 
possible per line of captions - emphasis, alignment / positioning, even 
colour may have their place.

We may create a presentation which has banner descriptors for subsections 
(I think Apple calls this a chapter track). This would be a useful 
addition, and can be inserted at the start of a 'scene' if the dialogue is 
otherwise sparse. Sounds optional to me, but a useful consideration.

Anyway its late here - will catch more tomorrow (this discussion seems to 
have taken off :-)
