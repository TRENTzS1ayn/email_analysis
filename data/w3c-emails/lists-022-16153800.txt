Hi Glenn - I don't have the URL to hand, but realtext can be streamed 
(though only through RTP, not from HTTP afaik) : RealText has 
<required>...</required> tags

Tealtext manual : "Use these tags to enclose text that must be delivered to 
RealPlayer under any circumstance. During extremely adverse network 
conditions, RealSystem will halt the presentation if necessary rather than 
drop the text."

In practice, the bandwidth for streamed text is so low this would never 
realistically happen from a Helix / Realserver box. But these systems 
*definitely* stream the text too, whereas HTTP I guess will deliver the 
whole file verbatim - I don't have a big enough example to time it :-)

Not too sure about SAMI though - it seems to be a bolt-on, and is handled 
by the player rather than the server afaik (ie, using a ?SAMI=url or by 
adding to the media directory). Maybe I'll sniff my server logs and see 
what the timing of requests is.

Cheersn
Neil Smith.
