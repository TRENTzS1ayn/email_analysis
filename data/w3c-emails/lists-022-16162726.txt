Hi -

I do wonder about this : The DOM model used in IE allows some ability to 
begin parsing the XML before the entire file has downloaded (by watching 
the readyState of the document being parsed). I am not sure how far this 
goes in terms of being useful.

But from what you say below, it kind of implies that only an event-driven 
non-validating parser (SAX or whatever) will be able to *begin* reading a 
streamed XML format (by assuming the root tag will be closed).

So, I am guessing that the native XML format may not be streamed as-is but 
will be pre-processed into a final client format by some form of media 
server. Thoughts ?
