Yes, this is certainly a possibility. However, I wonder if these
capabilities have indeed been implemented in any small footprint
devices yet. I have heard from some sources that "SVG Tiny is not
nearly tiny enough", and the reason the tend to give is the inclusion
of the basic font module.

One potential issue with the SVG font format is its apparent
lack of support for bitmap as opposed to outline glyph representations.
I would like to have seen a mechanism in SVG fonts that would support
the use of a "data:..." URI in which one may embed a bitmap directly.
Perhaps there is such support and I simply haven't discovered it.

Of course I realize very well the lack of device interoperatibility
entailed by sole reliance upon the use of prerasterized glyph images;
however, this is still a common mechanism used in a number of regions,
such as in East Asia.
