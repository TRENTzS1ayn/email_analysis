I actually personally favour a duration based approach, however as I
alluded in my previous mail, an overwriting approach has some advantages if
you need to erase something before it's programmed expiration. A duration
based approach has the obvious characteristic of passing the timing
responsibility to the decoder. Teletext subtitling uses a combination of
combining and overwriting to achieve certain effects (Snake and Add on). DVB
also uses an overwriting approach. For Teletext it is reasonable to use
'push' techniques - as to require the TV decoder to time subtitles would be
an overcomplicated solution. However this is an pre-existing emission
context - and I can see how translation from TT to Teletext emission would
be feasible. For DVB the justification for overwriting is less clear.

For TT in general I would favour a duration based approach - since
it fits better with a 'self contained access unit' philosophy - yet in a
streamed context the ability to instantly erase would be desirable.
