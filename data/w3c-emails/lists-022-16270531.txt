Teletext magazine transmissions consist of timed text where
different text instances are repeated at intevals (page refresh). In
addition other features such as clock and fasttext require periodic
transmission much the same as V-Chip ratings. TT might be a useful format
for the definition and exchange of Teletext magazine content.

I'm not sure quite what you mean by data tunneling - V-chip ratings
are IMHO not data, they are short hand for text that is periodically
displayed (at user request). The same argument can be extended to Teletext
clock - its timed text in some senses - being periodically transmitted, but
it differs from V-chip ratings by having a changing value. Why should TT be
limited to non repeating (from a display perspective) text. In short - I
would support the inclusion of repeated periodic transmission of static text
elements in TT. It would be a pity if such a mechanism could not include an
ability to send non static text too (e.g. clocks etc). This is where I see
TT and HTML radically differ - HTML is static (with add ons to make it
dynamic) TT is dynamic (at least from the user perspective).
