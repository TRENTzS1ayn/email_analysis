Both On-air and Off-air timings would have the characteristic of being
**both** expressed as relative timings to previous and next 'presentation
units' (see later comment!) - this would be necessary if bi-directional
playout was required in the authoring context. Alternatively, both On-air
and Off-air timings could be expressed as absolute timings (i.e. wrt another
timebase within or external to the 'stream'. I see this as an attribute of
the timing for a presentation unit (absolute or relative timing). The
off-air timing could be optional - in which case the 'presentation unit'
remains until replaced. There is I feel a need to support multiple
compositions of 'presentation units' - since a TT display might consist of
several 'regions' (and I don't intend to imply location here) of text that
might be independently derived from the screen - some of which are using
over-writing and some are self timed etc. Sorry if this is a bit vague.....

I am not aware of any use of DTS within DVB subtitling.

So in effect an 'Access Unit' is a coded 'Presentation unit'. In my previous
paragraph - my intended meaning would perhaps be clearer if I had used the
term 'presentation unit'?
