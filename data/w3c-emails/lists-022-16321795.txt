Uh, yes. We would not have got out of Candidate recommendation
otherwise. So, there are implementations from BitFlash and from Zoomon
and from KDDI (three or four different implementations!) and from
Nokia and from CSIRO; and from members of the public, too. All of
these implement SVG Fonts.

Plus of course the SVG Basic implementations from CSIRO and Intesis
and Bitflash.

Well, we went over all that in the SVG WG and the basic font modukle
ended up being retained. However, we restricted the content such that
fonts had to be provided along with the conten not referenc ed in a
separate file. This helps streaming, minimiuses caching requirements

That is a strength, not a feature. How are you going to cope with a
range of display sizes and resolutions with a bitmap font?

You can use data URIs but you cannot embed bitmaps into the font. This
was discussed, evaluated and found not to be a good solution.

Because its the only way to get a complete glyph coverage into a small
memory footprint - small and ugly fonts at a single resolution. The
solution is to not require the device to store a complete Unicode
coverage; the set of glyphs needed for the content is sent, rendered,
and thrown away.
