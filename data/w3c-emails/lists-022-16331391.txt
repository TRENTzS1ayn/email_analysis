I agree that if there is support for path drawing, then it is easy.
However, I think we are far from assuming that TT will mandate
support for path drawing. It is in this context that I am thinking
that support for an outline rasterizer may be construed as be
a significant burden.

We shall have to see whether or not we end up with support for
svg:path or not. It may be that even support for SVG's Basic Shapes
is too much to require on some devices.

We may need to handle this through a profiling process.
