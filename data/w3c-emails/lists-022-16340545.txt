Obviously, if some author used embedded bitmaps, then it is clearly
sub-optimal for device interoperability. On the other hand in some
contexts, it might be that the author or perhaps the delivery system
knows precisely what the required display sizes and resolutions that
are required.

On the other hand, clearly it would be a mistake, and I would
never advocate sole reliance on use of bitmap representations; I just
want to be certain that we meet the needs of common authoring and
delivery systems, where there are many more uses made of bitmap glyph
downloads than outlines at this time.

One possible way this might be used is as follows:

1. authoring and distribution system specify outlines inline;

2. emission system that knows device capabilities pre-rasterizes,
changing outlines to bitmaps;

If we fail to define a way to embed bitmaps, then in this scenario,
the emission system would be forced to use a different content format
or to extend it in a potentially non-interoperable way.

I would like to see us be able to support this scenario without
requiring a different content format or a non-standard extension.
