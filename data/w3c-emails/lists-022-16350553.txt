This ties directly into whether TT is an autoring format, a delivery
format, or both; and also, whether the model is that
many device-specific versions are generated/authored or one portable
one.

True. Then again, there is lots more use of proprietary binary formats
than XML, too, in that area. So change is possible, one hopes.

Yes, that is certainly possible.

Yes.

I can certainly understand that.
