In the TT Use Case and Requirements document I didn't see anything about
ANNOTATING timed text.

While it could be imagined that a text stream and an associated annotation
stream would be separate but synchronized, for annotation there would be
benefits from linking annotation items more explicitly to the items they
reference. Annotations could be for group access, or individualized for
personal access.

Possibly there is a general XML/Web pattern for supporting annotations, but
there may need to be some hooks in TT to facilitate it.

Has there been any consideration of dealing with TT annotations?
