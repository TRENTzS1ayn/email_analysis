Consider the use of digital video (including audio) for research and
education. A video is observed and interpreted from a particular
perspective, and a Timed Text record made of the interpretation. The record
could be a complex structure, akin to descriptive captioning, with
transcriptions of dialog, descriptions of movement and events, etc. This
would be displayed in a browser or media viewer panel synchronized with the
video. For research, review comments about the interpretation would annotate
the record and be presented in the timed display. For Education,
supplementary hints about how to view the scenes and pick out the referenced
aspects, or even instructor notes, would annotate the record and optionally
be presented in the timed display. Of course the record and annotations
could also be viewed in a non-timed manner. To emphasize the video aspects
associated with the timed text, an overlay of tracking highlights could mark
video objects and be keyed (e.g., by color) to the text.

Another example would be for an animated storyboard or movie, with the
screenplay presented in timed text (although there may not be a screenplay
DTD/schema yet). Annotations would pertain to hints or comments for all the
different production roles, or for cinema studies.

From a human factors perspective, having labels and descriptions closer and
more directly associated with the video objects would be best. Possibly the
timed text dialog should be displayable in a talk-balloon that moves with
the speaker. Is that within the scope of ways timed text can be presented,
or is it moving into animation?
