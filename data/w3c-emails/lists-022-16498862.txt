Hi,

Is there any work on providing a Core set of features that can be 
implemented by a couple of SMIL players, that can make it to a 
Recommendation status? Going though all this work to end up with
a W3C note, I don't think will solve the problem of supplying a standard 
Timed Text format.

Maybe there's a plan there at the W3C where Timed Text is interim format 
and the standard multimedia document is SVG+SMIL+SomethingElse but I 
think simple recommendations that can be fully implemented will keep
the Web from becoming Flash based.

Good Luck,
Jose Ramirez
