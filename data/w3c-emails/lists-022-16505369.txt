It seems that "annotation" and "meta-data" have quite a conceptual overlap,
but are not the same in current usage.

Annotations are included in XML Schema as full elements. TT Requirements
include meta-data elements that could be used for annotation, but it seems
that some annotations might not fit that model, for example, if an
annotation didn't reference a single element, but needed to say "element 1
doesn't agree with element 7". That could be shifted to an "external" form
of annotation document that just points to the multiple TT document contents
elements, but given that there wouldn't be reverse pointers, would it be
possible to display that external annotation material simultaneously in a
timed manner? If there was some sort of dynamic formation of a combined
document for timed display, wouldn't the structure need to support
distinctions between content and annotation anyway?

I note that MPEG-7 is mentioned in an editorial comment in TT Requirements.
Doesn't MPEG-7 do much of what Timed Text will do? It seems to address
annotation also. Possibly there should be more connection between the two.
