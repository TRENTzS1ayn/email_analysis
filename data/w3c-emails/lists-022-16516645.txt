I guess I don't see why the meta-data structure shouldn't be able to 
say things about multiple elements either, so I'm not sure I'm seeing 
the semantic distinction still.  Can you say more?  I'm probably 
being dense.

I think the purpose and function of MPEG-7 was intended to be very 
different from timed text, though I do not doubt that there is 
overlap -- and that, for example, an mpeg-7 timed meta-data document 
which contains caption information might be convertable into a 
timed-text document and styled for display.  But the functions are 
quite different.
