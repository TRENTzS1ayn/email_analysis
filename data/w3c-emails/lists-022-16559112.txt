The purpose of the phrase vocabulary item indicated in TT AF 1.0 Requirement R209 is to satisfy the types of usage you have listed below. So I think we are already covered here.

Luke, Glenn, et al 

Actually this may be an important issue. 
It may be desirable to allow inline markup within a TT document that marks sections of the text for specific purposes. I have in mind the XLIFF <mrk> element.

The specification for XLIFF can be found at: 
http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xliff/documents/xliff-specification.htm 

The mrk element has an mtype attribute 

<mrk mtype/> 

where the recommended values for the mtype attribute are as follow 

(this list is not exhaustive ? and reference should be made to the XLIFF specification): 
- abbrev = abbreviation, acronym, etc. 
- datetime = date or time information. 
- name = proper or common name. 
- phrase = sub-sentence level. 
- protected = text that should remain untouched during the process. 
- term = one or more words of a terminology entry. 

Some examples of a text element using mrk markup are shown below: 
<text id="T2" class="Charlie">Afternoon, <mrk mtype="abbrev">Dr</mrk>. <mrk mtype="name">Sparrow</mrk>.</text> 
<text id="T27" class="Sir Lancelot">I don't want <mrk mtype="protected" xml:lang="en-us">garbage</mrk> on my car.</text>

The first example illustrates the use of the mrk element to identify an abbreviation and a proper name that would probably require special processing by a machine translation system. In the second example the mrk element protects the word 'garbage' from machine translation ? thus this word should remain as 'American English' regardless of any translation of the remainder of the surrounding text.

Is there any reason why TT format would prohibit or prevent the use of such markup?
