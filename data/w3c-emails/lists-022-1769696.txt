Task Force Coordinators, please consider using W3C teleconference
resources to help move your task force work forward.  As the WG meets
biweekly, one easy option would be to pick the intermediate Thursday
for your task force teleconferences.

I will be happy to help make the reservations for the teleconference
bridge, or you may request the teleconference reservations yourself;
see the instructions in [1].

[1] http://www.w3.org/Guide/1998/08/TeleconferenceHowTo.htm

When making a task force telecon reservation, I suggest that
the reservation request include the task force keyword so that
the teleconference calendar [2] will display this information; e.g.
as "SW_BPD(OEP)".

You may request the usual WG teleconference code, SWBP (7927)
though other conference codes will need to be chosen if two or
more task forces want to meet simultaneously

-Ralph
