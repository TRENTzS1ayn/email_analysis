Good question(s).  The most recent pertinent message I see from Aldo
is [2], dated 1 April.  Aldo, is there a more up-to-date version of the WordNet
Task Force using the template in [3]?

[2] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swbp-wg/2004Apr/0017.html
[3] http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swbp-wg/2004JanMar/0208.html

I will be happy to put Task Force descriptions into revisable documents
in the WG URI space if the content exists in the mail archive.
