Actually, no need to apologize: this list is exactly the place to send 
public comments.

Or OWL Full for that matter. However, this is an interesting point, and 
perhaps adding this possibility as one of the bullet points for 
approaches 2 and 3 would make sense. I'll do that for the next version 
and see what other say.

You have a point there, and others have raised similar issues [1], [2]. 
I am not sure (1) is a feasible option though -- see my reply to Brian 
today. On (2) indeed translations between patterns would be helpful. 
Short of providing the translation tools themselves what type of 
information should we provide in the note to enable  tool developers to 
write conversions?
