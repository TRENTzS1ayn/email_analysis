Indeed -- I tried to add it to the new draft. I think it is important 
to identify these two cases, but at the same time I don't think they 
affect most of these approaches all that much. Approach 2 clearly is 
problematic if you are dealing with Case 1, but others don't seem to 
alter the "natural" semantics. I don't think the issue of whether the 
hierarchy is classified or not per se belongs in this note. It is a 
separate usage issue, the one where you have a great point to make and 
I hope will put it into another document from the WG that this one can 
cross-reference. I am a big believer to address only the specific issue 
at stake in these types of documents and to give the reader pointers 
for all the other issues it touches upon.

Or do you think this more detailed discussion really belongs in this 
note (and not another one)?

Thanks,

Natasha
