It can be expressed in SWRL (Patel-Schneider and Horrocks, WWW2004).
But if you don't want to commit to any particular representation (since
that game is not over yet...), then you might choose to stay with a
plain old FOL formula :) BTW, it seems like Approach 3 could also use
some rule to keep the two hierarchies consistent. (However, this rule
cannot be defined without committing to a particular parentSubject
property and then better left to the user...)

Let me just brainstorm aloud and correct me later if my logic goes
astray somewhere.

We have five ontologies, which potentially means 4*5/2=10 mappings to
do... Alternatively, we could map all of them to a selected approach (to
the _least_ expressive one?) or to a foundational ontology that captures
concepts on a higher level than the individual ontologies themselves. 

Aldo and I have used the foundational approach in the past, but it
carries a lot of commitment, so now let's just look if it's possible to
find internal mappings. For the sake of argument, I'll try to map
Approach 2-5 to Approach 1. (Simply by looking at the number of boxes,
Approach 1 seems to be the least expressive, which holds the promise
that we can project the other ontologies onto this one.)

Note: I'll have to index the dc:subject property with the number of the
approach, since it is simply not possible that all approaches are
talking about the same dc:subject property... For one, they do range on
very different things.

Note also that I don't introduce any type restrictions; I guess this
document would not want to mandate the use of, for example, a certain
Subject concept as a top level class of all subjects.

Mappings:

Approach 2 -> 1:

(x, dc:subject_2, y) AND (y, rdf:type, z) -> (x, dc:subject_1, z)

Approach 3 -> 1:

(x, dc:subject_3, y) AND (y, rdfs:seeAlso, z) -> (x, dc:subject_1, z)

Approach 4 -> 1:

Seems to be the same as 2 -> 1, but again a different use of dc:subject
(one that ranges on Lions and not Subjects. (Without foundations, we
will never resolve this distinction, however.)

Approach 5 -> 1:

Same as Approach 1, except that dc:subject_5 is an annotation property,
which puts limitations on it when looked at it as OWL DL.

In summary: such mappings are possible, at least for translating the OWL
DL approaches to the simplest OWL Full version. The translation is not
expressible in OWL Full, however. Also, there is a need to distinguish
the five separate uses of dc:subject, which might actually be the
solution for the question of how a machine could tell the different
approaches apart.

The other direction of translation (not presented here) seems also
feasible, even if with some existential quantifications.

Best,

Peter
