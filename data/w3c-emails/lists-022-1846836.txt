To help move things forward with the wordnet activity, I've taken a first
pass at translating Guus' note into RDF/XML.  So far, all I've done is the
RDFS stuff, OWL to follow.  There are some changes from Guus' note, most/all
of which are marked as an issue or with an @@.

I've also taken the liberty of starting of a strawman note that includes an
overview diagram of the ontology.

The files are in the attached zip.
