Hi all,

I am coming out of the data loss I have suffered two weeks ago ... 
here is the WNET TF description:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2004Jun/0010.html

For those involved in the TF (or anyone else interested), please give 
comments. We could consider extending it with all the contributions 
so far, or keeping it minimal, and linking to evolving drafts. This 
version is minimal, but also contains links to the parties contacted 
until now.

Cheers
Aldo
