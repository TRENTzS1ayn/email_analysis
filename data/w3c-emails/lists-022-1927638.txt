Hi all,

Can someone help me with description of a simple database schema to OWL?
What is the best way to describe it??

Imagine that we have these simple database: (P.S.:assume # to represent PK
and & to FK)

Students (#id,name,&courseId)
Course(#id,name,&deptId)
Department(#id,name,&deptId)

Thanks a lot!
