Thanks for your question, Daniela. In the WonderWeb project
http://wonderweb.semanticweb.org we have built a use case to show
good translation practices from db (conceptual or logical) schemas to
ontologies (also with help of automatic tools). We should put an
online report asap about that. See below for an example.
