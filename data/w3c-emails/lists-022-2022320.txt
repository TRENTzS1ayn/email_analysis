Hi Bernard, interesting case of overcommitment ...

I don't see the need for these metaclasses. A class can be the domain 
or range of a relation without any postulated metaclass needed. We 
can say that Country is a subclassOf Geographical Unit.
For example (in OWL abstract syntax):

Class(Country partial
  GeographicalUnit)
Class(Region partial
  GeographicalUnit
  (restriction(subdivisionOf someValuesFrom Country)))
Class(City partial
  GeographicalUnit
  (restriction(subdivisionOf someValuesFrom Region)))

therefore ...

I use "geographic part" relations, like your "subdivisionOf" for part 
applied to political or functional geographic objects. My rationale 
is that political mereology has different characteristics from 
physical mereology, like part when applied to rocks.
Then, the relationship between Strasbourg and Alsace is simply an 
instance of the "subdivisionOf" relation.

See above

If you refer to partial orders, you should decide on which relation 
creates that order, and then you can start evaluating morphisms 
between different orders. But I don't think your example needs that .
Conformity in your example applies between individuals (Strasbourg, 
etc.), and classes (City, etc.), in the sense that asserting triples 
on individuals should not violate the restrictions given on the 
classes.

Why not? this is the standard way to do it. The problem (if any) is 
about *your* intended meaning of part or subdivision: what 
individuals are in the universe of those relations? are those 
relations transitive?, etc.

Have a good time
Aldo
