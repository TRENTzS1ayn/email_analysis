I've been through that path. It assumes that the generic hierarchy (between classes) can
be defined by restrictions put on the hierarchy used at instance level. So there is no
point in wanting to express this generic hierarchy by a direct relation using classes as
individuals.

OTOH, in some contexts, modeling habits have led to different vocabularies for the generic
hierarchy and instance hierarchy. For example, in documentation management, documentalists
can be constrained to map their folder hierarchy on a so-called "taxonomy" (hierarchy of
"headings" or "categories"). And it's not obvious to port the above type of modeling in
this domain:

- A Folder is an instance of a generic Category, itself a subclass of Folder
- The Category hierarchy is defined by restrictions on the Folder-SubFolder relation ...

... This is technically correct, but quite difficult (not to say almost impossible) to
explain to documentalists, very unfamiliar with the class-instance paradigm, let alone
property restrictions :(
There again, do we want to push what we consider is "right" modeling, or represent at best
the legacy?

Agreed, but the distinction between administrative vs geographical mereology is an
orthogonal issue.

Exactly. It's all about morphisms. Not necessarily restricted to partial orders, though.
It can be extended to any generic pattern or organization scheme using different relation
types, like e.g. a publication schema organizing its different parts (Introduction, (
Chapter, Paragraph* )*, Table of Contents, Bibliography ...) using both "subdivision" and
"succession" relations.

Standard, indeed, but a bit awkward if you have a lot of classes, like in the above
example of Folders and Categories (which is actually the original use case I was
struggling with).

Browsing literature about mereology, it seems that it often confuse, like NL does, generic
relations like "Region is part of Country" or "Head is part of Body" and specific ones
like "Alsace is part of France" or "My head is part of my body". Not sure of what the
individuals are in the generic example ... seems to me they assert relation between
concepts, not unlike a "Broader-Narrower" in a thesaurus, rather than implicit
restrictions on instances of implicit classes.
There again, we are close to the "classes as values" issue ...
