Hi all,

Sorry I've been out of touch for a short while - been head down buried in
some project deliverables.  

Am still considering exactly what sort of note would be the best place to
start for this TF.  I was thinking a publication of an RDF schema for
standard thesauri, with an accompanying vocab spec?  

This could be a republication of the SKOS-Core schema [1] with perhaps a few
minor changes (some interesting issues have come up in recent work with
thesaurus developers).  The spec I was imagining as similar to the SKOS-Core
guide [2], but a slightly more formal description of the schema.

Just want to get a feel from you - if this is the right thing to aim for.

Interesting thing for me right now is how to set the SKOS schemas up so they
can continue to be developed and evolve in the most painless way possible,
as interest in them is growing and people are starting to deploy.  Managing
change in these schemas is a major issue ... the status schema [3] used with
FOAF is a kind of start here, but doesn't go anywhere near far enough I
reckon.

Surely recommendations and support for change management in RDF schemas is
major fodder for this WG?  Anybody thought about doing something in this
area?

Also FYI ... published in final draft form are the SKOS-Core Migration
Guidelines:

Yours,

Alistair.
