I meant 2), the common "Working draft" notion. We not have to agree with 
the content, but the WG should feel that publication serves a purpose to 
its "user community", i.e. semantic-web developers.

Well, I first thought this was new process, but one could also see it as 
an ambiguity/inconsistency in the Process document as the definition of 
WG Note seems in line with what I suggest.

I propose that Ralph and I send a message about this interpretation to 
the process-issues list of the AC.

Yes, that is my expectation. I see no reason why not.

Well, consensus means something different in rec-track work than in 
best-practices. A rec is normative, so it is easier to find point one 
cannot live with. We typically will provide documents will guidelines, 
including alternatives approaches, and so on. So, I expect it will be 
easier for people to "live with" (an important concept in W3C process) 
text that you yourself not agree with.

A practical example can be imagined for the "classes-as-values" note. 
Somewhat might vehemently disagree with the solution that requires 
stepping outside OWL DL, because s/he thinks OWL Full is crap. Still, 
given the alternatives in the same note the person might well agree with 
publication of the guideline. Compare this to the DL/Full fights in Webont.

Yes, this should be documented.

I will revise the process description after the telecon.
