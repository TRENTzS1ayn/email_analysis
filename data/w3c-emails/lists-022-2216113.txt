Just got around to reading this. Well put. I agree that approach 1 is 
counterintuitive for many, but works often best in semantic-web practice 
(also without the OWL DL / reasoner arguments).

Actually, we do exactly the same in our solution to the "classes as 
values" issue, see my initial response to Bernard:

  Excerpt from:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swbp-wg/2004JanMar/0152.html
[[
Assume we have a painting for which
we want to define the style/period value of "Cubism". Cubism is a class
in one of the subtrees, so it would not be a legal value. Instead, we
store an anonymous instance of "cubism". In fact, there is something to
be said for this solution: the style of a painting is not cubism but
some expression of cubism. Likewise, a painting is not "blue" but some
expression of blue.
]]

We also use it, like Alan, to handle partitions of the value space, e.g. 
analytic and synthetic cubism.

I have a naming suggestion. "Tall" in approach 1 is in fact 
fundamentally different from "Tall" in approach 2. It may be better to 
talk about "Tall value" in approach 1. This makes also clear why there 
is a subclass relation between "height value" and "tall value" and not 
an instance relation.
