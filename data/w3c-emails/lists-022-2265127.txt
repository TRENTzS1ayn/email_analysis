Actually this seems like a very general point that we could make 
which goes beyond the tricks-and-techniques style of our topics so 
far, and which we could legitimately make as a piece of best-practice 
advice.

As  a general matter of best practice, be aware that there might be 
several different possible styles that an ontology could use. So, as 
a general matter of improving interopreability, when composing a new 
ontology which uses a term from an existing ontology, *use the same 
style* as that ontology. If you can't, for other reasons, consider 
not using that term, but instead find (or invent) one which is 
defined in an ontology which uses a compatible style.
