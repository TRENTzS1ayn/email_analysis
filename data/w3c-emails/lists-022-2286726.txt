Alan,

I completely agree with your remark and my message was confusing.

In fact, the purpose of this message [2] was not to defend a particular 
approach (most of the time I use the option of reifying the instances of 
the n-ary relation).
My point really was that, IMO, a maximum of different possible options 
should be listed in the design pattern with their pros and cons like I 
tried to propose in a previous message [1].

What I was trying to avoid is to have a reader thinking we did not see 
an alternative approach while it was in fact implicitly discarded 
because of reasons that seemed obvious to us.
I think all the options we can think of should be listed and discussed, 
even briefly, to provide the design rationale that really makes the 
design pattern reusable.

But then again, may be I completely missed the point of this note,

Fabien
