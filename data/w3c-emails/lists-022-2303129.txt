Fabien,

This is a very good point and something that we should probably discuss 
as a group. I see two mutually-exclusive arguments for whether or not 
to include all approaches, including the ones we would generally rule 
out, in the OEP note.

Argument 1 (pro): Including patterns that we do not recommend but that 
a reasonable person may come up with is good because it preempts 
questions from readers such as "Why didn't you do in way X?" It often 
helps understand the patterns that we do recommend.  It also shows that 
we did our "due diligence" in considering other approaches.

Argument 2 (cons): The WG is the "best practices" WG, so the patterns 
that we produce should be the ones we think are good alternatives in 
some common set of circumstances. Therefore, including considerations 
for other patterns and then saying that we don't generally recommend 
them would dilute the message, in a sense; besides, someone who just 
wants a simple answer to his question "how do I do X?" may not want to 
read through all the reasons why you should not do it in a particular 
way.

I personally am leaning towards argument 2, argument 1 is often more of 
interest to academics than practitioners (Incidentally, 2 is also 
usually  less work :) But I can see the argument going either way.
