Peter,

I agree with you that such an Appendix would be helpful and useful to 
include in the document. Indeed the transformation rules will certainly 
help clarify the differences for many readers. For the moment though, I 
don't think I'll have the time to add it before proposing (in two 
weeks) the note for the first public release. If someone wants to go 
for it before then, please do :)
