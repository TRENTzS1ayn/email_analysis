SWBPD "Vocabulary Management" Task Force Description

    Vocabulary Management

    Considered

OBJECTIVES
    The goal of this Task Force is to describe best practice for
    declaring and managing terms and term sets (vocabularies)
    for use in a Semantic Web environment.  Specifically, the
    Task Force will describe the following:
    
    -- Identification of terms with URIs
       -- Term-related entities identified: eg, a term concept,
          a historical version of a term, a set of terms.
          Possibly: a set of terms declared elsewhere and 
          "reused" in an "application profile".
       -- Formation of URI strings: eg, "implied semantics", 
          "# versus /", version numbers in URI strings.
       -- Versioning of terms ("change management"): event-
          based model linking chains of "term versions" to a
          "term concept" [DCMI-VERSIONING].  Analogy to W3C
          practice for identifying document versions?
    
    -- Policies for term declaration and identification
       -- Term-identification policy: eg, "namespace policy" 
          [DCMI-NAMESPACE], expectations about persistence, 
          maintenance, institutional commitment, semantic
          stability.
       -- "Assertion etiquette" ("good neighbor" policies):
          eg, if DCMI and Library of Congress mutually assert
          a subPropertyOf relationship between MARC Relator
          codes with respect to dc:contributor.
       -- "If we want to declare a term but lack the
          institutional context appropriate to a persistent
          namespace policy, how can we do it?  Should I use an
          existing term, get DCMI to declare one, or declare
          my own?  How can I coin a URI?  Where would I put it?"
    
    -- Documenting terms
       -- What should term URIs "resolve to" (eg, TAG 
          recommendations with regard to RDF or RDDL)?
       -- What are minimum expectations with regard to 
          availability of HTML Web pages, RDF schemas,
          and the like?  Who can we point to that does it 
          right?
       -- Is there a notion of "canonical" versus "derived" 
          sources?
       -- Hints for work flow to maintain multiple 
          documentation forms in synch.

APPROACH
    The issues above have been discussed and documented in various
    vocabulary maintenance communities.  The Task Force deliverable
    should provide an overview of the issues involved in declaring
    and maintaining a vocabulary, pointing to available examples
    of good practice and summarizing their underlying principles.

SCOPE
    Beyond the areas outlined above (URIs, Policies,
    Documentation), additional issues are relevant but possibly
    beyond the scope of the Task Force deliverable:
    
    -- Describing terms: What attributes do terms have, and how
       important is it for interoperability to use existing
       attribute sets?
    
    -- Application profiles: Is it valid and useful to distinguish
       between a "term declaration" and a "term re-use" -- eg,
       in annotations or "application profiles"?
    
    -- Thesauri and ontologies: What types of "vocabulary"
       are there (eg, "metadata element sets", "thesauri", 
       "ontologies") and to which do these guidelines apply?
    
    These issues should perhaps be discussed within the Task
    Force deliverable itself in the form of a scope statement,
    when possible with pointers to other relevant documents.
    
DELIVERABLE
    A relatively concise technical note summarizing
    principles of good practice, with pointers to examples,
    about the identification of terms and term sets with URIs,
    related policies and etiquette, and expectations regarding
    documentation.
    
TARGET AUDIENCE
    -- Maintainers of terms and term sets (vocabularies) for use in a 
       Semantic Web environment.
    -- Anyone else wishing to declare terms reusably.
