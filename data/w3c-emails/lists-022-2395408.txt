My preference would be for the VM note to focus on
_identifying_ terms and term sets in a SW-friendly way.

With regard to declaring (i.e., formally publishing)
a vocabulary, I see two sets of issues:

-- The attributes of a term (such as Definition, Name,
   Comment, etc...).  I listed this as probably "out of
   scope" for the VM draft because the issue feels too big
   for a little note.  Or if the VM note were to address this,
   perhaps then only in the form of minimal guidelines (i.e.,
   "provide a definition").

-- Documenting terms: I think of this issue as in scope
   inasmuch we should summarize the state of discussion about
   whether a URI resolves to anything at all, and if so,
   whether to a Web page, a schema (of whatever flavor),
   or a resource directory.

   If best practice on this has yet to emerge in the wider
   community, the VM note should perhaps do no more (or no
   less) than summarize and critically discuss the range of
   possibilities, pointing to an example of each.

Yes.

In light of the above, the objective of the note should
perhaps be changed (s/declaring/identifying/):

    The goal of this Task Force is to describe best practice
    for IDENTIFYING and managing terms and term sets
    (vocabularies) for use in a Semantic Web environment.
