Guus, Natasha

Here is version 2 of the Lists of Values note I hope in W3 format.   I hope it is ready for release as a first working draft with the first batch. If there are further references which should be added or other tweaks please feel free to do so.  I have tried to take into account all of Guus' and Natasha's comments.  Also, given Natasha's helpful comments, I would be happy to see her name added to the editors list.  (I'd missed her comments on the first pass in recovering from an email crash.)

I have included the powerpoint file from which the .jpg files were created in case anyone wants to tweak those.

If the trains are on time, I may make it for the end of the next telcon.  If not (which is more probable) I shall be in a mobile phone black hole; so good luck.

Note that I shall have variable email links for the next two weeks but should have some contact although little time.

Regards

Alan
