Thomas

Thanks for this.  There are thre related questions I would put up for consideration - that need to be considered here or elsewhere and I think this may be the place.

1)    "Term" vs "Concept".  The medical community has a long tradition of carefully distinguishing the name from the representation of the concept/thing. This goes through almost all the major vocabularies - UMLS (CUIs = Concept Unique Identifier vs LUIs = Lexical Unique Identifiers vs even SUIs String Unique Identifiers  - although many think those should have been handled differently. SNOMED, its ancestor Read, ICD (sort of), HL7 (the main standards body), GALEN and all new developments.  Separating Term and Concept is probably the most important thing the medical community has learnt from its experience and something takes as a sine qua non of good practice.  I think some recognition of this issue in SW is needed.  The owl:labels annotation is one first step. However, I don't think it adequate to cover all the use cases (e.g. preferred terms vs synonyms/alternative terms for the same concept etc. within as well as between linguistic communities).

2)    "What constitutes a change" - this seemingly simple question has been very difficult to answer, especially in any ontology expected to be used with a reasoner. It can only be answered with respect to 1) - when is something just a change in naming and when is it a change in substance. 

3)    "What is the granularity of change" - the entire ontology? individuals terms/concepts? Some intermediate?

This distinction may not be relevant to all communities, but at a minimum it needs to be recognised as critical to some.

Regards

Alan
