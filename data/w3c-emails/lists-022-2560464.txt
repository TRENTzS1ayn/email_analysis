(I've snipped big chunks of Philippe's very interesting knowledge server 
ideas, trying to narrow to more immediate WordNet/SW mapping issues)

Ok, this suggests to me that a mapping is needed between the WN 
terminology and RDF/OWL constructs, and that some manual intervention 
will be needed after any automatic translation: so hyponym would appear 
to map mostly to rdfs:subClassOf but manual correction will be needed 
where the relationship is rdf:type.

It sounds like the antonym side could be tricky, again with something of 
a mixup between instances and classes - map mostly to owl:disjointWith 
then tidy exceptions to owl:differentFrom ??
I'm guessing the closure of "closed subtype partition" may be lost 
because of the open world assumption.

The Dunkerque case does suggest non-trivial manual intervention will be 
needed and/or a narrowing of the range of proper nouns!

Hmm, it's interesting that these all seem process-oriented - perhaps 
terms could be borrowed from OWL-S?

So the relations/view has to be worked out at runtime?
In RDF/OWL terms I guess we'd be looking at a triplestore holding the WN 
model, with a query engine taking queries/returning views, perhaps with 
on-the-fly generation of inferred relationships (and almost certainly 
with caching).

I think the only way this could be scalable is to use a single namespace 
with 'official' identifiers for the words. It probably would be 
advantageous to have a http server available, I think danbri's pointed 
out a possible way forward there:

http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog

How other individual servers use the ontology would be left to 
individual implementations - something MGET-like might turn out to be a 
common setup:

http://example.org/query?wn_term=http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog

I suspect there needs to be a clean separation between the "core" 
representation (which presumably would be a tangly graph) and views that 
would help provide subject trees. I'm not sure how in-scope the latter 
are for the WN TF, though perhaps a good use cases would be to map WN to 
the dmoz.org open directory tree.

Hopefully corrections would be fed back into the dictionary, but 
certainly sharable additions offer a lot of promise. Discovery of the 
additions might be tricky, but that's a larger problem.

I certainly have nothing against the implementation you describe, but 
would suggest that the Semantic Web will be comprised of servers (and 
clients) of many different architectures and for many different 
purposes, in the same way that human-readable knowledge on the web is 
maintained in a myriad different ways. The key requirement is having 
common interchange languages (i.e. RDF and OWL).

I do however think that your server suggestions do prompt some questions 
that probably should be directly addressed, in particular how will a 
Semantic Web representation of a WordNet-like lexicon be useful? How 
will it be used?

As a first pass, two application areas spring to mind - information 
search and knowledge interchange. An example of the former would be an 
extention of a traditional dictionary or encyclopedia, in which the WN 
terms would be used to disambiguate details of the query and provide a 
route to discovery of data. Such an application could simply provide 
direct references to something like the Wikipedia, but I think the more 
interesting SW application would involve the incorporation of statements 
that provide context for the query - a holidaymaker enquiring about 
Italian trains would be seeking different information that a WW2 history 
student.
The knowledge interchange angle is likely to have wider impact - if two 
organizations wish to exchange information then the unambiguously 
defined terms based on the WN lexicon combined with RDF/OWL logic 
provides a common language through which to communicate. I think that's 
the underlying intention of most ontology/schema authors that refer to 
WN terms already, but it still isn't entirely clear how 
ontology-ontology mapping will be aided in practice by this usage. (Ok, 
there are probably quite a few papers I haven't yet read...;-)

Cheers,
Danny.
