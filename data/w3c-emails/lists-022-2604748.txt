Bernard, Mike,

Thanks for the pointer. I'll try to work some of Bernard's suggestions 
into the examples (plus the skos properties, if there is a consensus 
that this is the way to go). I am also a bit concerned that sending a 
reader to too many places just to illustrate an example may distract 
too much from the main point of a particular note. I'll try to find 
some reasonable compromise for the next version and we can go from 
there.

It's indeed some effort, but probably worth it for readability of the 
final version.

Natasha
