It is in scope for the XML Schema Datatypes TF to address the specific 
issue of how to (slightly) increase the expressivity of RDF and OWL to 
permit user-defined datatypes (and hence at least a minimal solution to 
the big wheel problem).

Quite how to deploy that solution (in terms of the standards) is yet to 
be determined ... since there was support for issuing a first datatypes 
note that raised the questions, I think this is a plausible question to 
ask the community at that point.

Personally, if the necessary changes to any recs were small, I would 
favour errata against the current recs. That might not fly ... another 
option might be to have a rec track doc ourselves; or simply to record 
the consensus and await the next revision of RDF, OWL and/or XML Schema 
to deploy this consensus within the Rec track.

Without having thought about it much, I think small errata is the 
simplest path, but might meet opposition, and having a rec track doc 
ourselves would be a mistake. This might leave us with simply 
documenting the current position and suggested changes (which seems to 
be Mike's position)

I would be nervous about generalizing this - e.g. QCC were considered by 
webont and rejected, I would be very uncomfortable with this group 
revisiting that - whereas the user-defined datatypes issue was desired 
by both RDF Core and WebOnt, but we did not have the effort to put into 
resolving the problems (i.e. to coordinate adequately with XML Schema 
WG, and to make sure that any solution for these problems in RDF and OWL 
does not interfere poorly with work they are doing)
