People seem to have agreed that doing a pattern on n-ary (reified)  
relations would be a useful thing to have. Alan Rector and I actually  
had a chance to work it out and you can see the first draft  of our  
effort at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2004May/att-0003/n- 
aryRelations.html

It's nowhere near as complicated or as controversial (we hope) as the  
Classes as Values one. In fact, it's rather simple, almost too simple  
to be a pattern. On the other hand, it seems to be on a topic that many  
newcomers to OWL have questions on.

As usual, please feel free to poke holes in it and all feedback is  
welcome.

Thanks in advance,

Natasha and Alan
