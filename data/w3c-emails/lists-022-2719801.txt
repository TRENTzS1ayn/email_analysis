I was trying to catch up on the status of the wordnet task force and noticed
that that task force description on the group page

  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/#Tasks

Links to Aldo's first message on the subject.  Are there any plans to update
this in the light of subsequent discussion.

Is there a task force web page?
