Natasha, Alan

Nice work, once again :)

Some remarks about Pattern 2.

- The property "amount" seems to me a Datatype property, but it is displayed in the
graphical representation
the same way as otherwise Object properties, and further on not mentioned in the
restrictions.
So it does not seem to really participate in the relationship, or in a different and
underspecified way.
This is potentially confusing.
I would suggest to either get rid of it altogether (the example seems complex and
illustrating enough without it),
or specify how "amount" is different from other roles in the association. (Sorry, topic
map terminology is coming here very naturally - see below).

- Why is there not any inverseOf for "purpose"?

- The pattern looks much topic-map-ish to me ... A translation in terms of Topic, Roles
and Associations is quite obvious and easy to do. Note that in a topic map representation,
the inverse properties would be useless, since the linking of a topic to an association
through a role is by nature two-ways.
Only the instance of Purchase could be expressed easily this way in XTM, while the
reference pattern could be in the OWL ontology. I made proposals for such mechanism in my
XML Europe 2004 paper "Ontology-Driven Topic Maps"
http://www.idealliance.org/europe/04/call/xmlpapers/03-03-03.91/.03-03-03.html

I can provide TM translation for the Lionish example, along the lines of this paper, and a
bit of XTM syntax if it considered relevant to include it in the document.

Cheers
