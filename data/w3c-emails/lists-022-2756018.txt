Looking through the discusion on representing WordNet, I've been trying to
understand the relation between wordnets, thesauri and ontologies.

Is there a consensus view on the relationship between a wordnet synset and
the class the synonyms names, i.e. is the synset containing the word 'dog'
necessarily owl:sameAs the class of dogs?

Also, does WordNet have synsets for relations?  Do such synsets have
hypernyms or hyponyms?  If so is rdfs:subClassOf rather rdfs:subPropertyOf
correct?
