Thanks, Aldo.  That is helpful.

Is that representative of consensus in the community?

Hmm.  That logic seems vulnerable to the observation that properties too
have a unique intended meaning, as do instances.

So what are the instances of the class you have in mind?  The term 'synset'
suggests it is intended to denote a set of synonyms.  Are you suggesting
that the instances of the class are words, with the word 'dog' being of type
Synset(Dog).  Or are they dogs?

You were ahead of me :)

Hmm, it seems to a rather ignorant me that equating the obvious synset
containing 'dog' to the class of dogs is a bit dubious in theoretical terms.
Equating it to the class of synonyms of (one sense of) 'dog' seems like a
more accurate representation of the WordNet.  And that would be a precise
mapping to a formal ontology, just a different kind of mapping, right?
Later one could consider the relation between the synset containing 'dog'
and the class of dogs.  But that is not a sameClassAs relationship.

Guus' proposal did.

I shall look forward to the draft.  Is it a development of Guus' proposal?
However, what you have said so far is causing me to lean towards the view
that trying to treat wordnet as an ontology is a bit iffy and encoding
WordNet in an SW language might be more appropriate.  It would be good to
have practical criteria such as concrete use cases or effects on software to
guide a decision.

Is that a fixed mapping, or based on some criteria?

I didn't follow that.  I guess I need to see the proposal.

Hmm, we seem to have a tradeoff between just getting a common encoding of
WordNet and tackling some more 'interesting' issues of ontology
reengineering.  Do I recall correctly that phase 1 is just about the
encoding?
