Considering the acceptance rate of our papers and the results of our 
projects, it seems so :). BTW, considering synsets as concepts is 
quite common and accepted ...

Yes, and as I suggested, from a purely logical viewpoint, there is no 
obligation to use classes or relations. There are best practices from 
formal ontology engineering though. And at least one of economicity: 
when using Semantic Web ontology languages, it is preferable to 
manage a class than a property.

That's one central issue in SW. Formal ontology best practices tend 
to distinguish between classes of objects and classes of words. 
Synsets have a twofold nature: they can be considered *equivalence* 
classes of words, but based on a *common* intended meaning, and the 
intended meaning is not about words, but about something else 
(concepts, things, or even words in the case of metalanguage).

Then you can decide to use synsets to manage words. But in this case 
you get an ontology of word meanings, which approximates the way most 
ontologies are getting used. A big difference between an ontology 
extracted from a wordnet and one that isn't, is that the first 
encodes only the concepts that are lexicalised, i.e. that are in 
words.

As I've said above, I agree on the possibility of using synsets to 
create an ontology of the lexicon, but still you should wonder why 
those words are in the same class, i.e. what is the "identity 
criterion" you are applying for that class. And - formally - that 
criterion is the set of properties by which you can define the class 
of dogs.
Again, I agree that a class of synonym words is different from a 
class of objects or any other type, and that there is a relation 
between the two. But the benefits of having a comprehensive 
lexical-oriented ontology of entities is greater than having just an 
ontology of synonyms (that is there already), then it deserves the 
additional effort.

Guus' proposal is a refined datamodel for encoding the original 
structure of WordNet. I am trying to make a collection of the issues 
concerning WordNet2SW that have been raised so far, possible actions 
and solutions, etc.
Practical use cases? I have some, Jeremy provided others, anyone else 
is encouraged to submit

no fixed criterion, just heuristics

Yes
