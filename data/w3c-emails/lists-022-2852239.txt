I favor getting rid of it. This would mean using something other than  
purchase though (seems unnatural to define a purchasing event without  
an amount -- yo are right it doesn't add anything and only creates the  
confusion, but still). Perhaps borrowing or something like that.

No reason, except that it didn't seem to be natural to have one.  
Perhaps it should be there.

this would indeed be useful (Alan?). Could you make a pass at it? It  
would help though if you use an example very similar to the one in the  
note -- perhaps the same one (says she, right after saying she is going  
to change it :)
