agreed -- will change that.

This is where I would come back to the point of having only the bare 
essentials.. This note is not about proper usage of dc:subject. The 
only reason it's there is because subjects are a natural place where 
the need of using classes as values arise. There are many other use 
cases. Thinking about it more, perhaps using something other than 
dc:subject (just a local property subject?) could be a better idea to 
avoid touching on this issue. On the other hand, most people looking at 
a newly introduced subject property will immediately wonder why we are 
not using dc:subject. Will using some other property, say "topic" 
create less confusion? Any other suggestions?

If we do want to address the proper use (and best practice) of 
dc:subject, it can probably be in a different note that 
cross-references this one. So, understanding the use of dc;subject 
perhaps requires understanding this note but not the other way around.

Thoughts?

Natasha
