I agree that this would be useful and indeed there is nothing 
OWL-specific here -- the problem is just the same in RDF (or in any 
language that doesn't have n-ary relations). And the WG is concerned 
with SW in general and not just OWL after all.

In terms of simplicity though, I would a bit concerned about having too 
much branching: here is pattern 1, and here it is in OWl, and here is 
the same thing in RDF, but it will look slightly differently (using 
domain and ranges, etc.) Any idea on how to structure this so that 
readers interested in one language or the other can get what they need 
without filtering through too much extraneous (for them) information?

Basically, back to the issue of what a good template for this would be.

Yes, there is definitely a terminology clash there. Any suggestions on 
a different term to use?
