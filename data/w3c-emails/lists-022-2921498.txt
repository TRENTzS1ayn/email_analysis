The original sentence defining the situation has to be corrected in any case ...

"John buys a "Lenny the Lion" book from Mary for $15 as a birthday gift."

Should read certainly

"John buys a "Lenny the Lion" book for $15 *for* Mary as a birthday gift."

But in fact this sentence describes all mixed together two distinct events, the "purchase"
and the "gift".
Mary should not know anything about the former, and certainly not the amount - that would
be considered as rude from John, at least in France, maybe not in America, where $ is the
measure of everything :))

So, to get rid of the amount, let's focus on the gift rather than the purchase:

"John offers a "Lenny the Lion" book to Mary as a birthday gift".

With the following formal description

:Gift_1
a     :Gift ;
:has_agent :John ;
      :has_recipient :Mary ;
:has_object :Lenny_The_Lion ;
:has_occasion :Mary's Birthday .

And change the Restriction on has_occasion to e.g. allValuesFrom :Event

Another picky remark : the identification of the gift object is somehow fuzzy here.
Is it an individual copy, or the generic publication defined e.g. by its ISBN number as
discussed before?
Accurately, it's a random instance of the publication, before the purchase, and it becomes
a singular, identified one as soon as it is signed up by John ("To Mary, for her 7th
birthday - John") and offered.
Should the example capture that, or sweep the difficulty under the carpet ?

Will be more natural with "has_occasion" and "is_occasion_for"

I will propose it for the above "gift" example if you agree it's better.
The best would be first to define the OWL-RDF syntax for it, to have
the URIs of classes and properties that will be used as "subjectIndicatorRef" in the XTM
syntax.
(I can provide both syntaxes).
