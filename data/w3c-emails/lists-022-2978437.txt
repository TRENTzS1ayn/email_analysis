This thread suggests to me that we should really first focus on the
"as-is" conversion, without trying to interpret WordNet. Subsequently,
people can publish there interpretations. I do not expect this WG to 
publish a single ontologyical interpretation of WordNet, although it 
would be nice, of course.

As Aldo said, the purpose of my earlier note [1] was just to show how an 
"as-is" conversion could look like, using the WordNet v2.0 Prolog 
distribution as input. The main decision concerns the representation of 
the words in a synset, either as literal values or as individuals. The 
rest appears to me to be rather straightforward. This is what I call 
low-hanging fruit. It gives SW developers a common reference point.
