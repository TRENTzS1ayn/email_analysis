Reification would be the proper term normally. It is unfortunate that 
the RDF spec uses up such a useful word, and particularly unfortunate 
that RDF reification isn't a particularly useful representational 
mechanism. I would advise against using the word 'reification' (even 
with a NOTE) to describe "non-RDF" reification in an RDF context. Even 
writing that last sentence tied me in knots, since non-RDF-reification 
(eg. the n-ary conventions) is of course something we do in RDF. The 
word is gone, taken from us... to use it is to encourage its continued 
use, and not everyone will be as careful as us to include a disclaimer 
NOTE. I guess I'm not arguing that we must completely avoid its use (eg. 
in footnotes, parentheses, discussion of relation to UML etc.), just to 
minimise references to 'reification' wherever possible.
