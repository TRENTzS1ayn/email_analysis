I agree with Guus' sentiment here.  That is - "reification" is the
word that would be best understood by those from information or object 
modeling worlds.  We should, of course, clarify our use of the term
on first appearance for those who might interpret it as RDF reification.

This brings up a question though: What is the intended audience for
OEP notes?  I think we are targeting those new to the Semantic Web
and even KR.  I am expecting that audience to be dominated by domain
experts and modelers over the next few years (this seems to be 
validated by the emails I have seen on the protege-owl list).  Making 
the SW easy to use and understand for those groups is why I joined this 
WG.  So when picking terms, structure, examples and even the subject
of these notes, I would place a higher priority on the needs of these
groups than the needs of groups exemplified by say the members of 
rdf-logic.  

Is this a controversial view?
