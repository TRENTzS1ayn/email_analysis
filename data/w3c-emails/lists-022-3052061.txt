It puts the case well ...

this same audience may get confused though, if they pick up introductory 
RDF material, such as the Shelley Powers' book, or the RDF Primer, and 
find a discussion of reification which is somewhat at odds with the 
discussion in this note. Perhaps your target new SW users are different 
from mine. I suspect that they will read such books first, and the note 
second. "The word is gone, taken from us..."
