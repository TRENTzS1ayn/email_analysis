Right.  SWBPD should not be providing general KR guidelines, only
those related to using SW languages.  It would be appropriate for
a WRLD TF product to describe appropriate uses of SW languages
(classes of problems for which a SW language would be an appropriate
component of a solution), although that would be a pretty large space
I should think.  It would also be quite helpful for SWBPD to produce a 
note describing the classes of reasoning tools available for RDF, RDFS, 
and OWL.  I imagine the WRLD task force description covered the former,
don't know about the latter.
