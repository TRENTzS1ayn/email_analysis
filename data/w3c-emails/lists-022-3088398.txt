hi all,

Brian McBride and I have had some discussions about the applications and
demos taskforce, and I've come up with a draft taskforce description. I had
hoped that Brian might have time to look over it, but I need to send it
today as I'm expecting to be offline most of next week.

I'll have to send my regrets for the next telecon as I am in transit,
but I should be around for the following one for discussions. In the
meantime, please send comments to the list or me  - see in particular
the notes and issues below.

cheers

Libby


TEMPLATE Task Force Description

NAME Applications and Demos

[ADTF]

STATUS: draft

COORDINATORS:
Libby Miller University of Bristol

MEMBERS

TBA

OBJECTIVES

* To help ground the decisions made in other taskforces in code

DELIVERABLES

Short, illustrative documents showing methods of implementing other
taskforce decisions via usecases, including (pseudo-?) code and where
possible, online demonstrations. The documents will also link to
existing applications and tools in the area.


For example

in THES: http://www.w3.org/2004/03/thes-tf/mission
objective:
"Document strategies for representing Thesaurus-like content using RDF/OWL"

ADTF will write a short document:

Introduction: brief statement why SW versions of thesauri are useful

Usecase 1: using a multilingual thesaurus
code snippet: find the nearest English term for 'chien'
Usecase 2: distinguishing between different senses of a word
code snippet: accessing a thesaurus via a net api to suggest different
senses

This second usecase might also be a candidate for an online demo if
resources permit.

Links to similar applications, libraries with the relevant
functionalities.

Notes
- ADTF should be independent of the TF it is documenting - a 'second
opinion' akin to Brian's testing role for the taskforce
- ADTF should track the decisions as they occur and perhaps try to keep
discussions concrete by trying to implement them(?)

Issues
- real code or pseudo-code? if real, which library? several libraries?
- duplication with what the other taskforces intend to do?
