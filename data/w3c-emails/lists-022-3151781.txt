Actually, it's me not using the right words again (see a pattern here? 
:) a different kind of one, I suppose).

What we actually had in mind was indeed that John buy the book *from* 
Mary for a birthday gift for someone. So Mary was the recipient of the 
$15. So, by trying to use the generic roles of "recipient" and "agent," 
we've obscured the issue. I guess it would be better to use simply 
"buyer" and "seller". We can still omit the amount not to get into that 
discussion or just mention it and cross-reference the forthcoming 
pattern on quantities.

I would still go with the purchase example as its slightly more 
straightforward than the gift one (on the gift side, one might wonder 
for example if Mary and Mary's birthday should somehow be connected, 
etc.)

no, don't worry, even in America you don't usually flaunt the price of 
your gift :)

I'd say sweep -- the difference in representing a physical copy of the 
book and a generic publication is certainly out of scope here.
