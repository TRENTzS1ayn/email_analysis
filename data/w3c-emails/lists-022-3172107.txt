>ACTION: Jim report back on short-term plan for World Task Force

Currently, the short-term plan for the World Task Force is not to do 
anything.  No one has volunteered to do any immediate editing, and 
world doesn't seem to be waiting on us for this.  Here is my 
rationalization for not doing anything (although lack of volunteers 
to do something is the primary reason):

1 - Note on why to use RDF and OWL:  WG members are involved in 
writing articles about why to use RDF and OWL for other venues, and 
it may be easier to collect these at a later time than to write a 
competing document as a W3C note.  Maximum deployment would seem to 
argue for exposure in the highest visibility forums we can reach.
2 - Note on using RDF/OWL with other langauges: It is unclear what 
best practices we have in this area.  Might be worth waiting until we 
have something to say
3 - Note on "cleaning up the mess" - it is unclear to me that we have 
anything resembling consensus within the WG as to the relative 
strengths/merits of OWL Full v. DL.  My current instinct is to let 
sleeping dogs lie and deal with other, more important, things first.

Of course, if anyone wants to argue me out of the above by 
volunteering to actually edit a document, I will be willing to 
reconsider the positions above.  Anyone wanting to argue me out of 
the above without volunteering to edit a document is very unlikely to 
be successful.
