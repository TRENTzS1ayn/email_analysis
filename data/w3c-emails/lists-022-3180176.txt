Wow! This is another story that the one I caught, indeed :(

Or replace "Mary" by "Amazon", and ask them to sponsor the document :))

Right

Yes, and other noisy semantics like what is the kind of relationship between John and
Mary.
Sticking to the business relationship is safer ...

Happy to see America is not that far from civilization after all :))

Agreed. Just put that remark to point out that any apparently simple situation can be made
arbitrarily complex (and arbitrarily confusing for the user) depending on how carefully
you look at it. This is a general issue we should maybe address at some point.
Reminds me of a famous quote by a French humorist of the 70's:
"A technocrat is that kind of guy, when he answers you, you don't understand your question
any more."

Cheers
