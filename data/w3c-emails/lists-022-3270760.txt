You can find the next (and, hopefully, close to last iteration) of the  
"Classes as values" note at

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2004May/att-0019/ 
ClassesAsValues-v3.html

At this point, as we've agreed in the previous telecon, I would like to  
propose this document as an official note.

Thanks to everyone for their comments and suggestions.

Major changes:

1. I've added one more approach (approach 4) that approximates the  
solution by identifying the book as a  book about *some* lions. It is  
indeed an approximation, but the question has come up often enough that  
I felt it was worth at least mentioning and explaining what's different  
about such an approach. Please take a look at the considerations there,  
since this stuff is all new.

2. I've changed to real book examples, as Bernard suggested. I used  
rdfs:seeAlso to refer to the isbn site (cool resource indeed)

3. I have not used SKOS properties in approach 3 directly (avoiding the  
addition of another complexity level), but I have mentioned it (and  
also used seeAlso to point to the corresponding SKOS property). I hope  
it's a reasonable compromise.

Natasha
