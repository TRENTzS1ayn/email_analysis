Given the target audience will include people from the RDBMS world as 
well as the odd mathematician, to avoid ambiguity (and the wrath of 
purists) I'd suggest trying to follow Codd's use of "relation" [1] as a 
set of statements (in this case triples), with "relationship" used for 
the more general term, see Date [2]:

?Given the depth and complexity of Codd's thought, not to mention the 
arcane terms in which he often expressed himself, it is not difficult to 
grasp why so many of his key points have been widely misunderstood. Even 
programmers still often misconstrue the technical term ?relational?. The 
relational in relational theory refers to relations and not 
relationships. A relation is a special set of similar objects commonly 
modeled as entities or as database tables. Relationships may exist 
between these relations and if your relations are entities you could 
easily represent the whole thing using a Relational Entity Relationship 
approach. To elucidate a simple practical example, if you had a company 
table and an employee table and each company record could have many 
employee records associated with it, you would have two relations and 
one relationship. The relations would be the sets of similar objects 
found in the Employee and Company tables and the relationship would be 
the association between them. In this case one company to many employees.?

Cheeers,
Danny.
