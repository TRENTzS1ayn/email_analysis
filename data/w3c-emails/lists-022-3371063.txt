As decided in the last telecon, I propose the following issue to be 
discussed with Christiane Fellbaum in the May 27th telecon (30 
minutes):

(a) description of the actions for short/medium term to be followed by WNET-TF
(a1) port of Princeton WordNet as an RDF data structure with 
an explicit OWL datamodel
(a2) set of recommendations and/or patterns w/alternatives to 
reengineer wordnets as OWL ontologies

(b) availability of Princeton to include an OWL-RDF (datamodel+data) 
version (as at (a1)) in the official distribution

(c) availability of Princeton (and/or other initiatives in which 
Christiane is involved) to include (possibly by participating in the 
development of) our recommendations and patterns at (a2)) in some 
official set of guidelines or joint programme

If I receive no further suggestion, I'll consider these issues as a 
reference to produce a report on WNET activity some days before the 
telecon, so that we will not need much time to clarify the respective 
backgrounds.

All the best
Aldo
