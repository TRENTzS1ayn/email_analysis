As a matter of form, it is helpful to readers if writers would include
appropriate links and quotes when reference to previous decisions/discussion
are made.

Referring to

I see

[[
ACTION: Aldo to discuss a plan for the May 27th discussion at the next 
Telecon

Hmm, I'd rather separate these out, i.e.

Issue: Encoding WordNet 1.6 in RDF/Owl
  - Can we have some help from Christiane.  Active involvement would be
good.  Willingness to review important.
  - namespace to use
  - Technical issues to discuss e.g. are synsets classes and if so what are
their instances.
  - Structuring the data - view files or knowledge server (not sure I
understand that one - are we thinking they might ship knowledge server code
as part of the distribution?)
  - Subject to Christiane being satisfied with the results, would he be
willing ot include in the standard Wnet distribution.

Other than mentioning as possible future work, I suggest we don't plan to
spend any time discussing re-engineering Wordnet or wordnets as ontologies.

I think it would be great to have a strawman distributed before to discuss
at the telecon.  This might be based on Guus' proposal.

I'll be interested to see whether Owl is required for this.  As usual I'm
inclined to prefer to have a non-Owl version available.

Sorry, but you've got another suggestion.  I feat the task force leader's
enthusiams and mine lie in different places.

Showing willing by having a first cut would seem like a good thing.

Naively
