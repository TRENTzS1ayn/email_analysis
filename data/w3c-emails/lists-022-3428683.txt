OK thanks, doing exact references for everything is always a good practice :)

As an anticipation of the report, and to answer 
some of the issue you have raised sometimes ago, 
look at: 
http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/index.shtml, 
you'll find in the first paragraph:

WordNet? is an online lexical reference system 
whose design is inspired by current 
psycholinguistic theories of human lexical 
memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives and 
adverbs are organized into synonym sets, each 
representing one underlying lexical concept. 
Different relations link the synonym sets.

You are served: synsets are *sets* of *synonym 
lexical entries*. Synsets *represent* *one* 
underlying lexical *concept*.

Hence:

1) from the terminological viewpoint, a synset 
can be represented as an owl:Class whose 
instances are lexical entries (words, terms)

2) from the conceptual viewpoint, a synset can be 
represented as an owl:Class whose instances are 
concept's instances (where the concepts are only 
those accepted in the lexicon at hand).

3) A concept instance is *usually* interpreted as 
an entity in the domain of reference of an 
ontology, which is identified by the properties 
of the concept. Of course, there are even 
alternative semantic interpretations for concept 
instances, but the one mostly accepted in 
ontology engineering is the one I have mentioned.

4) Although not considered by WordNet, we can 
also conceive of representing synsets as 
owl:Individual, treating WordNet as a legacy 
database.

Besides my Lab's site, you can look at a lot of 
other work on these issues, for example:

http://www.bultreebank.org/OntoLex02Proceedings.html
http://conferences.atala.org/conferences/fiches/lrec2004.html
http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2004/doc/ws/prg_ontolex.pdf

No, Philippe was suggesting that owl-encoded 
wordnets should work on the Semantic Web through 
dedicated knowledge servers rather than as 
scattered views of monolithic files.

Perfect. BTW ... she be willing ...

Your suggestion clashes against the willing of 
many actors in the scene, besides the intended 
scope of Princeton WordNet. In this committee 
there are obviously persons not interested in 
that kind of work, but I understand they are not 
the totality, for example:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swbp-wg/2004Apr/0211.html
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swbp-wg/2004May/0023.html.

Moreover, I do not see why a meaningful area of 
investigation, supported by many individuals and 
groups in the Semantic Web and elsewhere, should 
not be addressed by this task force. As a good 
matter of form, look at the discussions in the 
[OEP] task force: none has ever tried to mute or 
to suggest to ignore a position just because she 
is not available to discuss it.

>I think it would be great to have a strawman distributed before to discuss
>at the telecon.  This might be based on Guus' proposal.

It is part of the report due before the telecon.

>I'll be interested to see whether Owl is required for this.  As usual I'm
>inclined to prefer to have a non-Owl version available.

OWL should be used for the datamodel in the 
Stoffel/Guus proposal. Probably the expressivity 
required can be available in RDFS as well.

Of course, this is a natural outcome of group 
working ;). I won't force you to discuss *all* 
the issues, you won't force me to shut up. No 
fear, no problem.
