Yeh, I think it is too good to be true. The English usage is that 
'relationship' is just a more abstract version of essentially the 
same notion, eg Wordnet gives

relationship (as in "relation") n. : a relation between people; 
(`relationship' is often used where `relation' would serve (as in 
"the relationship between inflation and unemployment")) preferred 
usage of `relationship' is for human relations or states of 
relatedness; "the relationship between mothers and children" 

relationship (as in "state") n. : a state of connectedness between 
people (especially an emotional connection); "he didn't want his wife 
to know of the relationship" 

and for 'relation' (which can also be used as a noun, meaning, the 
thing that is related) it has

relation (as in "abstraction") n. : an abstraction belonging to or 
characteristic of two entities or parts together 

relation (as in "sexual intercourse") n. : the act of sexual 
procreation between a man and a woman; the man's penis is inserted 
into the woman's vagina and excited until orgasm and ejaculation 
occur 

relation (as in "relative") n. : a person related by blood or 
marriage; "police are searching for relatives of the deceased"; "he 
has distant relations back in New Jersey" 

relation (as in "narration") n. : an act of narration; "he was the 
hero according to his own relation"; "his endless recounting of the 
incident eventually became unbearable" 

relation (as in "dealings") n. : (usually plural) mutual dealings or 
connections among persons or groups: "international relations" 

and I notice that many of the 'more specific' instances of 
relationship correspond to the 'similar' instances of relation.

>Or is it that "relation" has a formal definition, whereas
>"relationship" is more casual in this context? Go figure.

Yeh, go figure. Like much of English, the distinctions are more in 
usage and nuances than directly in actual definitions.

There really isnt an obvious English word for the 'instance of 
relation' idea, which is probably why philosophers felt it necessary 
to come up things like 'trope' and 'situation' and 'actuality'.

In haste
