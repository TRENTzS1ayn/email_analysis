See below under explicitness.  I think it makes the meaning much less clear and extension much more difficult.
(unless of course, one of the values really is a list, but that's not the case we are considering)

Oops - what it does move us is out of the things currently supported by the common reasoners, FaCT &  Racer.
I sometimes mistake the capabilities of existing tools for the specification of OWL-DL.  This may be fixed relatively soon,
but is certainly true now.

Simply that in the list, the roles of the arguments are indicated by position rather than by being labelled by a property.  To somebody reading the expression, it isn't necessarily obvious which argument has which role.  Likewise, it much harder to extend for programming.  If the role of each argument is indicated by a separate property, then additional roles can be added by adding additional properties without changing anything else. If they have to be added to a list, it is likely to require much more complications - e.g. there might have been a length limit.

Also, in the list case, it is harder to see how semantics of subsumption works.  When do two lists subsume each other?  I'd need one of the rdf:logic folk to check that out.  I presume super-lists entail sublists, but I am not sure. I do suspect it will be some time before reasoners catch up and support it.

Similarly, if the graph for a value needs to be extended , the result is a single graph.  In the list form, if a value needs to be extended, we have a graph inside a list.  Possible but messy.  Again, given the split between object properties and datatype properties in OWL, I think this is going to be nasty.

I am prepared to be convinced  of the feasibility by some well worked out examples, but the more I think about it at my current understanding of what would be involved, the more sceptical I am, except for the case in which the value really is naturally a list (or some other complex datatype) - which is clearly not what this note is about.

Even if it is feasible, when would this approach have an advantage?  Why add the complication of a list datatype when we can just add ordinary properties, object or datatype as required?
