All

While at Stanford, Natasha and I also discussed the issues of representing lists of values, either as partitioning classes or as all different individuals.

I have now put a short paper at  http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~rector/swbp/lists_of_values_v0_1.html and a pdf version at  http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~rector/swbp/lists_of_values_v0_1.pdf .

(There are some odd glitches in the styles, and the html doesn't always print out correctly although it comes out fine on the screen, at least on my machine.)

Natasha and I had some discussion of titles and what to call things.  I settled for the paper on "lists of values" as neutral with "value partitions" for the version using classes and "value sets" for the version using individuals.  Further suggestions welcome if we can make clear what the purpose is.
