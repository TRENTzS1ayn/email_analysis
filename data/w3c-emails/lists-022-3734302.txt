Guus,

How should folks who wish to contribute to, or comment on, the WG's
discussions do so?  

As we don't have a separate comments list, I have been assuming that folks
can just post to public-swbp-wg@w3.org, but I believe Jeremy's understanding
is different.

What practice would you like folks to adopt?

Brian
