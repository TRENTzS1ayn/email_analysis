Brian,

That's a very interesting and important issue (and in fact, overlaps 
with WRLD TF, which is ok of course). It is a different focus and a 
somewhat different document. If you would like to use the current note 
as a jumping-off point to write such a document,  that would make a 
great contribution.

PS. By the way, I need to check, but I think all the OWL DL approaches 
in the note are indeed OWL Lite.
