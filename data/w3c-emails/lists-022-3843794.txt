Ok, will do. Pardon my ignorance (and I am writing this on-line), what 
is the significance of @@

So, for the moment I understand that there is nothing I need to do to 
change the document format. I'll leave it at that until someone else 
points out what should be done.

Actually, this is a good idea and may eliminate some of the confusion. 
Anyone else has thoughts on this?

we certainly don't :)

I don't think that's an option here. If you have any doubt, see the 
discussion about a month back on "philosophy of swbp"...

seeAlso is an annotation property, so it would be fine. I've added it.

Thanks for the explanation, Brian. I don't think there are b-nodes 
involved here though. We are saying there are *some* lions there about 
which this book is about, but we are not creating any nodes -- blank or 
otherwise-- to represent those lions.

I disagree. If I want to use a DL reasoner on my ontology but am 
willing not to have it do anything about the subjects, this option is a 
feasible one. As far as I know, all (at least most) DL reasoners that 
exist today will simply refuse to do anything with an OWL Full 
ontology. (Please correct me if I am wrong)

I'd rather not, in particular since sometimes it may be hard to 
separate the two (when you use classes as instances). What is gained by 
the separation here (given that examples are tiny)?
