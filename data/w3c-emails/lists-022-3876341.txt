Alan,

It's actually approach 4 -- I had a typo at  "Considerations".

Of course. Fixed.

Yes, you are right.

I am not sure the use of "prototype" here in the explanation is all 
that confusing and clashes with the "prototypes: as you talk about it. 
However, it's one more of those words that has too much ingrained 
meaning and best be avoided. I like your rewording suggestion and have 
incorporated it
