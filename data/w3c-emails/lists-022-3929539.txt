Sorry to lag behind, but that are indeed interesting patterns
and by coincidence I happened to work on some similar internal
stuff to model reference values for diagnostic measurements...
While trying to use your N3 examples straight from the web, we
found an obstructing first line i.e.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
and maybe it's also better to have for instance
@prefix : <http://a.com/ontology/diagnosis#> .
Anyhow, our tests that way succeeded and you do a great job :)
