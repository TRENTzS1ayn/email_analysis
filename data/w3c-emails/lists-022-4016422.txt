hi all,

After discussing the possible direction of the taskforce with a few
people offline, and given the lack of response to my prvious message on
the topic[1] I suggest that we start with a list of applications and
demos such as the one Guus just sent[2].

As a template I suggest

TITLE
URL
AUTHOR(S)
INSTITUTION(S)
DATE
DESCRIPTION

and this can perhaps evolve as we gather more data.

If this is acceptable, the only real question is where to put the
information. One option is the W3C site somewhere, although this means
that it might take a while to get people who want to contribute
applications and demos logins.

My preferred option is to use the ESW weblog[3]. This weblog is
currently used for the SWAD-Europe project, but there's no reason why
its use could not be broadened to the working group - especially since
after SWAD-Europe ends in October it will not be used at all as it
stands, and since the goals of SWBLD are very close to those of
SWAD-Europe. The weblog is hosted on the W3C site.

Using the weblog would mean that people could quickly be given logins
to contribute, and would also give us a flexible templating format if we
wanted to try (for example) making the data available as RDF or OWL. We
could have a particular category of applications and demos which could
hold the things we are interested in (as we do for FAQs[4]).

What do you think?

Libby
