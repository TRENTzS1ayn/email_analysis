Dear all,

We are now some two-and-a-half months into the process and it would be 
good to start delivering our first results to the public. I'd like each 
coordinator of active TFs to make clear at the telecon what the 
short-term plans should be. I really like to see a number of different 
things coming out before/during/after the summer.

Guus
