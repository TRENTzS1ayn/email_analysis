I refer to the code of the "application" that has to compute annotations based on the OWL code for the examples. 
As readers don't visualize yet a general/typical SWA architecture, for each example, they have to "write" in their mind the piece of application that compute annotations to be sure to understand the real impact of each approach and to evaluate the real meaning of words/sentences like "Applications using this representation can directly access the information", or "will need to be aware of this appraoch",  or "A general-purpose reasoner will not be able to use this information directly" etc in order to choose, according too this particular point and their own constraints, the best solution.
I 'm going to try to be clearer. In [1] i tried to build a very simple typical SWA architectural use case, (for me the use case which will probably be the most widely "used" or "implemented" in the SW area) : what can be the architecture of a typical SWA dealing with annotations, which is, i think, the  implicit/underlying  use case in the note. (Note : this figure is based on a figure i have found in a french thesis). The main idea, and i have presented this idea to the internal readers who have been interested, is that it could be very useful to include  such a figure in the note and for each approach to give the piece of code from the ApplicationSpecificCode Box which is related to the approach described. [Note : is this figure correct ?]
Note : I'm not sure if this figure has to be included in this note or in an other [ADTF ?] but people think that this approach could be very very fruitful for them and will help them a lot to really understand the meaning of the considerations. [Note : perhaps that it could be interesting to have such very simple figures for each identified use case s for SWA in the AD note.
The note could be divided in as many sections/chapter as identified use cases whom the general architecture could be presented in introduction and concrete applications cooresponding to the use case could illustrate it.
For all the other considerations in each approach, which are not SW specifics points from their point of view,  they take them as normal or typical design choices they already have encountered in other contexts and so the don't want/or feel the need to discuss them. The general feeling, from what i could understand,  is that people want only to focus on points very specific to the SW that can be summed up with :
                                - the illustrated description of the concret level of complexity and reliability of my application according the kind of the reasoner i will use.
Thanks a lot 
Best regards

Marco, 
Thanks a lot for getting the feedback from practitioners -- I think it

Hmm.. That's a valid point, although I am not sure how to address it. 
The difference here is that if you look at the value of dc:subject in 
Approach 1, there is a direct subclass relationship (with well-defined 
and generally-known semantics) between the values of the property. In 
approach 2, there is no such direct relation. Perhaps putting this 
somewhere more explicitly would make the case better. What do you 
think?

I am not really qualified to take up the argument what type of 
reasoners do, and, more important, will exist. I do believe that there 
is more to the world than just DL reasoners though. I could  easily see 
a simple OWL Full reasoner that can do the reasoning along the lines of 
approach 1, reasoning with classes as values. It will not reason about 
everything in OWL Full (or even be a superset of an OWL DL reasoner), 
but to say that OWL Full reasoners don't exist is misleading. I think, 
for example, that  a rule-based system such as Jess can reason about 
classes as values and classes as instances without much trouble (and 
the JessTab plugin for Protege works fine with OWL ontologies) while 
not being able to do classification. So, you may want to clarify this 
point to your users, but it's probably outside the scope of this note.

Actually, I think that at the moment, most if not all DL classifiers 
will simply reject an OWL Full ontology (I could be wrong on this point 
and would welcome examples of DL reasoners that would prove me wrong).

I don't quite understand which code you refer to here. There is 
complete OWL code for the examples in the note (in three different 
formats). Are you talking about something else.

I am not sure you need a separate task force on this. Doesn't it fall 
under OEP? Someone could certainly write such a note. Alan suggested in 
an earlier message (sorry, don't have a reference since I am working 
off-line now) to do just that.

I would suggest they take a look at the OWL Plugin for Protege 
(protege.stanford.edu). You can have it flag all the things that are 
out of the DL case. It will also do conversion fort some of the cases 
(as the use of classes as instances), mostly by stripping out the 
offending statements. It will not do conversion for FULL-ness of 
approach one though, for a good reason: just stripping out the values 
may be very unwelcome and there is no single root to take to put it in 
the DL (at least 4 :) More conversion options may work in the future.

Ah -- excellent question (I am sure Alan would want to chime in if he 
ever gets this far in this message). The simple answer is "no". A 
single property that has a class as its value for a single individual 
will make your ontology OWL Full. You can try to partition your 
ontology putting all the Lite/DL stuff in one ontology, then importing 
it (owl:imports) to another ontology that would introduce OWL Full 
stuff. You can then use a DL reasoner on your first ontology, while 
still having the advantage of non-DL-ness of the latter. What we really 
need is a good tool support to make doing these kinds of things easier.

The n-ary not may have been somewhat premature to show outside the TF.
