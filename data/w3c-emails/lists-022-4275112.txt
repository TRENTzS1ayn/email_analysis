I've had a go at expressing the ideas I had about a different spin for this
document.  The words aren't flowing very freely, and the graphics certainly
are not, but I hope there is enough here for folks to see where I'm headed
and come to a view as to whether it is worthwhile.

I've taken a few liberties with the text, for which I hope Natasha will
forgive me.  I don't feel strongly about these, they are just illustrative.

However, it is worth reading the abstract and the introduction to get an
idea of how I'm suggesting reframing the purpose of the document.

Thinking of the task in this way, led me to the the key claim I am making,
that we can automatically translate between the natural approach using
classes as values and the (I think) preferred approach for OWL DL.

Thus I am suggesting:

1) We should define properties that describe the relationship between the
RDFS and DL approaches.

2) We should recommend an approach, so that folks who just want a quick
answer to "How should I do ..." don't have to work too hard

3) More controversially, we should recommend in general, the classes as
values approach on the grounds of simplicity, suggesting automatic
transformation to a form suitable for processing by a DL reasoner if that is
required.

I am filling sandbags as you read this.

When unzipped, you want the *-bwm-v5 version of the document.
