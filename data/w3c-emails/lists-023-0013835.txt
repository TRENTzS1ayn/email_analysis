Hi,

It's nice to see progress on the Time text spec's, I feel there is a 
missed opportunity to make Timed text more than a captioning format, not 
that captioning isn't important. If TT also could provide fading in and 
out, the text can be used like an image or sound in presentation, it can 
be another expressive media element.

This is an previously posted example from the old TT mailing list:
(HTML+SMIL for IE 6, about a minute long and 1MB, preloaded)

Now the same presentation without fading:

http://www.geocities.com/ramirez_j2001/test3/poem/html_smil_example-nf.html

If linking were added, Timed text can be used to jump to other parts of 
the document or any other resource on the web. It would be a real web 
language, without the 'A' element it's a neutered language.

Good luck all,
Jose Ramirez
