I agree it is worth considering fade transitions. I have received input
from a number of sources that have suggested this as a requirement as well.

Regards,
Glenn

Now the same presentation without fading:

http://www.geocities.com/ramirez_j2001/test3/poem/html_smil_example-nf.html

If linking were added, Timed text can be used to jump to other parts of 
the document or any other resource on the web. It would be a real web 
language, without the 'A' element it's a neutered language.

Good luck all,
Jose Ramirez
