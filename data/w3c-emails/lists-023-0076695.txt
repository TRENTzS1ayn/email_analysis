PLEASE BOYCOTT ALL FRENCH PRODUCTS!

Please refrain from purchasing any French products:

We ask that you assist in spreading this message to all your friends and
family, this action may seem extreme at first, however as this month
unfolds, a boycott of all French products will seem to be more of an
American duty then an outlandish attack.

Thank you for your time,
-The Anti-France Campaign
