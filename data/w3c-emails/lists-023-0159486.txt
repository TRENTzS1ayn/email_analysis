Haven't gone over the draft yet, but wanted to reply to the bitmap topic
raised.

Bitmaps may be preferred on some renderers, but I think it may be
counterproductive to treat the text as "alt" or optional, since many
prevalent renderers (including closed captioning, SAMI and quite a few
subtitling devices I've run across) don't have capability for embedded (or
any) bitmaps.  One constituency we're trying to help with timed *text* can
end up being visually impaired folks who are using Braille readers.  Text is
also nicer if one is going to try and co-opt TT data for indexing/library
purposes.  This isn't to say I'm anti-bitmap or anything, just that there
might be some benefit to keeping the emphasis on text capabilities.
Probably just being paranoid...

<http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-tt-af-1-0-req-20030515/> has not been included
here, pending further consideration of whether and what intellectual
property rights management (IPRM) related metadata to explicitly support in
the TT AF.

The inclusion of some form of rights and accessrights information is
IMHO very important. Also of concern is the need to protect the intellectual
property of the content. Speaking only wrt subtitle files - these are costly
to produce - and many users regard a subtitle file as a significant asset.
The inclusion of rights metadata does not protect the content from
unscrupulous exploitation. Is there a means by which the content of the file
(by which I mean the Timing / Style and Text) might be encrypted - whilst
leaving the metadata in the clear? 

Please propoes specific meta data items and their value syntax and
semantics to serve the needs you feel are important.
