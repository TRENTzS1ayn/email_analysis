I am not entirely sure what you mean by orthogonally here, my main concern
is that TTAF does not preclude the use of Rights information. Rather, I
would advocate that TTAF makes a strong positive statement regarding the
inclusion of Rights information in TTAF files.

with respect to:

<SNIP>

I am certainly not qualified to suggest which of any number of schemes for
inclusion of Rights information would be appropriate. I suggest that given
the desire to make TTAF applicable across a broad range of text based
activities, choosing a single scheme would NOT be the correct approach to
take. I would not advocate for example the enforcement of ONLY RDF.

This seems to be a common theme...
