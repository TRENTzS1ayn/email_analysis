Review of Action Items

DS requests that the WG members send suggested resources to the list.


Review of Issues (only those which generated discussion):

I-1: Whether to support conditional constructions (e.g., switch)?

DS, MH, GF voice support for conditional constructions


I-3: Whether to support non-flowed text, flowed text, or both?

Some discussion. No conclusion - open


I-4: Should we support both intrinsic and extrinsic text? i.e., text
internal and/or external to TT document(s)?

General consensus to support both, but more discussion needed.


I-5: How to handle highlighting? [N.B. See A-9]

MH: working on proposal. XPointer (now a rec) will be in proposal.

I-6: Whether to support writing-mode and unicode-bidi?

General consensus, Yes

DS: but concern when I-3 is considered... can be hard to do when
supporting text flow.


I-7: Whether to support excl/priorityClass?

TM: in SMIL

GF: useful for extended audio description
