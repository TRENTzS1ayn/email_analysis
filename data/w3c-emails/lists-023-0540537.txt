Hi,

There's a lot going into TTAF, to have better sense of what the profiles 
will be like, can the WG provide some examples of TTAF code?
Especially interested in what the basic profile consist of. It would be
great to see something small, that can be fully implemented next year :)

Even though it'll be a W3C note, it could become a de facto standard if
a lot people use it and if TT could be used inline as part of a SMIL 2.0 
file, that would be 'vintage W3C' simple and popular :)


Good Luck,
Jose Ramirez
