Glenn, 
As requested - some diagrams to illustrate the proposed temporal fill
attributes. These are NOT real world examples - but are intended to give an
idea of how I would anticipate these attributes to affect the display of
Timed Text content.
I believe that these proposed attributes are required for any 'relaxed'
profile for Timed Text. It is obvious that all of the effects I describe in
the attached documents might be produced by extensive use of selection
mechanisms and XSL/CSS style attributes. However IMHO this would be an
extremely onerous task and, even if performed automatically by an authoring
tool, would probably create very large output files.
Attachments: 
Three diagrammatic files showing the impact of the proposed attributes;
temporal fill direction, temporal fill mode and temporal block clear mode.
Apologies for MS format - but it does allow an easy representation of what
should appear on the display area.

 <<Fill direction.doc>>  <<temporal fill mode.doc>>  <<temporal block clear
mode.doc>>
