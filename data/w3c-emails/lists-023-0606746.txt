************************************************************************
Agenda
************************************************************************

1. Test Suites
2. Meta-Data Follow-Up
3. Review Input from Roberto Scano
4. Action Item Review
5. Upcoming F2F Planning

************************************************************************
1. Test Suites
************************************************************************

[TM] Reviews test suite scenarios. Suggests a lighter track process than
was done with RDF, to publish 2 public documents: TT test suite, TT impl
and interop report. For each module, a set of tests, for each test an
association of an assertion (expected behavior) and optional graphic
(png or svg). Another doc would be implementation report based on test
suite; goal is that all features are implemented. For each feature, at
least two implementations must implement. Included in email references
to work done on SMIL in this area.

[GA] Describes distinction between testing behavior at DF and AF layers.

[TM] Describes intent of test suites as mechanism for providing
assurance to W3M that technical specification is coherent,
implementable,
and implemented.

Resolution: In the specification, provide two pieces of information for
each feature: (1) a fragment of a sample document that demonstrates
expression of feature, and (2) a hyperlink to either a fully worked out
test document or another descriptive document that describes test
document
and points to test document.

Action: [*] For module owners, start developing test suite documents
that have feature tests in all necesary context, and no superfluous
context. Follow-on for primary spec editor will be to incorporate
fragments
from these cases, but that will be subsequent to publishing first
internal
draft of integrated spec.

************************************************************************
2. Review Descriptive Vocabulary [DK]
************************************************************************

[DK] Reviews work on metadata items.

[DK] Asks [GF] about "caption". Need to distinguish between open and
closed. Visualizes after start of program, captions are created from
text; where would you markup text as being "closed" caption?

[DK] Mentions example of referring to another caption file as source
used to create TT.

[GA] Suggests being handled through application specific metadata.

[GF] Withdraw email comment.

[DK] How far do we go with marking up open captions, i.e., burned in
text, e.g., title, credits, ...?

[GA] Suggests something very general.

[GA] Suggests attributes for each descriptive metadata item, in its own
namespace (http://www.w3.org/YYYY/MM/tt-af-1-0#metadata), such as:

ttm:caption
ttm:action

(1) need to define syntactic formulation, proposal here is use global
attributes, in TT metadata namespace;

(2) need to define set of initial attributes;

(3) need to define elts to which they apply and are semantically
relevant; need to define which layers apply (LF, PF, NF), need to
say if semantically relevant at one level but not another;

(4) need to define attribute value spaces and semantics for each
attribute value;

Action: [DK] to propose set of DM attributes and provide one paragraph
description for each DM attribute. Begin of process of defining value
spaces for each attribute.

[GF] Re: kinesic, isn't sure where it is useful for foreign language
subtitles to have description of actions. However, there are some
contexts where this might be useful for accessibility reasons.

************************************************************************
3. Discuss Input from Roberto Scano
************************************************************************

[GA] Asks for volunteers to review and make proposal. None at this time.

*** RESOLUTIONS ***

Resolution: In the specification, provide two pieces of information for
each feature: (1) a fragment of a sample document that demonstrates
expression of feature, and (2) a hyperlink to either a fully worked out
test document or another descriptive document that describes test
document
and points to test document.

*** OPEN ACTION ITEMS ***

Action: [SH] Will investigate use of media queries in this context and
report back.

Action: [DS with help of Paul Nelson and Peter Lofting] Write RFC to
register appropriate opentype/truetype font types as MIME media types,
suggest model of "application/font-<font-type-name>", e.g.,
"application/font-truetype".

Action: [GA] Make proposal regarding use of Xlink vocabulary or
"src" attribute.

Action: [GF] Investigate whether to use IRIs instead of URIs?
Note: XPointer and Namespaces in 1.1 use IRIs?

Action: [SH] Investigate use of "role" vs "class" attribute.

Action: [GF] Investigate mechanism for cascading
semantics and whether to support cascading on either or both
logical and presentation flowed vocabularies.

Action: [GA] Draft new requirement on "Integrability"
in general terms that should not impact testing or implementation
requirements.

Action: [GA] incorporate agreed changes into TT-AF-1-0-REQ in
preparation for publishing final W3C Note.

Action: [SH] will review and propose subset of aural parameters
(see R305).

Action: [GA] Add figure showing logical structure anticipated
by requirements.

Action: [GA] Add note to R217 and R219 that shows use of data: URI
scheme.

Action: [TM] Find out if xpointer() scheme WD [1] is still being
progressed forward.

[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-xpointer/#document-order-notation

Action: [SH] to propose subset with extensions for use in CS
Profile.

Action: [GA]/[GF] investigate syntax for regions vis-a-vis style.

Action: [DK] To write up short paragraph on uses of
role tokens. Suggest removing or adding as he
progresses.

Action: [TM] to propose and define standard MD attributes.

Action: [*] Think about standard MD items (and write something
down and send to list so we can think about it too).

Action: [GA] Need to start planning for June meeting in Japan!

Action: [GA] Post edited draft minutes for previous F2F (02/04)
for review.

Action: [TM] consult with W3C Legal to determine whether requirements
exist to explicitly obtain disclosure from past and current public
comments that have resulted in requirements, etc., specifically,
requirement R307. Note that this question is in regard to current
TTWG status under CPP.

Action: [TM] review test suites developed by RDF WG, which focused on
authorial intent, to see if some concepts and methodology can be
reused in TTWG context.

Action: [TM] Will research CR exit criteria and make proposal.

Action: [SH] to draft standard ready text for subset of xquery.

Action: [GA] post example file to member reflector.

Action: [DS] Based on email of 01/14, integrate with fillBehavior as
described in example.

Action: [SH] make proposal regarding keeping or removing float style
parameters.

Action: [*] For module owners, start developing test suite documents
that have feature tests in all necesary context, and no superfluous
context. Follow-on for primary spec editor will be to incorporate
fragments
from these cases, but that will be subsequent to publishing first
internal
draft of integrated spec.

Action: [DK] to propose set of DM attributes and provide one paragraph
description for each DM attribute. Begin of process of defining value
spaces for each attribute.

*** OPEN ISSUES ***

Issue: Whether to use XLink vocabulary, e.g., as used consistently by
SVG, or use "src" attribute as apparently will be done in XHTML2?

Issue: Whether to use IRIs instead of URIs? Note: XPointer and
Namespaces in 1.1 use IRIs?

Issue: Should we use "class" instead of "role"?

Issue: Probably want to permit in logical content mode the selection of
content based on generic XML features of non-TT namespace descriptive
markup, e.g., for applying style and timing semantics, in which case an
appropriate TT container element shall be implied based on nearest
ancestor TT namespace element.

Issue: Need to think about cascading semantics; how to express, how to
apply, etc. Possibly use CSS semantics here as well.

Issue (2004-03-05): Whether to allow block as immediate child of
inline? N.B. XSL-FO does allow this. [GA] showed example of renmoji
(horizontal block in vertical Japanese lines).
