Guido,

The Timed-Text WG Charter is linked from the TT public home page in the
"Current public documents" section.
http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/

The Timed-Text WG Charter is available at
http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/ttcharter20020901.html


For more visibility I have now added a new link to the charter on the TT
public home page
http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/Group

Hope tis helps,

Thierry MICHEL
W3C/ERCIM
