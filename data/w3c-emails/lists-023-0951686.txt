2. Review of New Draft of TT-AF-1-0-REQ
************************************************************************

[EH] Suggests adding a note under Figure 1 that indicates that user
agents would appear to the right of the distribution format lines.

[GA] Add a note under Figure 1 indicating that transcoding from
distribution formats to TT AF is outside the scope of this model.
However,
it is expected that TT ASs will likely be able to accept input from
some distribution formats.

[DS] Points out that TT AF may not cover feature set of distribution
format. [GA] Add note pointing out that there may be features that
can be expressed in TT AF that are not supported in a given distribution
format and vice-versa.

Resolution: Accept redlines and these final changes to produce a second
public WD for a 30 day public review and then proceed to W3C Working
Group Note.

[GA] Describes "display" property in R505 at request from [DK].
