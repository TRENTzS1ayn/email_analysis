Yes finding prior art is extremely prudent.  Presumably Microsoft has
already done this search.

My defintion of a browser is a program that displays a file on a
computer screen.  

The patent also talks about hypermedia documents which sounds like files
that contain clickable links in them.

When it comes to patents, its important to use very broad definitions
for terms.  Microsoft Word for example could be considered a browser.
People often use Word to read files that people send them.  Many times
these files are supplied across a network from a file server to a client
computer which is running Word.  As a side benefit, Word even allows
people to change the files they are browsing. ;-) 

So it might be possible to find a word processor program to overturn the
'906 patent.  Does anyone know of a word processor that was on the
market before Oct. 17, 1994 (or better yet, before Oct. 17, 1993) that
supported embedded files?

HI Richard,

Let me ask you, does this patent (or software patents in general) cover
just
the platform or the specific client technology claimed.  It specifically
mentioned browsers.   But will it cover GUI clients that are not
exclusive
to browser activity and offers the similar technology?

Like I said, the idea of "hitting a tag" regardless of the language, to
install,  load and  activate a process on a remote client machine has
been
around since the 80s.   Security issues restricted its progress until
Microsoft opened Pandora's box with OLE.

If the patent is broad and encapsulates all products and systems
regardless
of platform, server software or client software, then there is a
conflict
for many existing systems, old or new.  From my standpoint,  an
opportunity
to present prior art is prudent.

Sincerely,
