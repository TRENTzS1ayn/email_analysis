Had a quick email with Richard on this one...  Here is a question I had...

Is the loophole not .NET and Java here?

You load up a document, fine, run the app fine, find an external 
reference and then KICK OFF AN EXECUTABLE.

If the browser is written in pure .NET or pure Java and the object that 
is kicked off is pure .NET and pure Java then it is not an executable 
application.  Why?  Because Java and .NET do not posses the concept of 
an executable.  Two Java or .NET "executables" can run in the same 
process.  (That is why people have to be careful with statics since one 
app can reference the static of another app.)
