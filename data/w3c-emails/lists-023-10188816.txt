Hi Richard,

Then in my opinion, it makes the patent weaker because it forces the
inclusion of other similar systems or art that have existed well before
their patent filing.   This is not just Microsoft's problem but the entire
industry, including those who are not bent on using Microsoft methods.

Someone missed the boat here.  A good lawyer with good broad experienced
technical expertise or witnesses across the entire spectrum of what Steve
Jobs called in late 80s "The New Era of Inter-Personal Computing" would make
this an easy appeal.

And speaking of Steve Jobs, what about all the late 90s Next
Machine/Software with all its Hypertext, Embedded/Integrated
system/networking technology it had?

Sincerely,

Hector Santos, CTO
