Just to be clear about MS's dominance in the browser market, here are the
stats for about two weeks from my web site, which has nothing to do with
computers (aside from being a web site), and fully complies with current
HTML standards, and as such should introduce no browser bias.


Browser                    Hits          %
------------------------------------------
MS Internet Explorer     564540     95.2 %
Netscape                  15180      2.5 %
Mozilla                    5368      0.9 %
OmniWeb                    3778      0.6 %
Safari                     1602      0.2 %
Opera                       605      0.1 %
WebTV browser               504        0 %
Unknown                     401        0 %
Firebird                    299        0 %
Konqueror                   106        0 %
Others                       93        0 %


Note 1: The IE figure above includes all versions, including Mac versions.
IE6 for Windows consists of 74.4% of our hits, IE5.5 15%, and we see hits
from versions as early as 3.0.

Note 2: No, I have no idea what the difference between "Unknown" and
"Others" is.  I blame my web stat analyzer.


Anyway, the point is that the dominance evident above means that whatever MS
does with their browser, the other browser developers will be forced to
follow suit, or they will alienate their users.
