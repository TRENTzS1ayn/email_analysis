i disagree..the websites me and my wife take care of were at first made 
in FP2k..however i went in and turned off all the ms proprietary

moving to Amaya....we design to W#C standards..not to MS's whims..

May God Bless you and everything you touch.

My "foundation" verse: 
Isaiah 54:17 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.
