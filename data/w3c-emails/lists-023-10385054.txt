If we can assume that the XML and XSLT support is built into a browser,
then I don't believe there is a problem.  INAL, YMMV, etc.

Another interesting question does the use of the <script src=> tag ever
get into trouble with Eolas patent.  Part the answer to this question is
if the JavaScript interpreter is considered part of the browser or if it
is an external program.

Thank you for correcting my assumption Richard,

I guess it shows that I haven't spent much time with Java :-)

Any thoughts on my question about embedded XML and external calls to
other
XML and XSL/XSLT?
