Thank you Richard, I hear ya.

MSIE does have an optional method for client-side Databinding that uses an
<OBJECT/> tag, but I use the Microsoft extension with the HTML <XML/> tag -
much simpler and better functionality.

The MSDN literature often refers to the <XML/> tag as an "embedded Data
Island". Through this dynamic XML and XSLT is possible. Until more
information comes out, I'm a little concerned.

And your question about the <SCRIPT/> tag is a good one too. I often do the
following, where I call dynamic generated JavaScript (JScript) code:

<SCRIPT ID="dynamic_code" SRC="myapp.aspx?_function=specialcode"></SCRIPT>

And using JScript, dynamically make more calls for dynamic code to the
server from an HTML page through the <SCRIPT/> tag, something like:

---SCRIPT----
function make_call(new_argument){
dynamic_code.src = 'myapp.aspx?_function=' + new_argument;
}
---/SCRIPT----

And then there is dynamic objects on a page with "new ActiveXObject()" via
JScript. I'm curious about the interpretation here too.

The list just goes on and on doesn't it?
