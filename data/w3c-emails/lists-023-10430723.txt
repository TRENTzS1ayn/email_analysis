Please carefully re-read my letter to you... I said Viola was 
demonstrated in smaller settings, but before your demo. The applets 
stuff was demo'ed to whomever wanted to see it and had visited our 
office at O'Reilly & Associates (where I worked at the time).

This is what I wrote on the VRML list:

That date (May 93), at least, predates your demo if I'm not mistaken. 
Then around August 93, it was shown to a bunch of attendees at the 
first Web Conference in Cambridge. So, it was shown, just not with 
lots of publicity and noise.

I'm sure I could find more evidence if I spent/waste the time of digging
thru archives.

If you're talking about any display code transferred over network,
look at a number of predating systems, including say net-transmitted 
postscript (NeWS).

For transmitted interactive applications, even the early Viola
(started around 88, relased 1991) had a viola-app net transfer tool
(the idea is to have something like a Hypercard like environment
on the scale of the net). 

If you're talking about interactive apps *specifically* on the web, ie
applets in-lined into HTML documents etc, and with bi-directional 
communications, then look at ViolaWWW as it existed around late '92 
early '93.
