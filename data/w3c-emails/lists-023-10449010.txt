I'm curious, if Microsoft links the .NET VM into the next version of IE and 
runs it as an IE thread do they stop infringing the patent?  If so I imagine 
they may actually be quite happy about this ruling, behind closed doors, and 
perhaps they aren't trying very hard to find prior art to overturn the 
patent.  If browser plugins are outlawed it does substantially more harm to 
Microsoft's competitors than it does to Microsoft as long as Microsoft builds 
the dominant browser.

Assuming they can switch to builtin's instead of plugin's it will mean they 
can pick and choose which plugins will live and die following this decision.   
.NET will be builtin and survive.  Java wont unless a court compells it.  
This solution will lead to bloat in IE so they will plea they can't build in 
every plugin so they will have to pick and choose.  Windows Media player will 
be builtin and Real and Quicktime wont.   It would seem to be an ideal way 
for Microsoft to dispose of some troublesome Internet competitors and they 
can say "The judge made us do it".

Doing away with ActiveX plugins will certainly cause turmoil especially for 
all the corprate Intranet users relying on custom ActiveX plugins but I 
imagine Microsoft would be overjoyed to have them compelled to move to .NET 
anyway, with Eolas and the courts playing the heavy.  Getting rid of ActiveX 
is a big plus form them for security reasons alone.

Microsoft and Macromedia could cut a deal to convert Flash to a builtin if 
both were willing.  If they aren't Microsoft would presumabky push SVG or 
some new proprietary vector graphics standard in .NET. 

With this approach Microsoft will also acquire a great deal more power over 
the ISV's they vet for builtin's since they will set the release schedule and 
can threaten to drop a builtin if, for example, an ISV becomes too friendly 
to competing platforms.
