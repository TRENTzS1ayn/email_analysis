I wouldn't jump to the conclusion yet that my previous post is valid at least 
as far as .NET goes.  There is a key assumption in it that isn't proven.  It 
could be even if a Java or .NET VM is built in to the browser the patent 
still encumbers the Java or CLR applets that it runs.  If it does then 
Microsoft will be very unhappy since .NET is inherently infringing. Of course 
so is Java, Actionscript and every data format that has control information 
built in to it.   You would think, since Microsoft's known about this patent 
all during .NET's design, that they would have a loophole to keep it in the 
clear though.  I would have thought they designed .NET primarily for the day 
when ActiveX plugins might be disallowed by this patent.

Whatever happens with .NET, I'm sure Microsoft is cool with switching things 
like media players to builtins though.

If my conjectures are correct I'm sure hoping Eolas will collect their half 
billion dollar check from Microsoft, sign over their patent to W3C and retire 
to a nice island someplace before Microsoft uses it as a tool to eliminate 
competing plugins.
