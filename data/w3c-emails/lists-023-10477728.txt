At FidoCon 1990 held in New Jersey that year,  I demonstrated 'Gold Xpress'
to a crowd of 3-4 hundred who were at awed at the potential technology.

Gold Xpress was the next step up to our Silver Xpress product line which was
a offline mail reader system.

Gold Xpress combined Silver Xpress with telecommunications and a special
tag-based instruction language that allowed TEXT based terminal to provide
GRAPHICAL display of data.  Plotting histograms, pie charts was used as part
of the demo.

Google "FidoCon"  for more information.

Google a direct search for "FidoCon"  and "New Jersey" and "Hector" and you
will find:

Silver Xpress was developed in 1983/84.

Gold Xpress was developed in 1989 (and I was not the only one doing this),
but among the first to demonstrate it at a large trade show such as FidoCon.
GX never got of the ground because of the "dependency" of the BBS hosting
system to support it and the dearth of "WYSIWYG" tools.   It looked for
venture, but it never materialized.  The concept was too new and the
bandwidth of communications was still low.   However, the whole POINT of the
system was "off-load storage/caching" of applets and images/data,  which I
recall IBM has a patent on.

(side note, and incidentally,  Platinum Xpress  (get it? silver gold,
platinum) was developed in 1993/94, and had plans for a new product called
TX (Titanium Xpress) when I eventually brought the Wildcat! BBS/Intranet for
Windows product line.  The Xpress line of products were no longer that
important.)

Also,   Gold Xpress was re-demonstrated in One BBSCON 94 in Tampa, Florida.
One BBSCON started in 1992 (maybe 1993?) as an attempt to "professionalized"
and exploit the emerging BBS, communications and networking market.  It was
headed by Jack Richard of BoardWatch.   Many of the big boys attended these
shows, including Microsoft,  IBM, Novell, US Robotics, etc.

Google Gold Xpress and you will find a aug/94 report by wife,  she was one
my first users of Gold Xpress.

What is important here is Galacticomm with their World Group system.  I
believe they demonstrated "remote client applets" capability at these
earlier ONE BBSCON shows (which I did not attend).   So more research here
can probably show pre March 1993 prior art.
