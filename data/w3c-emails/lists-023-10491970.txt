This is really got me worried.  I am wondering if someone can help me see if
my system is effected by this Eolas patent:

We have a GUI Frontend system called wcNAV ("Wildcat! Navigator") for our
WINSERVER (Wildcat! Interactive Net Server) client/server hosting system .

WINSERVER allows for

- PPP dialing
- Direct RS232 Dialing
- FTP connectivity
- EMAIL
- Telnet
- Web

etc, etc.     It centralizes a user database,  file database and mail
database so regardless of how you connect,  the object security model
presents the same access capabilities to the users.

WcNAV is a Windows based applications which system admins to give to their
end-users.   Optionally, they can prepare a customized "Splash Screen" and
they can lock the Connect Dial Address book to specific entries.

WcNAV allows for connection methods:

- RS232 Dialups
- Telnet Socket

The Dialup and Telnet communications are virtualized so it really doesn't
matter how they connect.

Once a connection is made, the Toolbar has:

TELNET ICON
WEB ICON
MAIL ICON
FILE ICON
CHAT (Instant Messaging) ICON
WHO IS ONLINE ICON
PROPERTIES ICON
(3rd party Icons installed by developers)

This toolbar is controlled by a SYSTEM component  which checks the host upon
connection for updated versions of each component.  In addition, each
component will communicate with the system component to perform a
installation and version check.

Each component is a separate Window Process and they all communicate with
the system component using OLE, Windows Messaging Events, etc.

WCNAV can stand on its own and does not need the WEB component.

However, if used,  the two are tightly integrated using a FILE ASSOCIATION
activation system.

For example, the same TOOL BAR can be presented as a HTML page:

<a href="/client?message.wcn">Messaging</a>
<a href="/client?file.wcn">Uploads/Downloads</a>
<a href="/client?chat.wcn">Chat Instant Messaging</a>
<a href="/client?who.wcn">Who is online</a>
<a href="/client?personal.wcn">Properties</a>

etc.

With the WCN extension,  our web server is smart enough to know how the user
logged in.  If he logged in via the WEB browser, the then HTML version of
these clients are presented.  If he logged in via wcNAV and is viewing a
HTML page to navigate a web site,  then the WCN will trigger the
corresponding client side module.  This is done via Windows File
Association.

File association:

    .wcn=wildcat-navigator_auto_file

File type definition:

    wildcat-navigator_auto_file=e:\wcnav\wildcat %1

So our unique client?xxxxx.WCN  url can be used for both HTML and WCNAV GUI
operations.

With our 3rd party Software development kit, developers can write additional
WcNAV client modules.  They are prepared for distribution using our special
tools on the server side.    When wcNAV connects, the system components
checks for the TOOLBAR layout and any new installation of new components.

If this or any part of it covered by the patent?

The only thing I see that is could be covered by the patent is our HTML
version of the CHAT.WCH client which uses JAVA applet send to the user's
machine in HTML mode.

All our other HTML clients do not use embedded technology but instead our
version of "CLR" called Wildcat! BASIC which our version of CLR to define
the central client/server operation of the system.

Anyone interested in visually seeing it in action to get a better feel, can
download the wcNAV from:

        http://www.winserver.com

install it on your machine.  I believe it already has a connection entry for
our Support site, but if not, use online.winserver.com as a TELNET (WINSOCK)
connection type.

and then one of the following accounts to login:

userid: GUEST  password GUEST
userid: GUEST1  password GUEST1
userid: GUEST2  password GUEST2

What I want you to see is the "home page" that is popped up when you
connect. If it doesn't automatically start your browser, then click on the
BROWSER icon on the toolbar.  Notice how you can activate any of the wcNAV
GUI components either directly via the wcNAV toolbar  or via the home page
HTML menu corresponding to the same actions with the WCN extensions.

If you like, you can directly connect via the BROWSER to see the HTML
versions of these clients.  The CHAT module is the only one using JAVA.

Comments?
