I notice that the Microsoft "Information for Developers about Changes to
Internet Explorer" page is still saying this:
"Early next calendar year, Microsoft expects that new computers and retail
purchases of Microsoft Windows XP will have this behavior. Microsoft also
expects that new service packs of Windows XP and Internet Explorer will have
this behavior starting after that."
http://msdn.microsoft.com/ieupdate/

Does anyone have a feeling for whether this is actually likely to happen
before the pending legal action is settled?

If Microsoft does release significant numbers of the modified Internet
Explorer, it seems to me that developers are going to have to apply the
workarounds, even if the patent ruling in favour of Eolas is later reversed.
