Hello,

  The HTML Patent Advisory Group (PAG) [1] met on 5 December 2003.
  Fourteen people attended.

  Participants from Pennie & Edmonds and the PAG reviewed what is
  known about the legal proceedings. A clarification was made that
  Internet Explorer is not shipping with changes for the '906
  patent. Microsoft has shipped a developer version, not an official
  version, with modifications.

  Two upcoming dates were mentioned: 60 days are allowed to Eolas to
  respond to the USPTO '906 patent reexamination; the hearing for
  Microsoft's motion is approximately 12 December 2003.

  The PAG then decided again that review of the HTML specification
  is not necessary at this time. After discussion, the PAG requested
  from Microsoft a copy for the W3C of Microsoft's documentation
  that explains their proposed changes to HTML in the case that
  Internet Explorer is modified for the Eolas patent.

  The PAG reviewed the need to continue to search for prior art, and
  decided to proceed with a prior art compilation in the background.
  The group discussed scheduling and agreed to meet next on
  19 December.
