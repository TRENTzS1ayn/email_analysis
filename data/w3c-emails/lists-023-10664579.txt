Macromedia has already applied the necessary changes to their site, but  
I notice neither Apple nor Real has made the change.  Last time I  
checked, neither Microsoft property; microsoft.com or msn.com have made  
the change, either.

A partial change-list document for the upcoming Service Pack 2 for  
WinXP doesn't offer anything on the subject, at least not after my  
cursory reading of it except perhaps noting that this is not a complete  
listing of expected changes:
