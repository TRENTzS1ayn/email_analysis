Noting that nearly every Web user today relies on plug-in applications, the W3C fired 
off a passionate letter to the USPTO arguing that Eolas has no right to a patent that 
restricts access to the technology.

think of Microsoft's patent application for 'Displaying Plug-in Supplied Content 
in a Browser-Embedded Window', which the USPTO made public earlier this month?
