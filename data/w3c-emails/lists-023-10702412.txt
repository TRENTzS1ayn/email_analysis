When I looked over this pending Microsoft patent, I couldn't see where it
would be used.  Does anyone have some ideas of the application of this
particular patent?

Noting that nearly every Web user today relies on plug-in applications, the
W3C fired 
off a passionate letter to the USPTO arguing that Eolas has no right to a
patent that 
restricts access to the technology. 

So what does the W3C Patent Advisory Group (including its two Microsoft
members), 
think of Microsoft's patent application for 'Displaying Plug-in Supplied
Content 
in a Browser-Embedded Window', which the USPTO made public earlier this
month?
