Regarding Eolas's patent I would like to say that the W3C should be 
ASHAMED of the acts they are taking to destroy 906.  We live in a 
country where innovation is the upmost importance and one of the few 
ways we protect and encourage intellectual property is with patents.  
How is anyone EVER going to be encouraged to think and come up with new 
ideas if they will be later invalidated.  If anyone of these companies 
or people patented or protected this idea first they would be acting 
the complete opposite.  906 patent has been decided and WE ALL have to 
move forward.  We all will adapt.  If you are going to find prior art 
or another loophole to make patent No. 5,838,906 invalid you should go 
through every other patent first and confirm there validity.  Every 
person knows of someone who came up with the invention way before it 
was patented.  Does that make every one of those patents invalid?  I 
suggest each of you think about all the innovations you ever dream up 
in your life meaning NOTHING.


Sincerely,
Harold Wray
