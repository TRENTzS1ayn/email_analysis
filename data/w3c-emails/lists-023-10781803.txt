I happen to be very proud of their acts :-) Eoloas destroyed '906
by ignoring the obivious. It was obivious at least Feb. '93 when I
wrote about loading QuickTime movies via TCP/IP in an future
XMosaic browser in the Compuserve Unix Forum.

Hate to burst your bubble there, but '906 is far from decided.

If an innovation ends up meaning NOTHING than it was never an
innovation to begin with. Inventors have long abused "loopholes" and
not the other way around as you suggest: much like moron's abusing
domain name registration. One abuse is to anticipate a company coming
to market with a new product by than applying for a broad patent that would
cover that product. The slimmy inventor than seeks all sorts of delays
so that he can hide his patent application from the true inventor
during his patent research to enable an infringement ambush later.

Then there is the inventors who use such broad and general descriptions
that could almost be applied to anything. So we need to be more concerned
with the process and merits of a patent rather than worrying about someone
losing a patent to prior art!
