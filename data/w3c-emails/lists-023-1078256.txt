February F2F: [GF1] has arranged for meeting rooms at WGBH in Boston, MA
USA for Feb. 4-6 meeting.  Will send hotel info to [TM] within the next
few days.

[GA] will reschedule June f2f for Tokyo.

TT-AF specification development: Initial draft deadline is 12/15/03.

[TM] has sent metadata draft to the group Web site.  Please review.

[GF1] has started writing examples for style module.

EH is getting started on timing module.

[GA] is making progress on content module.

[DK] is starting work on descriptive vocabulary/section R221.  [GA]:
suggests use ID and IDREF attributes to indicate character, scene,
shot, etc.  Might want to organize info in a manner similar to TEI
section on typeset for drama; perhaps TEI is a source for other
vocabulary.

Further discussion on R221: [GA]: TT-AF should define speicific
metadata.
i.e., make a reference to metadata that describes an actor, for
example.  We'll need metadata for this entity.  Need descriptive markup
for specific characteristics that will need to be defined in metadata.
Should we adopt existing language or write our own?

[DK]:  Unsure, will research.

[TM]:  Need hosting elements for our data.

[GA]:  Perhaps look at MPEG-7 vocabulary.  

[TM]:  Will look at MPEG 7; will coordinate with [DK].
