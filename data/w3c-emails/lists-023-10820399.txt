Hello,

Nine people attended the 31 October 2003 HTML Patent Advisory Group
(PAG) teleconference. First the group approved past meeting minutes and
reviewed reactions to the W3C briefing [1], filing [2] and letter [3].
The Chair suggested possible next steps for the PAG and asked for other
suggestions:

   *  Wait to see if the USPTO takes action.
   *  Gather and analyze other prior art.
   *  Invite Eolas to come to one of these meetings.
   *  Determine what would need to change in W3C specifications to make
      compliance with them not require a license.

The group decided that assembling prior art from the public-web-plugins
mailing list [4] is the next step and the Chair took an action item to
compile it. The HTML PAG meets next on 7 November.
