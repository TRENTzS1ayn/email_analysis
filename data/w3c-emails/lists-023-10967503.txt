Information for Developers about Changes to Internet Explorer



Issue


This section describes changes to Internet Explorer's handling of ActiveX
controls and Java applets. Developers who build ActiveX controls, Web
developers who use ActiveX and Java Applets on their Web sites, and
developers who host the Web Browser OC or MSHTML should consult this
documentation to understand how the user experience is changing, and also
how to modify their pages to manage the user experience for their content.

From this site, there are links to Microsoft documentation explaining these
changes, a test version of Internet Explorer that shows how it will work
when new versions of Windows are released that have this behavior, as well
as links to information provided by other companies who produce ActiveX
controls or tools.

Microsoft expects that new computers and retail purchases of Microsoft
Windows XP will have this behavior sometime early next calendar year.
Microsoft also expects that new service packs of Windows XP and Internet
Explorer will have this behavior starting sometime after that.

Please read this disclaimer

this Web site.

Test the Pre-Release Bits


Microsoft has made two versions of Internet Explorer 6 with the new behavior
available for testing. Microsoft strongly recommends that only developers
actively testing the changes to Windows and Internet Explorer perform the
install. In order to use either of these installation packages, you must
first have Windows XP SP1 installed. 


*IE
<http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/7/b/a7b11561-95e3-4d94-b1b3-913593
5bb9b5/IE6UPDv01.exe> 6 Update v.01
This installation package includes the altered files for Windows and
Internet Explorer in a Self Extracting ZIP file. First, download the
package. It will ask for approval on the License terms, and then for a
location to copy the self-extracting ZIP to. Then, to install, run the
Self-Extracting zip. It will create a directory, by default called "IE 6
Update". Inside that folder will be a local copy of IEXPLORE.EXE. Double
click on that program to run the updated version. Other ways of starting
Internet Explorer will run your current system version of Internet Explorer.
Other programs that use Internet Explorer technology such as the WebOC or
MSHTML will not be changed by installing this way. This installation method
should be used by Web Developers who want to test their content running in
existing and updated versions of Internet Explorer side-by-side. 

*Coming Soon
This installation updates your Windows system with the updated version of
Internet Explorer. All uses of Internet Explorer and Internet Explorer
technology on the machine will be updated with this method. This
installation method should be used by developers who want to test the
behavior of their applications that use Internet Explorer technology.
