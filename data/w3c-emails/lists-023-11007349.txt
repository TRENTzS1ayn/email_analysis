Yes Orlando, embedding Flash is changing. 

A Link for Flash developers is provided off the original posted link.

You just have to do some reading :-P

By the way, Thank you Richard for the heads up - finally some useful
information and some time to build a strategy. It appears the "changed"
version of MSIE won't be out until early next year (and service packs
following after that), so that buys us some time.

Good luck everyone.....
