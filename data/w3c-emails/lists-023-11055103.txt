The semantics of "first distributed hypermedia document", as defined in the
'906 patent, are definitely at issue here. These workarounds clearly are
ensuring that objects are delivered in a "second distributed hypermedia
document" going forward.

 

I wouldn't be surprised to see Eolas raise claims that Microsoft continues
to violate the spirit of the patent, which will just continue to drag this
thing out.
