I posted a message about this to this list about 24 hours ago; however, 
it does not appear in the list archives, so here it is again. But the 
short summary is "yes, it's not working right for me either."

<snip>

As you all probably know, Microsoft just released a new test version of 
IE which is "Eolas-compatible", along with advice as to how to modify 
scripts and applet calls to avoid getting the "Press OK to continue 
loading this page" popup.
http://msdn.microsoft.com/ieupdate/
http://msdn.microsoft.com/ieupdate/activexchanges.asp

This method involves document.write()ing the <applet> or <object> tag 
from an external JS file.

I have put together a small test page which will do this for both Flash 
and Java:
http://www.gerv.net/hacking/eolas/

I believe that I have followed the method given in the document released 
by Microsoft (and Apple, Real and Macromedia.) I have loaded this page 
in the version of IE downloaded from Microsoft's site.
http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/7/b/a7b11561-95e3-4d94-b1b3-9135935bb9b5/IE6UPDv01.exe

One would expect no popups; however, the popups continue to appear. I 
have tested it on a single Win2K machine and also a WinXP SP1 machine.

Can anyone else confirm that my test still produces popups? Is it a 
problem with my test, or the new IE?
