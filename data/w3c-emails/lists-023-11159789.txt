I don't think that the article has anything to do with Eolas' view of 
the MS workaround. It is normal practice for the winner of a patent 
infringement suit to see a permanent injunction. That is their right as 
the patent holder. We did a similar thing when I was at Stac in the 
Stac v. Microsoft case for infringement of our compression patents (for 
those who remember Stacker, the disk compression product). This was 
back in 1994. We were able to obtain a rather painful injunction that 
would've required MS and all the PC OEMs to remove their doublespace 
compression technology from systems on store shelves (not end users). 
We were granted the injunction and then under pressure from the OEMs, 
we wound up entering settlement negotiations and settled.

There is still a lot of legal room for MS to run. Even if the 
injunction is granted, MS can request a stay, pending appeal. I'm not a 
lawyer, but have seen some of this first-hand. It won't be over for a 
while, unless Eolas really winds up in what MS considers "reasonable" 
license territory.

There's a lot of negotiating going on that we're not seeing and it's 
happening at the court level.
