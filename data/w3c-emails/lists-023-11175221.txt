If you dynamically write in (via the 'Microsoft-recommended' method) an
ActiveX object for a control *that is not already installed on a client
machine* and then access that document from a web server, you will see the
usual security prompt followed by a dialog entitled "ActiveX installation" :
"Press OK to continue installing".

This dialog is not documented on the docs for the IE6sp1b test build, and if
we follow through the logic that dynamically written-in content does not
infringe the Eolas patent then it should not be appearing anyway.

I'm assuming that this is a bug in IE6sp1b v.01 that was missed in test.

I sincerely hope so, otherwise it rather defeats the object of asking our
corporate customers to re-script vast numbers of documents (none of which,
Michael Wallent may be surprised to learn, leverage our controls to 'deliver
advertising').
