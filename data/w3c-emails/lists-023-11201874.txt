V .02 of the IE6SP1b test builds was released on 10th October here:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/ieupdate/

It fixes the 'first time install' behavior I described earlier (below).

Those who are still seeing prompts when using .js writeIn might need to
check this, from 'Known Issues':

" If you have the Microsoft Script Debugger enabled, Web pages using the
external .JS file mechanism may continue to prompt. This can be eliminated
by running without the Script Debugger enabled. "

That has been confirmed, here at least.
