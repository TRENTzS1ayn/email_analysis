Glenn, 

On behalf of the DIWG, can I thank you and the TTWG for your careful consideration of our comments. You have covered all of the points we made with appropriate actions. We hope you found the exercise useful.

Very best wishes

Rhys

Use Cases and Requirements



Dear DIWG,

The TTWG has reviewed your comments on [1] and provides the
following responses (inserted inline below).

[1] http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-tt-af-1-0-req-20030915/

We greatly appreciate your efforts to review and comment, and
understand that this requires valuable resources to accomplish.

Regards,
Glenn Adams, Chair, for TTWG

We agree that the term "transcoding" is not sufficiently general, and
will change to "transformation" and "transformed" as appopriate. Thank
you for pointing out your glossary of terms.

As indicated by the Note under R109, the list is explicitly
informative.  However, since we are not mandating that any of these
formats be normative targets of transformation, and to make it more
logically consistent, we will change "shall be capable of being
transformed into..." to "should be capable of being transformed
into...".

As is clear from the title and introduction of this document, the
intended use of this work is as an authoring format, and not a
distribution format. Although we do not exclude its use as a possible
distribution format, we have not made any special provisions for this
use. As a consequence, your comment about use with limited resource
devices is not expected to be relevant, since a transformation from
the TT Authoring Format to a distribution format suitable for the
target user agents is implied.

Regarding use of XSL FO vocabulary, we have adopted this vocabulary
in certain cases for the purpose of describing authorial intention
and presentation semantics. This usage does not imply that the same
vocabulary must be used in a distribution format or will be visible
to user agents for some distribution format.  We believe that the
XSL FO vocabulary we have adopted can be readily transformed into
XHTML + CSS or SVG in most cases, although some loss of generality
is to be expected to occur in such a transformation.

Notwithstanding the above, if the DIWG is aware of any authorial
related usage of the indicated subset of XSL FO vocabulary that would
make transformation into a distribution format impossible or difficult,
then we would be interested to learn more details.

As is the policy in other W3C standards documents, unless it is
explicitly marked as informative, or appears in a note or an example,
then it is normative. However, to make this clear, we will add
a sentence in the introduction indicating this to be the case.
