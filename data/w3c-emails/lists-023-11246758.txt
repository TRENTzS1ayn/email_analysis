Thanks for the links,

I was wondering what took them so long.   It read good.  Hopefully, it
should be sufficient.  To borrow a phrase from Dorothy Parker;

                   "This is not a patent to be tossed aside lightly.
                                It should be thrown aside with great force."


Sincerely,
