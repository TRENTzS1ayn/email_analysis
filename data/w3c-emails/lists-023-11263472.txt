If Tim Berners-Lee needs additional assistance I can offer proof that the
concept, understanding and working of the '906 patent was already
publicaly discovered and discussed in Feb '93 as an additional potential
use for the XMosaic browser to load QT. Only reason it did not make a
splash then was modem speed limitations and because XMosaic was still
under going beta development. Everything the '906 patent relies on to work
was already discovered and understoodm, whether by actual applications or
because it was totally obivious by virtue of current and past web
developments that eoloas had nothing to do.
