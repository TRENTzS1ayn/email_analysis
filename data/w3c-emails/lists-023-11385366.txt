I have been complacent with current "relaxed" patent software laws which I
am catching up to now,  but if this patent strictly covers the client applet
activation concept for "Web HTML-based Browser"  only,  then I guess I have
less of an issue with it.  Microsoft was well aware of Eolas in 1994 so we
shouldn't be crying "boo-hoo" for them.  I personally feel it (activex)
should be removed from IE or any other idea of "remote-client" software
loading and activation.

But if this patent attempts to cover all systems,  all OSes, then that's a
problem.  In this case it is my opinion the patent becomes more weaker, not
stronger due to a wide "database" of prior art.

I already mentioned BBS systems.   Another area of prior art where client
side applet activation and imaging processing was available was with the
Optical Document Storage Archive and Retrieval (ODSAR) market

During the 80s, the ODSAR systems was invented and demonstrated in large
trade shows such as AIMS,  FOSE, etc.    My first company, OptiSoft,
created a turnkey system called "OptiFile" which was marketed as an
"electronic file cabinet."    But there were hundreds of companies creating
similar ODSAR systems.  Among the biggest are companies such as FileNet and
many of the big companies, including IBM, HP, WANG, XEROX etc.   Many
vendors used a solution from a vendor if  I recalled correctly, "Kodak???
Software" which had special imaging adapters and software development kit
for DOS, Unix and eventual Windows.

The adapters linked printer engines (such as the Canon engine used in most
HP printers) with large 20" video screens to provide super fast, compression
and imaging processing.   Most of the HP laser printers have a video adapter
slot in the back where you can plug in this fast imaging adapters.

There were many systems that worked in client/server fashion allowing for
the scanning and storage of documents and the retrieval of documents for
client-side processing (panning, zooming, etc).  This was especially the
case as GUI based operating systems started become more feasible.

Before starting OptiSoft 1986, I worked with Westinghouse Electric Venture
Group, a "think tank" where we began many projects using hypertext ideas.
One project was a ODSAR system where I demonstrated a system using a
Hypertext "Story Board" to reference images.   When big W folded the venture
group, I asked to go on my own with 2 other people to start OptiSoft using
these ideas.

The $35,000 OptiFile system was demonstrated in various trade shows.
However, long sale periods,  lack of venture capital in a highly competitive
new market with many of the big boys in it,  forced us to close shop.

Nonetheless, this is yet more examples of prior art here for client-side
data processing concepts.
