One quick comment. The Eolas '906 patent isn't really about the EMBED
tag.  The EMBED tag is not talked about in the claims section of the
patents.  Instead the EMBED tag is an example implementation of the
patent.  The meat of any patent is the claims section.  That's were any
discussions about prior art needs to be focused.
