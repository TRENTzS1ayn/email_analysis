Of course, we do not yet know what remedy Microsoft is making, but if they 
were to remove support for some features to avoid paying future royalties 
(presumably the current ruling encompasses past royalties), and patent 
compliance was their sole motive, then surely, if they had a mechanism to 
fix existing browsers (i.e. a patch,) they would have to use it? Or is 
that the point? That Microsoft see that by fixing all future copies of IE, 
they have done their part, and are free to move on to "bigger" and 
"better" things? (They have already said that MSIE is now a legacy 
component. What do they care if people are running the next to last 
version of a legacy component, or the last version?)

Too many questions,
