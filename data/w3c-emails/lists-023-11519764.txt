Ha!   I'm not crazy after all!  Check this out September 1 article I just
found regarding UCITA

http://archive.infoworld.com/ucita/

and this one about the "Remote Disabling of Software":

http://archive.infoworld.com/articles/uc/xml/00/08/21/000821ucissues.xml

The Eolas PATENT will control  DEVELOPERS who want to control the automatic
installation, activation, interactive usage and/or licensing of client-side
applets using UTICA was a legal means to do so.

On a positive note, this is further indication of "prior art."  As Ed
Foster, the author the article,  notes in his article, as the most
informative journalist on the subject,  Article 2B as been in debate the
early 1990s.  The idea of "remote client software" control concepts has been
in use and the minds of many in the industry.

Please note in first article  the listed group UCITA supporters does not
include Microsoft.   The truth is most of the groups, especially BSA is
supported and funded by Microsoft.  BSA is just a political lobby front for
Microsoft.
