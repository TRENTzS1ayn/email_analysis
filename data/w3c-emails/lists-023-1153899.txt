Bert, (et al)

I read your comments with some interest, having just re-read the
requirements
document myself following the recent posting of minutes on the list.

I would like to add my observations to yours, in anticipation of feedback
from the WG for TT AF of what is intended by certain statements in the
requirements document.

This is not strictly a comment....
I work in the subtitling / captioning industry (sse sig) so am perhaps
vaguely qualified to answer this......

Captioning (or subtitling) audio involves:

Text content.

Timing accurate to frame/field. (including synchronisation to video frames)
Note this is not the same as duration or offset from start - because
captioned
video material may be discontinuous (e.g. Ad breaks)

Basic colours (for text - 16 colour model is sufficient)

Font selection (Fonts for captions are quite restricted due to resolution
and interlace issues

Background colour and box styles (boxing refers to how the background fits
around the text)
E.g. A 'stripe' is a horizontal background across entire display, 'box' is
background
starting just before first character on a line and ending just after last
character.
Other styles are possible e.g. 'word box'. The 'leading' between lines of a
subtitle may
or may not be filled with background.

Italics selection (e.g. italics are used to represent lyrics, other stress
or intonation)

Typically underlining and blinking are NOT used.

Outline and shadow effects on glyphs are used, but outline is typ. a black
border
around a coloured(filled) glyph, and serves to accentuate the glyph against
a varying
video background (i.e. used when background is transparent)

Transparency is used for background. I have never seen reversed text (i.e.
background solid
with transparent text).

Positioning can be quite complex. Captions can steal into the safe area...
often non speech
characters (speaker change marks '-' or music marks '#' will be positioned
outside of the
'safe area', this gives more space for the caption text.
Captions may be centred, left or right aligned, and this may vary from
caption to caption
often to match the speakers on-screen position.

Vertical text has yet more rigorous demands, but is typically produced as
graphics that are burnt
over video.

Finally - although a distinction is (rightly) made concerning captions and
subtitles, in terms of
the system requirments for their display there is very little difference.
Captions may use more 
features for display than subtitles, as captions carry non speech
information as text and this
may be rendered using colour or styles that would not normally be used for
speech related text display.

This is true if TTAF is used as a source for the generation of an audio
output.

My view is that TTAF is intended as a format for the authorial intent of
text over time.
How TTAF is handled when it is embedded in other protocols/formats is
probably outside
the scope of TTAF, but I guess if it is considered a likely scenario it
should have
some bearing on how TTAF is specified.

I read this as meaning 'The TTAF specification is written in XML / XSL.

Hopefully this means that TTAF will be specified such that certain
accessibility issues will be
mandatory within a TTAF document rather than optional. (See R217/218)

I read this as meaning that any character can be represented, but by using
only the ASCII
characters for that representation. E.g. Cyrillic characters may be edited
into TTAF by typing in
a Unicode codepoint in an ASCII form.
However - I don't read this as meaning that this method is the only form of
representation 
for characters not in the ASCII set !

I personally would like to see adoption of CSS font selection. Ultimately
the display
font used for presentation will depend upon the UA (since all fonts may not
be present
at the UA). Consequently IMHO it is more important to convey the authors
intent wrt the
font used, than the actual font used. That said, it may be important in
certain cases
for TTAF instances to carry a font (or at least glyphs) as bitmaps or
vectors etc for
specific usages of TTAF e.g. company logos (This might use SVG?)

I interpreted this as 'an appropriate meta dictionary for describing what
the text is'
E.g. stage direction - or - dialogue etc. EIA 708 also contains such
descriptive categories.

I agree. I would personally prefer to drop audio. Audio description as
source text for
re-speaking (by human or machine) would still be TTAF.

I think one aspect of TTAF may be that it is not primarily content for
direct display,
as for example HTML is. Rather TTAF is an XML standard for conveying text
information,
together with styling and timing that apply to that text, between clients
that will
manipulate that information. Consequently, there is no requirement that the
ordering
of any text within the TTAF document matches the ordering (temporal and or
physical)
of the subsequent presentation of that text content.

So in TTAF you might have the following....

<doc>
"This is displayed last (in time) at the bottom of the screen."
"This is displayed first (in time) at the middle of the screen."
"This is displayed between (in time) at the foot of the screen."
</doc>

If you only had style sheets it might be more? difficult to do this?

I kinda think of a style sheet as something that is used to dress up a
document for display
- without radically altering the basic structure of the document, whereas I
see
style expressed as attributes as being bound more tightly to the context....
YMMV.

I was the proponent of the temporal styling concept.
I could send you the original examples and comments if you wish 
- they should be upstream somewhere...
