This is my technical opinion.

The way the patent is described,  NO and YES, it depends.

If I just have a URL on a why site that activates a side-side process (web
server, cgi, ANYTHING) and the XML OUTPUT is strickly dumped in the BROWSER
window, then NO.  It is not covered.

Now,  with the new Microsoft XML components in IE, which takes the XML data
and transforms it into a "visual tree outline",  this YES.   Any remote
client applet  that takes data and "transforms" it is covered.

If the IE Browser "detected" that XML was coming to the BROWSER and it did
not have a XML component and IE automatically went back to the WEB SITE to
download the XML component, then MAYBE.

I say MAYBE here because I see nothing in the patent that claims the
automatic transfer of requirement component to the client machine as part of
the business method.  However, this may not matter and probably
intentionally left out as it would had limited the scope of the patent.,
