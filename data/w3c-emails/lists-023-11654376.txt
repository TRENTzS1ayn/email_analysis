This is a question more for Microsoft.  I haven't heard them make this
argument in their lawsuit.  Although Microsoft did mumble something
about Mike Doyle of Eolas hearing about their future plans for OLE about
the time he said he invented Weblets.  Not sure what article this was
in.

  I believe most of the things we are speaking about are not
straight prior art, but they can -should- be used to claim
obviousness. As far as I understand, if it can be showed,
based on prior inventions, that the patent claims are
obvious for any engineer, then the patent is invalid.
Is this the plan?
