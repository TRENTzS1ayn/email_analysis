Hello,
 
Does anyone on the list know why the judge in the Eolas/Microsoft '906
patent trial refuse to allow the jury to hear about Pei Wei's ViolaWWW
work?  In particular, was it an issuing timing or was the Viola system
somehow different than Mike Doyle's work?
 
Here are some interesting links on Pei Wei and his Viola project from
1994/95:
