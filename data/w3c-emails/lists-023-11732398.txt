It depends how you call the SVG. If you are using an SVG plugin
then as far as I know you are in the same boat as Flash plugins,
Quicktime plugins, etc.

You could embed the SVG inline within the HTML, which was a use-case
identified early in the design of SVG. Unfortunately, there isn't much
adoption yet in the browser space (you can get Mozilla builds).

This patent claims to cover plugins, so it probably doesn't matter
what format you use. However, you could probably implement SVG support
in a browser and avoid the patent claims, by embedding the
content inline. To be honest though, I haven't read the patent
in detail and I'm not a lawyer.

I think the compression is irrelevant. SVG mandates support for
gzip compression, which would provide the same results as HTTP 
compression.

I pass on the rest of the questions :)
