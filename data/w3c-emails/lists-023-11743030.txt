Hi Michael,

IANAL, but I'll try to answer.

Given access to your server's configuration, you could make it serve index.swf 
as the root document for your website. Of course, this isn't a very pleasant 
thing to do, to say the least...

Yes, HTML or SVG alternatives should work fine.

Yes.

SVG's "compressed mode" is just gzip. Embedding it directly in an HTML document 
would require one to gzip the entire document. However, that's not a problem 
since all browsers now understand gzip. The overall size will in fact be 
noticeably slower than HTML+SWF.

There's some support for doing that in IE through binary behaviours, and 
natively in some versions of Mozilla. I'm sure that if such a radical fix 
happens, those that currently ship plugins (eg Adobe, Corel,...) will quickly 
make their functionality available in patent-circumventing ways.

I think those are not covered by the patent.

If the browsers support the data: URI scheme, you can include your SWF directly 
inside the HTML using Base64 encoding. Mozilla supports that, don't know about 
IE. Note however that that will inflate the size of your SWF by a largeish 
amount, as well as processing time.

I'd love to know.

That very much depends on the country/state in which you are, and what you tell 
your clients. I'm pretty much certain that in France, if you sold an SWF 
animation to someone in full knowledge of the current risks and without warning 
them, they could probably ask you for their money back if things go wrong (you'd 
have sold them something with "hidden flaws").

I'd say the safest bet is either 1) explain to them in full detail what the 
current situation is, or 2) switch to alternate technology that doesn't really 
suffer from this patent.
