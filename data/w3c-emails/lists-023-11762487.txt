At the time that Mike Doyle applied for the '906 patent in October 1994,
did he have working software yet?  He didn't ship his TCL applet toolkit
until November 1996.

If I understand it right, the judge decided that Pei Wei's system wasn't
published in a suitable way to make it acceptable prior art.

Prior art isn't just that you did it earlier, but that you also
published it
for all the world to see.
