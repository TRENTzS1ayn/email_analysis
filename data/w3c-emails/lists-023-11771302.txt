Ok, so let me get this straight...  Because the Internet was not as 
widely known back then, and there were bits and bobs hanging around it 
was not suitable?

Essentially the judge is saying, "Hey if you see a demo, you can rip it

Holy cow, no wonder Microsoft is flabbergasted.  Now wonder Microsoft is 
thinking of alternatives because this is absolutely lame!

Sometimes I wonder about the justice system...

I sure do hope this gets overturned by appeal.
