I don't know what this ruling was about, but I believe that the US uses 
a "first-to-invent" rule for determining patent ownership, so it should 
not matter how or whether the work was published.  However, there is a 
rule that states that regardless of who invented it first, the patent 
must be filed for within one year of the first publication of the 
invention by any party (and in Europe there is no one-year grace 
period); perhaps MS was arguing that they had broken this rule.

Anyway, to me the patent seems to be a fairly obvious extension of the 
<image> tag concept, not that my opinion counts for anything...
