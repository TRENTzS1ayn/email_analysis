The patent laws do not require an inventor to actually build any embodiment of an invention in order to patent it. He merely has to provide an "enabling" description that would allow others to build and use it.

At the time that Mike Doyle applied for the '906 patent in October 1994,
did he have working software yet?  He didn't ship his TCL applet toolkit
until November 1996.

If I understand it right, the judge decided that Pei Wei's system wasn't
published in a suitable way to make it acceptable prior art.

Prior art isn't just that you did it earlier, but that you also
published it
for all the world to see.
