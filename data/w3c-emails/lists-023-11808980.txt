Sure they can. Eolas hasn't been legally adjudged a monopolist in any
market. Monopolies (MS, for example) live under a different legal regime
than non-monooplists because their overwhelming marketplace power makes
things that are 'competing tough' for a market with multiple viable
competitors into 'competing with an unfair and unbeatable advantage'.

Patent owners are not generally _FORCED_ to licence their patents to all
comers 'fairly' (or even at all). I can point to _you_ and say: "You have
to pay me $100,000,000,000 per year. But _this other fellow_ gets it for
$1 a year.  Nyah. Nyah."
