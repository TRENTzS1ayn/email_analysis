Very cool: Sounds like an "extension" to me, instead of a plug-in.

Hmm, not if the browser was built with an extendable/open framework. It
could then be recompiled with a new extension built using that framework and
abiding by the open API.

Ok, building on this, since XHTML is XML, why not expose these patched
"extensions" (have they patented extensions?) via a new tag

eg. <extension name="Flash"><!-- custom tags? --></extension>

or, the extension could even add its own tag definitions:

eg. <flash version="7.0" flashvars="a=5&b=4"><!-- child tags? --></flash>

Thoughts?
