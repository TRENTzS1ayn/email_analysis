Um, I'm pretty sure that "extensions" are the same as "plugins".  Code in a
different file, loaded at runtime, and run at the request of a hypermedia
document.  Covered by the patent, I think.

The suggestion, I believe, was to actually inline Flash, QuickTime, Java,
and any other major plugins right into the browser's code.  Then the code
isn't external, and so it's not covered under the patent.
