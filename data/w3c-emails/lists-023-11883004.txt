That's more of what I meant, initially.  Updates to the un-plugins would
be in the form of patches to the executable.  If, for instance, the
libflashplayer.so was instead actually compiled into mozilla-bin.  The
tag itself would then be "dumb" as far as the executing program is
concerned.  It'd just say <flash src="egregious_patent_abuse.swf" /> and
that'd be the end of it; the browser would have to then have the
responsibility of actually reading that format.  Not nearly as elegant
as a plugin architecture, but it'd at least keep existing pages from
breaking.
