Would it really be covered by the patent if the extension was
*compiled/patched* into the browser? i.e., the browser was recompiled to
include the patch? e.g., sample workflow:

1. I go on a site that uses Flash 14.0.
2. I am informed that my browser does not support Flash 14.0 and given a
link to download the extension.
3. After downloading the extension, IE automatically *recompiles* its
executable, including the Flash 14.0 patch/extension
4. IE restarts itself, now with the extension as part of its binary and
displays the page
