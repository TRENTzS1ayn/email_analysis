I think maybe recompile is misleading, if we're talking about internet
explorer.  (presumably they, being who they are, will prefer to leave
their source closed) But what about something more like a binary patch? 
The gist of the patent, if I'm reading it right, is that the tag links
the browser to a plugin designation, allowing a certain amount of
arbitariness - if next week someone comes up with a smell-o-vision, IE
will accomodate that through activeX, as long as the smell-o-vision
authors used the activeX api. What I'm suggesting they might do is
remove that arbitrariness.  Flash would play not because it was some
plugin, but because playing swf files would be part of IE's core
functionality.  The recipients of the royal screwing in this scenario
would be future plugin creators, as any extendability would require
official merging into the Master Control Program.

It's a little childish and stupid, but then, so are software patents.
