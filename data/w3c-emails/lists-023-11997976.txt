Tom,

I don't consider Microsoft's patent portfolio to be
daunting in the least; there are many other companies
with much more significant portfolios -- note IBM's
recent use of its portfolio in the SCO fiasco.

My point is that if a small company or individual
inventor creates a new "mousetrap" that is
sufficiently compelling in its function to gain wide
adoption in the marketplace (e.g. web browser
plug-ins), then the marketplace has a means to obviate
the 95%+ market control of a monopolist (e.g.
Microsoft).

Microsoft is not measured on the quality of their
products or services; they are measured on the ability
to interact and make use of the personal computer
which they have dominated through predatory means
(e.g. you can't buy a PC from Dell -- or others -- w/o
a MSFT operating system installed).

I have yet to see MSFT use their portfolio of patents
to control the marketplace and given their lackluster
performance in invention, I do not see them doing it
in the future; why try to dominate through patents
when you can dominate more easily through predatory
practices?
