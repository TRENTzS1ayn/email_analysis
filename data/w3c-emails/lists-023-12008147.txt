Speculation has been outweighing hard details here for sure. What else are
we to do while we twiddle our thumbs waiting for more useful information.

Of course, spreading additional comments that are not funded in fact doesn't
help either.

And isn't the one of the biggest topics of Linux evangelists, concerning the
wide-spread adoption of Linux - is that it won't happen until an Open Source
comparable/competitive/alternative version of MS Office can be build for
Linux? 

Doesn't that say something about the quality of some of their products? 

And now please don't start on how "evil" they are:

When it comes down to choosing between people and a Software brand - I'll
choose people every time. Who else gives away cash like this?

Surprised indeed....

I really think the usefulness of this list would be better served if we
could keep politics out of it. 

More technical details from W3C, Microsoft or Macromedia or anybody sure
would be helpful anytime now....

Flame me if you wish.
