 From the Java perspective, the HotJava browser would be an working 
example of this since the same JVM that displayed the document also 
executes any applets embedded in the document.

It might be possible to create a .net assembly that plays back Flash 
movies instead of using a plug-in that is downloaded and executed 
directly. This is splitting hairs since I believe that most plug-ins 
are essentially libraries that are dynamically loaded into memory and 
started by calling a specific function exported by the plug-in. In 
turn, the plug-in code is allowed to draw and receive events from a 
limited region in the parent document.
