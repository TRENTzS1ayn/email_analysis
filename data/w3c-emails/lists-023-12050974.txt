Software patents seem much easier to work around, than business model
patents.  The former must describe a precise methodology for doing
something.

The latter on the other hand, control customer experience. For
instance, the Amazon 1-Click patent, would stop others from providing
the same customer experience.  That is, regardless of the technical
_methodology_ used to provide that customer experience.

To what extent, can such a "plug-in" patent be used as a B-M patent,
hence controlling the _entire_ idea of embedded, interactive,
"thinggies" on the web?  (Scary thought!)
