That's an interesting idea.

You're right.  This does appear like a central theme in this patent.
If you circumvent it, the problems should go away.

But see

The thought that this kind of patent can become a "business model"
patent is troubling.  Imagine if the patent claimed, "we are serving
our customers documents in such a way that in *one* download they can
view all the other related documents, at the same time, and embedded
into the main document.

Sort of like the famous Amazon.com 1-click patent.  (notice the word
*one* in both places!)

Again, I am not sure how far this sort of B-M patent could be pushed.
AFAIK, Amazon vs. B&N finally ended their fight through an
out-of-court settlement (details not disclosed!)  So there is not much
precedence that I'm aware of. But the whole thing is worrisome
nonetheless.

W3C can also standardize Javascript, so it can communicate with
the external program (through a pipe or socket) if the programmer so
wishes. Would that be well outside the patent protection?

Standardizing Javascript has other great benefits.  In the end, with
the event model now being standardized by W3C, it makes sense to glue
DOM/XML/etc together, through Javascript standardization.  Putting the
D into DHTML seems to be the whole point here, correct?
