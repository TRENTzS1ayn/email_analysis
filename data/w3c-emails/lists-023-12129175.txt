Short Answer Part 1: Probably.

Short Answer Part 2: Wait for Microsoft's update to their web browser so 
                     we can see 'how bad is it'. Until we know 
                     _exactly_ what MS intends to do to their browser to 
                     comply with patent, we simply don't know how serious 
                     the impact is or what actions will have to be taken 
                     in response.
