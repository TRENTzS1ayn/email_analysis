Here's a quick link to the patent:

http://tinyurl.com/juea

Please have a look at claims 1 and 6.  It specifically refers to
"displaying" the embedded interactive object *within* the hypertext
document, even going so far as to say that the embedded object shall have a
particular visual location within the document.

While looking through the patent again, I noticed a part in the description
section which mentioned OLE and Apple's OpenDoc, claiming that neither had
the ability to be embedded in a remote hypermedia document.  I thought that
OpenDoc did have that ability; does anyone know?  And what about OLE?  Since
it's mentioned in the patent, it was obviously pre-existing.  Was it
possible to embed OLE documents in pages then, or was that not until the
advent of ActiveX?
