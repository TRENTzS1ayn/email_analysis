Somewhat, though I've moved to doing mostly just programming and design for 
the time being. One of my projects is to create tools for authoring the TT 
format (using a temporary XML format until specs exist) and displaying them 
on video.

Ah, I was assuming you were doing the subtitles at the same place the video 
was being broadcast originally. Personally, I would suggest seperating parts 
of a TT file into scenes and marking subtitles with (very accurate) 
percentages through the video. Then it would be easy to adjust to different 
source files or media.

So you're looking at TT as a format which you convert when streaming it. I'm 
looking at TT as being the format that is actually streamed.

Even reusing previous characters' colours, there are still many different 
characters which would go over using 16 colour shades.

They would be essential for a do-everything-TT format, which I hope is what 
the TTWG is meant to create...

One could also argue that 256 colors is plenty for images too.

I would be thinking more of a format similar to DVD, but using MPEG-4, Vorbis, 
and TT as the standard formats for the content. In this case, there would be 
no restrictions by conversion formats.

It's quite readable. The credits in this example are only slightly 
transparent, enough to see the background behind them.

Convince the TV industry to move to using MPEG4/Vorbis/TT for distribution 
content. ;)
Simple enough to do it for a DVD-replacement format though...

I am referring to translations of visual items.
