Again, the gist of this erroneous patent is two parts:

First,  REMOTE client/server operations.  The key is REMOTE.

OLE was LOCAL machine operations.  The next generation of OLE aka
ACTIVEX/COM and DCOM made it network based,  thin (or FAT as I like to call
it with you use a PC) client, etc, system.

Although the patent talks about existing prior-art, it uses the "prior art"
to illustrate the "problem" thus defining the need for this patent or what
this patent solves.

Second, since within a LOCAL system, all the components will be available,
in a REMOTE arrangement, the client may or may not have the components to
handle the data.   So the other part of the claim is the ability to
associate the data with a "handler" and this handler is automatically sent
to the client and automatically installed.  The data can handled by the
client.   How the data is displayed is immaterial.  Pop it up in another
window or within the same window, it doesn't matter.

So lets imagine the patent locks itself into a "Frame" window concept,  then
you win - you bypass the patent by displaying another way.   In fact,  is
this was the case,  this Microsoft can use the following method to get
around the patent:

- Burn in Microsoft Only ActiveX components in the OS and only support
Microsoft script maps, extensions.

For example,  *.DOC,   this should, in theory, bypass the patent because it
uses standard script mapping and using file association and standard html,
you can display and edit word docs in a standalone window or view port.
However, you need WORD installed on the machine.  A delayed process.  Could
this be the reason Microsoft now offers a downloadable "Word Viewer?"

On the other hand, PDF is not a Microsoft component. Although it is part of
the standard script map tables for most web servers, the client side
component is not available.   This PDF component (Acrobat Reader) has to be
downloaded in a "delayed fashion."   This would be, in my technical expert
opinion, Acrobat defense.  The irony here with the fact that using Acrobat
requires an extensive complete download of their reader system, probably
saved their butt.  However, if they provided an embedded tag and distributed
activex components to Web sites for free distribution and automatic tag
association, then they are in the same boat FLASH is in.

Lets imagine the patent claims are isolated to just HTML based browsers,
then the obvious circumvention are proprietary frontend systems.  That is
means Prodigy had it right. AOL had it right,  We have it right with our
Wildcat! Navigator system.  This would coincide with the current direction
of the internet with more and more "private or semi-private" systems
offering their own "look and feel."    Our strategic direction is based on
this vision.  People what to add more "interaction" with their exclusive
users.

However, the problem with this direction of add-valued" custom look and feel
systems is that it is being done with the standard HTML server/browser
technology augmented flexible browser plug-in capabilities.

So like I said, the argument has to be presented that the TECHNOLOGY has
existed, maybe not for the World Wide Web,  but nonetheless exist before the
patent was filed.

This is why I said the patent claims are flawed.  It targets the WWW yet
makes broad references to other usages that are not web based.

If Eolas limits their patent to web-browsers, then I see the progress and
direction to custom web sites halted.  In a way,  this will benefit my
Wildcat! BBS technology so I shouldn't be complaining.

However,  If Eolas attempts to cover all "non-web" frontend systems, then
Mr. Doyle will no doubt be over burdened with lot of companies challenging
the patent.

With that said,  I don't think Mr. Doyle is willing to risk losing its claim
on the WWW by targeting that offer non-www systems as well where he will
surely lose.
