But my point was exactly that.

They specify 'hyper-text' document.
Ergo html document.

An swf is not that as far as i know.

There is no html link to the swf. It is
loaded directly off the server.

Now surely a browser can display whatever
the hell it wants to, 'including' but not 
limeted to html or a 'hyper-text' document, 
which falls under the patent. Otherwise it 
seems to me that the patent defines a 
web browser as anything that connects over 
http, not just html/document transfer?

In that case the stand-alone flash player 
itself would be defined as a web browser 
and therefor fall foul of the patent.

Perhaps a re-read of the patent is on the
menu for me ;p

I suspect that Eolas would fight that as long as you're viewing the Flash
document from within a browser.

However, downloading and saving the SWF, and then playing it with QuickTime
Player should be okay.
