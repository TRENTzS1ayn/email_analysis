The best languages are ones that make it simple to do simple things, but allow 
complex things to be done with more complex code/markup. Restricting a 
language or format will only cause a better format to replace it in the 
future as more complex features are needed.

You seem to have only looked at the most inferior timed text formats that 
exist. Much more powerful formats such as Sub Station Alpha and Advanced Sub 
Station allow for much more complex effects to be done (though these 
themselves are not powerful enough IMO).

The result is already much delayed IMO. HTML came around before other text 
markup languages had become popular. There are many timed text formats 
already, which implies that such a standard has been needed for a while.
