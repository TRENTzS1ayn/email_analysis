Microsoft has claimed for years now that the browser is _AN INTEGRAL PART_
of the OS. In fact, they have made that a center piece of some of their
legal battles to date. They would probably get murdered in court if they
tried to claim at this late date that the browser _wasn't_ part of the OS
for the purpose of this patent. If they made a legal filing to that end,
they would open themselves to a claim a perjury (because they would have
legally under oath on the record claimed two positions that are clearly
mutually incompatible) and/or to losing some of the other civil litigation
in process against them.
