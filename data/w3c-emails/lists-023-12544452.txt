I disagree with the logic of the writer.  The patent really doesn't
specify how the browser associates a MIME type with an external
application.  The browser can do itself or it can make an operating
system call to do it.  Both scenarios I believe are covered by claim #1
of the '906 patent.

Greg has an interesting take on the patent which may provide Microsoft a

huge loophole to avoid future claims.
