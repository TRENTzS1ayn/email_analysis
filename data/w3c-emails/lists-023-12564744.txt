I agree that JavaScript needs a lot work.  Anyone who has also
programmed in Python quickly realizes how much JavaScript is missing.  A
format operator like Python's % is at the top of my rather long list of
missing features.

Microsoft has created something called Jscript.NET, but it isn't runable
in IE yet and I'm not sure it really addresses JavaScript's weaknesses.
My concern is that JavaScript has become a bit of an orphan at
Microsoft.

In HTML Applications (HTA), JavaScript does support file access via an
ActiveX control.

It's also possible that some enhancements to JavaScript can overcome the
Eolas '906 patent.  The patent never really anticipated script code
running in a Web page.  As a thought experiment, I wonder what the
effect of having script code set up a display area for a plugin and have
the script code download and execute the plugin would be?

Yes.  I certainly agree with the reasons you sight for Java's
unpopularity (surely on the applet side.)  Jake also mentioned it's
complexity, which is very valid also (I'm fluent with C++, so I'm not
whining, but for the web, there are much simpler ways.)  

That is why it would be really, really interesting to see some good work
by W3C on "Javascript."  It does  not need to be complicated at all. 
Scripting languages are not, at all, even hard to implement.  Just look
at the many choices out there: Tcl, Perl, Python.  Certainly, to merely
standardize Javascript, and add a few essentials like file and network
access, is very easy for W3C to do.  And the GUI is just DOM.  Too
easy!  And all of us benefit if we do it.
