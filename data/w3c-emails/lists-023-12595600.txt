Hi Thomas,

I'm sorry about the way I said it.  I stressed "standard" because it was
important, but the real key phrase is "complete."  You know, just simple
things, like (basic) file and network support.  Also see Richard's post:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-web-plugins/2003Sep/0115.html

Ever played chess on the web before?  Or chatted?  Wouldn't it be
absolutely lovely to be able to offer that to your audience w/o
requiring Java for a change?  And in totally standardized ways?
