Thanks for pointing out this article.  The article was both very
interesting and very frustrating.  It would be nice if Mr. Wallent would
put together an email for this list describing some of the technical
measures that Microsoft is considering to avoid the Eolas '906 patent.
Our collective mind readers are broken.......

Subject: CNN circumvents the Eolas Patent?



Hello all...

I just read a new CNET article (
http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-5074799.html?tag=fd_top ) that detailed
the Microsoft / Eolas case, and in it Michael Wallent (a general manager
in the Windows Division) urges developers to use alternate means of
delivery of content just in case they don't prevail in their appeals.
Then, the article went further:

"Wallent cited CNN.com as an example of a site that uses Macromedia
Flash--a technology many consider particularly vulnerable to the
patent's claims--in a non-infringing way."

I glanced a bit at the current CNN.com site and didn't see anything
different about how they were using Flash; does anyone know what he's
talking about?
