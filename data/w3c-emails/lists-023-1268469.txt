Sean et al,

Hi Sean,

Yes, not competitive with SVG, but should IMHO allow SVG as external content
by
reference. This probably covers most of the esoterics, without TTAF having
to 
provide mechanisms. I might even go as far as saying that TTAF does not need
animation, in that SVG content covers what you might want to use animation
for.
I.e. promote SVG as the catch all for complex presentation?

Absolutely - it is most important that this (authorial intent) is the
primary focus,
both from accessibility point of view, and from the perspective of
creating a generic precursor format for all timed text activities.

However, I think it might require a co-ordinated effort to produce profiles
under the auspices of a 'standards body', it won't happen if left to the
industry....
Or rather - there will be many overlapping profiles :-)

Exactly - SMIL, SVG, CSS (XSL/FO)

I see TTAF as more of a profiles exercise than anything else, i.e.
I actually feel it is more a case of saying, we want this from CSS but not
this,
we want this from SVG but not this.... etc.

See other recent post... unfortunately there may be multiple sweet spots.
