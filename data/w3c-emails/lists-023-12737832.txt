Thank you for the article, Jeff

Although there are "some" details - it still sounds very speculative. They
also make the article sound like we already have the details (which we
don't), and then also says we're still waiting.

Sounds like somebody trying to create news - when there isn't any yet.

Anyway, I did a quick snoop of CNN.com with a HTTP Sniffer tool and found
something interesting, although I don't know if this is precisely what they
are referring too - I'm not a Flash programmer.

It's funky, and the JavaScript poorly written (probably on purpose), but not
too unusual.

In one CNN.com page, where a Flash piece appears, they are calling it with
the below JavaScript.
----------------
<script language="JavaScript1.1">
<!--
adSetTarget('_top');
htmlAdWH(93163965, 120, 240);
//-->
</script>

----------------
That JavaScript then calls a couple of functions in an external .js file,
which then dynamically does document.write() to the page where the Flash
location is, and then either creates a <DIV>, <ILAYER> or a <IFRAME> element
that then externally references a dynamic source to return the following
HTML

Hopefully the following OBJECT tag stuff is visible after mailing. I'll
change the left angle bracket of the OBJECT tag to [[[ - just to make sure
you can see this.

It's very indirect, because the dynamically loaded object reference is
dynamically written, and comes from a "text/html" Content-Type, but then it
still does an external data reference once loaded - does this circumvent the
patent?
