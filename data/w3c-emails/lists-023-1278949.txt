We are, the subtitles are inserted over the top of a video broadcast at the
point of broadcast.
(Termed 'playout' subtitling).

Hmmm...  There seems to be a misunderstanding here.

How would a subtitle inserter detect the start of a scene?

Basically the broadcaster has video and audio on a tape or video server.
In accordance with a schedule of programming, the tape gets played (or the
server is started).

As the program plays out, the timecode on the video signal is monitored.
At the correct points in the program, the subtitles are inserted.
This has to be a real time rendering process. (although we can and do
pre-render in 
anticipation of the next insertion event).

If the broadcaster chooses to interupt his program with an advert, or public
service announcement, then the station automation system switches across to
a different
video segment. When the adverts finish, the previous program resumes from
where it left
off.

The only clues the subtling inserter has are the timecode of the video, and
an indication
from the automation system that the program has changed.

This is not like producing a media clip, where the subtitles are added
against a media clip
of known duration (in play time terms), since the time required to air an
entire program
will depend on how many advert breaks the broadcaster chooses to have. This
may differ
from channel to channel and possibly at different times of day.

TT requirements are for primarily an authoring format.
TT **may** be used as a distribution format, but that is not the main
emphasis.
I.e. it is not for example a primary goal to develop the most wire efficient
format,
TT AF will (hopefully) be optimsed for editing/authoring.

8 foreground colours works fine for Teletext subtitling, in fact not all 8
are commonly used. In fact, a **lot** of subtitling is done with just white
on black.

Yes, format should support them, but they might not need to be 'core'

There is a difference between the use of shades within an image, and the use
of colour
for text. It is primarily an issue of readability - especially for TV
subtitling where
the text is over changing video, and viewed on a 17 inch screen from the
other side of
the room.

I doubt you'd make much headway in getting consumers to move away from DVD
now...
A new standard would have to offer significant advantages over DVD.

'Text over video' i.e. that describes what the video is (...what can be seen
in the picture)
is called 'description'.
'Text over video' i.e. that is equivalent to what is said is either
'subtitles' or 'captions'.

For SMPTE the distinction between the two is that subtitles involve language
translation, but
captions include text to describe sound effects in addition to speech.
