I think we are hearing very little from Microsoft for very obvious reasons.
It seems clear that their defense rolled-over.  It is, in my opinion, in
Microsoft's best interest actually to have precedent establishing the case
for the multitude of patents that they expect to file.  There's more than
one way to control the desktop, and one of them is to disallow any
competition.

I'm surprised that the patent, filed in 1994, was not issued until 1998 -
well after java 1.0 and applets were a fact, as was ActiveX.

I think we are hearing very little from Microsoft because I'm sure they are
trying to weigh the cost of the lawsuits to come over the cost of the patent
infringement.  Their best course of action is to come forward and put their
full weight behind an appeal and to overturn this stupid patent.  I really
think the ramifications are huge.
