In which case you can tell when the video is stopped and pause the subtitles 
at that same time, no? Or are commercials actually in the source material 
(video tape/file)?

Default times for the start/end of scenes can be set and on top of that 
specific times or frames for a particular MD5. If there is no MD5 match for 
the source, default times could be adjusted if a scene change was detected 
near the default. For live-encoded stuff, you'd probably need to use the 
defaults, though.

In the latter case, I would suggest muxing the TT so the server provides it 
also.

If you have the content prior to the broadcast, you could probably add some 
kind of identification (similar to MD5 for video files) to use non-default 
times...

Why can't the subtitle be paused during this time? If the subtitles are added 
at the original broadcast point, this shouldn't be an issue.

If the automation system can tell the subtitling program, it should be able to 
handle it.

I would suggest against doing that anyway. It is better to add a TT stream to 
the container and have the video player render it (though that would involve 
converting the percentages to actual times).

Consider the subtitle times as program times, not as air time. Just because 
the subtitle file is 23 minutes long doesn't mean when it's played it needs 
to complete all at once.

A lot of subtitling is done using 24-bit RGB values, also.

Better video quality isn't a significant advantage?
Even if not, enough things being released in only a new format usually can 
supply a reason to use it. The few people I know who don't care about video 
quality would have stayed with VHS if it weren't that some media (in addition 
to DVD-only releases, a lot of people prefer to author VideoCDs over VHS 
tapes) can only be played with a DVD player.
