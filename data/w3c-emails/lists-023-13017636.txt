The wording of the patent seems to specify that "at least a portion" of the
containing "hypermedia document" be displayed in the browser window.  

Do you agree that that's what the patent says?  

And if you do agree, does your original comment hold good?

Although I have not studied the scope of the patent in detail my
understanding under English Law (which is very similar to US Law) is that
apps which take over the whole of the browser window would still be covered.
The part of the window affected just happens to be 100% of it. By using the
term part they have covered everything down from 100%, Although most of the
definitions of the word imply that there must be more than one, Websters
Dictionary has as one of the definitions of the word "an exact divisor of a
quantity",. Mathematically a division of 1 is still a division.
