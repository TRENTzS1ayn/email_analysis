 Hmm question is, I know no on any working prototipe at that time. That is
the funny thing of soft patents. If Oct 17th 1994 someone ask the patent
maker to show exactly such thing I douft it to be able to do.

 Seriusly you american guys should ask for a working prototipe in every
patent. If diagrams are compulsory in hardware, source code should be
compulsory in software. Regretly the open source community does not
like patents, so it does not lobby for source code in the patents.

The question of triviality. If based on previous known developments, the
patent is trivial idea for a software ingeneer, it can also be dismissed, but
at major juridical effort.
