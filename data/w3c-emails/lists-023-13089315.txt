System for transmission of embedded applications over a network 

Abstract

A system and method for transmitting embedded applications over a network
is disclosed, wherein a user of a computer-controlled network client, such
as a remote control device used for controlling a network of
computer-controlled home entertainment devices, or a Web browser running
on a Web client, can request and receive compound documents that include
embedded applications and/or data files that can only be processed (i.e.,
imaged or played) by handlers that are not resident on the client. In
addition to embedded documents, the compound documents that are
transmitted over the network can reference flat files (e.g, image, audio,
or text files), and other compound documents. Whenever a client receives a
compound document, the client determines whether it has access to all of
the documents referenced in the compound document and, if not, requests
the documents to which it does not have local access. So that the multiple
documents embedded in a compound document can be simultaneously output by
the client to a multimodal output device, the requestor includes a
multi-tasking real-time kernel. This scheme allows a client user to
download documents from a server that include embedded applications, which
when executed on the client, allow the client to control the servers using
commands downloaded from the servers.
