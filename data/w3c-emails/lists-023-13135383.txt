The reference to launching and controlling a computer program within a
browser from a "first distributed hypermedia document" appears quite
frequently within all 10 claims of the patent. I'm inferring from other
posts and articles that a possible workaround to the Eolas patent is to
ensure that OBJECT tags only appear within the "second" distribution of
hypermedia content files.

 

If this is correct, then couldn't IIS and Apache servers be updated with a
new "Isolate OBJECTs from Pages" security setting that instructs server-side
filters to dynamically replace all OBJECT tags with nested FRAMEs, or use
the "CNN approach" to dynamically rendering <SCRIPT> tags in place of
OBJECTS that reference secondarily distributed javascript files for
dynamically rendering hypermedia content?
