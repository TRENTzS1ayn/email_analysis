This is really a pedantic interpretation of the patent, but if a "second"
hypermedia document is required as a workaround, perhaps a new HTTP request
header could be used so that compliant browsers would instruct servers to
reformat responses containing OBJECT tags into a secondary document.

(BTW- Ideally, I'd prefer a settlement between MSFT and Eolas to avoid such
a workaround altogether. My proposals are in no way meant discredit Eolas'
patent or deny their right to a "David and Goliath" battle for licensing
their alleged IP.)
