As I understand it, the problem (for Microsoft at least) is that the
*browser* infringes the patent so it has to have the capability to process
an OBJECT tag removed or modified so it doesn't work the same way. As such,
even if every server in the world was modified as suggested, the browser as
it stands would still be liable to a $1.47 per browser licence fee (because
it has the capability).

I would lose no sleep over Microsoft but, in principle, the same applies to
all other browsers. So, if all browsers have to be changed anyway, there is
no point in ALSO changing servers.

Neil.
