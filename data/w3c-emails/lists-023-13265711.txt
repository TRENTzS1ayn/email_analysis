Firstly, Eola is way off base with their patent claims and at least 5
years too late with their so-called "discovery." Their claims was already
being worked out at five years before they applied for their meritless
patent. But this is all another story....

Here is why I think Eola patent does not apply to modern browsers:

Eola bases their bogus patent claim on identifying hypermedia through the
URL. Basically, in their patent they identify a media application with the
URL http://foo.com/somemedia.mpg

Modern browser's don't work this way. For example, IE will load a media
player for somemedia.mpg with the URL http://foo.com/29sjsghegegasls
Why? Because unlike the Eola approach, modern browsers identify the object
being returned by the server not on the URL, but on the content headers.
Thus, browsers are not limited to what they can display as they would if
they used Eola's approach, and this I think is significant enough
difference between the two approaches to render modern browsers in the
clear.
