Hi,

W3C to study patent's threat to HTML

Patent Politics

Interesting tidbit from the second article:

Doyle's fervent belief in the patent system may be in his genes. His
grandfather used patents to protect more than 60 inventions in the
papermaking industry, including a 1918 "Paper-Machine," a 1949 "Pulp
Drainer" and a 1965 "Apparatus for Draining Fibrous Material."
