Jerry,

point taken, and apologies.

Here is the announcement, as it appeared on the W3C homepage on Sept 23:

> 
> Quotes:

> "The mailing list archives of the HTML PAG are member-only."
> 
> "This charter as well as the PAG report to the Director will be public. At
> regular intervals, the PAG should also provide status updates to the
> public."
> 
> "To communicate with the public, the PAG should use the
> public-web-plugins@w3.org list."
> 
> However the formation of the HTML PAG seems to have been announced via the
> press in the article that Richard Smith linked to:
> 
>   http://news.com.com/2100-1032-5082046.html
> 
> but not yet on this list.
> 
> Let's hope the status updates won't go the same way.
