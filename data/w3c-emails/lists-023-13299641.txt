i'm having a bit of a hard time with this private group thing. my livelihood
depends on this stuff and it would be nice to feel represented. are there

members?

Jerry,

point taken, and apologies.

Here is the announcement, as it appeared on the W3C homepage on Sept 23:

W3C Launches HTML Patent Advisory Group

    2003-09-23: Under W3C [76]Current Patent Practice, a Patent Advisory
    Group (PAG) has been launched to study issues for HTML-related Working
