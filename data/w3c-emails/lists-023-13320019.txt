Virgina,

if you look at the PAG charter, the group use this list 
(public-web-plugins) to communicate with the public
http://www.w3.org/2003/09/w3c-html-pag-charter.html#comms

This includes monitoring the list for input by the public.

As you can see from the "W3C Membership" page
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Prospectus/Joining

there are no ad-hoc or special memberships for W3C.

>>The charter is announced here:
>>
>>  http://www.w3.org/2003/09/w3c-html-pag-charter.html
>>
>>Quotes:
>>
>>"The mailing list archives of the HTML PAG are member-only."
>>
>>"This charter as well as the PAG report to the Director will be public. At
>>regular intervals, the PAG should also provide status updates to the
>>public."
>>
>>"To communicate with the public, the PAG should use the
>>public-web-plugins@w3.org list."
>>
>>However the formation of the HTML PAG seems to have been announced via the
>>press in the article that Richard Smith linked to:
>>
>>  http://news.com.com/2100-1032-5082046.html
>>
>>but not yet on this list.
>>
>>Let's hope the status updates won't go the same way.
