Why look for prior art? All that needs to be shown is that the claims were
already obivious and publically known. Anyone remember the old HTML
mailing list in the early 90's? That's where eoloas got all the material
for writing the patent. When Marc added <img> to Mosaic most thought that
wasn't enough and wanted <embed> and other tags. Marc said he didn't have
enough time to add <embed> then. So this shows where the ideas came from
and that they were all obivious and openly discussed by those who worked
with early HTML and browsers.
