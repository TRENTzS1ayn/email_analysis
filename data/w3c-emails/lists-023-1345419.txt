If you have any additional input on the Timed Text Authoring Format 1.0 Use
Cases and Requirement [1], we would like to hear about it by the start of our
next face-to-face meeting which will occur next week from Wed through Fri
(02/04 - 02/06).

We intend to wrap up our work on comments to this document at that meeting.

Regards,
Glenn Adams
