Of course.

Cookies were documented in RFC 2109 in 1997 with an open ended usage in
mind.   A specific usage can't lock anyone out from doing the same thing.
Nothing new in the process.

This is just yet another  "ignore this patent" patent.  Don't worry about
it.  If  Amazon is going to bother you, then you probably more of a threat
to them in general and if its anything like IBM, they won't bother you until
you hit 2% of their market share.

And the question is: is it still possible to comply with the cookie
RFCs without infringing this patent...
