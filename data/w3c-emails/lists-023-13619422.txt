Not to be outdone by Amazon's 1-Click patent, Microsoft snagged a patent from the USPTO Tuesday for a 'Time based hardware button for application launch', which covers causing different actions to occur depending upon whether a button is pressed for a short period of time, a long period of time, or multiple times within a short period of time. So does pressing car radio buttons for different periods of time to change or set stations constitute patent infringement?
