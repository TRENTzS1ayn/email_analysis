While I can't offer an answer on behalf of the HTML Patent Advisory 
Group constituted to address the Eolas patent, I can address the way 
that the W3C Patent Policy works.

Patent Advisory Group's are created when we become aware of a patent 
that is essential to a W3C Recommendation that is *not* available on 
royalty-free terms.[1] Our policy is focused on hte most serioius 
threats to interoperability. We do NOT create a PAG every time a patent 
is discovered that might read on a Web standard. The US Patent system 
being what it is, if we created a PAG for every patent allegedly related 
to the Web, we would have more PAGs than technical working groups. :-(

New Recommendations developed under the W3C's new patent policy will 
offer more (but not complete) licensing certainly. Our policy requires 
that from now on, all who participate in the development of a W3C 
Recommendation agree to license any essential patent claims they hold on 
a royalty-free basis.

FYI, our letter to the PTO said that we believed that there is a strong 
case that the patent is invalid and that that PTO should take action as 
quickly as possible to remove the damaging impact of the patent which 
should not have been issued in the first place.

We did not, as you incorrectly suggest, challenge Eolas' right to hold a 
patent in general on Web technology.
