I certainly didn't mean to be condescending.

As I understood you original note, you would like W3C to do something in 
particular about the particular patent application you cite. My response 
was simply to explain when we are or are not likely to look at a given 
patent. We're most concerned about patents that are actually being used 
to block compliance with W3C Recommendations, as Eolas is doing. If I've 
missed something, please clarify.
