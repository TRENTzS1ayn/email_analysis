Hi, 

Does any one have any idea of what the results were for the Jan 6, 2004
ruling to stay both the jury award and the modifications to IE? Like
many of you, our sites uses a lot of embedded plug-in code and I would
prefer not to implement the workaround if there is a stay.

Thanks,

FYI 

Friday's Chicago Tribune reported a federal judge will 
rule Jan. 6 on Microsoft's request to stay the jury's 
$520 million award until the USPTO reexamination is done.
