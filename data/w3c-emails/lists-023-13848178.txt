Yea, I do.  I wrote one in late '91'92ish., and on into '93.  I worked for a
small Energy Managment System dev. company out of Plymouth, MN.  I was the
'AI' expert and did a lot of programming in turbo prolog/PDC prolog cross
linking with C for my UI.  I leveraged the hypertext toolkit package
purchased through PDC (source code included).  The product ran in DOS text
mode, EGA, VGA.  It had 'intelligent' update "hooks" so the user of our EMS
software was being guided via the browser as he navigated through the
displays. I made extensive modifications to the source, and provided the
abilty (pre-windows 3.1) to embed graphics (I actually did demo in '91 for
my end of year AI project at Mankato State). Later (92-93), I built a new
hypertext engine from scratch to run in OS2 1.1 using the C language, and
provided a tagging scheme to embed graphs + images in the .PCX format.
These images were "external" from the document and pulled in and displayed
when the page was loaded.  I also provided the capabilty to create "program
links" that called external programs.  The OS2 version also had a DDE
interface so that a external process could promote navigation.
