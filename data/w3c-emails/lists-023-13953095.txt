Hello,

Twelve people attended the HTML Patent Advisory Group (PAG) [1] meeting
on 23 January 2004. The group approved the minutes for the previous
meeting. The agenda was a report from Microsoft on its plan to deploy a
modified Internet Explorer, as a consequence of the recent court
ruling. As Microsoft was not in attendance, the Chair proposed a
meeting on 30 January if Microsoft could attend. The meeting was
adjourned.

Microsoft was able to join the teleconference late and submitted a
postscript to the meeting minutes for the Chair. Microsoft reported
that at this time, it has no plans to release a modified Internet
Explorer (IE) and will continue to ship IE with its current
capabilities. Since Microsoft does not presently plan to modify IE as a
consequence of the '906 patent, it is not necessary to modify the HTML
specification to include a 'noexternaldata' attribute [2]. Microsoft
reported that if they believe that HTML changes are needed, they are
ready to document them and submit them to the W3C HTML Working Group [3].
Microsoft was ready to do so, but believes no changes to the HTML
specification need to be submitted to W3C at this time.
