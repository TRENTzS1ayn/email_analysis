The links to the PTO submissions cited by TheoDP all come from a very  
useful piece by Dale Dougherty, in which Dale explains:

I encourage those interested in the substance of this matter to have a  
look.

btw - I was confused at first by the presence of this link. I thought  
that the text TheoDP sent was from Dan Gillmor, distinguished columnist  
and blogger from the San Jose Mercury News. Actually, the text in  
Gillmor's blog is from TheoDP originally, so it's TheoDP's for a second  
time, not Gillmor's.
