A Microsoft attorney's e-mail tip to a Bloomberg reporter last week caused 
investors to yank their money [1] from Eolas Technologies Inc., which is battling 
the software giant for a $521 million patent infringement award. Eolas founder 
Michael Doyle called Eolas' widely reported setback at the USPTO a 'non-story' 
that Microsoft spun to its advantage as Eolas was closing a significant 
investment which would have covered expenses to defend the patent at the 
examiner's office.
