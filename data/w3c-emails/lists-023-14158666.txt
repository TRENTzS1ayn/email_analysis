Hello,

    The W3C HTML Patent Advisory Group (PAG) [1] has published its
    final report [2]. The PAG was chartered in 2003 to study HTML
    specification issues raised by the court case of Eolas v.
    Microsoft and US Patent 5,838,906. The HTML PAG recommended that
    the W3C Director contact the US Patent and Trademark Office
    (USPTO) and request a reexamination which is underway [3]. The
    USPTO made a preliminary report rejecting all claims [4]. Visit
    the HTML home page [5].

This information is archived at [6].
