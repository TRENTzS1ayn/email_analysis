Dear Glenn, all,

Please find attached the draft MPEG specification on timed text streams, 
provided within the W3C-MPEG liaison on this subject. The objective of 
MPEG is to complete the specification in the forthcoming July meeting of 
MPEG. Currently, the document is under ballot in MPEG. At the same time, 
review is taking place by 3GPP and IETF experts to further improve the 
specification within the context of harmonization between MPEG, 3GPP and 
IETF. You may note that the specification already has a very high level of 
commonality with the work of Jose Rey et al in IETF, see 
draft-rey-avt-3gpp-timed-text-02.txt. Input from your  timed text WG in 
W3C is of course very welcome as well. 

Best regards,

Jan van der Meer
