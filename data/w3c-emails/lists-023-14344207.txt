My response to the workshop is up on my blog: 
http://donxml.com/allthingstechie/archive/2004/04/28/645.aspx , and we can 
discuss them here, if you want, but I basically said "'bout freaking time". 

IMHO, you have 2 options, try to beat XAML out the door (unlikely at this 
point) or wait for it to hit the streets, learn from it's mistakes and make 
it better. 

I think Miguel de Icaza summed it up pretty well in his recent blog entry, 
Defining The Game:

<snip>
Although some of the discussion has centered around using a native toolkit 
like Gtk+/XUL to build a competitor that would have ISV sex-appeal, this is 
not a good foundation as it wont give us Web-like deployment (we need a 
stack that can be secured to run untrusted applications, and we need to be 
able to verify the code that is downloaded, which leaves us with Java or 
.NET).

The same statement holds true for "Web Applications and Compound Documents", 
since they are very much the same thing.
