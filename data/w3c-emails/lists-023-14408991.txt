In completion of Action 2004-06-2.1 (2004jun02.html#ACTION1), I am sending
the draft minutes to this mailing list.

I apologize for not having gotten the minutes out yesterday, due to illness.

In accordance with Action 2004-06-2.2 (2004jun02.html#ACTION2) please send
your corrections within one week to the list, or privately to Dean Jackson
<dean@w3.org>.

Leigh.
