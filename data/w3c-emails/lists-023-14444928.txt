Thanks to Lee for writing such detailed minutes, they're quite amazing.

My name is mispelled in both days' minutes, it should be: Charles Ying, 
Openwave Systems

In the section: 2004-06-02.Final Session.Straw Poll, my first comment 
should be changed to:

Charles Ying: I think the effort should be smaller. Test suites are an 
excellent start. The scope should initially deliver the integration of 
two fronts -- XHTML and SVG. Then we can look at next steps. That's for 
our market; but which standards depends on who is involved in the effort.

In the section: 2004-06-02.Final Session.Straw Poll, my second comment 
(after TVR's) should be changed to:

Charles Ying: Even integrating two core W3C standards (XHTML + SMIL) 
still needs an accurate conformance test suite and use cases. We need to 
solve issues like this first before addressing additional standards.

Thanks,
Charles
