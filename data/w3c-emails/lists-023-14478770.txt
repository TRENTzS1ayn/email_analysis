Enclosed is my postion paper: "The Future of the Web is not the Past of 
Windows"

XML is well-suited to GUI development.  In fact, I believe it is a natural 
way to describe application UI.  Often I see XML standards generate 
standardized user interface look and feel.  I present the position that 
today's web calls for an approach to application UI that supports the wide 
range of design that we see in web content today.
