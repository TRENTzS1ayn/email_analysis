Dear List,

I am not sure it is really the scope of this workshop but it is kind of 
related: some markup-languages have the ability to store semantic 
content aside of presentation content, even with a synchronization 
between the markup-trees.

MathML is such, for example, it allows MatML presentation to be endowed 
with IDs corresponding to IDs in the content-tree whose semantic is 
well defined.

Out of that, copy and paste can be achieved and this is what interests 
me...
I was wondering if copy-and-paste (and drag-and-drop) and the embedding 
of semantic-data (or references to) are of concern to this workshop ?

paul
