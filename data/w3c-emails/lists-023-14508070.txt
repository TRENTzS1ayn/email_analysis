I'm also concerned about large binary attachments to XML documents --
scanned color documents are often in the ten megabyte range, and the XML
metadata that accompanies them can be small -- a few kilobytes.

See the XForms 1.0 submission method multipart-post [1], which is built on
RFC 2387 [2].  I believe it is compatable with your proposals and allows the
XML chain to be used on the metadata even when the content is not
XML-accessible.
