Dear Compound-Documenters,

As the workshop is about to start, I seem to have found little (but I  
may have badly searched) about the capabilities to perform  
copy-and-paste.
Of course, I am meaning copy-and-paste of semantic data presented in  
some documents. Tim Berners-Lee actually nicely alluded the question  
[1]... is anyone speaking of this ?

I have tried to dive deeper on this topic for mathematics, see [2] and  
I would love other persons on the topic.

thanks

paul
