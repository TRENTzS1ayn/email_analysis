Hi:

Note that in Sect 6.1 the following reference under [IANASchemes] is to a
self-confessed retired page:

"Dan Connolly's list of URI schemes is a useful resource for finding
out which references define various URI schemes."

Would it be appropriate to distingush between normative and non-normative
(i.e. informative) references? If so, then the following would be an example
of a normative reference

"IANA's online registry of URI Schemes is available at
http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes."

while the Connolly resource (were it not retired) would be an informative
reference.

Tony
