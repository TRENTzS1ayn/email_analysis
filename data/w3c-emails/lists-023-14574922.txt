Tony,

For the moment, we don't distinguish between normative/informative
references because there is no conformance to this document. 

I think that the current organization of the references may be
confusing. We do intend to have a list of architectural references
(6.2). Section 6.1 used to be the list of normative references, but
then we eliminated conformance. "Internet Specifications" is not
a useful title for 6.1.

My sense (this morning) is that we should have two lists:

 a) References
 b) Architectural References

Thoughts?
