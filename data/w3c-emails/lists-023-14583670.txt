Hmm - good point. Was just mindful that DanC had mothballed that URI web
page (and also traded it in for a newer 'sexed-up' wiki model). And then
looking at the document I kind of wondered what a new reader would make of
it all. No distinction between REC, CR, WIP, etc. They would all pass
themselves off as authoritative. Whereas some docs have received
considerable scrutiny. Though as you say, there is no conformance
requirements.

Your suggestion looks interesting and I will noodle on it. Perhaps useful to
relegate the Internet side of things to a general infrastructural level.

Tony,

For the moment, we don't distinguish between normative/informative
references because there is no conformance to this document. 

I think that the current organization of the references may be
confusing. We do intend to have a list of architectural references
(6.2). Section 6.1 used to be the list of normative references, but
then we eliminated conformance. "Internet Specifications" is not
a useful title for 6.1.

My sense (this morning) is that we should have two lists:

 a) References
 b) Architectural References

Thoughts?
