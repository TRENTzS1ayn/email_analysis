In "6.3. Additional References", reference to SVG 1.1 [1] includes
a strange abbreviation of one of its editors,  x   x  :

  SVG11
    Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.1 Specification , J. Ferraiolo,  x . ,
    D. Jackson, Editors, W3C Recommendation, 14 January 2003,
    http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-SVG11-20030114/ . Latest version
    available at http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/ .

 x  is his family name, and  x  is his given name.  You can't abbreviate
his name like this.  Japanese names don't fit well with this citation
style, but I think just mentioning the family name (i.e.  x ) is fine.
