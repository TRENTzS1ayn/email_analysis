Picking a few more minor nits in References:

The IRI reference says [3]:

  IRI
    IETF Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), M. Duerst,
    M. Suignard, Nov 2002. This IETF Internet Draft is available at
    http://www.w3.org/International/iri-edit/draft-duerst-iri.html.
    If this document is no longer available, refer to the home page
    for Editing 'Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)'.

It is indeed spelled "Duerst" in that Internet Draft, but in "Authors'
Addresses" section the author noted as follows [4]:

   (Note: Please write "Duerst" with u-umlaut wherever possible, for
    example as "D&#252;rst in XML and HTML.)

I'd suggest to respect his wish.

The P3P10 reference [5] says "M. Marchiori, Editors", but there seems
to be only one editor.

There are references to IETF RFCs, but some of them refer to www.ietf.org
and others refer to www.rfc-editor.org .  The latter seems authoritative,
but in any case, I'd suggest to refer to RFCs consistently.
