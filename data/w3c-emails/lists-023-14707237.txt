RFC 2396 [1]:, section 3, talked about the sequence of four components
that makes up a URI:

        <scheme>://<authority><path>?<query>

The <authority> part is the "authority component." For HTTP URIs, 
this is the part after the double slash and before the next
slash. Section 3.2.3 of RFC 2616 [2] states that for http URLs:

  - Comparisons of host names MUST be case-insensitive;

Thus, "For http URIs, the authority component is case-insensitive."
