I have no doubt that there exists some inconsistent use of terms
within the webarch document.  However, the way to fix them is to
point to the individual inconsistencies using factual statements.
I have no respect for arguments that are based on taking single
examples out of context and making claims that they somehow define
the entire space in exclusion of all other potential examples.

Sometimes, yes.  I fail to see why the EXAMPLES that are provided in
the document are somehow DEFINITIVE for the entire space of resources,
or that the document must give equal weight to all examples of resources
and their interconnectedness.  You are simply assuming "for all" in 
cases
where no such assumption should be made, and not specifically 
identifying
cases where the document does make that assumption and should be fixed.

Where does it say that all resources are connected by networks?
Where does it say that all resources can be accessed?
Where does it say that all resources have a unique identifier?

Those are obvious contradictions with what has been written in
rfc2396bis, and if they exist in the webarch document then I want to
know where so that we can fix them.  I don't see them, but at this point
I've read the document too many times and my eyes tend to glaze over.

Do you really think that those words would be any less likely to be
misinterpreted?  In any case, entity is typically used to refer to
an embodiment of some type, and not all "things" are resources, so both
examples are more overloaded given what we want to use resources for in
the SemWeb.

We have already talked about why more of the rationale behind "resource"
is not in rfc2396bis.  To some extent, I have improved the definition
since then, as the number of obstructionists have decreased over time.
However, my recollection was that you could not come up with a 
definition
that was any better, nor any useful recommendations for better 
terminology.

Yes. (assuming the network protocols are only one part of an overall

No.  I have no idea what you are talking about here.

Yes, it does, though you seem to have trouble believing it.  Some people
use the term "resource" to mean people, others to mean "oil", still 
others
to mean "land", etc.  The one thing that the ordinary English sense of
the noun "resource" has in common is that a resource is a source of
supply or support within the context of a given system, whatever that
system might be.  A system like a "hypertext browser" is going to have
a very different set of resources than a system like a "theorem prover".
Nevertheless, the things that they operate on can be termed resources,
can be identified by the same system of identification (URI), and over
the past 10 years I have yet to encounter any other word that can
express the same sentiment in a reasonable number of characters.
Whether or not all systems can make effective use of all URIs is
completely irrelevant to whether or not a thing can be a resource
to one system.

In short, if you feel that "resource" means something other than the
above in the ordinary English sense, then please feel free to explain
what your sense of the English IS rather than simply complaining about
every definition that has ever been proposed.

I am surprised that a person working on the semantic web would assume
that all communities would use the same term in the same way, let alone
in the way that you claim (but have never actually shown).  I require
that the terms be defined and used consistently within the scope of
a given set of specifications, but you reject the definition AND then
complain that its usage is inconsistent with some imagined definition
based on the Web examples.  The inconsistency is in your assumption
that the examples are somehow covering the entire scope of what is
being described by the Web architecture.  The examples provide a way
of relating the concepts within the architecture to a familiar set of
behaviors and interactions within one system based on that architecture.
If you can think of additional examples that show a wider variety of
resources, preferably based on real systems rather than potential
future notions of what you think the SemWeb is about, then
please send them as your comments.

In fact, your entire tirade is basically taking one sentence,
reinterpreting a few of the words in a sense that artificially
bolsters your argument, and then claiming that those reinterpreted
definitions somehow restrict the semantic web.  I don't believe
your paper tiger has any bite, and if you took the time to read
the document without prejudice then maybe you could help identify
the places where the architectural principles are bogus (there are
a few) or where the prose overstates a practice as being universal
when it, in fact, is only applicable to one of the systems that
use the Web.  Those are valid and helpful comments.  Claiming that
you have a special understanding of the English language that differs
from that used in the document and  invalidates the work we have
put into describing the Web architecture, is not only unhelpful --
it is obviously wrong and I have shown you, many times, where your
claims about the meaning of words are a complete fiction.

Again, I have no idea what you are talking about.  Nobody on the TAG has
ever assumed that every entity has a unique True Name, though some
people (myself excluded) would like to require that every name have one
true interpretation, and most people agree that it is better to use one
name rather than several different names to refer to the same resource.
That does not prevent the assignment of multiple names to a resource,
nor does it ensure that names that have been assigned are used in the
way that they were intended, but it does state a preference that folks
should not be intentionally inconsistent in their use of names.

I assume that your comment on an unpublished philosophy of language
is based on prior messages I sent to you about the background of REST.
I assure you that what you are complaining about above did not originate
with me and has nothing whatsoever to do with REST or its background.
Since none of that background appears in this document, I'll just put
your comments down to an arrogant assumption that you can evaluate my
work even though you have never seen it and do not, in fact, have
any experience in related fields.  Maybe if you weren't so prejudiced
against finding any meaningful insight in the webarch document, you
could find time to comment on what is actually published rather than
on your assumptions about something you have never seen.

You documented the phenomenon?  Why don't you simply document the
instances where usage differs from definition?  The only things you
highlighted were simple examples used to relate the definitions to
the real world.  One solution would be to add more examples.

That is quite possible.  Not a useful comment, however.  It would
probably be more coherent if we wrote several different documents,
as suggested by another commenter, each one with an individual author
that can maintain consistent use of terminology throughout their
document.  In the long run, though, I doubt that would help attain
any sense of consensus, and in any case we barely have enough spare
time to collaborate on just one document.

That is, of course, a hopeless misinterpretation of the word connected.
Have you ever seen the BBC series (shown on PBS as well) on the history
of the world, called "Connections" (James Burke, 1978)?  For that 
matter,
just look it up in any dictionary:

     http://dict.die.net/connection/

I completely reject the notion that "interconnected" implies a physical
connection of any kind, just as I completely reject the notion that a
hypertext link (a reference that uses a URI) is in any sense a physical
notion that requires that the referent exists.  There is no basis for
your claims.

No.  Nobody here has ever said that all resources are connected to all
other resources, nor that all resources are accessible by means of
network protocols, nor that making a reference somehow guarantees
that operations on it will be successful.
