My point is not that there are clear inconsistencies. It is that

(1) the terminology is ambiguous and its intended meaning is unclear, 
and could easily be made clearer by giving some short non-circular 
explanations (I am unable to offer suggestions for wording precisely 
because I do not know what meaning is intended.)

(2) I can think of two distinct alternative systems of meanings, each 
of which is largely coherent; but

(3) on either of these readings, some parts of the document do not 
seem to make sense. The parts in question differ according to which 
reading one adopts, so again until the intended meaning is clarified 
I am unable to offer concrete suggestions for rewording better than I 
already have done.

I use the examples in the document only as presumed guides as to the 
intended meaning. If these examples are misleading, or nontypical, 
perhaps you could provide more typical examples as a guide to the 
reader?

(I apologize for the exasperated tone of that message - which , to

its use of UPPER CASE. I will try to restore the dialog to a more 
even tone in what follows.)

Look, please. I really, really do not know what this space is 
supposed to be. I am struggling to understand what it is that y'all 
mean by this word "resource". What else can I do, but take the 
examples given as intended to be explanatory? I am sure that you have 
a clear idea in your mind as to what you mean by this term, but it is 
not yet clear to me. Surely its not asking too much for you to give 
enough examples, or some words of explanation, to indicate what the 
range is that you intend your terminology to have?

>You are simply assuming "for all" in cases
>where no such assumption should be made,

Well then please can you give me some way to know when I can make 
such assumptions, or what the intended boundaries of this 'for all' 
are supposed to be? You give no definitions, so I have to rely on 
induction and interpretation and guesswork.

It does not say any of this clearly and unambiguously, I agree. But 
then it hardly says anything clearly and unambiguously (which is OK 
for this kind of a document, but does mean that readers are obliged 
to interpret). Nevertheless, it seems to clearly convey these ideas 
as somehow recommended or necessary.

>Where does it say that all resources are connected by networks?

The opening sentence
"The World Wide Web is a network-spanning information space of 
resources interconnected by links."
is surely intended to convey the idea of resources being things that 
are linked on a network, is it not? If this is supposed to be read as 
identical in meaning to the paraphrase "the WWW is a network-spanning 
information space of things interconnected by links." then it is 
almost painfully vacuous. Is this the way you mean it to be read??
But more generally, if resources are not connected by networks, what 
have they got to do with the Web, and why is this document talking 
about them?

>Where does it say that all resources can be accessed?

It seems to identify 'access' with 'identify', for example where it says

"A URI must be assigned to a resource in order for agents to be able 
to refer to the resource. It follows that a resource should be 
assigned a URI if a third party might reasonably want to link to it, 
make or refute assertions about it, retrieve or cache a 
representation of it, include all or part of it by reference into 
another representation, annotate it, or perform other operations on 
it."

On the face of it, using the normal meanings of words like 'refer' 
and 'operations', this seems to confuse two different ideas: that of 
describing something, and that of accessing or manipulating it. These 
ideas have got almost nothing to do with one another, so to see them 
mixed together in a listing like this is startling, and when I read 
this I was forced to think about what it could possibly mean. It 
would make sense if one were to identify access with reference, so I 
take it that this is what was intended. If it is not, could this be 
rephrased, so as to make the two senses more separate? [See later for 
more on this text.]

>Where does it say that all resources have a unique identifier?

Sorry about that last one, I phrased it badly. I know the document 
does not say that resources have a unique URI, ie that URIs cannot 
converge in identification; in fact it explicitly denies it. What I 
should have said is that the idea that resources must be identified 
by an unambiguous URI has no rational basis, etc.. As I have 
explained in earlier emails, with examples, it is not necessary to 
have an identifier for something in order to refer to it.

Yes, definitely. The WordNet definition of "resource" has three entries:

resource (as in "assets") n. : available source of wealth; a new or 
reserve supply that can be drawn upon when needed 

resource (as in "asset") n. : a source of aid or support that may be 
drawn upon when needed: "the local library is a valuable resource" 

resource (as in "inventiveness") n. : the ability to deal 
resourcefully with unusual problems; "a man of resource" 

which clearly indicate a particular sense, having to do with sources 
of support or enabling, a sense which is quite remote from anything 
'universal' such as thing or entity.  It lists 'asset' as a more 
general term, and "natural resources" as a more specific one.  I know 
of no usage of "resource" external to the W3C which gives that word 
anything like the scope that you use it with.

I take the general point that any word when used in a technical way 
may have to undergo a shift of meaning: but this just seems like an 
argument for giving a reasonably clear explanation of what its 
intended non-standard meaning is, when it is so used.

>  In any case, entity is typically used to refer to
>an embodiment of some type

Not in general English usage. WordNet again:

"entity (as in "entity") n. : that which is perceived or known or 
inferred to have its own physical existence (living or nonliving)  "

with, notably, no more general or synonymous terms and 21 (!) 
distinct more specific instances. (I think, speaking now as a 
philosopher manque, that 'physical' here is inappropriate, but 
whatever.)

>, and not all "things" are resources,

I am genuinely surprised by this, since I had thought that according 
to the broad interpretation preferred by Dan C and yourself, 
*anything* was a resource. Can you give me an example of a thing that 
is not a resource?

Of course I cannot come up with a definition, as I do not know what 
you mean by it. The only way I could offer a single definition would 
be by being telepathic. I tried my best to figure out what you meant 
and I was left with two alternatives, neither of them perfect and 
mutually incompatible. I tried to explain these two, and asked y'all 
if you could make your intentions more clearly known. I don't know 
what more I can do.

The particular thread you are now involved in arose from Dan C. 
claiming ( I think) that my alternatives were not incompatible, a 
position which I firmly disagree with, but which is different from 
the thrust of my comments of the architecture document (though 
obviously related to them.)

>, nor any useful recommendations for better terminology.

Well, I would suggest using a very plain word like "thing" ("entity" 
having been poisoned) if that is really what you intend to mean. If 
that makes some of the sentences seem rather flat and pointless, then 
take that to be a critique of the sentences rather than an 
justification of the use of a fancier word. Or, I have already 
suggested that you could use 'resource' in the very general sense, 
but clearly stated to be so intended, and use "source" for the more 
restricted sense (or Tim B-L's "web resource").

>>Is wood something which can be connected to a network-spanning 
>>information space by a link?
>
>Yes.

What??? I am gobsmacked by this response.  Can you explain or 
elaborate, if only briefly? What would it mean to connect to wood by 
a network link?

I can think of two possible meanings, just.

One is that there could be a representation of something wooden, say 
an image of woodgrain, such as those at 
http://www.rockler.com/ecom7/product_group.cfm?&objectgroup_id=173&catid=47
or an OWL ontology about wood, say. This is not what I meant by a 
link TO wood (but if it is what you mean, then that would help 
clarify a lot of other things in the document.)

Another is that there could be some piece of woodworking machinery, 
say a IIDA profile moulder, hooked up to a network in some kind of 
Web-connected automated woodshop, so that a network signal could 
cause some actual physical wood item to be cut and sanded, and then 
maybe have its surface sensed and a report on it sent back somewhere. 
Is this the kind of thing you mean, what might be called network 
robotics? If so, that isnt what I meant either: that might, at a 
stretch, be said to be a network connection to a particular piece of 
wood (I would dispute this, in fact, but I concede the case needs 
arguing) but it is not a network connection to wood, the generic 
concept of wood.

If you meant neither of these, then I am completely lost, and would 
REALLY like some explanation of what you did mean.

>
>>Is wood something on which operations can be performed by means of 
>>network protocols?
>
>Yes. (assuming the network protocols are only one part of an overall system)

Again, can you explain? (What does it even mean to perform operations 
on wood? ie , wood in general, as opposed to a particular piece of 
wood.)

>

>>would that claim even MEAN? what could it POSSIBLY mean? )

Sorry, forget the 'unique'. Must wood be identified by a URI? (If so, 
do you happen to know it? The URI for wood, I mean, the URI which 
identifies the resource corresponding to the meaning of the English 
word "wood".  Who owns that URI? Who owns that resource?)

Those are all instances of resources, yes. None of them is 
identifiable with the concept of resource itself. But perhaps I am 
being too picky. Onward....

>The one thing that the ordinary English sense of

A source of supply or support (or use), yes. Within a system, no. The 
normal English meaning of "resource" makes no reference to a 'system'.

>  A system like a "hypertext browser" is going to have
>a very different set of resources than a system like a "theorem prover".
>Nevertheless, the things that they operate on can be termed resources,

Fine, OK.  The things they OPERATE ON can be, yes. The things they 
REFER TO are something else altogether.  So the weather report about 
Oaxaca might well be a resource, but the actual weather is not (and 
neither is Oaxaca).  Please keep this distinction clear: that is all 
I am asking you to do, in fact.

But now I have to do a gear shift. Until now, you seemed to be saying 
that "resource" had to be understood in the broadest sense possible, 
and this is what Dan C was arguing in the message I was replying to, 
and is the sense that (partly on Dan's advice) I wrote into the RDF 
semantics, where "resource" just means "anything and everything". Now 
you seem to be saying that "resource" means what the word indeed 
suggests, which is "things that can be operated on via the network" 
or maybe "things that can be of use on the network" or some such. 
That is my C sense, where resources are things that in some (perhaps 
generous) sense can be accessed and operated on by computational 
operations. It is not the broader sense of things in general, the 
entire contents of the universe of discourse, that Dan C (and until 
now, I thought, you) wanted it to mean.  I am VERY happy with the 
narrower interpretation. So, great: resources are things that can be 
operated on by Web applications. If the architecture document could 
clearly indicate that it is meant to be understood as talking about 
the things that applications operate ON, not what they refer TO, it 
would mostly (ie with a small amount of pruning) make perfect sense 
and I am sure would be a valuable document which was in fact about 
what it claims to be about, viz. architecture, rather than semantics.
Some of the language needs to be adjusted to avoid it being 
mistakenly interpreted as saying something much stronger than (I now 
think) it is intended to say.  For example:

"A URI must be assigned to a resource in order for agents to be able 
to refer to the resource. It follows that a resource should be 
assigned a URI if a third party might reasonably want to link to it, 
make or refute assertions about it, retrieve or cache a 
representation of it, include all or part of it by reference into 
another representation, annotate it, or perform other operations on 
it."
-->
"A URI must be assigned to a resource in order for agents to be able 
to perform operations on the resource. It follows that a resource 
should be assigned a URI if a third party might reasonably want to 
link to it, retrieve or cache a representation of it, annotate it, or 
perform other operations on it."

BTW, if you can confirm that I have this right, I would be willing to 
go through the entire document and suggest minimal changes to the 
text to clarify this meaning, as a top priority (it would take me a 
couple of days). I could edit the HTML directly if that would be 
helpful.

Well, OK, as long as we can be clear about that sentiment. That is my 
C sense, not the D sense. I'll assume that this is the sense 
intended, in the rest of my comments.  But then you cannot reasonably 
expect me to accede to your often-repeated claim that a resource is 
anything with an identity, which is way too inclusive. Which sense do 
you want to use?

I agree, and I never intended to say otherwise. My complaints have 
been about a different point entirely.

No, I have been complaining about the fact there there is no 
definition. "Anything with an identity" is not a definition (and 
apparently is wrong, given what you say above, if I follow you.)

Ok, this is a good point. I think that part of the communication 
problem is that I have no idea what you see as being the scope of Web 
architecture. I can only guess at it from the text you provide. I 
have the sense (from reading your thesis and other documents) that 
you are concerned not to overly restrict the architectural 
description, given the undeniable fact that the growth and 
development of the Web places stress on any attempt to restrict or 
constrain it by describing it in terms of any old, or even present, 
set of categories; and I respect this concern: but I think that in 
trying to avoid being restrictive,.you may have, perhaps 
inadvertently, set the boundaries too wide. Your description tries to 
encompass too much: by tossing naming and reference into the same bag 
as network identification of resources (in your sense given above), 
you have implicitly claimed (or at any rate can be easily read as 
claiming) that referring to things is similar to accessing them or 
performing operations on them; but it isn't.

That is not fair. I have given a detailed analysis of the text, 
trying as clearly as I know how to explain why parts of it seem to be 
inconsistent with other parts, and offering in some cases alternative 
wordings.

None of this would matter much if the document were not so important 
and so authoritative, but it is: it will be cited for years to come 
as holy writ, and sentences taken from it will be cited to justify WG 
decisions and to object to proposals, and so on. And so it has (you 
have) a rather unenviable responsibility to make sure that it does 
not say things that are harmful. And it seems to me that at present 
it does, or at any rate can be readily interpreted to be saying them. 
For a major example, it says "A URI must be assigned to a resource in 
order for agents to be able to refer to the resource." which, as I 
have explained, is not true; and in fact is *perniciously* not true, 
in that if it were true then an entire useful technology would be 
impossible (applications which are able to determine referents by 
reasoning).

I have tried, believe me. I have spent more time than I want to

as to make it make sense.

I have very little to say about the architectural principles, and my 
opinions on them wouldnt be worth much in any case (I did make a lot 
of detailed comments on aspects of the wording in my first long 
email, but have no more to add about those). My worries here are 
almost all to do with the *semantic* implications of the text as it 
is written. Maybe you have no interest in these aspects of the text, 
or did not intend to convey any semantic implications, which is fine: 
but then all I am asking you to do is to clarify this.

The only one I'd reiterate is the criticism of the idea that URIs 
must be opaque. The more I think about that, the worse it gets.

I beg to differ on that point, but let us not squabble. I do not 
claim any special understanding of English, but I would claim a 
reasonable mastery of the language and have read most of the major 
dictionaries (I collect them), and I have never intended to 
invalidate anything. While we are being ad hominem, I would venture 
to suggest that if your attitude were less defensive then we might 
make progress a little faster. All I have ever asked for is more 
clarity and less ambiguity, which you have now apparently provided, 
thanks very much.

Well, I can resonate with that point. Still, other WGs have managed 
to reach consensus on difficult issues.

Yes, of course, and in keeping with the rather facile nature of that 
series, its title is merely a pun. But I will try to take you 
seriously. You are saying, then, that when the architecture document 
uses words like 'connect' and 'interconnected', that this is intended 
to be understood in the broadest possible way, so that an 
'interconnection' between A and B could be something as evanescent as 
the fact that a mention of A reminds someone of B, or that the ideas 
of A and of B might be associated in someone's imagination. Do I have 
that right? Because that is what you seem to be implying here (and 
your dictionary, cited below, has the sense
  5: the process of bringing ideas or events together in memory
         or imagination; "conditioning is a form of learning by
         association" [syn: association, connexion]
being the only one which does not imply some kind of causal 
connection between the things connected.)

But if this is indeed what you mean, what has this got to do with the 
Web, or computational architecture, at all? Why aren't you, in this 
case, making shallow entertainments like James Burke, rather than 
writing authoritative documents about the Web?  And if this is not 
what you mean, what do you mean?

To fully capture the English sense one ought indeed to use 'causal' 
rather than 'physical', but with that modification, I would stand by 
my interpretation. Read that definition again: of the 9 senses given, 
the only possible more general sense is number 5, quoted above.

But aside from definition-challenging, surely the use of the 
'connect' word in an architecture document is supposed to connote 
some kind of *architectural* connection? If not, I REALLY do not know 
what the document is supposed to be saying.

Wrong. A hypertext link is not a REFERENCE that uses a URI. It is a 
LINK that uses a URI, or is made by using a URI (Im genuinely not 
sure of the right way to state this in architectural language, but 
'reference' is semantic language.)  Referring is not an architectural 
or computational concept: it has to do with the meaning of language. 
A reference using a URI is the use of a URI to denote, to refer to, 
something, not the use of a network transfer protocol to fetch 
something. The two may coincide in many cases, but the coincidence is 
just that, not a necessary identity: they are not the same concept. 
If I use the name "Roy T. Fielding" in some plain HTML body text, it 
is a reference to you. If I enclose it in an <a> element with a href 
hyperlink to your website, the reference is unchanged, but the link 
is new.

I never said it did. We are at cross purposes. However, surely it is 
the case that a (successful, ie not a 404 error) hypertext link does 
require the resource identified by the URL in the link to exist.  (If 
not, how does the GET protocol work, exactly?)

Neither did I say or imply any of this. We seem to be talking 
entirely past each other. My point is not that reference does not 
guarantee the success of performing operations, but that it has 
nothing whatever to do with performing operations. The two sets of 
ideas, of (access and operations) and of (reference and denotation) 
are almost completely unrelated. They shouldn't even be discussed in 
the same document: they have nothing to do with one another.

I think in fact that you might agree with this, if we could bring our 
discussion to a point of mutual understanding. I have no desire to 
interfere with your architectural work or analysis, but please don't 
confuse it with semantics. The Web needs both, and needs to get them 
both more or less right.
