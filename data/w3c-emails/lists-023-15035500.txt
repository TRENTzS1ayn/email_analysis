The quoted paragraph is untrue (the word "must").
OWL permits reference to uniquely identified resources without them 
having a URI. (through the use of functional and inverse functional 
properties)
Suggest a minimal rewording of insert "easily"
i.e.
"A URI must be assigned to a resource in order for agents to be able to
  easily refer to the resource. It follows that a resource should be 
assigned a  URI if a third party might reasonably want to link to it, 
make or refute assertions about it, retrieve or cache a representation 
of it, include  all or part of it by reference into another 
representation, annotate it, or perform other operations on it."

Although my preference would be to take Pat's comments seriously which 
may require greater rewording.

OWL's use of Functional and InverseFunctional Properties is a simple 
example of this, I can flesh this out if it is helpful.
