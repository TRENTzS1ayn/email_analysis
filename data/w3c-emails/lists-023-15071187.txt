Hello,

In preparation for the TAG's face-to-face meeting this week, I've
made available the 10 May 2004 Editor's Draft of the Architecture
Document:
   http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2004/webarch-20040510/

This draft supersedes the 7 May draft; I incorporated a few extra
changes I had wanted to make based on TAG resolutions.

The remainder of this email includes information about:

 1) Diff resources
 2) List of issues addressed

Below there is a list of names and issue URIs. If your name is
on the list (and in the "To" line above), it means that this
draft MAY address the issues that you raised that are listed
below. Each issue URI points to details of the proposal to
address your issue.

Although the TAG has not yet agreed to these proposals,
I welcome your comments about proposals that concern your
issues; please send those comments to public-webarch-comments@w3.org. In
particular, please indicate whether the text as proposed satisfies you
for that issue or
how it might be edited to satisfy you.

Thank you,

 - Ian

   I did not incorporated the following editorial suggestions
   from Patrick:

     Section 3.2, para 1, last sentence:

        Consider changing to "A message may even include metadata
        about the message itself (for message-integrity checks, for
        instance).

     Section 3.3.1, last para, last sentence:

        This last sentence could either be removed or
        clarified/reworked.

   I did not implement the suggestion that the media type for
   the first example be changed from "application/xhtml+xml"
   to the simpler "text/html" (although I did fix the graphic
   and text to be consistent).

   http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2003/lc1209/issues.html#schema1

   http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2003/lc1209/issues.html#schema21

   For schema4, the Schema WG asked for a stronger statement
   along the lines of "Don't use content negotiation", which I
   did not add.

   For schema21 (editorial issues), I did not address these points:

    [3.5.1] We are surprised to not see a best practice
            recommendation here.

    [4.5.3] (And elsewhere) If namespace prefixes are used, there
            should be a table indicating their bindings to URIs.

    [4.5.6] and [4.5.8] highlight a lot of problems, but make no
            recommendations about what to do about them.

   I did not remove the shadow from the illustration as Michael
   recommended.
