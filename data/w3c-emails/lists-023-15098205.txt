I'm happy with the proposed text as it currently stands.

I'm happier with this text, though the sentence "Just as promoting a
shared vocabulary..." sets up an analogy I don't understand.

I cannot tell whether any change has been made to this text in the
latest Editor's Draft; thus, I'll reserve comment till a later point.

The language that the Editor plans to add sounds like an improvement.

Please take these comments as advice to the Editor; I reserve the
right to change my mind if the final text differs from this
significantly. :>
