I would feel much happier with this draft if some of the fundamental
issues that Pat Hayes has pointed out had been addressed.  Without
resolution of these issues I don't see any point in the document.

As a particular illustrative example that leapt out at me while I was
reading the document, I quote, from Section 1

Each resource is identified by a URI.

and from Section 2

Resources exist before URIs; a resource may be identified by zero
URIs.
