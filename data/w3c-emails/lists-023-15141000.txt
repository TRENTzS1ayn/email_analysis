Regarding TAG issue booth1,
http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2003/lc1209/issues.html#booth1
I am satisfied that the TAG has adequately considered the issue.

Although I still believe the WebArch definition of "agent" differs from 
common usage in computer science (because the WebArch definition includes 
people), I do not object to the WebArch document going forward with its 
current definition.
