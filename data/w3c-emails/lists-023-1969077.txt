I think the terminology here (URI,URL) is itself indicative of the 
different masters.

I may be on shaky ground here, but it seems to me that there is no 
fundamental difference between an  identifier and an address in 
that:  given enough infrastructure, any identifier can be used as an 
address, and any address can serve as an identifier (modulo scoping 
issues).  So, in this respect, one might view URLs as URIs for which the 
corresponding locating infrastructure happens to exist.

(BTW, I didn't mean "glorified address" to be dismissive, though it now 
reads that way to me.  Rather, it was the idea that a URL can encompass the 
structure of any existing addressing scheme.)
