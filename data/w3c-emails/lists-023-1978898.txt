>Dear Members of the Technical Liaison Group for ICANN,
>
>Let me introduce myself.  I am Chair of the ICANN Nominating Committee and 
>seek your help
>in the Outreach of the Committee.  The list of addressees is the most 
>recent information I
>have on the composition of the Technical Liaison Group. If I have 
>overlooked someone or if
>there have been changes, I would appreciate your letting me know.  Here is 
>my request.
>
>Would you please arrange for the following message to be conveyed to the 
>members of the organizations
>which you represent on the Technical Liaison Group.?
>
>We, the ICANN Nominating Committee (NomCom), have just posted our Formal 
>Call for
>Recommendations and Statements of Interest  for the ICANN positions NomCom 
>will select.
>Please see 
><http://www.icann.org/committees/nom-comm/formal-call-05apr03.htm>http://ww 
>w.icann.org/committees/nom-comm/formal-call-05apr03.htm This
>information has also been distributed via the ICANN Announce list.
>
>We would like to send a special invitation to the members of the 
>orgnizations represented
>in the Technical Liaison Group to submit as individuals their 
>recommendations and statements of
>interest for the positions NomCom will fill. The success of this new 
>Nominating Committee process
>depends on the active participation of members of the Internet community, 
>and we are eager to
>encourage your attention to this opportunity.
>
>Our timeline is short because our goal is to be able to seat the New Board 
>and NomCom-selected members
>of the GNSO Council and Interim ALAC at the conclusion of the Montreal 
>ICANN meeting June 22-26, 2003.
>
>We believe you will find in the posted Formal Call the information needed 
>about NomCom, about the positions
>to be filled, the eligibility and criteria that apply, the review process, 
>and how to respond to this invitation.
>But we do understand that questions will arise and we would like to engage 
>directly with members
>in our recruiting.
>
>NomCom is therefore offering to participate in teleconferences organized 
>by groups such
>as those you represent to help launch the Nominating Process. If you would 
>like me and some of the NomCom
>members to participate in one of your teleconferences, please contact me 
>via email. If you have
>other suggestions for how we could reach out to such groups, we would 
>welcome your bringing them
>to our attention.
>
>NomCom will be posting Frequently Asked Questions with their answers on 
>the NomCom web page 
><http://www.icann.org/committees/nom-comm/>http://www.icann.org/committees/ 
>nom-comm/  and invites comments via email
>to <mailto:nomcom.comments@icann.org>nomcom.comments@icann.org
>
>We encourage all those interested in this new Nominating Committee process 
>to visit our webpage and to
>subscribe to 
><mailto:nomcom.announce-request@icann.org>nomcom.announce-request@icann.org 
 > to receive notice of news from the Committee.

>We look forward to hearing from you and your colleagues.
