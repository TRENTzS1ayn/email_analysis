Martin,

I'm integrating the results of my 19 Mar request for schedule info
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-uri-cg/2003Mar/0002.html
into the group schedule
  http://www.w3.org/2001/12/URI/#Schedule

and I don't see any reply to my question about charmod/iri
schedules.

Could you add some date estimates to stuff like...

"The W3C Character Model is being prepared for Candidate Recommendation,
and will then be moved towards Recommendation status, by the Core task
force.

The IRI Internet-Draft is being prepared for submission to the IESG to
move it to IETF Proposed Standard, by the Core task force."
