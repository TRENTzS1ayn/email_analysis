Re-reading about URI related issues
(http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/HTTP-URI.html) in the
context of RDF URI identities, I thought of another
way to separate abstract concepts from references to
the web page itself.

By adding or removing the "www." to the domain name,
one could clarify if the URI referenced indicated an
abstract concept (no "www.") or the web page itself
(with "www.").

Of course, I understand that this solution could not
be assumed to work with the current web, but it might
provide a platform for future default of semantic
identity references.
