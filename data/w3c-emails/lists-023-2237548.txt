As our first item of business, I'd like
to input to the group schedule
  http://www.w3.org/2001/12/URI/#Schedule
from each of the related groups:

I can't think of any scheduled TAG events,
though there are some issues I think we
should be tracking...

http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ilist#IRIEverywhere-27
http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ilist#uriMediaType-9
http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ilist#URIEquivalence-15

and our charter calls for us to get the TAG
to review
  http://www.w3.org/TR/uri-clarification/

Norm, any schedule input from XML Core? I gather
there some URI issues in some of the XML specs
reaching end-game. While ideally we'd get involved
in planning last call, and I think those specs are
past that, I'd like an estimate of when their
next state transition will happen anyway.

Hmm... I noted an issue w.r.t. XML Query the other day...

  why the special case for % in fn:escape-uri?

Perhaps we should be getting some more uri-eyeballs
on the XQuery spec. The reply I got was pretty
critical of URI specs... though I don't think
it's all that unreasonable:

"I have to say that I find the various RFCs on URI syntax incredibly
difficult to follow, and in many places ambiguous or contradictory. Since
there seems to be a belief that URIs are the foundation on which the web is
built, I would be much more comfortable if the specs were rock-solid rather
than shifting sand. With the escape-uri() function (and the rules for URI
escaping in XSLT serialization) we've done the best we can, but it's pretty
flakey stuff."


Martin, when should we expect the IRI and charmod
specs to do their next thing? Any other I18N WG
stuff for the schedule?

Leslie, Michael, I think Larry's announcement of the URI BOF
covered the IETF for the most part; anything to add?

Mark, what's on the horizon for OpenURL?

Ray, any events in the library community we should know
about? Any opportunities to present stuff, or opportunities
to recruit review resources or whatnot?
