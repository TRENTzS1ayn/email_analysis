/ Dan Connolly <connolly@w3.org> was heard to say:
| Norm, any schedule input from XML Core? I gather
| there some URI issues in some of the XML specs
| reaching end-game. While ideally we'd get involved
| in planning last call, and I think those specs are
| past that, I'd like an estimate of when their
| next state transition will happen anyway.

The IRI issue is the only one that comes immediately to mind. That's
escalated to the TAG already as the director pressed back at the last
call telcon.

| Hmm... I noted an issue w.r.t. XML Query the other day...
|
|   why the special case for % in fn:escape-uri?

Another one. 

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-xml-query-wg/2003Mar/0301.html

It doesn't seem to be threaded very well in the archives, so you may
need to scan forward a bit as well.

In brief:

The XSL/XML Query WGs added a document-uri() function to return the
URI of a document. This is distinct from the base-uri() so that one
can use it to distinguish between documents in a collection that might
have the same base-uri().

It was suggested that this always be an absolute URI. I pointed out
that it's possible to construct a circumstance in which the absolute
URI is not available (but URI experts could demonstrate that I'm
wrong, which would suit me fine). The new proposal is that "" be
returned if an absolute URI isn't avialable. Feh.

| Ray, any events in the library community we should know
| about? Any opportunities to present stuff, or opportunities
| to recruit review resources or whatnot?

There's the whole OASIS thing: http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xri/

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
