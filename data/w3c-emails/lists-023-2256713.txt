Massimo,

I gather you're reviewing some CORES stuff
for the European Commission and there's an
event 3 Apr.

This document is somehow relevant, I gather...
http://www.cores-eu.net/interoperability/cores-resolution/cores-resolution.pdf

I'm not sure what CORES is, but it sounds like
something that perhaps the W3C URI CG should
be aware of.

Would you please fill is in?

In case you're not familiar with this group, see...
