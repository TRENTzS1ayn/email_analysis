Actually, Norm was quoting me there, but no matter...

A few things come to mind:

(1) We could increase the visibility of "how that earlier
debate was eventually resolved" by following thru on our
obligation to get
  http://www.w3.org/TR/uri-clarification/
reviewed (and perhaps promoted to W3C REC) by the W3C TAG

I have that scheduled for the June timeframe
  http://www.w3.org/2001/12/URI/#Schedule

The action to do that naturally falls to me, as TAG
liaison, but as I'm carrying a number of other balls,
I'd appreciate if somebody would perhaps take this
one the first few yards for me.


(2) I'd like to know about upcoming opportunities to chat
with OpenURL folks. When/where do they meet next?
Do they have periodic meetings?

(3) Perhaps there are influential members of the OpenURL
communities that we could invite to upcoming IETF or W3C
events. The W3C TAG meets face to face in July, though
this seems like an awkward fit at best for their agenda.
Ah... better yet, the next IETF is in July too...
  57th IETF - Vienna, Austria
               (July 13-18, 2003)
