Hello Ray,

If the OpenURL people have concluded that to register new schemes
or URN namespaces is very difficult, then I think they are wrong.

I think deployment of new schemes/namespaces is difficult, but
that's a different issue. For registration, a decent registration
document and some thoroughness in following through is mostly
what is needed.

So I think it would be worth to find out more about whether your
suspicion is true, and how it could be corrected.


Regards,    Martin.
