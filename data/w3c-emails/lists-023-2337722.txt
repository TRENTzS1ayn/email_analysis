Sometime ago, I got a call from Pat Harris, of NISO,
wanting to do some coordinating with IETF, W3C and
OpenURL folk over the NISO standards work in this area.

I said, sure, let's telechat.  I haven't heard anything
from her in weeks (and her mail responder says she
won't be back until May 27), but I began to wonder --
has anyone from W3C-land heard from her?  Anyone else
aware of an effort to have a conversation?

I'm still trying to get a grip on where the points of
overlap with teh IANA registry are (and oughtn't be).
