Leslie

this came up because of a conference call I was participating in with NISO -
Im also on the W3C URI CG and this was raised there as well - I sent a note
to the chair of the OpenURL committee about this but havent gotten a
response for him yet either

Ill let Pat continue to coordinate this from the NISO site since I think
some of what she wants to talk about is more general then OpenURL - but
there are some OpenURL specific issues that need discussion

Sometime ago, I got a call from Pat Harris, of NISO,
wanting to do some coordinating with IETF, W3C and
OpenURL folk over the NISO standards work in this area.

I said, sure, let's telechat.  I haven't heard anything
from her in weeks (and her mail responder says she
won't be back until May 27), but I began to wonder --
has anyone from W3C-land heard from her?  Anyone else
aware of an effort to have a conversation?

I'm still trying to get a grip on where the points of
overlap with teh IANA registry are (and oughtn't be).
