I recently sent a heads up [1] to the chairs list concerning review of 
RDFCore's 2nd last call documents which contained an error, assuming 
there was a URI WG in W3C.

RDFCore are seeking appropriate review of its 2nd last call WD's and I 
would like ask the uri-cg where we should seek reviews of these 
documents.  Aspects of the documents that may be of interest to this 
group are the use of xml:base (which has not changed significantly since 
1st last call) and internationalization of URI's.
