Seems in order, yes...

Which one is that? ah yes... Guidelines for new URL Schemes ...
need to cite that under
"How do I register a new URI scheme?" in
  http://esw.w3.org/topic/UriSchemes

Note that I'm moving the parts of
http://www.w3.org/Addressing/* that are supposed to represent
community consensus into the ESW Wiki to subject them
to WikiConsensus.

I'm also reviewing the URI CG schedule
  http://www.w3.org/2001/12/URI/#Schedule

It's not going very quickly, but I hope you can see that
there's movement...
