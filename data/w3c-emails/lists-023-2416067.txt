Would you please submit it again, Mark? If it's
not straightforward for you to do, let me know
and I'll try to remember how to do that.

The relevant TAG issue is still pending...
  http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/ilist#uriMediaType-9

Freed took an action in March
  http://www.w3.org/2003/03/13-ietf-w3c.html#iana-uri

but I haven't heard much about it since, and we
neglected to review that action in the June
meeting.
  http://www.w3.org/2003/06/17-w3c-ietf

The next meeting of that forum is today.

Meanwhile, people continue to ask...
 "What single,  stable, and widely used name should I use
  to refer to the text/plain mime type?"

Michael, you mentioned "RFC 3553 (BCP 73) which recommends someting
like this structure:

urn:ietf:params:media-types:application:vnd.kde.kword"
-- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2003Oct/0082.html

which is at odds with the impression I got from
the March 2003 W3C/IETF coordination call...

"draft-connolly-w3c-accessible-registries asks IANA to maintain
dereferencable and persistent URIs as identifiers. Masinter: presumption
is that this will be advanced as BCP."
 -- http://www.w3.org/2003/03/13-ietf-w3c.html#iana-uri

Ah... I see you weren't at that meeting.

Hmm... this URI CG hasn't had a teleconference yet, but I'm
starting to see a number of motivations to put one together.
