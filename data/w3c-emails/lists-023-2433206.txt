Michael,

On Wednesday, we talked a bit about scheduling a URI
CG telcon; we talked about next Friday (16 Oct) and
I said I'd do something today, as W3C process
calls for 7 days notice, and as I'd like to invite
some folks that aren't URI CG members, so does
common courtesy.


Turns out I'm in an all-day meeting on the 16th.

Norm, I tried to call you about this today, but
I didn't manage.

Maybe I'll make progress on telcon-tiddlywinks next
week, but for today, I'm afraid I give up.
