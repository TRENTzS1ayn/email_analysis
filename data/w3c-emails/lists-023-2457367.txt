Looks very nice, Dan, and thanks!

I think it would be very useful to also include a pointer to *proposed*
schemes,  something like waht Michael has included for URNs at
http://uri.net/urn-nid-status.html where the status is also shown. I don't
know if such a page exists, but it ought to. Then folks could find out how
'info' and 'doi' are coming along! (Or that they even exist.)

And on the subject of URNs, I'd like to see a link to that page too. You
might not like that suggestion, as it singles out one particular uri scheme
for special attention, but I would suggest it for any for scheme that has
subordinate namespaces. There doesn't seem to be an easy way to find that
page. (I have to spend 5 minutes every time I want to find it, beginning
with google; I know I should bookmark it, but my bookmarks always get lost.)
