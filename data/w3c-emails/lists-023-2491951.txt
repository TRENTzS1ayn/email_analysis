Ladies and Gentlemen,

Having completed the review of its first last call comments and made 
substantive changes to its specifications,  the RDFCore WG is aiming 
shortly to publish second last call WD's.  There will be 6 documents:

   rdf primer
   rdf concepts
   rdf/xml syntax
   rdf schema
   rdf semantics
   rdf test cases

RDFCore hopes to publish these documents on 13 Oct 2003 which will be 
substantially the same as the current WD's [1] published on 05 Sep 2003.

The first last call [2] requested comments specifically from the 
following groups:

XML Core   (handling of xml:base)
XML Schema (datatypes solution)
URI WG     (handling of xml:base)
i18n
XMLSIG
XHTML      (relating RDF meta data to XHMTL web pages)
SVG        (relating RDF meta data to SVG web pages)
XMLP       (Carrying RDF over XMLP)
P3P        (Social Meaning)
WAI
RDFIG
WEBONT

and again we will invite these groups specifically to comment.  I would 
note however, that the Social Meaning section has been removed from the 
specifications. Of course we will welcome comments from all groups.

I am writing to ask which groups intend to comment on these 2nd last 
call WDs and how much time they will need.  As an indication of the 
amount of effort involved, we believe that most of the documents are 
substantially the same as the first last call documents, with the most 
extensive changes being in the semantics document.  I am investigating 
tools for the creation of HTML diffs to ease the reviewing process, and 
would welcome advice from other chairs on appropriate tools to use.

RDFCore would like to have a short second last call period (well, who 
wouldn't) and in an ideal world we would like to close the last call 
period after three weeks on 03 Nov 2003.  We would be grateful if you 
indicate that you will be able to provide comments in that timeframe.
