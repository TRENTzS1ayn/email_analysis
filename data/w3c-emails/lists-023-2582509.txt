My appologies if I should know the answers to these questions:

1. http://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes, this is an
*authoritative* list of *approved* URI schemes, yes?
2.  is there an *authoritiative* procedure by which a proposed scheme
is added to this list?
3. Is there an *authoritiative* list of *proposed* schemes that are
undergoing this approval process?

Thank you, and again my appologies, as I should probably know the
answers to these questions, but I don't.
