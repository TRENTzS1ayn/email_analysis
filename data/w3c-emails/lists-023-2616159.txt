Just a thought...

Recently, a proposal [1] for registering message header fields was approved 
as BCP (yet to be published as RFC), which provides for a "provisional" 
registry as a way to address this kind of issue.  Maybe consider something 
similar for URI schemes?

I note an argument against this is that it might appear to encourage a 
proliferation of URI schemes, which would have costs not associated with 
message headers.  (TOH, maybe better to proliferate in public view than in 
private enclaves?)

(This is my personal website copy, I can't get to the IETF I-D search 
engine right now, and it seems the IETF-announce message archives have been 
moved yet again.)  Ah, here it is:
