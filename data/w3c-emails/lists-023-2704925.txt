Speakers
Michael Paciello, President of The Paciello Group, is an international
authority on Web accessibility and assistive technology. He cofounded
the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) for the World Wide Web Consortium
(W3C).  Mike has spent the last 18 years as a technologist,
international consultant, and professional speaker in the area of
assistive technology and accessible interface design, working with such
clients as Microsoft, Adobe, Sun Microsystems, Fidelity Investments, GE,
Compaq, Dell, Easter Seals, The Kennedy Center, NASA, Yale, MIT, CSUN,
CAST, and others.  Mike also serves as a member of the Microsoft
Corporation Accessibility Advisory Board and the Federal Government
Electronic and Information Technology Access Advisory Board.  He is the
author of the best-selling book Web Accessibility for People with
Disabilities.

Chauncey Wilson, a senior user experience consultant, spent two years as
the Director of the Bentley College Design and Usability Testing Center.
He is a professor in the Human Factors and Information Design program
where he teaches graduate and professional education courses in
user-centered design and prototyping methods. Prior to Bentley, Chauncey
was a product line development manager at BMC Software, Inc. where he
developed complex performance monitoring software. He has been a
human-computer interaction (HCI) architect and usability engineer for
IDX Corporation, FTP Software, Dun & Bradstreet Software, Human Factors
International, and Digital Equipment Corporation. He is currently
working on two books in the area of HCI.

Mary Frances Theofanos has worked for the National Cancer Institute to
build and manage its Communications Technologies Research Center, a
state-of-the-art user testing, collaborative design and training
facility. She and her colleagues have conducted usability testing for
numerous federal agencies, including the government portal FirstGov.gov
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Mary is
establishing a research program to promote evidence-based user-centered
design and the development of usability metrics to analyze the
effectiveness of communication products and services.  Her research
program will ultimately result in guidelines for accessibility.  She
received her M.S. in Computer Science and is a Ph.D. candidate
completing her dissertation in Software Engineering.

Tom Tullis is Senior Vice President of Human Interface Design at
Fidelity Investments, where he manages a department within Fidelity's
Center for Applied Technology, which focuses on continuously improving
the usability of Fidelity's interactive systems and Web sites. Recent
strategic usability studies have focused on improving the usability of
Web sites for older adults.  Dr. Tullis received his M.A. in
Experimental Psychology and Ph.D. in Engineering Psychology.  He has
over 27 years of experience in the human-computer interface field and
has published over 35 papers in technical journals.

John Eulenberg is Professor of Audiology and Speech Sciences and
Director and Cofounder of the Artificial Language Laboratory at Michigan
State University.  He also serves as chairperson of MSU's Accommodating
Technology Committee, which studies ways to make university programs
more accessible to those with disabilities.  His research interests
include augmentative communication, multilingual speech synthesis, child
language development, and applications of computers to speech science
and speech-language pathology.  John's work in using artificial language
technology to enable a severely disabled teenager to speak and chant at
his bar mitzvah was recently profiled by ABC's Nightline program.  Dr.
Eulenberg holds both an M.A. and Ph.D. in Linguistics.
