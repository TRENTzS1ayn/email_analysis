Greetings Steven, just a couple of minor observations.

In section 4 you explicitly call out a small number of groups with which 
there should be some coordination. You include Accessability & 
Internationalization but omit a similar broad based activity Device 
Independence. As a member of the DI WG I am endeavouring to encourage more 
interaction between these three activities.

You last point in section 6 begs the question "based on what metrics?".

Regards, Roland

Many thanks to Scooter Morris for updating this directly as we discussed 
it
at the workshop. I have made a few changes to reflect new W3C situations.

Comments?

Best wishes,

Steven Pemberton
