...metrics for success... I'm not sure what we could use for metrics.  we are 
begging the question, I think, because we would consider just getting some 
discussion going with IG participants and other W3C groups "success" in the 
short term.  Perhaps this is enough for section 6.  I'd like to see some 
thoughts from W3C folks about this since I am not familiar with other W3C 
charters.
