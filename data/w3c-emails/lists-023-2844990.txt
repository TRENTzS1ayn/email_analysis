I see that there is a W3C plenary in Cambridge from March 3-7.  Meeting rooms 
are all booked up...   Is anyone planning to attend this besides Steven  and 
are there any plans (or can we make plans) to discuss the UIG further?  Steven, 
do you have plans to submit the charter?   If it looks like there might be some 
UIG discussion, I could try to plan to attend at least some of those days.
