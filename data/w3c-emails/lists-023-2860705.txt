Is this draft on the website yet?

4) Other groups

I don't know what all the acronyms mean. Best practice in a document is
to spell out the names in full and put the abbreviation in brackets
after. 

For this sort of effort to success it should be explicitly
multi-national and multi-cultural. Maybe there should be more reference
to non-US groups (assuming that they are all US groups), such as the
British HCI group.

6) Success

I'd like to see the success criteria in a 3-column format with headings
of

item, description, measure

Measures don't all have to be hard, but I think it's weak to have
'useful comments'. Who decides what's useful, and if the number of
'useful' comments meet the mark? In this case we could have something
like 'positive response from the chairs of other W3C groups on the input
from this UG'.

7.2) Communication

As an example of usability best practice, the words 'domain leader'
should be linked to a small popup, or a page elsewhere that defines the
term. All publications should follow this principle if, as in this case,
they are likely to be read by people who are unfamiliar with the jargon.
