Good question. As a practical matter, we are just starting the interest group 
and don't have a lot of resources, so it makes sense to me to initially just 
look at web sites.  The question of web apps being in scope or not is, perhaps, 
something that should be discussed once the IG gets going.  There are obviously 
some issues that would carryover, but once you enlarge the scope to apps you 
have to look at software usability issues in general.  The WAI guidelines, for 
example, skirt around this issue.  Many guidelines are specific to markup 
languages, but where needed they mention things like making embedded 
applications accessible or recommending good software design practice.  

I don't think the scope in the charter itself needs to be more specific at this 
point.
