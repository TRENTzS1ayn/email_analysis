I signed up for this list awhile back and would enjoy participating in
the group.  Please let me know how I can participate and help out.

Currently, I'm working with the WCAG 2 Working Group.

Subject: editing the charter and timeline?



This mainly directed at Steven since he owns the UIG charter html
file... Who is going to put in the suggested updates to the charter and
what is our 
timeline?  What about the plenary in March?  I could put in the
updates...
