I would take this further.  Some of the people who attended this 
workshop did so solely due to their interest in improving 
web-based applications.  If the scope is dropped to only be web 
sites, not only will the group lose the chance to improve the 
tools and standards of a vast set of web applications, they will 
lose interested participants as well (including myself, for one).

Todd, great quote in your signature.
