I am planning my schedule at CHI 2003 <http://www.chi2003.org/> - 
will there be anything happening at the conference related to this 
W3C User interest group?

I do not see anything on the program yet, but I suspect we could at 
least have an informal SIG - a chance to meet others and bring 
someone like me (who missed the workshop) up to speed on what is 
happening.

Like all CHIs, there will be many competing activities, so the sooner 
we can set this up the more likely I can attend.

Keith
