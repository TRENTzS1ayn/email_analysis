I will be at CHI.  I sent an email to Steven Pemberton about getting an update 
on his draft of the charter and its status at W3C.  I really would like to get 
some updated info. before planning an informal SIG.  However, if you email me 
that you are interested in meeting at CHI, I can try to arrange something--
either signing up for an informal sig or arranging to meet for lunch or 
something.  Sharon
