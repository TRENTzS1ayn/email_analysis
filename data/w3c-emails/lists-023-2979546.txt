It's been quite a while since I've seen any traffic on this list serv. I had
to check with Matt May to make sure things were still in synch on the
working group.

Let's not lose our zeal folks!

I will be at CHI.  I sent an email to Steven Pemberton about getting an
update
on his draft of the charter and its status at W3C.  I really would like to
get
some updated info. before planning an informal SIG.  However, if you email
me
that you are interested in meeting at CHI, I can try to arrange something--
either signing up for an informal sig or arranging to meet for lunch or
something.  Sharon
