I have been in contact with Steven Pemberton.  Here is the plan for CHI:

I will sign up for an informal SIG at CHI.  I haven't found out the time slots 
yet, but will try to today.   For those of you who want to attend the sig, let 
me know if you have any hard constraints and I will try to sign up for a time 
to accommodate as many people as possible.    Steven and I will also meet at 
CHI for planning purposes.  

Sharon
