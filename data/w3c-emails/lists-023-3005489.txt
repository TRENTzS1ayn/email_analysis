The most convenient time to schedule the W3C UIG informal sig discussion is:

Tuesday 4/8 1-2:30pm    
This is the lunchtime slot. I don't think we will need the entire 90 minutes so 
there will be time for lunch afterwards. 

As of Friday, this slot was still open for an informal SIG.

If this is not available or there are conflicts,  Wednesday 4/9  1-2:30 will be 
the backup.

I will email the informal SIG people and get on the schedule this afternoon and 
confirm via this listserv.   

Hope to see you next week. 

Sharon
