I hope this is not the wrong NG.

I have chosen a frame- and Java-script-based solution for my catalogue because this offers the chance to work with an offline copy in contrast to server site scripting. However this leads to some broadly discussed usability-problems starting with bookmarking end ending with circular embedding of subpages, if the pages are not carefully created.

I would be very glad if someone could point me to a location, where this issue is discussed in a very compact manner in particular concerning www-developments on usability in the near future; to my experience it is much more helpful to get tips from competent people than search with irrelevant terms.

best regards
