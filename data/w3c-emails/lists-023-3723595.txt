WSTF folks,

I don't think we should spend too much more effort to chunk the list. I
propose that we discuss it one more time today (including these
suggestions sent to the list), and if we do not come up with a
satisfactory solution, we skip the chunking and leave it one long list.

It _is_ important that we have a comprehensive task list. Please take a
little time to think through tasks that anyone might want to do on our
site (even if they are not currently supported) and send those to the
mailing listserv so that we can add them to the Task List.

Thanks,

~ shawn
