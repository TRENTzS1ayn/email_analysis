Sailesh,
 
Thanks for the thoughts!
 
I think grouping tasks by effort required applies to the current design
of the site. Perhaps when we redesign the site, something that once
required several steps (such as determining how to make forms
accessible) might be a more simple task that is only two clicks away
from the home page.

Subject: Grouping Usability Tasks


Hello All,
I was unfortunately not present at the mmeeting  when this current
grouping  scheme was discussed. But I guess it has evolved  out of the
idea I proposed at an earlier meeting that the tasks be grouped under
say three heads  along the lines of : easy, intermediate level, and
difficult . This  again  is as perceived by  the working group.
The grouping should have some relevance to  the objective  i.e.
conducting usability testing, and certainly is not being done just for
"chunking". So for instance, we might  consider assigning one task from
the simple, intermediate level and   difficult tasks to each of the
subjects.
As Blossom pointed out, any one might  need to do any of the tasks. And
the individual might have little or a lot of  tech knowledge and
likewise little or a lot of accessibility knowledge. The grouping of
tasks should not   be based on the characteristics of the subjects.
Finding info about WAI might be categorized as a relatively simple task
as the info is perhaps a link away from the home page and    all in one
place. But determining how to make forms accessible is something that
will take several steps and one might need to review more than a couple
of pages: guidelines and checkpoints and techniques. One has to
determine which checkpoints relate to forms to begin with, etc... so it
is a fairly involved and time consuming task - for anyone regardless of
background.
So I suggest we consider the above grouping and have just 3 groups as
the number of tasks too are less than 50-60.

Hello, all - 

A note above the Task List posted November 28, 2003
(<http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/tasks>), comments that the
headings
"below are only to help 'chunk' the long list and the grouping under a
certain heading is not important." -
 
I agree 100% that we need to chunk the list. But, if the groupings under
each heading are "not important," then the grouping is confusing. If
something is grouped, I'm assuming that there is some meaning to the
grouping. 

The way the list is currently grouped does not work for me very well.
For
example, I could have heavy technical knowledge and moderate Web
accessibility knowledge, but still search for the definition of the term
Web
accessibility.

For discussion on Monday, here's another grouping possibility:


GENERAL ACCESSIBILITY

1. I am trying to find the definition of the term Web accessibility.  

2. I need info to help convince self, boss, org, or other that Web
accessibility is important and that we should be doing it. 

3. I want to find out about Web access policies around the world.

4. My boss told me to make our Web site accessible and I need to know
where
to start.

5. I want a simple checklist of what I (content developer) need to do
for
Web accessibility.

6. I am doing a presentation on accessibility and want to order Quick
Tips
to hand out. 

7. I am doing training on general accessibility information and trying
to
find materials for my presentation.

8. I want to find a list of all the guidelines WAI has published.


SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND SEARCHES

1. I have been asked how much time and money it would take to make your
Web
site accessible.

2. I am trying to find a specific document. ["How People with
Disabilities
Use the Web", "Policies Relating to Web Accessibility", etc.] .

3. I want statistics on disability to help make a business case for Web
accessibility. [deliberately not on site or in resource in the
foreseeable
future]

4. I've searched for XYZ in a search engine [that dumped me in the
middle of
a resource] 
 
5. I am trying to find the list of Web accessibility evaluation tools. 

6. I have a specific question on Web accessibility that I want to ask
WAI
(e.g., interpretation of a guideline). 


TECHNIQUES

1. I heard XYZ [text resizing] is important for accessibility and want
to
find out why. 

2. I heard that Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) helps with accessibility; I
want to know why CSS is good for accessibility and get an intro on CSS. 
 
3. Someone gave me a report generated by a Web evaluation tool, and I
need
to look up details about some of the things it said needed human
evaluation.

4. Someone gave me a report generated by a Web evaluation tool, and I
don't
understand how to fix some of the things it identified as errors.
 
5. I am looking for a document that explains the techniques to implement
Check point #X.

6. I am doing a new thing [data tables, forms, etc.] and I want to make
it
accessible. 


WAI

1. I want to know more about WAI in general. How long has it been
around?
How is it funded? Who is on the staff?

2. I heard W3C WAI was open to outside participation and I want to help
out.


3. I am a member of a WAI WG and I am trying to find out when the next
meeting is. When is that in your time working zone? 


Regards,

Blossom
