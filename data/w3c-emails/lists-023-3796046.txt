WSTF folks,

Minutes covering card sorting for information architecture are under
"Information Architecture" headings(<h3>s) in past 2 meeting minutes at:

If you did not attend the meetings where this was covered, please read
the minutes as we do not intended to repeat information provided
previously -- although are happy to provide any clarifications or answer
questions.

Best,

~ Shawn
