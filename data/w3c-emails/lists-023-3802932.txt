Dear all,
 
Attached are 3 documents to help us with the Card Sorting exercise.
Below are the details on each one:
 
1.  WAI_Card_Sort.xls   - This is the file where you will list all of
the results of your card sorting exercises.  If you have questions on
how to list the information please refer to the previous emails or ask
Michael L. or myself.
 
The next two files are .pdf's - if you have difficulty with them or
would prefer a .doc file I can send that as well.  Either of these two
methods is acceptable - it's really up to personal preference.
 
2.  cardlabels_cards.pdf - This file has the cards arranged 4 up on a
page (to be printed on card stock or on larger labels.
 
3.  cardlabels.pdf - This file has the card names arranged for printing
on address labels (1"x2.6") to then stick onto 3x5" card stock.
 
Thanks,
Carol Smith
