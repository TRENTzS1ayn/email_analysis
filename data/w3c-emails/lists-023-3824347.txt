Dear all,

Attached are 3 documents to help us with the Card Sorting exercise.  Below are the details on each one:

1.  WAI_Card_Sort.xls   - This is the same file as before where you will list all of the results of your card sorting exercises.  If you have questions on how to list the information please refer to the previous emails or ask Michael L. or myself.

The next two files are Word .doc's and refer to the Excel spreadsheet for data.

2.  cardlabels_cards.doc - This file has the cards arranged 4 up on a page (to be printed on card stock or on larger labels.

3.  cardlabels.doc - This file has the card names arranged for printing on address labels (1"x2.6") to then stick onto 3x5" card stock.

Thanks,
Carol Smith
