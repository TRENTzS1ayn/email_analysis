Shawn,

A few suggestions from NILS in Australia:

1. I (could be anyone) want to know the definitive meaning of some terms
I've heard used in discussions about web accessibility - I'm looking for a
glossary of terms.
2. As a person with a disability (possibly using XYZ assistive technology)
I want to know what aspects of accessible design should be useful to me
(and possibly available within my assistive technology) [eg a screen reader
user should be able to take advantage of structural markup such as
headings; a non-mouse user will require 'skip to content'; etc]
3. I am a software developer considering a web-based front-end - what do I
need to know to make my application accessible?
4. I am developing some online information/products using proprietary
(non-W3C) products (eg. Flash/Acrobat/JAVA) - how does WCAG apply to me?
5. As a CMS developer, which W3C guidelines do I need to take account of in
order to be accessible? [specific version of #38]
6. My company needs to get some advice on accessibility issues (no time to
learn it all ourselves) - who can we contact locally for advice?

Not all of these may be able to be answered (at this stage) from the WAI
site - but reasonable questions for people to ask.

Andrew
