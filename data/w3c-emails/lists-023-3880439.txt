Here are a few scenarios to consider:
 Q1: Where can I find specific information about browser support for different accessibility technologies outlined in the WCAG?  (Answer: there is a link in theWCAG 1.0)
Q2: I notice some docs are endorsed by WG members and some by W3C members and  some are endorsed by the Director. Is there  a description of the guideline creation / endorsement process? 
Q3: My family member has become disabled (motor / vision / etc. impairment). I am looking for adaptive  technologies that will help her use the Web. So I am trying to locate useful info / links on WAI site.   
Q4: Am trying to  identify current job openings at W3C-WAI.
Q5: I need to buy an eval and repair tool. Is there a checklist of issues I should consider during selection?   
Q6: What are "W3C technologies"?  ... not in glossary
