Hi Team,

Here are the results of the first two card sorts I've done.  I was hoping to get the third done before the meeting tomorrow, but it doesn't look like it will get done until the middle of next week now. I have included the user descriptions below (3rd participant is listed also) and listed their user group from the http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/users site.

The first participant is a female with a UNIX Admin background so she is very technical.  She only recently started hearing about accessibility.  She is aware of ALT tags, but that's about it.  She had been to the W3C site, but wasn't really familiar with WAI as much (couldn't find what she needed when she visited).  She is representative of #2 Web "coder"/technical developer 

The second woman has been doing web development of larger news sites for a couple of years and is much more user focused with a good understanding of WCAG and accessibility in general.  She has been to the WAI site and is a usability specialist.  I would say she is representative of #8 Internet or intranet site manager as she's managed and developed very large sites or of #21 educator (including accessibility in courses) as she teaches an HCI course.

The third is a male, very familiar with the W3C site in general and with WAI.  He is also a web developer and of the three the most familiar with various technologies and accessibility needs.  I would include him in the #3 Web interaction designer, usability specialist, application designer group.

All three have HCI-type backgrounds.  Hopefully this doesn't overlap too much with other's participants. I'll be in meetings all day tomorrow so I may not be accessible much via email
