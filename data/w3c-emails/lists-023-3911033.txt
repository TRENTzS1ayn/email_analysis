Hi, Team

I am following Carol's lead in sending my  results to the list.

#1 Male professor.  He is an accessibility advocate both in his 
college and at the university level on an advisory committee.  He is 
rather technologically savvy.  He is familiar with W3C and WAI but 
not real familiar with the WAI website.

#2 Female executive staff assistant and office manager for one of the 
university vice presidents.  She is aware of accessibility issues and 
the university initiatives but is not familiar with WAI and has never 
seen the WAI site. As far as I know has not created any web pages.

#3 Female WAI/EOWG member, academic accessibility consultant/adviser, 
involved in writing guidelines, life long student, web consultant/web 
designer, web project leader, etc.
