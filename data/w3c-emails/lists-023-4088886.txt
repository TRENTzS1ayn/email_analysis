I came up with one more persona to add to our group.  I can put it into a
formal doc with a photo if the group likes it.

Barb

"I'm just not sure which guidelines to follow...what's the difference
between Section 508 and the WCAG guidelines?"

Barb is an independant website developer.  She's a jane-of-all trades when
it comes to her work - everything is in her domain including: one-on-one
client meetings, programming, project management, website design, etc.  She
wants to find out what the deal is with WCAG and why she should use these
guidelines instead of the Section 508 guidelines.

Age: 32
Company: Independant Consulting
Potential: Barb recently had a client ask about Section 508 compliance, and
in talking to other web developers about the subject she found out about
WCAG.  She's somewhat familiar with the general ideas of both, she's just
not sure which could work best for her customers.  She also is looking for
information she can use to convince her customers of the added value of
having an accessible website.
