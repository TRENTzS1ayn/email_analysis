Greetings,

I am the Web Accessibility Information and Project Principal for Michigan
State University and been on the EOWG about three years.  An old picture is
on my website at http://www.msu.edu/~corcora1/

I have degrees in Business Management, Communication (Organizational), and
in Educational Administration. I was part of the start-up development team
that created the MSU Web in 1994.  Since then, I have helped develop and
manage the central MSU web site, several Executive-level (President,
Provost, Gov. Affairs, Academic Governance, etc) websites, and special
priority projects for MSU's President, the Provost, and the Vice Provost
for Libraries Computing and Technology. I have also done consulting and
development for external clients including the State of Michigan Department
of Treasury. I was the first webmaster for the Standing Committee on
Disability in the American College Personnel Association (ACPA) as well as
for several professional women's groups on campus.

My role has been to be the usability and accessibility "voice" for
technology users in the development of MSU websites and related technology
policies for the past 10 years. I have written articles for "Student
Affairs Online", Center for Educational Networking "Newsline", and "About
Campus" Journal of the American College Personnel Association (ACPA).
Currently working on two books unrelated to technology. I have presented on
the topic of organizational communication with respects to diversity,
accessibility, disability, and technology in education at Educause, at the
Raines Colloquium with author, Sherry Turkle, and several other venues.

I started with Fortran 4 programming in 1969 but I am not a programmer in
that sense. I am most comfortable in using a line editor (Bbedit) but also
have a modicum of skill in, PhotoShop, and DreamWeaver. I enjoy exploiting
the capabilities of computer programs that support accessibility coding to
see how we can "reach the broadest possible audience."

My strengths are in communication (organizational communication in
particular), compiling proposals for changes in organizational approaches,
and policy development. I have experience and strength in editing documents
including being on the editorial team as the Web Development Editor for
WebProfession.com and of course our joint effort on EO.  Though I have
functioned as webmaster from a technician standpoint in a number of
circumstances, my primary webmaster role has been in the communication,
project management, and policy development aspects.  The more technical
functioning issues are generally handled by my staff or by our computer
center staff.

For the past year, I lead the team at Michigan State University that has
demonstrated that web accessible html coding and good graphic design are
not mutually exclusive.  Two of our most recent projects are found at
http://www.msu.edu/webaccess/ and http://www.msu.edu/~webaccess/. On these
projects both usability heuristics and a rigorous process of accessibility
validation were used.

Two of my current assignments involve designing and setting up the MSU
Usability and Accessibility Lab and revamping the centralized training and
information used in communicating the institutional approach to web
accessibility.
