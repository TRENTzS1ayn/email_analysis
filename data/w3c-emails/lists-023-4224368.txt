WSTF folks,

A draft task list for usability testing is available at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/wai-ut#tasks

I have a few more comments (from Jon, Judy, & AIR) to incorporate still.
I plan to send this page to EOWG list Wed night or Thur morning. Feel
free to contact me directly if you have any suggestions that we should
address before sending it to EOWG.

I will also be adding the participant screening questions that AIR
drafted based on our participant criteria.

Justin

l) is editing the master task list
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/tasks). Remember that all tasks
should be on that list, but only a few select ones will be used for
usability testing.

Regards,

~ Shawn
