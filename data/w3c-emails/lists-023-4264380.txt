WSTF folks,

Below are some updates related to the next meeting.

Additional agenda item for the beginning of the call:

Note: Monday's meeting is the final opportunity to make changes to the
usability test tasks and questions. Please send your comments to the

meeting.

Note: We might have a representive from AIR (the group conducting the
first usability testing) for part of the call. If you have any questions
or concerns about this, please call me as soon as possible.
