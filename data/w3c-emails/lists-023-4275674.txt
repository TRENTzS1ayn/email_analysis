_______________
Pre-Test Questionnaire
_______________
I: Have you ever   - what do you use vs. what did you use.  It would seem
that there should be some agreement in tense between question #1 and the
questions that follow.

1. Have you ever researched Web accessibility for people with
disabilities?
                       If yes:
                            a.What resources do you use to learn about Web
accessibility?
                            b.What Web sites do you use to learn about Web
accessibility?
                            c.How often do you use them?
etc....

II: Under Question #1 - Duplication of question....I like H. better and
suggest dropping A.

   a.What resources do you use to learn about Web accessibility?
   h.What other resources (e.g., books, classes) do you use to learn about
Web accessibility?

III: Specify here that the question is about accessibility related features
that prompt the user to add in accessible coding.

    "2.Do any of the authoring tools you use have accessibility-related
features?"

IV: Change
                  4."If you were to envision your ideal Web accessibility
Web site"

to  "If you were to envision your ideal "Web site about Web
accessibility"

_______________
Post-Test Survey
_______________
V : Change "8.It is easy to find one's way around the site." to
"It is easy to find my way around the site."

VI: Change " 9.You can get to information quickly." to
"I can get to information quickly."

VII: Can they really evaluate this??? "The site effectively communicates
the organization's image."

VII: "18. Information is relevant." Too brief.  Expand to a more complete
sentence i.e. "The Information is relevant to my needs." -OR- "to the
topic" or something with a fuller meaning.  Relative to what???

IX: "28.It is always clear what to do next."  Maybe "28.It is always clear
what I can do next."

X: "30.Mistakes are easy to correct." change to "My mistakes are easy to
correct."
