Hi all,
just to throw this in to the pot:

http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk/~ph/sus.html

Its a 10 point , serves well, gives a single metric and therefore a benchmark - we will be able (potentially - we hope) to tell how we have improved.

In my experience it is filled out quicky and effectively by particiants + it is a balanced and tested Q i.e. all those things a likert really should be.

Downsides - a bit general? Can't we explore those other issues in the orig  in another way? What will you do with the data in any case?

Jon
