participants should have a basic knowledge of user centered design
processes (UCD), as well as the WAI site and the EOWG. Several online
resources and books provide information on UCD.

it is a publicly archived list).
- Let's try using IRC to support the meeting. Shawn will be on the

the meeting starts. (Type "Shawn" to get my attention.)
