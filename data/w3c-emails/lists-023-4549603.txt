WSTF folks,

IA questions for this week updated based on our teleconference:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/ia-study3.html

(My beta test was a total bust, but that's largely because the
participant was a an extreme Web novice. Hope yours go better - though
I'm not sure people will be able to understand the last question.)

.xls file for data attached.

Thanks,

~ Shawn
