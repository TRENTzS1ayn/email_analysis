Two questions:

4:30p - 6:30p US Eastern

If the meeting was held at the above time on the dates below, please
indicate if you could attend the meeting "ALMOST ALWAYS", "MOST OF THE
TIME", "SOMETIMES", or "ALMOST NEVER" and feel free to add additional
comments (e.g., "best day for me" "SOMETIMES, except the second Tue of
every month")

Thanks for prompt reply.
