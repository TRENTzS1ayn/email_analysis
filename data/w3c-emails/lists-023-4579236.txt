WSTF & WAI Team,

Please reply to this message as soon as possible, preferably by end of
day Tuesday 13 April.

Since the WSTF's last discussion on WAI working group home pages, the
WAI Team (that is, W3C staff Judy, Wendy, Matt, and Shadi) agreed to
re-organize their working group home pages to a consistent format
(headings and in-page links) by the end of this week (still using that
same old style for now).

I reviewed the content on all of the current working group home pages,
reviewed our agreed-upon audience write-up (linked below), and walked
through some tasks. Based on this further analysis, I recommend some
small changes to what we previously discussed, primarily:
- making the subtopics under About [working group name] <h2>s
- adding an optional last category "Additional Information"
I updated the draft with these recommendations at:
www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/design-sum#wg
and implemented them in the EOWG home page (with old style) at:
www.w3.org/WAI/EO/
and a UAWG ROUGH DRAFT (with essentially no style) at:
www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/sketchpad/uaag-wg-css1.html
- please ignore the layout for now, just look at the center column.

Please review the format (headings) at
www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/design-sum#wg and reply to this list (not
shawn@w3.org): __ APPROVE as is __ APPROVE, recommend the following for
consideration: __ NOT APPROVE, because of the following objection):

If you have any questions, feel free to call me directly.

Thanks for your prompt reply.

Regards,

~ Shawn
