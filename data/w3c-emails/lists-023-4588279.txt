>Since the WSTF's last discussion on WAI working group home pages, the
>WAI Team (that is, W3C staff Judy, Wendy, Matt, and Shadi) agreed to
>re-organize their working group home pages to a consistent format
>(headings and in-page links) by the end of this week (still using that
>same old style for now).
>
>I reviewed the content on all of the current working group home pages,
>reviewed our agreed-upon audience write-up (linked below), and walked
>through some tasks. Based on this further analysis, I recommend some
>small changes to what we previously discussed, primarily:
>- making the subtopics under About [working group name] <h2>s
>- adding an optional last category "Additional Information"
>I updated the draft with these recommendations at:
>www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/design-sum#wg
>and implemented them in the EOWG home page (with old style) at:
>www.w3.org/WAI/EO/
>and a UAWG ROUGH DRAFT (with essentially no style) at:
>www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/sketchpad/uaag-wg-css1.html
>- please ignore the layout for now, just look at the center column.
>
>Please review the format (headings) at
>www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/design-sum#wg and reply to this list (not
