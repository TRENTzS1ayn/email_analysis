> Since the WSTF's last discussion on WAI working group home pages, the

> I reviewed the content on all of the current working group home pages,

> - making the subtopics under About [working group name] <h2>s
> - adding an optional last category "Additional Information"
> I updated the draft with these recommendations at:
> www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/design-sum#wg
> and implemented them in the EOWG home page (with old style) at:
> www.w3.org/WAI/EO/
> and a UAWG ROUGH DRAFT (with essentially no style) at:
