shows, and such
* short introduction (about one printed page)
* annotated list of related information (somewhat like current Resources
page [http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/])

a. Intro to Web Accessibility
- includes relationship between developers, authoring tools, user
agents, assistive technology, users, Web technologies (XHTML, CSS,
etc.), etc. -- Or, is this a separate short page?
- probably replaces Getting Started
[http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/]

e. Intro to Specific Technologies - cover page for Accessibility
features of CSS, etc.
