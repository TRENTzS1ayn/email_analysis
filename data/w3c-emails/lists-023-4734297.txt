Oddly enough, the nomenclature questions we had are not an issue with 
the people I asked. Though Cisco uses both Getting Started and 
Resources. Though people expected Resources to be outside the site 
area, as that is what they do here.

Attached are the schematics. There is one area that Daniel and I 
discussed that we would change for sure, but this is what his proposed 
solution was. He had a lot of concern over making sure the navigation 
was persistent due to the frequency of cross-linking.

If you feel comfortable with them, go ahead and send them out.
