Two good examples of visible (but not "in your face") <skip links> as the
first link on a page are:
1. http://www.monash.edu.au/
2. http://www.gt.nsw.gov.au/

In both these page, the links is placed at top right and with the rule
across as part of the graphic, it does not appear as part of the main page,
but is the #1 link for people tabbing through the page.
