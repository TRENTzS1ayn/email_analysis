Hello all,

Since we are having difficulty getting all of the info we want on the home page, what about adding a drop down box with a list of "I need to..." as the heading.  I've seen this on other sites and it seems to be effective and very task oriented.  Thoughts on this - have we already discussed similar ideas?  For some it would be a pain to use where accessibility is concerned, but most users would be able to access it.

The selections could be some of the following ("I need to...):
-get the WCAG Guidelines
-get the ATAG Guidelines
-volunteer with WAI
-learn about Accessibility
-get basics for accessible websites
-find training materials
-create an accessibility policy
-get an FAQ answered"

Also, I'm working with this group (http://www.cje.net/) and they have an incredible marketing campaign in Chicago right now.  "We're the Chicken Soup of Elder Care".  I think something simple like that with a graphic would be great for WAI.   I'll send the purpose statement in a bit.  Maybe that will help spark some ideas.
