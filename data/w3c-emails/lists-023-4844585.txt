Here's a brief explanation (from previous notes) to include for EOWG (please give feedback on this as well).  I don't think my current version of the purpose statement has much pizzazz so maybe someone has a way to work that in?


"The Purpose statement is meant to be user-centric and focused especially towards the newbies.  It should answer the question of "what is this page I've landed on?".  It should have some pizzazz, and generally align with the vision of the website."
