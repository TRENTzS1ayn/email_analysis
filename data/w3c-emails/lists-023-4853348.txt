I think this one is the best idea of all:
- provide a way to showcase different resources, since many people don't
know what we have

The hot topics issue is very subjective and lends itself to the techy 
side - whose hot topic anyway? On the other hand, our resources could 
be highlighted on a constant rotating basis and would meet the need 
of our "newbies".

That could be augmented by a second item (agreeing with the two topic 
idea) hot topic that might be more hot topic-like that would lend 
itself to the more advanced user, thus cutting across the user base. 
Without more of a balanced approach - a little bit of something for 
both ends of the spectrum, I would be concerned that the hot topics 
that would bubble to the surface otherwise would put off a large 
number of our readers.

As for Tim Berners-Lee's quote: I consider his quote worthy of being 
on the home page as an anchor. He started the Internet so his words 
do carry weight. His vision is noteworthy and still offers a modicum 
of creditials to the effort. It is not necessarily the item that 
defines the WAI or the home page but it is nonetheless significant 
and worthy of honor. "He who does not remember where he comes from 
will never know where he is going..."(paraphrase).So, I vote for 
keeping it on the page but not necessarily above the fold.

>Issue: Highlights on WAI home page
>
>WSTF is considering having highlights on the WAI home page.
>
>Purpose:
>- provide a space to address "hot" topics
>- provide a way to showcase different resources, since many people don't
>know what we have
>- make the home page more "alive" with timely topics that change
>frequently
>
>Examples of things that might go in highlights area:
>- blurb on newly finished documents, such as standards harmonization
>- XYZ government adopted WCAG, with a link to Policies
>- technique addressing hot issue
>- tip from a document, such as Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility,
>with a link to that document
>
>Notes:
>- would probably often have two highlights: 1. that stays longer and is
>a current high priority issue, such as standards harmonization, and 2,
>that changes more frequently, perhaps every week, such as a technique or
>tip
>- would not replace news/announcements as is currently on home page
>

>Issue: Quote on WAI home page
>
>The current WAI home page (http://www.w3.org/WAI/) has in a prominent
>position this quote: "The power of the Web is in its universality.
>Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." --
>Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web
>
>Question: On the new WAI home page, should this quote be: a. above the
>fold, b. below the fold, c. not on home page (on another page, such as
>Introduction to Web Accessibility or About WAI).
>
>Discussion: @@ ... doesn't say what WAI is about or what the site is
>about... was important when WAI started to give credibility & that's not
>as important now... takes up fair amount of space and doesn't give a
>whole lot of "umph" if you don't know who he is & many don't...  [sorry,
>i'm too exhausted to do this now :-[
