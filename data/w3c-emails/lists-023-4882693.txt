Thanks for the quick feedback, Charmane!
 
We talked about that the _first_ thing most people want to know is,
"What can I get from this site?"  - and "What is WAI" is close second
that should be easy to find.
 
What is WAI is (right now): "WAI, in coordination with organizations
around the world, pursues accessibility of the Web through five primary
areas of work: technology, guidelines, tools, education and outreach,
and research and development." - which doesn't seem like a good welcome
to a new site.
 
While one purpose of the site from WAI's perspective might be to support
the mission of the WAI, we wanted an opening statement from the
_user/visitor_ perspective - that is, what is on this site for me?!
 
Also note that a recurring theme in usability testing was that the site
was too much about WAI, and not about accessibility. (although I cannot
remember if it was one person harping on it repeatedly, or several
different people) 
 
> Maybe we are saying the same thing just different words....
 
Perhaps so. It wouls be GREAT if you would you propose a different
"purpose statement" to help in the discussion!
(Carol's first pass is at the bottom of the e-mail)

Shouldn't it answer the question what is the Web Accessibility
Initiative rather than what is this page I have landed on?  It seems we
have to define the entity the website represents to provide the context
for the site. The purpose is for the site is to support the mission of
the entity so we must define the entity, contextualize the purpose of
the contents of the site. Maybe we are saying the same thing just
different words....

Here's a brief explanation (from previous notes) to include for EOWG
(please give feedback on this as well).  I don't think my current
version of the purpose statement has much pizzazz so maybe someone has a
way to work that in?

 

 

"The Purpose statement is meant to be user-centric and focused
especially towards the newbies.  It should answer the question of "what
is this page I've landed on?".  It should have some pizzazz, and
generally align with the vision of the website."

Hello again,



 

Here is my first stab at the Purpose statement (38 words) - I look
forward to your comments!



 


 

WAI is your resource for Web accessibility.  WAI includes: resources to
help you create accessible websites; design software that supports
production of accessible Web sites; and design accessible browsers in
order to make the internet accessible for everyone.


 

 

 

Best,
