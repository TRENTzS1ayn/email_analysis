> 
> WSTF is considering having highlights on the WAI home page.
> 
> Purpose:
> - provide a space to address "hot" topics
> - provide a way to showcase different resources, since many 
> people don't know what we have
> - make the home page more "alive" with timely topics that 
> change frequently
> 
> Examples of things that might go in highlights area:
> - blurb on newly finished documents, such as standards harmonization
> - XYZ government adopted WCAG, with a link to Policies
> - technique addressing hot issue
> - tip from a document, such as Evaluating Web Sites for 
> Accessibility, with a link to that document
> 
> Notes:
> - would probably often have two highlights: 1. that stays 
> longer and is a current high priority issue, such as 
> standards harmonization, and 2, that changes more frequently, 
> perhaps every week, such as a technique or tip
> - would not replace news/announcements as is currently on home page

> Issue: Quote on WAI home page
> 
> The current WAI home page (http://www.w3.org/WAI/) has in a 
> prominent position this quote: "The power of the Web is in 
> its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability 
> is an essential aspect." -- Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and 
> inventor of the World Wide Web
> 
> Question: On the new WAI home page, should this quote be: a. 
> above the fold, b. below the fold, c. not on home page (on 
> another page, such as Introduction to Web Accessibility or About WAI).
> 
> Discussion: @@ ... doesn't say what WAI is about or what the 
> site is about... was important when WAI started to give 
> credibility & that's not as important now... takes up fair 
> amount of space and doesn't give a whole lot of "umph" if you
