EOWG,

Please be prepared to discuss the issues below at the EOWG
teleconference on Friday 30 April. Feel free to comment on the list
ahead of time, especially if you are not able to attend the
teleconference.

Regards,
~ Shawn for the WAI Site Task Force (WSTF)


Background reading:
- WAI Site Analysis Summary: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2003/analysis-sum
Particularly:
- vision: http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2003/analysis-sum#vision
- Primary user groups are: 1. People who are new to Web accessibility,
2. Web developers

===

1. WAI site "purpose"

WSTF recommends a short bit of text in a prominent top position of the
WAI home page that:
- answers the question, "What can I get from this site?"
- is user-centric (that is, from the user's point of view, not WAI's
point of view)
- is focused for people who are new to the site, answering "What is this
page/site I've landed on?"
- has some pizzazz
- generally aligns with the vision of the Web site
- is very short, preferably around 30 words or less

A "straw proposal":
WAI provides guidelines and resources to make the Web accessible to
people with disabilities. WAI is an international collaborative forum to
help Web content providers, Web software developers, business and policy
leaders, and others create an accessible Web.

(Thanks to Carol, Charmane, Blossom, Judy, and Shawn for contributing
ideas for the straw proposal. Other ideas are in the WSTF e-mail list
archive: 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wai-eo-site/2004Apr/
)

Question: Ideas for what the text would be.

===

2. Quote on WAI home page

The current WAI home page (http://www.w3.org/WAI/) has in a prominent
top position this quote: "The power of the Web is in its universality.
Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." --
Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web

"Screen real estate" is extremely valuable on the home page, especially
above the fold. The quote doesn't say what WAI is about or what the site
is about. It does lend credibility.

Question: Should this quote be: a. on the WAI home page above the fold,
b. on the WAI home page below the fold, c. not on home page (on another
page, such as Introduction to Web Accessibility or About WAI).

===

3. Highlights on WAI home page

WSTF is considering having highlights on the WAI home page.

Purpose:
- provide a way to showcase different resources, since many people don't
know what we have
- provide a space to address "hot" topics
- make the home page more "alive" with timely topics that change
frequently

Examples of things that might go in highlights section:
- blurb on hot (non-tech) topic, such as standards harmonization
- blurb on just released documents
- XYZ government adopted WCAG, with a link to Policies
- technique addressing hot issue
- tip from a document, such as Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility,
with link to document

Notes:
- usually 30-40 words each (maybe less)
- would probably often have two highlights: 1. that stays longer and is
a current high priority issue, such as standards harmonization, and 2,
that changes more frequently, perhaps every week, such as a technique or
tip
- perhaps have one for "newbies" & one for more advanced, and/or one for
"techies" & one for "fuzzies" [1]
- would not replace news/announcements as is currently on home page

Question: Do you think highlights is a good idea? What changes do you
recommend for the parameters above (that is, what would go into the
highlights section)?
