- SHAWN, by 30 April: start Intro page for Web Accessibility,
incorporating Getting Started

I won't be able to finish the draft Intro page for Web Accessibility by
30 April. Since it needs to go through Judy before I can post it, it
will likely by at least 13 May before I can send it to the list. That
shouldn't hold up our other work.
