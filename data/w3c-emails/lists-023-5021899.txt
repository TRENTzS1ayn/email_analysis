> - CHARMANE, by 5 May: e-mail analysis of graphics on home page to list

Charmane & WSTF,

I had an idea after the EOWG meeting today. Remember we talked about an
illustration of the "components" of Web accessibility?

What if the graphics on the home page were an artful arrangement of
(some or all) of the components* (which themselves were artful, nothing
like the straw illustration I mocked up:)?! By artful arrangement, I
mean they wouldn't have labels or arrows or have to be in a same setup
as the components illustration.

They could be clickable to go to the intro page for that topic. That way
the graphics wouldn't be totally gratuitous (which makes me much more
comfortable :). Also, we could include the graphic on its intro page to
further reinforce the idea & have some consistency.
