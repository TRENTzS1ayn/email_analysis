Thanks to Andrew & Blossom for the following.

(some) Notes for WSTF from EOWG:

INTRO para

changelog - add concept of 'strategies'

tag line idea: "Strategies, guidelines, and resources to make the Web
accessible to people with disabilities."

if we DO have short tag-line, then need to be sure to include other
aspects such as 'what wai is' on the h/page

TIM'S Quote

- several spoke in favor of having it above the fold
- only Justin spoke in favor of below the fold
- a few abstained
RC: quote is synonymous with WAI - need to keep it up front
CL: suggested dating the quote (RC agrees)
CC: should be on the page - placement is less important

HIGHLIGHTS

CL & RC sent comments to EO list
nugget of info with link to more (rather then just long title)- agreed
to
- 3 different items
- to appeal to different audiences
- always reaching multiple audiences so as not to alienate
- rotating frequently
- draw out buried resources
- different levels of technical/etc
