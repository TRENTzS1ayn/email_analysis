Dear all,

This design implication is similar to #3 on http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/analysis-sum but has a different implication (could be rolled into #3).

Finding: Users may "land" in the middle of the WAI site by following search results and my not understand what they are looking at.
Design implication: Easy to comprehend navigation, bread crumbs or another form of way-finding, and descriptive page headings should be used. 

Regards,
