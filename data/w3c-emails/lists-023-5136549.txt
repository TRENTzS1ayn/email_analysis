Hi all,

Here is my most recent version of the persona's: http://www.kognitive.com/eowg/persona.html

Changes include:
I added a second name to the following:
Martina Prado
Marc Blake
Andy Petroff
Willam Travis
Jessica Pratner
Mary Stone
Caryn-Ann Robinson
It's awkward using both names each time - I left first names where they had previously been, as well as Mrs., etc. within the body of the persona - can change that if needed.

Made Martina Prado and Caryn-Ann Robinson more goal oriented.  

I made William Travis older - is this better?
