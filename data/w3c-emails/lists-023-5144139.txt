I think we need to be consistent - common editorial practice. Maybe we
should discuss our standard at the next WSTF meeting.

Hi all,
 
Here is my most recent version of the persona's:
http://www.kognitive.com/eowg/persona.html
<http://www.kognitive.com/eowg/persona.html> 
 
Changes include:
I added a second name to the following:
Martina Prado
Marc Blake
Andy Petroff
Willam Travis
Jessica Pratner
Mary Stone
Caryn-Ann Robinson
It's awkward using both names each time - I left first names where they had
previously been, as well as Mrs., etc. within the body of the persona - can
change that if needed.
 
Made Martina Prado and Caryn-Ann Robinson more goal oriented.  
 
I made William Travis older - is this better?
