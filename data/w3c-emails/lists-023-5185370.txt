WSTF,

I think the CSUN early bird discount ends today, 20 February. We are
still planning to do some Web site design work there (hopefully
usability testing and maybe more).

It would be good to have several WSTF folks at CSUN. Charmane, Carol,
and I plan to attend. Anyone else?

Also note that WAI IG plans to meet on Saturday late afternoon.

Oh, and, we probably will not do any usability testing at the Technical
Plenary (and I'm not sure that I will be able to go).

Best,

~ Shawn
