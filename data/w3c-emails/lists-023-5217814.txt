Just some thoughts.

It would be a very good use of time to run users through some of the 
more challenging areas of the site that we have brought up in past 
calls. We know there are a couple of items that will benefit from the 
validation of placement. At minimum it would be great to do a run 
through of our baseline usability test on the proposed information 
architecture.

If we can...
- A closed card sort would benefit us as it would validate the sorting 
we have done to date with users.
- If we can do rapid prototyping that would be great for validating the 
site structure from a task perspective.

If we do prototypes, they should be devoid of visual design to allow 
the users to focus on information, versus presentation.
