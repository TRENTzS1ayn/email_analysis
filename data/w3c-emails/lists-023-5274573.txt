Notes on survey at CSUN

What about asking persons with disabilities what they would want to 
see on our site.  Right now, I think we are clueless.  This is a 
different angle on the Web site redesign but CSUN would be a good 
place to get this information. It is the one big hole we have in the 
redesign process.  We don't really know what people would want to 
find there.  We know designers, we no policy people, an that is it.

I was thinking of creating a very simple survey instrument. Something 
simple like

Name - just so we don't get duplicates

Email address - because it is a technology conference and because we 
could ask them more questions or to test our site at a future date

Do you have a disability that affects your use of the Web?

If so, what is the disability that affects your use of the Web? 
(voluntary info)

Have you heard about the W3C?

Have you heard about the WAI?

Have you ever visited their website ?

If so, why did you go to the site?

Did you accomplish your goal while you were on the site?

Why or Why Not?

If you could, what would you put on the site that you did not find there?

or---

         What would you like to find on the site that you did not see?

That's it.  Pretty simple. The data would be easy to compile.  It 
would also be an opportunity to handout information about W3C and WAI 
if you could arrange to have some delivered there in time.

Are there any permissions or legal issues with doing this????

I would be happy to distribute the survey and may have someone else 
who is coming to the conference who might be willing to assist with 
it also.

Any thoughts??
