WSTF: re: CSUN: Survey for persons with disabilitiesThis is a great start Charmane!  We could add a little disclaimer I've got samples we could take from.  I'd also be happy to distribute the survey at CSUN.

There are a few other things I'd be curious to know such as:

- How often do you use a computer?
Everyday              Couple times a week                     Couple times a month                      Rarely/Never 



- How many times in the last week have you used the internet to obtain information?

Not at all                        1 - 5 times                             5 - 10 times                           too many to count





- Do you regularly use a document editing program (eg. Microsoft Word)?



- What challenges do you encounter regularly on the internet that frustrate you? (or something like this)

  Notes on survey at CSUN


  What about asking persons with disabilities what they would want to see on our site.  Right now, I think we are clueless.  This is a different angle on the Web site redesign but CSUN would be a good place to get this information. It is the one big hole we have in the redesign process.  We don't really know what people would want to find there.  We know designers, we no policy people, an that is it.


  I was thinking of creating a very simple survey instrument. Something simple like


    Name - just so we don't get duplicates


    Email address - because it is a technology conference and because we could ask them more questions or to test our site at a future date


    Do you have a disability that affects your use of the Web?


    If so, what is the disability that affects your use of the Web? (voluntary info)


    Have you heard about the W3C?


    Have you heard about the WAI?


    Have you ever visited their website ?


    If so, why did you go to the site?


    Did you accomplish your goal while you were on the site?


    Why or Why Not?


    If you could, what would you put on the site that you did not find there?


    or---


          What would you like to find on the site that you did not see?


  That's it.  Pretty simple. The data would be easy to compile.  It would also be an opportunity to handout information about W3C and WAI if you could arrange to have some delivered there in time.


  Are there any permissions or legal issues with doing this????


  I would be happy to distribute the survey and may have someone else who is coming to the conference who might be willing to assist with it also. 


  Any thoughts??
