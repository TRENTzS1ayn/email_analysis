Michael ,
The nested layout works for me... I can make out the  structure and navigate to  section of interest. Only thing missing was it does not say it is a site map anywhere. Perhaps the page title could be WAI Site Map. 
(I understand it is a draft)
Another alternative  for nesting lists: to  use h3 (and if needed , h4) levels to nest links under main groups marked with h2.  That will obviate  the need to have lists with single li items (as   is the case  now, although they are child lists). When headings are nested, their structure is clearer and are easier to  navigate using an audio user interface as used by screen reader users.  The lower level headings too can be indented and the heading  size can be a visual cue
 for sighted users.
Another thought: If these six h2 level items are also  presented   as links in one place near the top or in a left side navigation bar, they will also  allow one to navigate  to the relevant section   by activating the link. So it is another method of navigation available to one besides navigation by headings.
the table representation does not  convey structure to JAWS users like me.
