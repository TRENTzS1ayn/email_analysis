WSTF,

Attached is another version of a potential WAI site map. Let's call it
Version B.

Please note that both this version and the version Michael sent last
week (let's call that version A) are incomplete, unpolished drafts.
Therefore, please review the overall information architecture, including
category grouping and labeling. (And at this point, avoid commenting on
things like broken links.)

Talk to you in a few hours!

~ Shawn
