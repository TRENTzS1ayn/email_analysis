Glad to note that  this version  has implemented most of  suggestions made on Jan 2, 2004 (see below). I find this more   easy to navigate and the structure
is clearer.
One inconsistency at the page start however, under
"On this page" :
The h3 level headings for item #5 are listed as a to e  and these are not coded as links. However the h3 level items forTraining and Events are not listed
at all under  item#4. I suggest that the a to e items under #5 be knocked off too.
Sorry I am not able to attend the meetings.
E-mail of Jan 2 is attached for ease of reference.

WSTF,

Attached is another version of a potential WAI site map. Let's call it
Version B.

Please note that both this version and the version Michael sent last
week (let's call that version A) are incomplete, unpolished drafts.
Therefore, please review the overall information architecture, including
category grouping and labeling. (And at this point, avoid commenting on
things like broken links.)

Talk to you in a few hours!

~ Shawn
