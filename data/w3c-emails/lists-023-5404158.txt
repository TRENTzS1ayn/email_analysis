WSTF,

A revised draft WAI site map based on previously e-mailed versions from
Michael and me, and discussions in today's teleconference is at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/site-map

Note that this is a draft of a site map and basic information
architecture. It does not necessarily translate into web pages and
specific navigation design. Also, there certainly will be
cross-referencing in navigation and content pages.

I think that this version includes all of the change we discussed today,
except:
- left "About WAI" item as that will probably be a page, such as
http://www.w3.org/WAI/about.html
- did not figure out a good way to include Evaluating under WCAG
- did not add UA = browsers & multimedia players because I think we will
need to add brief explanations for several things (including for web
content!), maybe on site map &/or elsewhere, e.g., home page &
navigation pages

Best,

~ Shawn

P.S. Thanks to Andrew, Carol, Charmane, Justin, & Michael for a very
productive & enjoyable "worksession" on this during the teleconference!
