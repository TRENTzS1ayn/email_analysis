MessageShawn,
The site  map after all serves as a table  of content  for the entire site and as the site map has   over a hundred links, a  navigational bar that lists the main categories under which links are grouped is sufficient in my opinion. If these main groups are not over 5 or 6, it might be even ok if there is no skip nav link  for them. Else one is desirable.
So I strongly feel that the h3 and lower level headings should be kept out of the top nav bar and duplication be avoided.
Another thought: If the main groups are being numbered, then the h2 level items too should be prefixed with the corresponding  numbers.
Thanks,
Sailesh

1. I wonder if it's OK to list the h3 level headings where they are important to clarify the content under h2 heading, and not to list the h3 level headings where they are not important to clarify the content? See the revised version for a suggestion of where subheadings are needed in the list at top and where they are not needed - at:

    2. will probably link all of the list at the top later (just didn't get to it for rough draft)
