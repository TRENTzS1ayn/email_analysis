Ah, OK. Then, I'd say leave in ID 2 and fix the description, and add in
the notes that link to AFb as an example.

Also, for ID 1 ("Alternative Sytle Sheets") can put in notes example:
"Select a Style Sheet (CSS)" at http://www.trace.wisc.edu/sitehelp/

ok with me.

i got the idea when looking at different categorizations of things,
e.g., having all the checklists under "C" and techiques under "T" - in
addition to site map categorization.

(note that WAI search might be complicated and have not yet figured out
the feasibility of getting that soon...)
