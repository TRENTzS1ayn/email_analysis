(I think) Mon 19 Jan is Martin Luther King Day in the US. Some people
might be on holiday. If enough people can't make it, we could cancel the
WSTF teleconference (which means we need to get more done this week!
:-).

Please respond:

__ I probably would participate in WSTF teleconference on Mon 19 Jan

__ I probably would NOT participate in WSTF teleconference on Mon 19 Jan

__ Other: _______
