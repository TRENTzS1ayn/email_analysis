Search within results is always good - and is a feature of the standard
Google anyway - not sure if part of the licensed version.

I think the easy/complex Boolean search is a very low priority, but "search
within results" should be medium/high.

ID 3 "WAI Subsite Search"

In reviewing the MITS/Parking Lot list
(http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/mits.html) I found this that we
should include on the features matrix:

- ability to refine search, search within results, easily construct
complex queries without knowing boolean stuff
