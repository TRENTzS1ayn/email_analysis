I think that the purpose of this list isn't as much to list new content but 
more to list new features or functions that we are goign to have one the 
webiste.  It's more new functionality that we are going to add to the 
website, like searches, dynamics calendars, login's, things that people are 
going to have to interact with. 

Like if the events calendar was just an events calendar, it wouldn't be 
appropriate to put it on this list. It fits on the list because the user has 
the ability to submit their own events for people to see on the calendar, 
it's a new feature versus new content. 

The feature's list originated with Michael so he would probably be able to 
tell best, but that's what I would guess should go on the list.
