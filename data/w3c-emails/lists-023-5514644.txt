Hi Justin,

I seem to recall some discussion about another desirable search feature:

Group - Search
Function Name - Search Within
Description - used to narrow the search further by providing additional
key-words and searching within the current search results
Notes - seems to be a Google feature already and may just need
adapting/respecifying for W3C/WAI use
Importance - Low?
Effort Required - unknown
Dependencies - Google renegotiations WRT overall W3C search facility

Cheers,  Andrew
