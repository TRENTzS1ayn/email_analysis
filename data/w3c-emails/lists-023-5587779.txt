I put up the features matrix excel spreadsheet on my webserver.  If you go 
to: 

http://www.msu.edu/~thorpjus/w3cwai/fmatrix.xls 

The computer prompt should ask you if you either want to open or download 
the excel spreadsheet that has the features matrix on.   If that doesn't 
work let me know; I might have to switch over to just doing it in HTML. 


Best Regards,
Justin Thorp
