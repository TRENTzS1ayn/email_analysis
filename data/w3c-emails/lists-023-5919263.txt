Carol,
 
Thanks-a-million for keeping active on the task force and sending drafts
to the list for comment.
 
I think wireframes are jumping ahead a little too much at this point.
Specifically, we need to agree on the content of the home page and
navigation design before we start working on designs/wireframes.
Hopefully we can get that going before CSUN. Note the "next Steps"
listed at:
    http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/Overview.html#tasks
 
Also, I think we agreed last meeting that we wouldn't be far enough
along for actual testing at CSUN unless people were very prompt in
completing action items and commenting on the list, which,
unfortunately, has not happened. I'll send updated action items &
reminder for participation soon...
 
Thanks again.
 
Best,
 
~ Shawn

I've put together some wireframes for you to look at.
http://www.kognitive.com/eowg/wireframes/index.html
 
Consider the following:
-These are NOT representative of what the site may end up looking like.
-These are just for discussion and possibly for testing at CSUN.
- Most text is "greeked"
 
Feedback I am looking for:
- Navigation - is this accurately labeled for now (came from Site Map -
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/site-map)?
- Font Size - should it be larger for testing?  (When printed these are
about the size of a piece of paper - 600 x 800)
- General Comments on wireframes
- Should I continue mapping out the tasks with this style?
- I'm eliminating some tasks as I go because we won't be creating a full
site - please give your advice on these as well.
 
Regards,
