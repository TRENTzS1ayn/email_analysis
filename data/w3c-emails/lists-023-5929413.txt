WSTF folks,

Here is a bit of "carrot and stick" for increasing involvement on the
WAI site redesign.

We set a good foundation with the analysis work. We have a little more
effort required to wrap up analysis, and then we get to "the fun part" -
design! There is a lot of interest in the WAI site redesign throughout
W3C. There are many benefits to our keeping the work moving along as
rapidly as feasible.

Please note the following requirements for participation in the WSTF:
* minimum 2 hours per week of Task Force work
* remain current on the Task Force mailing list and respond in a timely
manner to postings on Task Force mailing list
* participate in Task Force telephone meetings, or send regrets to the
Task Force list
* assist in preparing Task Force deliverables for discussion
These are listed at http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/2003/wstf. If you are
unable to meet these requirements, please call me and we can discuss it.

Please regularly check the latest list of action items (which I send to
the mailing list and are in the mailing list archives,
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wai-eo-site/). I will send an
updated action items list soon - feel free to complete items before I
send the update so you can get marked "[DONE]" ! :-)

Best regards,

~ Shawn
