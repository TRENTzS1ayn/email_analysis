I can fly to LA Wednesday evening and attend Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.


I'd appreciate finalization of the WSTF meeting times ASAP, as I'm coming
for the meetings. I'm not signed up for the conference. For example, if
we're not meeting on Thursday, I would fly in on Thursday. I hope we're
alloting enough time to meet to make it worth my coming to LA. I do plan to
look at the exhibits, though.

P.S. I'm about half way through the page type assignments.

P.P.S. A belated comment to Carol re Implications:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/analysis-sum#ideas
- good food for thought while looking at the WAI Web pages and considering
page types and design. Thank you.
