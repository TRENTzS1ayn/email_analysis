MessageAnswers to a Shawn's questions:

SH: How do you propose to overcome the problems that folks had last time we tried card sort, for example, people not understanding what the documents are from the title?

CS: I'm hoping that by eliminating many of the cards we can simplify the excercise to such an extent that there is much less confusion.  However, given the fact that most users of the site are familiar with only one of the 3 main working groups I think we will still need to act as facillitators more than a "normal" Card Sort excercise would entail.


SH: Have you planned methods to conduct the card sort with participants with various disabilities?

CS: Partcipants who are unable to physically manipulate the cards, could either have their assistants act as their "hands" or we could depending on the situation.

Participants who are Deaf or hard-of-hearing who know English shouldn't be a problem as we can create written instructions (I've done this before for these types of participants).

Blind or sight-impaired participants who have a good memory and hearing could still do the excercise verbally.  Also, I could prepare text documents that they could manipulate on a laptop or other device - does anyone think that would be a good idea?

Participants with cognitive disabilities will be challenging.  This would need to be done in a quiet room with lots of time.
Participants who are not literate in English for cultural (ASL or other language is first) reasons is easier.  I've done usability testing with participants in this area and with a translator it is no problem - it's difficult at best without.


SH: Have you thought about recruiting participants at CSUN?

CS: Yes - at a previous conference I set up a table with posters and signage asking for volunteers to help with research.  If we can create some similar signage with the W3C/WAI logo's and also ask for volunteers we should be fine.  At such a large conference I suspect we may have to turn people away since we are limited in the amount of tests we can physically run.  If we can create post-cards or similarly sized paper to hand out with a time and place before testing that would help get the word out as well.

Looking forward to continued conversations on this!
