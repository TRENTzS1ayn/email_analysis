Shawn,

I am attending CSUN during the week and WAI meetings on Saturday.  I 
will be involved in WSTF as much as I can without further challenging 
my health at the moment or missing CSUN sessions I need to report 
back on. It would be helpful to know just how much time you are 
planning on spending for these meetings since these are not official 
face to face meetings.

Charmane
