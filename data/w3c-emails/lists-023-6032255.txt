I can participate in the card sort at CSUN.  Probably will not be 
able to talk to anyone before hand.  I am leaving on the train on 
Sunday morning. I am being called into special meetings tomorrow that 
were not planned. No communication possible until Tuesday when I 
arrive. Anyone can catch me Tuesday night at LAX Hilton, though.

>Here is my first go around at shortening the card sort list for the

>Here's a brief summary of what I've done with this file:
>- I took out references to version 2.0 for simplicities sake
>- I took out odd outliers - such as Errata
>- total of 40 cards removed - I think we can cut more.  The more we 
>cut the more we can test because time will be shortened per test.

>Here are the group names I suggest for the closed card sort - please 
>give feedback on this as well (from
