a. vision:
- definitive resource - consider expanding to include "authoritative"
and "credible" 

b. user groups:
- add "assistive technology developer" (probably under tool developers
category)
- suggestion to identify users in two categories: "technical
implementers" and XYZ (thoughts on that other group: "functional
implementers" or policy, management -type folks)

c. user groups & content list:
- request to define primary audience for each doc or group of content
(we previously questions whether that was worth the effort)

d. personas
- Andrew's concerns about personal information in personas
--- consistency issue, maybe less when have primary (perhaps take out of
others?)
--- pros & cons of explaining
--- put secondary, rather than first
--- (also change  college > university)
- identify primary personas

e. tasks
- action item: spell check the list (and for grammar, eg. #7) 
- new task? or already covered? or merge with another?: we contracted
out site development and required it to meet WCAG. how can i tell if it
does?
- new task?: how do people with various disabilities use computers and
Web sites?
