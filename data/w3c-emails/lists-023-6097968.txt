Great suggestions - thanks!  The notepad files are an easy solution that
will be very effective I think.

>Hello Carol,
>1. Well, I would  like to have  the list of 52 items say in one Notepad
file
>and the seven categories  numbered (as 1, 2, 3... or A, B, C,....)in another.
>Then I will  pick (copy)  the first of the 52 items, review the categories

appropriate.
>2.  Another way is to have the two lists separately  as before. Then  label
>every item in the  list of 52 with its category.
>3. Someone who prefers to work with a spreadshheet might like to have the
>  categories  in column B, C, D...H (column header) of an Excel sheet.
>The 52 items can be in column A (row headers). One  can  set an Excel sheet
>to read row and column headers and navigate down the list. Against every
>item in the list, one can move sideways and   mark an X in the desired
column.
>Hope these help.
>One can also use table in MS-Word  but that might be a bit clumsy I  feel.
