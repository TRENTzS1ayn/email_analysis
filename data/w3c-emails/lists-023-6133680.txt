Dear All,

I have posted a more recent version of the Closed Card Sort document: http://www.kognitive.com/eowg/closedcardsort.htm.  

I have changed the following:
-Added definitions - please take a look at these and tell me what you think.  They could use some work!
-Added common acronyms to the ends of the Web Page names.
-Added the words "email list" to the Archives page names (4 instances)

I also added the following to the Web Page List and randomized the list:
-Accessibility Features of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
-Accessibility Improvements in HTML 4.0
-Alternative Web Browsing
-Evaluation and Repair Tools
-Logos for Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines
-Logos for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
-XML Accessibility Guidelines

I'm creating written directions (will send tomorrow) that will encompass what you see on this page and will also include the following Pre-study questions:
1.  Have you ever developed a web page?  Yes/No
    If they answer "No" we will thank them and discontinue the study (I'll write script for this)
2. Have you ever looked at any web accessibility guidelines or standards?
3. Have you been to the WAI site? Yes/No
4. If answered "yes" how often in the last 3 months?
Once     |     Once a month    |     Once a week

If time allows the participant will be encouraged to continue to further group their cards into subgroups and label them (with post-its, or other means).

I will add the text documents (based on Sailesh's - thanks again!) for testing to the site tomorrow and I'm also working on a reporting tool that will help us collect the data.  I'll bring 3 sets of cards, placemats and I'm going to create some simple signage for use at the conference.

I'm staying at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel - Los Angeles Airport (LAX)
6101 W. Century Blvd
Phone (310) 642-1111
You can also reach me on my cell phone: 773-218-6568 during the conference.  I will be checking email sporadically during CSUN.

Going to bed - will do the rest tomorrow. Safe travels all.

Regards,
