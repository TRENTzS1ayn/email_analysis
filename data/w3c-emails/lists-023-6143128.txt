Here's the final version.  Please note Blossom and Charmane I am printing enough documents for us to do numerous card sorts so you do not have to print anything.  However, as a precaution ALL of the documents you would need (including scripts, consent form, etc.) are now on this web page (go to the bottom section labeled: Text Versions and Documents).

After 3 pm Central I will not have access to the computer until late tonight in LA (at the earliest).  See you soon!

Thanks!
