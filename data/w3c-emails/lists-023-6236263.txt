Regrets yet again - I'll be in Canberra running a "web and online
accessibility" workshop
See www.visionaustralia.org.au/webaccessibility/workshops/

And the following week (before Easter) is also likely to be out due to a
workshop in Sydney the following day (taking advantage of the travel to
visit clients the previous day). Depends what time I travel.

Sooorrry,  Andrew
