Category.

not

> Participant #2: Wanted to be sure to note that "WAI Resources" could also
go

and

> Participant #3: Removed Getting Started (commented that she "hates that

> however.  Participant first completely excluded the Archives of Email,
then

belonged

> Participant #4: Removed the About WAI category.  Added Working Groups

> or adding a section with all the overlaps and just separating the
> differences (as in all that are similar).  He would then put Working
Groups

can

> Participant #5: All other cards subheading for home page (links).  Not
sure
> what "Getting Started" means - newbies?  All UAAG stuff together.  Also
> Guidelines and Techniques.  The more ways to get somewhere the better -
> cross linking. WAI Glossary placement is content dependent.  WAI
> definitions? Resources? Terms for Guideline and Techniques? Saw these
cards
> as being a bridge between Getting Started and Techniques.  Organization,
> structure, policy - bridge between policies/newbies and Tech, policy vs.
> tech.  Post-it note comments: right now on WAI pages - likes navigation on
> left because scroll bar is there (tech person).  Would put WAI Contacts on
> WAI Groups in addition to WAI Contacts Category
>
>
>
> Participant #6: Added new category of "Education Training Outreach
> Work-Sheeting kinda stuff" - she stated this was "Inter-mediary category
> between Getting Started and Techniques."  Comment on Resources Title:
> "Confusing Category Usually Means links to outside info."  Comments on
> General links on Web Accessibility card: "Why do you need this card?
Where
> is this going to take me? Makes me think too much.  What are the general
> links - where will it take me that all the other's hasn't already taken
me.

> Participant #8: Combined Guidelines and Resources and Techniques into one

comments:

> About WAI; Getting Started, Guidelines Resources and Techniques; Events
and
> Meetings; WAI Groups.

> Participant #9: Added FAQ's or FAQ's and Glossary Category.  Should have
