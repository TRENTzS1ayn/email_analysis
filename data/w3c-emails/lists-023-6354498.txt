WSTF,

I updated our latest new home page contents based on this week's WSTF
and EOWG discussions:

- http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/design-sum#homehome has notes,
links to lastest version and previous versions, list of changes

- http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/sketchpad/home-slh1 is a very rough
idea for layout

Note that Blossom's & Matt's previous versions are linked from:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/design-sum#sketch

Looking forward to talking about Blossom's next wireframe at on
teleconference on Monday 10 May!

Best,

~ Shawn
