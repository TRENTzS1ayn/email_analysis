Hello, all -

For discussion, here's my second draft redesign of the WAI home page.

I think I got all the new content, and I used three columns to bring the
"tagline," Announcements, and Guidelines and Resources all above the fold. I
also played a bit with images (the one of T B-L was degraded to start with,
so was difficult to work with). 

There were still tweaks I wanted to make, but I've run out of time. 

Shawn, if you post this to the WSTF site, please don't forget the Images
folder.

Regards,

Blossom
