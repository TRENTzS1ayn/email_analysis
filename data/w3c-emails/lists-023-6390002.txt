Please note that the background of the T B-L quote box should be gray, not
blue. My monitor at work shows this color as grayish, and I did not catch
the error until I viewed the page on my home monitor. The error is due to a
typo in the style that I did not catch in my rush to catch the ferry. 

Shawn, if you post the page to the Web, please change the style color to
"background-color:rgb(94% 94% 94%)".

#quoteBox {border-top:1px solid #000; border-bottom:1px solid #000;
border-left:3px solid #000; height:140px; background-color:rgb(94% 94%
940%)}

Subject: WAI home page redesign - bkm draft 2


Hello, all -

For discussion, here's my second draft redesign of the WAI home page.

I think I got all the new content, and I used three columns to bring the
"tagline," Announcements, and Guidelines and Resources all above the fold. I
also played a bit with images (the one of T B-L was degraded to start with,
so was difficult to work with). 

There were still tweaks I wanted to make, but I've run out of time. 

Shawn, if you post this to the WSTF site, please don't forget the Images
folder.

Regards,

Blossom
