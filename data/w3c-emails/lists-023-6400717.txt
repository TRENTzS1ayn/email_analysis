I think that this site is much more visually appealing then the last draft. 

My only concern is that when I look at the page my eyes are going 
everywhere.  I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking at.  I can't tell 
what the main section is that I'm supposed to be reading. 

Plus I would flip Tim Berners-Lee's body so that he is facing into the 
quote.  Right now he is like an arrow pulling people's eyes off the page. 

Thanks,
Justin Thorp
