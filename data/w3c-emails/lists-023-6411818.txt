Great job Blossom!

I agree with Justin's statement on flipping the photo - we'd need to get a
new version anyway - that one appears very lossy on my screen.

As for eye-wandering I had a bit of that myself.  Possibly making some of
the vertical DIV's stronger would help.  Also, the links at the top appear
very close together in IE 6 and Opera.  There's not enough white space
between them to make them appear as individual links.

I don't know that we need the WAI <h1> above the content as we've already
got the Logo above it.  I think it just gives us less space for content -
any other thoughts?

Pardon me if we've discussed this.  It would be great if we could use a
dynamic content system that was easy to implement and made 100% accessible
pages - does one exist?  Charmane, you had a post the other day regarding
CMS - are there any you would recommend?  I've been using Movable Type for a
blog I'm working, and it appears to be great - as long as you add ALT text
to images.  I'm not sure what our policies are on using other technologies
though.

Talk to you tomorrow.

Carol
