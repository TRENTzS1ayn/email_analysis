My information is rather limited, unfortunately. My exposure to CMS 
is in the havoc they have caused. I have not heard of any strong 
success stories. The CMS that are canned and very expensive tend to 
restrict access to the templates by the purchaser and are not as 
accessible. The  seller creates the template and may require 
additional fees to change the template or the template is not coded 
in a way so that accessible coding can be added by the end user. That 
is what has been reported to me.

The best we have been able to come up with is using the Macromedia 
Contribute with Macromedia DreamWeaver. We control the Templates so 
we can make them highly accessible.
