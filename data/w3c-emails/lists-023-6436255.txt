  Hello Blossom,
  1. Was wondering if WAI site search  form should  be on the home page.
  2. I see that  certain sections are listed under guidelines and resources section. Should they be h3 level headings like you have for the Highlights?
  3. A minor edit:
  I think Strategies, guidelines, and resources to make the Web accessible _to_ people with disabilities
  should be 
  Strategies, guidelines, and resources to make the Web accessible _for_ people with disabilities

  Thanks,
