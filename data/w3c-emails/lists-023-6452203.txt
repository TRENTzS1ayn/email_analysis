I have had an action item from a while back to write a short one paragraph 
introdocution on personas that was to be added to our User Center Design 
Intro page. 

Sincerely,
Justin Thorp 

********************************************
After consulting with Shawn and Carol this is what I came up with: 

Personas are a tool for the designer to help keep the needs of the users in 
mind. Personas take the primary or target users and help to turn them more 
into a concrete person that the designer can better understand.  The better 
that we can identify the persona???s skills, motives, and achievements, the 
better we can understand what features they would want on the website.
