Some questions and comments:

1. Do we want links in the page title (<h1>)? I would vote "no." I also
would not put the byline info in the title, particularly since we have this
contact link in the page content.

2. The link to the slide show could be in the first sentence: "The (begin
link) Online Overview of the Web Accessibility Initiative (end link) HTML
slide show provides an overview of Web Accessibility and the Web
Accessibility Initiative."

3. Follow this sentence with "The slides will help answer..." with the
questions in bullets.

4. Rather than repeating information already in the slides, simply link to
the respective slide:

(link) Online Overview Table of Contents
(link) Tips for Using These Slides (no link to Slidemaker Tool as that's on
the Tips slide)
