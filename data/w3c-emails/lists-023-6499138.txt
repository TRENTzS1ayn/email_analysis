Charmane,

Thanks for getting a start for us to work on. It would be great if you
can send the next version out this week so we can keep things going
through the list even through we are not meeting.

The other thing we need to is have a very small requirements document
for this. In addition to providing focus and direction for the document,
it will cover things like the clarifications from today's meeting that
helped with Blossom's comments. You could also note here which "slides"
will be removed when the Introduction is released. For an example, see:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/bcase/changelog#about 

I started a requirements section at the beginning of a changelog for
this document.
- http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/changelogs/wai-intro-slides.html
You can fill that it & send it to the list & I'll post it.

Here are a few more suggestions and questions in addition to those we
discussed on the phone today:

- "For a complete index of slides, go to Overview of Web Accessibility."
Is this going to link to the table of contents
(http://www.w3.org/Talks/WAI-Intro/Overview.html) or something else?

- The file that lists all the "slides" in one HTML page is:
http://www.w3.org/Talks/WAI-Intro/all.htm

Regards,

~ Shawn
