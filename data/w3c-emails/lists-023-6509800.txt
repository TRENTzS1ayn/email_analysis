Blossom & WSTF,

I updated the site map, adding a high-level organization at the
beginning:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/site-map

Note that one of the confusing parts for Michael's colleague in doing
"schematics" just from the site map was that some headings in the
detailed page list are just to group the pages in the site map, while
others are actual pages themselves. For example, "About WAI" is a page,
and "Guidelines and Resources" is probably a single page. However,
"Getting Started," "Guidelines and Techniques," "General Resources,"
"Promoting and Implementing Web Accessibility," "Evaluating Web
Accessibility," and "Developing Web Accessibility Training" are headings
on the "Guidelines and Resources" page, not pages themselves.

Reminder that the page components we identified are at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/design-sum#components

Some questions for navigation: 
- site navigation: left column hierarchical or breadcrumb?
- if left column hierarchical, does that include "utility nav"?
- in-page links / table of contents goes where?
- related links goes where?

A mockup working group home page is at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/sketchpad/uaag-wg.html

Feel free to call me if you have other questions. Also, I'm not sure if
Matt is planning to work on navigation design and page layout this week
or not. If you are concerned about overlapping work, you might want to
check with him.

Regards,

~ Shawn
