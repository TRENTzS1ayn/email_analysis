Blossom,

Per our conversation, I added sample pages for an annotated navigation
page (Guidelines and Resources) and a non/TR/ document page with suite
nav. (disclaimer: they are rough and might have some small
inconsistencies between them:) They are listed at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/UCD/design-sum.html#sketch

I did not cut content from the uaag sample working group home page
because I remembered that WSTF prefers to have the mockups with a
representative amount of content.

I keep getting this nagging feeling that maybe the Guidelines and
Resources should not all be on one page; rather, each section should be
its own page... Feel free to play with options!

Best,

~ Shawn
