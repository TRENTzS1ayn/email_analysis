Per the IRC notes below I think that I have done everything noted on 
the intro page. If not, let me know.

The link to the TOC is on the page.
The other items that were directly from the slide set are removed.
I didn't attempt to format the page since we don't have a set 
page design yet.
The instructions are on the page but I have a concern about 
removing both
slide 1 & 2 from the slide set.

I have seen instances where these slide sets are used as a whole in 
conference situations so I have some concerns.

#1. Slide One: "This presentation covers"- would belong inside of the 
slide set if used independent of the intro web page. MAYBE should 
retain text in the slide set and on the intro page on the web

#2. Slide Two: How to navigate - belongs outside the slide set on the 
intro page and only on the web for an independent user, not 
usable/necessary in a conference situation

Discussion on #1: Agree, Disagree, Comments, Can you think of any 
other circumstances beside presentations and training where the slide 
set could be used independent of the intro page and might need the 
text of Slide One

Discussion on #2: Agree, Disagree, Comments

Any other thoughts????
