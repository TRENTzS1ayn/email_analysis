Here is the action item regarding use of graphics/aesthetic design 
reformatted from the email submitted 5/9. We have multiple 
definitions of the word graphics going on so I hope this outline 
helps to clarify that issue for our discussion. 

Generally, I think that the aesthetic design has to be addressed on a 
site first before you decide on any content graphics or you will have 
a cart before the horse issue. The aesthetic design/wrapper affects 
the entire site and the content visuals do not appear on every page.

I am willing to integrate whatever examples of content 
visuals/graphics that others would like to provide in the outline 
below. I just can't recall any from our conversation - total blank. 
Sorry In any case, here is submission #2.

I. Purpose of Graphics
    A. Aesthetic Design/Site-Wide Wrapper (see e-mail Charmane 
Corcoran May 09, 2004 )
Aesthetic Design Sets the general look and feel of the  as a whole site
Appears on every page and wraps around/holds the content
Captures the viewer's attention and draws the user into the site
Enhance comfort level and goes beyond brand identity or simply 
including a copy of the logo
Involves design elements such as lines, outlining, picture, gradient, 
or numbers and shapes in the banner background
   B. Content Visuals/Graphics - page by page content area, inside the wrapper
Content Visuals can Extend the Ability to Communicate Concepts by 
Enhancing Comprehension and Reinforcing Content - may include charts, 
graphs, pictures, or other graphic representations.
Special Case - the Home Page
1. Introduces Special Content or connect graphically to the Site Structure
2. Special Content Graphics that may/may not appear on interior 
pages. These visuals are not part of the aesthetic design. 
3. Examples - browsers, keyboards, monitors, etc. (see e-mail Shawn 
Lawton Henry 30 Apr 2004) serving functional purpose related to 
content
