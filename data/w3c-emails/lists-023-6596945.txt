For Discussion on the use of Homepage & Site Design -- 

In the WCAG it says:
14.2 Supplement text with graphic or auditory presentations where they will 
facilitate comprehension of the page. [Priority 3] 

I know that most likely this checkpoint was meant for a document. That there 
should be an illustration or audio presentation that goes with it. 

I think it also can be taken that we have a general message that we are 
going to be presenting on the homepage.  By adding an aesthetic design or 
enhancing  its look and feel we are using the design to supplement the 
message(tagline).  Some people might not be able to comprehend the site  
just by reading the content. A design would help illicit the same emotional 
response and give people an understanding of the message of the site and the 
organization. 


Sincerely,
Justin Thorp
