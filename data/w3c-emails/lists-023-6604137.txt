Here are a few URLs to help with the discussion.

http://www.csp.msu.edu/pages/misc/ops/jobsint.cfm

This is not a site I worked on but it is fairly crisp presentation of 
the difference between wrapper (consistent site-wide design) and 
content. Everything in under "Internships" is the content. Everything 
in the navigation and with the logos is the wrapper. It remains 
constant throughout the site. What goes in the content including any 
graphics (graphs, photos, etc.) to explain or expand the content can 
change based on the specific page text. Some pages will have no 
graphics with the content and some will. This site appears to have no 
content graphics.

Splash pages example: http://www.coleman.com/coleman/flash_intro.html

A splash page is not what I intend when I talk about aesthetic 
design. I was referring to the wrapper or the consistent site-wide 
design. Splash pages are a barrier in most cases because they 
generally need a plug-in of some sort. I consider them over-kill, 
viewed once then by-passed on succeeding visits.

Our Trustees site is an older example. The home page and Tier I & 2 
pages are not identical but the home page sets the graphical 
wrapper's "look and feel" for the rest of the site.   The content 
area is framed with the wrapper.  What is in the content area changes 
from page to page. No graphics in the content here either.

The following link to our Sesquicentennial web site comes closest to 
the aesthetically pleasing and graphical representation. In this case 
there is not a significant difference between the home page and the 
Tier I pages. There is a difference more of a difference between them 
and the Tier II pages.  It is not in final form yet but is available 
to the public.
