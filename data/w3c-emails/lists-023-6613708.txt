>Per the IRC notes below I think that I have done everything noted on 
>the intro page. If not, let me know.
>
>The link to the TOC is on the page.
>The other items that were directly from the slide set are removed.
>I didn't attempt to format the page since we don't have a set 
>page design yet.
>The instructions are on the page but I have a concern about 
>removing both
>slide 1 & 2 from the slide set.
>
>I have seen instances where these slide sets are used as a whole in 
>conference situations so I have some concerns.
>
>#1. Slide One: "This presentation covers"- would belong inside of 
>the slide set if used independent of the intro web page. MAYBE 
>should retain text in the slide set and on the intro page on the web
>
>#2. Slide Two: How to navigate - belongs outside the slide set on 
>the intro page and only on the web for an independent user, not 
>usable/necessary in a conference situation
>
>Discussion on #1: Agree, Disagree, Comments, Can you think of any 
>other circumstances beside presentations and training where the 
>slide set could be used independent of the intro page and might need 
>the text of Slide One
>
>Discussion on #2: Agree, Disagree, Comments
>
>Any other thoughts????
