> Here is an introduction to UAAG page.

Matt,

Should some other UAAG documents be listed on this page? such as:
- Frequently Asked Questions on User Agent Accessibility Guidelines
(UAAG) 1.0
- Checkpoints for User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0
- Errata in User Agent Accessibility Guidelines
- UAAG 1.0 press release
- UAAG 1.0 testimonials  
- UAAG implementation report
- UAAG implementation evaluation form

We discussed the possibility that once the guidelines intro pages were
in place, we might link to those from the WG pages and not repeat the
links (e.g., under http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/#pubs). Now that you've
started an intro page, what do you think about that?

Also, a reminder to remove all sense of style for the EOWG review.
Thanks!

~ Shawn
