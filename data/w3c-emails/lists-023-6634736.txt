Here's my action item from the meeting.

http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/sketchpad/uaag.html

I am concerned that, out of context, this content doesn't look very 
useful. I think it makes more sense with all of the things that were 
taken out by request put back in. Likewise, removing the links to the 
other Guidelines is a negative, in my opinion. Other thoughts are 
welcome.
