Matt,

Thanks for making the changes.

One thing that seems missing: I thought we agreed to change the headings
from questions.

I will provide a little context to the EOWG about how the Intro pages
fix in the overall site design.

I think we meant for the links to the UAAG documents to stay in there. I
think we meant only to replace the link to the other guidelines (WCAG &
ATAG) with a link to the Intro page for all the guidelines (as yet
un-named), and to remove the breadcrumb and "utility navigation" (About
WAI, etc.) for this version to go to EOWG.

Unless others remember differently, could you add back the links to the
UAAG documents (perhaps including others as mentioned in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wai-eo-site/2004May/0029.html
) ?

Which things?

I am concerned that, out of context, this content doesn't look very 
useful. I think it makes more sense with all of the things that were 
taken out by request put back in. Likewise, removing the links to the 
other Guidelines is a negative, in my opinion. Other thoughts are 
welcome.
