Hi,

In order to provide the best support for an accessible teleconference, the
planned date of April 14 did not provide adequate time to make all necessary
arrangements.  I have contacted the presenters and we are in the process of
exploring the rescheduling of the teleconference to either April 21 or April
28.

I will keep the list posted as we make progress.
