Many thanks for the John Gardner link, How did I miss it first time 
around?

It's intriguing, seems strange that onmouseover is used to generate 
sound, but what the heck...

http://www.peepo.co.uk/SVGmobile/click.svg works on the zaurus750 PDA 
with a little help and tinyline 1.5
so making it ASVG accessible should be a doddle ~:-)

thanks
