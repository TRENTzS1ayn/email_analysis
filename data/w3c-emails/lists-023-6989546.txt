I have been talking for a while about accessible Web 3D applications. One 
idea was to create a panel on this topic to a Web 3D conference in April as 
an outreach event and then use that and possible other contacts that we to 
create a corresponding WAI RDIG teleconference event.

We also talked earlier about doing something similar for the CHI 
conference. Maybe this kind of format could work as an outreach format to 
get researchers interested and thinking about these issues in their work 
and then use the work already done and contacts from the conference to 
create an RDIG event?

Naturally, not all RDIG events need to be related to conference outreach.

Feedback?
