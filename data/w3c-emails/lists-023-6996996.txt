It's been suggested that I submit a proposal for a roundtable to GDC on 
Accessibility and games.
It would be really helpful if we could accumulate some expertise on 
what makes a game accessible.
I've a contact at the RNIB who has supplied some materials.

This is a really fundamental problem, it is far from trivial, and 
merits attention.
Games are about having fun, and it's more fun if everyone can join in 
:-)

Does anyone have any suggestions?

thanks
