I think this would be a good topic. It touches on a lot of issues that 
regular WAI guidelines groups struggle with. Along with the fun aspect 
is the idea of competition that is inherent to many games - and also to 
a lot of assessment in education, and other scenarios from everyday 
life.

Having an idea about what work is being done strikes me as something 
that would be very valuable.

Cheers
