We are starting to share the received papers with the reviewers.

Please respond to the list if you want to be a reviewer for the next event. 
So far I only have Charles, Mark, Wendy and myself. Maybe I have missed 
somebody?

We also have a meeting next Monday 9am EST (14 UTC) to start discussing the 
papers and hopefully already make some selections as the holidays are 
approaching. Mark will have more details of the time schedule but the goal 
is to do the decisions rather sooner than later.
