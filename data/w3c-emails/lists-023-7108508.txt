I'm not sure how much I can continue in this group because of some 
unfortunate funding issues.

To help a bit I updated the checklist template I made earlier.

http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2003/11/checklist.html

I also made a page of the submissions for the reviewers of the next event 
and unless there were changes Wendy promised to organize the rest of the 
review in Jan. 7th. It looks it will be an interesting event.

Thanks for everybody for all your contributions and Happy New Year!

Marja
