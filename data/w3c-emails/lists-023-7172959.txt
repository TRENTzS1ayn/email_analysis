Could someone please write me what the invitation proposal is? I dont 
want to look too ignorant and stupid...

eg Invite experts for  a one hour telephone conference call to discuss 
web collaboration software and accessibility?
is it more than this? did I miss something out? do we have a fixed date 
yet?

thanks

Jonathan
