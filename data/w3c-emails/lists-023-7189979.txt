Hello All,
Here are some URLS I have on Joint Attention research on collaboration
processes.  Seems to me there is a relationship between cognitive
disabilities and Joint Attention research, for example in sharing gaze.

To summarize, Joint Attention research seems to focus on Eye contact needs,
how to share attention in collaboration and programming issues related to
creating the sharing needs.
