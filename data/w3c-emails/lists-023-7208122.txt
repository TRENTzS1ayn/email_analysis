After discussion on process issues with our W3C staff contacts Wendy and
Marja,  it became obvious that we need to re-evaluate our timeline for the
first event. What follows is rationale and proposal for a new timeline.

We need to provide 30 days advance notice of our public events. As a result,
a February event is no longer viable, and the W3C Tech Plenary and the CSUN
Conference dictate that our first event can take place no earlier than the
week of March 24th.

If we assume our event takes place during that week, we need to send the
public announcement out during the week of February 24th.

This then leads to the issue of topic and presenters. Collaboration remains
the topic, and we have generated some good leads up to this point. During a
previous planning call, a suggestion was made to issue a Call for
Presentations, as befitting a workshop model. Now that we have more time,
the Call for Presentations idea should be considered.

What I would like to propose to the planning group is the following:

We discuss and decide the content for a Call for Presentations during the
next planning (Monday, February 10). The Call should then be finalized and
issued no later than Friday, February 14. This implies also that between now
and the 14th, we identify candidate recipients (individuals, groups, lists)
to receive the Call. Of course, projects already identified will be on the
recipient list.

The call will present, among other things, Use Cases that highlight the
accessibility issues for collaboration. The challenge will be for presenters
to respond to the use case in the context of their research. I will provide
an initial use case in a following message and challenge you, the planning
group members, to propose additional use cases.
