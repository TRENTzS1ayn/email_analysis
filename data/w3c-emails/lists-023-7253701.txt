Hello,

Here's a rough draft for today's discussion:

Position Papers / Interest Statements

@@need an intro about the event:  a summary of the topic, the goals of the 
discussion, the mission of RDIG

Position papers (interest statements) are a springboard for discussion at 
the event.  **You should submit one to the chairs during registration. (@@ 
should we ask people to register?)** It should summarize:

   - If your organization conducts research and development of 
collaboration technology, describe that research and development.
   - If your organization uses collaboration technology, describe how you 
use it including:  1. issues that you run into  2. specific accessibility 
issues  3. work-arounds that work  4. description of tools used
   - Your potential contributions to the discussion, including any specific 
proposals or suggested solutions.

Position papers should be short, around 2 paragraphs (x characters/words). 
Position papers will be published on the public Web pages of the event. 
Position papers must be available for public dissemination. Submitting a 
position paper comprises a default recognition of these terms for publication.

The planning group (**defn of active participants in rdig) will explicitly 
invite the authors of particularly salient position papers to present their 
position at the event to foster discussion. In this case, the authors are 
also required to make the slides of their presentation available on the 
event Web site (@@link to event web page).

Allowed formats for position papers and slides are HTML. Papers in other 
formats will be returned, with a request to use one of these formats.
