Agenda:

Discuss Call for Presenters
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wai-rd/2003Feb/0013.html

Summary:

Today's call focused on the draft proposed by Wendy.

We discussed the topic of having presenters distribute reading materials to
the list ahead of the presentation. Were there incentives to encourage
participants to read these materials ahead of time? Nothing feasible, other
than wording in the conference announcement to the effect "Call participants
are expected to have read the materials in advance of the presentation".

On the topic of questions from the participants, preference was stated for
both email and IRC questions from the audience, with first priority given to
questions received ahead of time.

Prepare a set of directions for presenters regarding how to handle
questions.

We spent a little time discussing the expansion of research related to
collaboration to include those studying the psychological/social aspects of
collaboration. Led to conclusion that this may be better dealt with as a
future RDIG topic area.

We discussed the introduction and the chair began putting together some
introductory paragraphs.
ACTION: Chair to submit a draft of the introuction to the group in the next
day.

Agreed that participant registration was appropriate. Suggested to add check
box so that registrant "agrees to read advance material".

Agreed that the 2 paragraph position paper was workable.

Agreed that a reference and link to W3C IPR policy was needed.

All should review draft call.
