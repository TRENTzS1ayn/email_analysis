I have posted an HTML version of the Call for Position Papers at:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2003/03/call-collaboration.html

It incorporates a number of the comments received thus far, but needs your
review. There
are strategically placed typos, so a close reading is expected (but no
prizes awarded). I would like some comments and suggestions on the "Who
should participate" section, in particular.

At this point, it looks like we're headed for a conference call to discuss
this Friday, February 28. Details will be posted shortly.
