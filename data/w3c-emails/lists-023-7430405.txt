Mark will make and send out later today.

presentations..."
- s/presentations/position papers
- s/researchers/ researchers  and practitioners
- after the use case, remove @@insert use case 2. link to page on rdig site 
that would have room for additional use cases. e.g., doyle's.
- under goals: goals of conference not goals of rdig
- goals for this: forum for synergistic exchange of reserach ideas
- submission info: re: invite 2-3 authors...if that few, odds are too low.
- thus, put first "all will be published..." - that more of an incentive.
- short presentations from select papers selected to stimulate discussion.
- only looking for research? also looking for things that work?
- that's what we mean by practitioners.
- s/all papers/all relevant papers

-  lists: sigchi research list, sigchi announcements, utest, acm groups, 
CHI-WEB
- some lists are closed. when send suggestions, let know if closed list or not.
- text only version sent to list?
- best, yes.
- marja send heads-up to w3t-pr
- everyone send suggestion for list and if those lists are closed or not 
(and if so, if you volunteer to send)
