I think I got everything into the call, based upon the discussion today.

You can find it at:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2003/03/call-collaboration.html

Please review and have any comments to me by Monday morning.

You'll note that the links to the Use Cases and Planning Group page are not
done yet. Those should be done over the weekend.

I'll be sending out a list of distribution targets between now and Monday,
and expect to see some from you on the list, too.

Thanks for all your efforts to get this wrapped up.
