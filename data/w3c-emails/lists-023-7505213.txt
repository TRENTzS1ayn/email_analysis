Here is a link to a sketch tool (in Oxygen project) that can follow drawing 
gestures and automatically detect objects in certain domains. For instance, 
it may be programmed to detect the components in an UML diagram with arrows 
and boxes or a physics environment with weights, ropes and pulleys. (Sorry 
that almost all material is in .pdf)

If this tool or other similar sketch tools would produce SVG diagrams that 
have a hierarchical structure with labels and metadata that helps users to 
understand the image, the image could be either seen visually on the Web or 
understood from the structure.

Here is another tool IC2D for helping to draw images without seeing them. 
It uses a 3x3 grid that helps users to navigate through the image.
