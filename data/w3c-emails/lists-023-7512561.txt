Web annotations help collaborating users to create and read comments in the 
context of the documents. Annotea is a metadata based annotation framework 
that uses W3C standards as much as possible. So the annotation information 
is readily available for different kinds of clients. Here is a link to 
Annotea project home page.

And one of the earlier Annotea papers:

annoChump is one client that uses Annotea annotations server in the context 
of IRC for documenting URI's

Also EARL evaluations can be thought as annotations with a different 
schema. Here is
