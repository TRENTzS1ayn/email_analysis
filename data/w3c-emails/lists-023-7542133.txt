Hello,

I took an action item to draft templates for meetings. I came up with three:
1. Planning meeting template - to help organize information for an event. [1]
2. Topic-specific event template - basically an "agenda" for an event. [2]
3. Topic-specific proceedings template - a means to gather information 
after an event. [3]

These are labelled "topic-specific" because we had talked about two 
different types of events:
1. "around the world" which would be a general discussion about a variety 
of current research
2. "topic-specific" which focuses on a specific research topic (e.g., our 
first event is a topic-specific event focusing on collaboration).

Thoughts?
