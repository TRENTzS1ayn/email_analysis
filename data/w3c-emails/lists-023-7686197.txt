It has been proposed that the RDIG planning group hold its teleconferences
on Mondays, as opposed to the original Wednesday schedule.

During today's planning call, there were no objections to this schedule
change.  To accomodate our participants from around the globe, the meeting
time will continue to alternate between 14:00 UTC  and 21:00 UTC. The next
meeting will be Monday, February 3, at 21:00 UTC.
