Folks -- during the RDIG call this morning I promised to provide URIs 
for the UPA 2001 Accessibility Workshop I mentioned.  Here are the Call 
for Participation 
<http://www.upassoc.org/conf2001/reg/program/workshops/w6.html>, and the 
workshop web site <http://www.nist.gov/accessws/>.  I will provide the 
workshop report as soon as it has been cleared.
