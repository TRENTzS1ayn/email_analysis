I had mentioned during the last teleconference a plan to meet again on
Monday, 21 July. Because of other pressing work related to an upcoming
conference, I did not follow-up with an announcement to the list in a timely
fashion.

Though the bridge is reserved, I am going to postpone the un-announced
meeting and take the discussion that was planned to the list, starting this
Monday.

regards,
mark
