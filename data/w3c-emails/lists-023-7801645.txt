Last time we were discussing of possible rdig f2f meetings and co-operation 
with e-swad and conferences. I promised to send some information on the CHI 
conference deadlines.

Next year CHI is in Vienna between April 24-29 and the theme is ambient 
intelligence, which I think would be very interesting from accessibility 
research point of view.

If we would organize the f2f as a CHI workshop, the deadline would be Oct. 
6 (http://www.chi2004.org/cfp/workshops.html).

Another possibility is a SIG with a deadline January 12th 
(http://www.chi2004.org/cfp/sigs.html).
