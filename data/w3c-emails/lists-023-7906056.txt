Agenda:

1. Increase Participation in planning calls
2. Completing the Proceedings from the first event
3. Planning for next event

Discussion:

How do we increase participation in planning calls?

Planning for more events ahead of time. Pages to gather links and materials.
Start discussions about those.

Phoning in during the evening is an issue for European participants. We
should try to schedule calls to allow more european participation.

We need more specific info about how to contribute to the planning group.
One example, or template, may be:
http://www.w3.org/2003/Talks/0523-www-wac/slide6-0.html

Give more ideas of how people could get involved.

We need to try to make more BOF kinds of events and include some RDIG slides
when doing presentations.

actions Mark: publish RDIG info slides for others to use

How to get more participants from Asia? People have been interested, doing
more outreach to get more interest, still many do not appear in calls. We
need to do more outreach and encourage participation.

Replace "how to join" page with "how to participate" page, which includes
joining information.

action Mark: create how to participate page

action wac: can the "how to join" form be made a real form?

Marja could start Web3D, visualization and using Semantic Web Topic pages if
suitable?
Home page "topics" links to topic pages.

action marja: take a stab at creating a topic page for one of the topics
interested in. use and comment on template.

agendum 2. "completing proceedings from previous event" taken up [from
wendy]

Current components of the proceedings are:
draft themes http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2003/04/28-themes.html
captions http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2003/04/28-captions.html]

w3c possible status would be: note or WD. personally WAC prefers something
in /WAI/RD/ space that does not have official w3c status.

How to structure proceedings so that they look like proceedings?

action hazel: take a look at web-based proceedings. find suggestions for how
to structure ours.
