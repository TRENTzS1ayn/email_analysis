First my apologies - I have been battling a couple of major problems 
today and couldn't make the call.

This is hard - there is a time zone barrier and a language barrier, and 
quite often something of a cultural divide as well. One thing that 
would be interesting is to ask people working in Asia (and in asian 
languages) to give something of an overview of work they are aware of, 
and perhaps ask them to encourage particular individuals to talk about 
their work.

There is a lot of good stuff being done in languages other than 
english, but people assume that the first place for development is 
always english, so don't look, or don't think they have something new 
to show.
