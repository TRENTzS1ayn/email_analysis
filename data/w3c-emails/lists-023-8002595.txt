Looks good.

<suggestion-1>
the link "Additional use cases can be found at the RDIG web site." that
points to http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2003/03/use-cases.html is non-functional.
Should at least have a shell page.

<suggestion-2>
In the section titled "goals of the teleconference" we state at the end
"Proceedings of the Teleconference will be web-published by the Research and
Development Interest Group." I think there should be a link and a shell page
attached called "Proceedings of Accessible Web Collaboration
Teleconference." The link to this page might go in the Goals sections, but
may make more sense if it is included as part of the "Submission
Information"

I think I got everything into the call, based upon the discussion today.

You can find it at:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2003/03/call-collaboration.html

Please review and have any comments to me by Monday morning.

You'll note that the links to the Use Cases and Planning Group page are not
done yet. Those should be done over the weekend.

I'll be sending out a list of distribution targets between now and Monday,
and expect to see some from you on the list, too.

Thanks for all your efforts to get this wrapped up.
