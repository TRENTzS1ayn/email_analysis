ACM has a number of Sigs that should receive the RDIG call announcement:


Groupware SIGGROUP
Computer-Human Interaction SIGCHI
Computers and the Physically Handicapped SIGCAPH
Hypertext, Hypermedia and Web SIGWEB

Within each of these groups there are typically one or more mailing lists.

Are there any that should be added to this list? Full list is at:
http://www.acm.org/sigs/guide98.html

If you have other suggested groups, particularly non-US, please send them to
me or the list.
