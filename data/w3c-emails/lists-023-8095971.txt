We are seeking position papers from researchers and practitioners (academia,
industry, government, consulting) on state of the art work in collaboration.

About the Topic

The Web is bringing together individuals and enabling them to collaborate in
new and innovative ways. Today, diverse communities of people can come
together in virtual spaces for meetings and working sessions. Examples of
such communities include standards development, engineering, knowledge
management, software/content development, accessibility, scientific
research, government/international rules and regulations, and education.
Diverse, international groups currently use a variety of tools, such as
instant messaging, IRC, shared desktops, and teleconferencing for real time
interaction, as well as email, mailing lists, Weblogs and proprietary format
documents for asynchronous interaction.

Who should participate

Researchers and practitioners active in any aspect of Collaboration
Technologies, Human Computer Interaction, Assistive Technologies, Disability
Studies, Web Accessibility, or related fields.

Event Details

Tentative date for the first event is Monday, 14 April, 2003. The format of
the event is a teleconference, augmented by Web-based presentation material,
and IRC.

Submission Information

Position papers are due by 28 March 2003 and should be sent to the chair
(hakkinen@dinf.ne.jp) and W3C staff contact (wendy@w3.org). The papers
should be short (limited to one page) and be submitted in HTML or plain text
format. Complete details and additional information is available in the Call
for Positions Papers.
