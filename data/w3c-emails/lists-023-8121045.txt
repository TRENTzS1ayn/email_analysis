Hello from CSUN!

I wanted to give you an update regarding the Call for Position Papers.  So
far, we've received two submissions, and there are two more that I am told
to expect (as of today). We have one more week to go.

During the past week, I have submitted the call to several groups (ACM
lists, usability information sites). I am also reaching out to individuals
who may also wish to participate.  Now is the time for those of you with
contacts in the collaboration field to reach out to individuals and projects
you are aware of and let them know of the call, and encourage a submission.

I had planned to have a teleconference on Monday, March 24, but I will not
be able to make it as I will be in St Louis to attend a funeral. If
possible, I would like to reschedule the call for later in the week. Those
interested in participating in a planning call, please suggest times that
you would be available, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.
