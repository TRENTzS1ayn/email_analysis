Hello,

Due to travel, I am going to have to postpone the conference call planned
for Monday, May 19.  I apologize for the short notice, and have to admit I
had mis-read a flight time on my itinerary when I had originally set up this
call.

A new date and time will be announced as soon as possible on the list and on
the RDIG home page. In the mean time, I would like to ask each of you to
take a look at the themes [1] from our first event, developed by Marja, and
send any comments to the list.

Thanks,
mark
