See the original call with new deadlines below:

Call for Papers (Extended): Teleconference on Making Visualizations of Complex
Information Accessible for People with Disabilities

The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative [1] Research and Development Interest
Group [2] is extending the Call for Position Papers [3] for a teleconference
focusing on research issues of accessibility and visualizing of complex
information.  This teleconference is the second in a series of discussions
that will cover a variety of topics related to accessibility and Web
technologies.  Real-time transcription will be provided for participants of 
the audio teleconference to ensure accessibility.

[3] http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2003/09/call-vis-papers.html

We are seeking position papers from researchers and practitioners
(academia, industry, government, consulting) on state of the art work in
visualization technologies.

About the Topic

The amount of complex information available on the Web is growing and the
types of information are becoming more diverse.  This information includes
scientific measurements, financial data, modelling and simulation results,
demographic information, and metrics describing the web itself
(communities, metadata, and relationships between pages).  Researchers and
practitioners are developing innovative graphical presentations of
information (visualizations) that can help users easily grasp the complex
information.   The goal of this event is to explore visualization research
and discuss possible models that could be used to make data accessible for
people with various disabilities.

Who should participate

Researchers and practitioners active in any aspect of Visualization
Technologies, Human Computer Interaction, Assistive Technologies,
Disability Studies, Web Accessibility, or related fields; and people with
disabilities with interest or experience in different approaches to
accommodating their requirements for accessible Web-based visualizations.

Event Details

Tentative date for the first event is 26 January, 2003. The format of the
event is a teleconference, supplemented by Web-based presentation material,
real-time text transcription, and IRC.

Submission Information

Position papers are due by Friday 12 December, 2003 and should be sent to
the chair (hakkinen@dinf.ne.jp) and W3C staff contact (wendy@w3.org). The
papers should be short (limited to one page) and be submitted in HTML or
plain text format. Papers in other formats will be returned. All
submissions and presentation slides must conform to W3C's Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 to at least level Double-A. Complete details
and additional information is available in the Call for Positions Papers.
