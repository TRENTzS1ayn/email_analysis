I would not leave visualizations out as that is what many people also do 
understand and understand that they are inaccessible. You can have access 
to the numbers in a table and still not have access to something similar as 
good visualizations.

As a compromise, maybe we could do something like "Making Visualizations of 
Complex Data Accessible for Persons with Disabilities." ?
