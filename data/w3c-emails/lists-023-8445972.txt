In particular, we are looking for research which can address requirements 
expressed in the following use cases.

For some reason (maybe my Finnish processor) it sounds very strict to me in 
this way. Maybe we should add we are not limited to these use cases and 
requirements? E.g. I did not see anything on mobility. Or just make it 
sound a bit looser not so restrictive.

Otherwise, I think it was fine.
