Thanks Marja!

Comments, anyone?

Here are some quick comments:

"Occasionally" didn't seem right. Here is an alternate sentence:

"The web is home to a growing and dynamic source of complex information and
data sets from many domains."

> This information includes scientific measurements, information
> of models, demographic information, information of Web communities,
> relationships between Web pages, and Web metadata.

Some rewording of the above sentence:

"This information includes scientific measurements, financial data,
modelling and simulation results, demographic information, and metrics
describing the web itself (communities, metadata, and relationships between
pages)."

Since we try to include "practicioners" in our audience, I tried to include
them, along with a few other changes:

"Researchers and practicioners are seeking to develop innovative graphical
presentations of information (visualizations). Effective visualization can
make it easier for a user to quickly ascertain trends, make comparisons in
several dimensions, and detect irregularities or anomalies in data.
Visualizations can help users see new, interesting information or
relationships between data, and illustrate structures and known, useful
relationships."


That's all I have for now... Comments?
