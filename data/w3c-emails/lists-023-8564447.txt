Thanks for the rewrite Marja-Ritta
good changes Markku.

some minor changes to the last paragraph...

<old>
Another example is a bar chart; some bars are several times longer than
others while some are so small they are barely noticeable.  Reading the
number associated with each bar may be useful but it does not capture the
instant recognition of seeing one bar twice as long as any other in the
chart.  How can we visualize these relationships in an accessible way?

and some changes to the last question (my thought is that we are not trying
to visualize the information in an accessible way, but to provide an
alternative (non-visual) representation of the instantly recognizable visual
relationships....

"How can we represent or summarize these  provide the same information
contained in these visual relationships in an accessible way?"

or

"How can we provide the same information contained in these visual
relationships in an accessible way?"
