One more 'Minor Change' - Extension of Jim's work -

[Original]
"Another example is a bar chart with some bars that are
several times longer than others, while other bars are so
small they are barely noticeable."

[Revised - 'Small' becomes 'Short', to match 'Longer',
above]
"Another example is a bar chart with some bars that are
several times longer than others, while other bars are so
short they are barely noticeable."

(OR, change "Longer" to "Larger")
