Basically I like this, but wonder if we could make more of the fact 
that any large representation of information (something that contains 
more than the magic 7?2 data points at a given level) is inherently 
complex.

An idea to explore - are we really talking about presentation of 
information, or about enabling easy searching of the information? Is 
there a difference?

cheers
