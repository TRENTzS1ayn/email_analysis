 - "Self-Editing" my own suggested change, adding to Jim's
Work:

[Original]
"Another example is a bar chart with some bars that are
several times longer than others, while other bars are so
small they are barely noticeable."

[Revised - 'Small' becomes 'Short', to match 'Longer',
above, AND the word "THAT" should be added, following
'small'/'short']

".,..several times longer than others, while other bars are
so short THAT they are barely noticeable."

(OR, change "Longer" to "Larger")
