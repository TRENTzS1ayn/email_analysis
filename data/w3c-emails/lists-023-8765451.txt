Hi RDIG Members:

With Summer over, we will be getting RDIG back into a regular meeting cycle.
There are some new members who have recently joined, new topics to explore,
and past activities to review.

Two planning group calls are scheduled, with details below.  The first, on
short notice, is Monday, September 8. If you can attend, please let me know.
My intent is to review where we are and make plans for the next call,
scheduled for Monday, September 15. A summary of this call will be available
for those who can't attend.

For the September 15 call, I want to specifically invite our new members
(including those who have expressed interest in joining, but have yet to do
so), along with our regular planning group participants.  My intent with
this call is to kick off the planning cycle for our next event.

I look forward to your participation.
