Well once again slightly late for the call :-(

I am looking for an SVG browser to run on the Zaurus 750 to view our 
website http://www.peepo.co.uk

and having plenty of problems, so to chear myself up I installed 
jsqiggle

This enables people to collaborate in real time over an svg drawing.

It worked for me using a Zaurus 750 and macosX.2 with java1.4.1

What can I say, it should be great fun!
