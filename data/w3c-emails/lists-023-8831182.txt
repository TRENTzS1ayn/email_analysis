Fascinating!

I would Strongly Suggest starting on the Web Page whose
address is Below, that Marja provided.  It's a "Text-Only
description of a Very Complex Picasso Abstract Painting" -
Great Mental Imagery!
I think it would be best to Read the Description First, and
Afterwards, if you are able, Look at the Painting with your
Eyes - It 'Opened My Eyes', in may ways!

After visiting the link in the original email below, I would
suggest visiting the Project's Home Page:
http://www.tate.org.uk/imap/index.htm

I quote the first part of this page:

"Matisse Picasso i-Map Project

About this Project

This digital project has been designed for visually impaired
people and aims to explore some of the ideas, innovations
and working methods of Matisse and Picasso, two of the
twentieth century's most influential artists."

Their Menu includes:
"Welcome | Introduction | Get Started | Comments | Raised
Images | Touch Tours at Tate"

Truly Fascinating!
