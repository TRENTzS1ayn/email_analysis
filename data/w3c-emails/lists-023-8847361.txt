I promised last week to find out how much it would cost for participants to 
be part of a normal CHI workshop if RDIG is interested in organizing one 
and if that is even possible for us (still finding out about that). We 
might attract more researchers normally attending to CHI that way but might 
also loose some not attending.

  The fee for one day workshop is 150 USD.
