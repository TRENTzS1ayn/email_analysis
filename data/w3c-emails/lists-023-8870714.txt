Could we please have a little more detail on the proposed Visualisation 
meeting?
There may be some part of our work on the peepo project that would be 
suitable for this topic.
It would be helpful if we could help define this early on.

It is likely to be closely related to the work carried out at SWAD-E

It would be helpful if scenarios included:
Online virtual environments: games, chatrooms(habbohotel), 
web-directories(peepo), musical(1)
assumptions about navigation
relationships between images: redbus and bin-cat-owl (2)
problem of illustrating generic topics such as 'humanities' 
transparently


Is there a likely time for Dec 3rd?

thanks

1http://www.braunarts.com/3dmusic/navigation14of10.html there are many 
others
2 redbus:  if your local bus is green, then it will be harder to 
generalise a redbus, similarly double/single decker
bin-cat-owlgarbage can + cat is different to owl + cat, this can be 
helpful, however cartesian coordinates also.....
