Hello,

Thanks to those who reviewed the submissions and provided feedback.

During today's call, we reached a conclusion on the format of the next
event, and made a final selection of the submissions.  The presenters
selected will be announced once their participation has been confirmed,
which should be during the next week.

The format of the event will be the following:

Welcome and Introduction (Chair)
Invited Keynote (TBA)
Short Presentations (six of the submitters have been invited to make a short
presentation)
Moderated Discussion (led by Chair)
Wrap-Up and Future Steps

Since we are looking at a four week interval between the public announcement
and the event itself, the earliest possible date for the event will be
February 19. We will be exploring a date and time that works for all of the
presenters, and an announcement will be made as soon as possible.

Because our format is somewhat different from the first event, we will be
providing the presenters with an accessible HTML template that they can use
to create a small slide set to be used for their presentation. This will
ensure accessibility and consistency in navigation.  Wendy will be posting a
sample of this template to the list for review and comment.

We also spent a few minutes discussing ideas for our next topic. I will be
forwarding some ideas to the list, and an idea of a timeframe.
