Hello,

I took an action at last Friday's telecon to draft a template for 
presenters to use.  Since the presenters will have such a short amount of 
time, we decided to publish brief statements by the presenters instead of 
web slides.

Please provide feedback.  Are the questions clear?  Will these questions 
apply to all of the presenters? Is there a question that has been left out?

Draft available at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2004/01/presentation-template.html

Best,
--wendy
