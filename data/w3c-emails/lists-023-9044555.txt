Looks good, Wendy!

I'm thinking that some presenters might want to highlight at least one
technology they use - as an exemplum.  Many complex information media are
technology-specific.  So - how can we convey that we don't want the
technology highlighted, while recognizing that fact?

Subject: Draft template for presenters


Hello,

I took an action at last Friday's telecon to draft a template for
presenters to use.  Since the presenters will have such a short amount of
time, we decided to publish brief statements by the presenters instead of
web slides.

Please provide feedback.  Are the questions clear?  Will these questions
apply to all of the presenters? Is there a question that has been left out?

Draft available at:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2004/01/presentation-template.html

Best,
