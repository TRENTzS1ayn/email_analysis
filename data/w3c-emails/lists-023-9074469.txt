I apologize for not being attentive to the RDIG. I've been rehabbing my 
house, getting ready to retire (cleaning and moving my office), 
organizing and convening V2 IT Access Interfaces standards meetings, 
etc.  I will be more active as my transition to full time consulting 
stablizes.  In the meantime  I intend to participate as time and health 
permit. 

Is there going to be any RDIG or other WAI activity at CSUN (i.e. during 
or following and at the venue)? 

Thanks.     Bill
