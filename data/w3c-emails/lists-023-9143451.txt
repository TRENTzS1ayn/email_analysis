Hello all,

The announcement for the RDIG event should go out to WAI IG and this list 
by tomorrow and then we can circulate the announcement and registration 
information to a variety of mailing lists.  Please send proposals for which 
lists you would like to send the announcement so that we can coordinate and 
avoid duplicates.

We will have a 90 minute planning call on Monday, 7 June 2004 at 
10:00am-11:30am Eastern/14:00-15:30 UTC.

Agenda:
1. Finalizing agenda for the event
