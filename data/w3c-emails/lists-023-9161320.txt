Hello all,

The announcement for the 28 June 2004 teleconference on Making 
Visualizations of Complex Information Accessible for People with 
Disabilities went to WAI IG and to the communications team to appear on the 
W3C calendar and as a news item.

If you forward the announcement to a mailing list, please send the name of 
the list in an email to public-wai-rd@w3.org so that we can avoid duplicates.

Thank you,
--wendy
