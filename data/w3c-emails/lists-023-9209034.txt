i must say hat many can read ad that is a silly theing to say i do admit  tha 
thabbo is addictive plus slang is used alot but there is no need for it to  
be shut down
its is parents fault if they are letting there children spend hours at a  
time on a computer and surely if it was causing so many complaints habbo would  
have to shut down but it hasnt so dont complain all us kids love habbo and its  
away for children wo dont have many friends to learn how to make them !!
yours poofacely
group of anti habbo protesters 
DONT CLOSE HABBO !!!
