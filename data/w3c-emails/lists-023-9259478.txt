Call for Papers 

IBM Systems Journal 
Special Issue on Accessibility 

Sara Basson, Vicki Hanson, Michael Strack, guest editors 
IBM T.J. Watson Research Center 


The IBM Systems Journal is planning a special issue on Accessibility. 
People with disabilities number nearly 1 billion worldwide, representing a 
formidable force of employees and customers. The technology required for 
achieving accessibility dovetails with technology required for pervasive 
computing, as all customers need increasingly flexible, multi-modal 
interfaces to accommodate IT access under varying environments and with 
numerous devices. The objective of this special issue is to document 
significant contributions to the area of accessibility by IBM authors and 
other leaders in the field. 

Topics of interest include: 
Architectural considerations in achieving accessibility 
Applications designed for people with disabilities 
Business considerations in providing an accessible infrastructure 
Universal access and design 
Aging populations and accessibility requirements 
Models of accessibility management 
Surveys of recent work in accessibility 

In order to help us plan this issue, prospective authors should notify the 
guest editors of their intent to submit a paper by submitting a title and 
short abstract to Sara Basson (sbasson@us.ibm.com) by May 15.  The papers 
are due on October 15. Papers will be published on the Internet beginning 
in 2Q05 and the complete issue will be printed in August 2005. 

IBM Systems Journal strives to be a premier technical forum for software 
and systems aspects of computer science and engineering. The Journal???s 
Internet site is visited by 1.6 million readers per year, and 30,000 
printed copies are distributed to IBM customers, employees, and paid 
subscribers. Here is an excerpt from the information for authors: 

"A paper may describe original work, discuss a new technique or 
application, present a survey of recent work in a given field, or provide 
tutorial information.  Concepts and underlying principles should be 
emphasized, with enough background information to orient the reader who is 
not a specialist in the subject.  The desired focus is on new technology 
or science, rather than simple descriptions of products.  It is important 
to describe the value of specific work within the broader framework to 
which it pertains."
