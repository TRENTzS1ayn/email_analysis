Dear RDIG Participants:

The current RDIG charter is expiring soon even with the grace period under 
the W3C Patent Policy transition. Please review the following draft 
charter, and comment to the list as requested below. Please note that due 
to updates in the W3C Process Document, a milestones section is now required.

The draft is available at:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/charter2.html

1. Okay as is
2. Okay, but recommend the following changes (please specify)
3. Okay only with the following changes (please specify)

Thank you,

- Judy
