OK as is, but suggest the following changes in the group's practice, which 
could be reflected by changes to the charter:

This charter seems reasonable, but experience shows that it is hard to 
plan and schedule the teleconference events. It is not clear that anything 
will change in this regard.

Perhaps a renewed focus on using the mailing list, and on closer 
integration with other WAI groups, would be more appropriate as a way of 
stimulating activity, and exchange of information. I don't know if that 
needs any particular change in the charter.

I am not so clear about the role of a document on incoroporating 
accessibility in research. Beyond the fact that any decent research into 
human factors should be incorporating disability as a factor (along the 
same lines as medical research needs to include people from both genders 
if the plan is to unleash the results on both genders), it seems very 
difficult to write a general document about how to include disability 
factors. Moreover, it seems something that the EO group is better 
qualified to do.

By contrast, one thing the group might do is offer to work with particular 
projects, and how they can best incorporate accessibility into their work, 
more along the lines of the Semantic Web Best Practices Working Group. 
This might lead to some conclusions that can be generalised (or to a 
conclusion that there is little that is general beyond the very obvious 
basics).

Some example projects might include working with the Concept Coding 
Framework group, who are developing techniques for interchange of 
documents written using symbol sets such as PCS or Bliss, with providing 
access to VoiceXML for Deaf people through alternative interfaces, or 
looking at developing audio editing interfaces for structured and styled 
content. It seems that a quick teleconference on this kind of topic might 
not be as valuable as an ongoing discussion, and that WAI might be able to 
bring its very strong connection to and understanding of the fundamental 
architecture of the Web as a major added value to the discussion. A 
commitment of four hours per week might be better spent in asynchronous 
discussion by email than in trying to find appopriate times for a 
teleconference.

This could in principle be done under the current charter and released as 
the resources on research, or with minor editorial changes  to suggest the 
shifted focus.

cheers
