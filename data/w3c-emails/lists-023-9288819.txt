3. Okay only with the following changes (please specify):

Change "Teleconference" to "forum" throughout the document.

2.2 Scope:  change "through a mailing list, teleconferences, and
face-to-face meetings" to "through a mailing list, teleconferences,
face-to-face meetings, and other medium"

This will allow the use of Webcasts, collaborative media, IRC, captioned
multimedia, and any other forums we might wish to use. Not that I think we
are planning anything but teleconferences, but I could see a CSUN
presentation instead of (or in addition to) a teleconference, for example.

Otherwise, looks great!  Nice work, Judy!

Dear RDIG Participants:

The current RDIG charter is expiring soon even with the grace period under
the W3C Patent Policy transition. Please review the following draft
charter, and comment to the list as requested below. Please note that due
to updates in the W3C Process Document, a milestones section is now
required.

The draft is available at:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/charter2.html

1. Okay as is
2. Okay, but recommend the following changes (please specify)
3. Okay only with the following changes (please specify)

Thank you,

- Judy
