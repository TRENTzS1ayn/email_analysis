The scheduling difficulties are most likely tied to current resource 
levels, which may change.

EOWG could collaborate on such a resource but RDIG is the group in the 
position to accumulate observations, after a sequence of teleconference 
events, about how research projects may respond to guidance on inclusion of 
accessibility considerations. It is possible that such a resource is under 
development elsewhere but various researchers have expressed interest in 
having such a resource available.
