Ok as is.

This group may not be the place, however, including developers/manufacturers
of assistive technology as part of the audience may facilitate the inclusion
of the research results in actual products. Also, building a broader base of
collaboration between researchers and AT developers (who generally being
small companies, don't do much research) could lead to new research agendas
and AT ahead of the curve of innovation.

During the previous teleconferences, I have been intrigued by the range of
papers submitted that do not have accessibility as part of the research goal
or objective, but have an application to or impact on accessibility. I think
that shows a willingness of the researchers to consider a wider use/utility
for their research. If the group can get the scheduling problem under
control; as more teleconferences happen, we should see more of the same
response, and eventually see more research directed specifically at
accessibility problems that also have broader implications for people who
are non-disabled.

Dear RDIG Participants:

The current RDIG charter is expiring soon even with the grace period under
the W3C Patent Policy transition. Please review the following draft
charter, and comment to the list as requested below. Please note that due
to updates in the W3C Process Document, a milestones section is now
required.

The draft is available at:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/charter2.html

1. Okay as is
2. Okay, but recommend the following changes (please specify)
3. Okay only with the following changes (please specify)

Thank you,

- Judy
