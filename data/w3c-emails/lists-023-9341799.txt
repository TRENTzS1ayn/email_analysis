Okay, but recommend the following changes:

Section "6. Dependencies" - point 2 "EOWG" - consider adding other groups
of people EO reaches that would/should be interested in the work of RDIG -
a) accessibility experts/practitioners & b) web developers.

Clarification required: "8. Meetings" - suggests teleconferences approx
"every other month". However, "5. Milestones" show them scheduled
quarterly.

Section "12. Participation" - suggested rewording:
Current: "... invites experts from researchers of web technologies and
accessibility ..."
Suggest: "... invites experts from organisations researching web
technologies and accessibility ..."

Otherwise reads well.

Andrew

Dear RDIG Participants:

The current RDIG charter is expiring soon even with the grace period under
the W3C Patent Policy transition. Please review the following draft
charter, and comment to the list as requested below. Please note that due
to updates in the W3C Process Document, a milestones section is now
required.

The draft is available at:
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/charter2.html

1. Okay as is
2. Okay, but recommend the following changes (please specify)
3. Okay only with the following changes (please specify)

Thank you,

- Judy
