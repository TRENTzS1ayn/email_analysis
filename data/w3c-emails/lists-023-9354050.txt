Hello all,

We've been negotiating with the presenters for the Teleconference on Making 
Visualizations of Complex Information Accessible for People with 
Disabilities and have decided on the following date and time:  28 June at 
14:00 UTC [10:00 New York, 15:00 London, 23:00 Tokyo]

I'm setting up registration and drafting an announcement.  Please don't 
forward this message to other mailing lists. Please wait for the 
announcement which I should be sending on Friday.

We'll need someone to work with presenters to ensure presentation materials 
are accessible. Any volunteers?

Best,
--wendy
