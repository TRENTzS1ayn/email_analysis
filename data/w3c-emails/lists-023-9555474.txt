Hey,

Wouldn't it be better to put effort into getting rid of the craziness 
we call "software patents" instead of finding a solution working around 
something (web plugins) that's considered a basic idea based on common 
sense ?

Afterall, there's no guarantee that it stops here and there is so much 
more at stake than just web plugins.
