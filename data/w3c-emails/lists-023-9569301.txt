Hi,

There have been various reports floating around the web about the 
meeting, its purpose, who participated, etc. But I haven't seen yet a 
technical report that would highlight what the possible solutions were 
and where this whole thing might be going in the next few weeks and 
months. Thanks for any valuable pointers,

Antoine
