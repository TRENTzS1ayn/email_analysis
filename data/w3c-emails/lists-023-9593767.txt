I agree with your sentiment, but the reality is that if Microsoft and in
turn Mozilla, Opera etc all start to modify their browsers and phase out
support for current plug-in methodologies, both the W3C and particularly
developers will be force to adapt as well.

This being said, I can't believe that any court would expect browser vendors
to remove all "infringing" features without some sort of well defined phase
out period.  To do it without such a period would break some or all portions
of untold numbers of websites, including many business oriented ones.

Hey,

Wouldn't it be better to put effort into getting rid of the craziness 
we call "software patents" instead of finding a solution working around 
something (web plugins) that's considered a basic idea based on common 
sense ?
