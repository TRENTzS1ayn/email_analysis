I understand the issues, which is why the list went beyond just mixed 
namespaces. Also, I seemed to understand that it would be ok to embed content so 
long as the program wasn't controlled, is that correct? Is there any assesment 
of how direct the control ought to be (since simply loading is already a form of 
control)? Would changes in the *container's* SMIL timeline, affecting the 
timeline of AV content indirectly, count as interaction?
