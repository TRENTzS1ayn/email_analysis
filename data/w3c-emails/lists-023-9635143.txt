Hello all,

Will the verdict affect how Mozilla/Netscape and other browsers perform 
plugins?  From my stand point, my organization does not have a lot of 
pages that invest in plugins, but never the less, this does seem like 
developers like myself are caught in the middle and have to do a wait 
and see game now.  Is this a correct assumption?  Please advise.

Regards,

Orlando
