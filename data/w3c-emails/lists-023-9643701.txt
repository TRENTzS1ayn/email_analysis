What abt plug-ins implementing XForms ..
Has anyone come across applications which are solely functioning as XForms
clients ..(not using browser to host services)

Hello all,

Will the verdict affect how Mozilla/Netscape and other browsers perform
plugins?  From my stand point, my organization does not have a lot of
pages that invest in plugins, but never the less, this does seem like
developers like myself are caught in the middle and have to do a wait
and see game now.  Is this a correct assumption?  Please advise.

Regards,

Orlando
