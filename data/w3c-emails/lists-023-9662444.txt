1) What specific changes are contemplated?
2) Will browser upgrades be gradual (typical 1%/month adoption of new
browser model) or more rapid?

From W3 page:

In the near term, Microsoft has indicated to W3C that they will very soon be
making changes to its Internet Explorer browser software in response to this
ruling. These changes may affect a large number of existing Web pages. ...

There was widespread agreement that a solution that minimizes the effects of
changes to Web software, Web sites and the user experience was needed.
Microsoft presented several options that it has under consideration, and
benefited from constructive discussion of these options.

What abt plug-ins implementing XForms ..
Has anyone come across applications which are solely functioning as XForms
clients ..(not using browser to host services)

Hello all,

Will the verdict affect how Mozilla/Netscape and other browsers perform
plugins?  From my stand point, my organization does not have a lot of
pages that invest in plugins, but never the less, this does seem like
developers like myself are caught in the middle and have to do a wait
and see game now.  Is this a correct assumption?  Please advise.

Regards,

Orlando
