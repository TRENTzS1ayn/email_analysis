The W3C site http://www.w3.org/2003/08/patent stated:

"W3C believes that it is important for the Web community to begin now to
consider and contribute to the range of technical options available."

I suppose it's not just me, or is a technical analysis (developer speak) of
what is being cut/changed in MSIE (and other browsers) simply not available
yet?

How can we contribute constructive options without more information?

Any insight would be appreciated......
