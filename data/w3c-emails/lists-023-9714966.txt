Sorry, I just can't see this as a practical idea.

I build business applications for Intranets, where I use MSIE exclusively as
the client.

As much as I love MSIE and all it's well supported technologies, this would
wipe out many smaller businesses and ultimately stifle innovation.

Down the road, I'm thinking the fall-out from this Patent case will equally
affect MSIE and other more rigidly standard based browsers like Mozilla. 

But Microsoft is the only one with the resources for the new development
that's needed - who's going to pay these other developers to collaborate on
such an effort? Likely nobody.

It's too obvious who would dominate the North American market - and the rest
of the world would have nothing (or a patchy beta at best). 

I see this kind of approach as bad for everyone.
