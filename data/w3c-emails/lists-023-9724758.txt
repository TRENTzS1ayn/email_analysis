Christian and I just had an off-list discussion regarding his suggestion.  I
am now under the impression that it was meant as a way to show the world
(and more specifically, US lawmakers) that the current patent system needs
work, and only as a poor solution to the actual plugin problem.

His suggestion would effectively create two mutually exclusive and
incompatible World Wide Webs.  I think we can all agree that it's not a good
solution from that standpoint, but that was the point of the suggestion in
the first place.

If you're asked to wash the dishes, and you don't like doing dishes, break
some dishes.  The person asking you to wash the dishes may rethink the
original decision that you should be the one washing dishes.
