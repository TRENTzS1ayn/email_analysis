For (our website), which makes extensive use of Javascript and DHTML to
support user interaction with (primarily textual) data, our initial
assessment is:

I don't believe there will be an issue...given all the 'magic' on the
client-side is sent down the pipeline with each an every client-to-server
call.  It's not resident anywhere else on the client's system.
Nonetheless...this is useful information to know.

Does this sound right?
