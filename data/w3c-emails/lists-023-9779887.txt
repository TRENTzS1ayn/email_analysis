As wonderful as this sounds, many websites are profit-seeking ventures, and
I'm betting that most management bodies will tell their web developers to
"screw making a statement and get our website online!"

Also, there are way too many people out there that don't listen to us -- it
couldn't possibly be an effective boycott.

That said, I love the idea.
