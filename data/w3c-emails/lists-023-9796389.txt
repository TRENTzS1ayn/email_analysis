You raise some excellent points Christian,

Almost too many points to handle I fear.

I agree, but my statement was more about defense than foregoing knowledge.
Maybe I should have used the word "boycott" instead?

I sure hope the OSS crowd gets the message. 

A brief look at www.slashdot.org on any given day just confirms for me that
the anti-Microsoft crowd will fail to see this point because of their
anti-vision (a.k.a. blindness), even after the Internet has been pulled out
from under them.

I agree completely. Since the Internet came along, and the beauty of it was
realized, many industries have learned that they needed to adapt to survive
- except the Patent Office.

Patent Offices wants to keep everybody in the stone age of industry.

If what Gandhi said is true, and I believe it is, that "You have to be the
change you want to see in the world" - then the Patent Office's view of the
world is a very frightening thing......
