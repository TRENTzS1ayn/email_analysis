I have been reading some of the messages on here from companies and
individuals who apparently do not see any implications of this verdict. I
was wondering if anyone here uses Flash?

As someone who runs a small business making web application front-ends in
Flash, this ruling has the potential to hurt us terribly, if not completely
shut down the business.

Sure, we could return to making application front ends in DHTML and
Javascript but that seems as appealing to us as would a return to the
Victorian era (I had to stop myself from saying "stone age.")

Apart from the very concept of software patents being a Bad Idea (tm), and
one that we may have to tackle in Europe if the powers that be in the US
have their way, I believe that this has the potential to negatively impact
the hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of people working with or
earning their living through the Macromedia technology we know as Flash.

Also, could someone please enlighten me as to whether this ruling affects
Europe and other countries that do not currently recognize software patents.
If not, could we in the "free world" (i.e., those countries not bound by
software patents), please raise our voices a little louder so we don't have
to face such debacles in the future.) I know that there is currently a web
blackout movement going on against software patents (with sites such as
Knoppix signed up.) We need to make our voices heard so that Europe does not
become like the States in this regard (freedom, once lost, is much harder to
regain.)

All the best,
Aral
