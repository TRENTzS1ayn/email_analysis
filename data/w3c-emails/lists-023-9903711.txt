Patents are a _bad_ idea especially for small business that don't have a 
patent portfolio. Small business never stand a chance against big 
companies with a large set of patents (even if they do have a patent). The 
only reason I can think of that Eolas won this lawsuit is because they 
don't have any applications and therefor or not infringing on any patents. 
Otherwise Microsoft would have countersued them.

So where you basicly want to have a free market, software patents 
allow some clever guy to create a monopoly on something as basic as a 
progress bar and collects the money.

None of my software comes from the US. There may be contributions from the 
US, but since I'm only running Open Source software you can't say that I'm 
using US software.

So it may affect US contributions to Open Source software in the future 
(just like the DMCA probably had an affect on that). But as long as the US 
doesn't succeed in enforcing software patents on Europe, we can use 
plugins and progress bars and one click shopping scripts as much as we 
want.

So if software patents mean that in the long run US citizens can't run any 
Open Source software, I'm sure US will reconsider its point of view. If 
however they succeed in forcing the whole world to adopt software patents, 
sure they will have a huge advantage (all those basic patents that I 
consider common sense ideas).

If Europe thinks twice, I'm sure they understand what's at stake here.
