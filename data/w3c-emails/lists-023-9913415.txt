Hi,

Being a Shockwave developer (with Macromedia Director) I'm as worried as
you, but I'm also curious about what this will do for the open source
community. I'd be happy to switch to Linux if the apps I need to work
existed in Linux, like Macromedia products, Adobe Photoshop, 3DS MAX...

On the other hand, since MS most likely will appeal the verdict, I guess
this process will take years before it gets anywhere.

Kind regards,
Thomas
