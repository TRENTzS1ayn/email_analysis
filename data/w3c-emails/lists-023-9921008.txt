Another reason why software patents are no advantage for small companies. 
Even if they have a software patent, they cannot stand years of 
litigation.

If you plan to spend effort in rewriting a website, rewriting 
functionality in applications (because of this patent) or even discussing 
it, you're time is worth more if you can effectively fight against 
software patents.

Please consider sending money to eff.org or ffii.org.
