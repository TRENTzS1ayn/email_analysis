I haven't read the patent fully, but it would seem there's much prior 
art pre-dating these claims.

 From my own experience, Apple's HyperCard dates from 1987 and had 
XCMD/XFCN functionality that's exactly like today's browser plugins. 
It would be stretching definitions to describe HyperCard as an 
*online* system, but there were certainly similar online hypermedia 
systems of that era that had the claimed features. Intermedia from 
Brown university rings a bell.

The place to start looking is the archives of the ACM Hypertext SIG.
