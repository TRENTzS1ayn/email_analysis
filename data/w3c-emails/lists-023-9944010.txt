Yes. The University of California, the owner of prior art Viola project
( http://www.xcf.berkeley.edu/~wei/viola/violaHome.html )
has been satisfied by the jury verdict:

A Chicago jury has ordered software giant Microsoft (Quote, Company Info) to
pay $521 million to the University of California and Eolas Technology for
using patented technology in its flagship Internet Explorer browser.

The W3C effort to protect Internet operability may be more fruitful if
University of California will be also invited to this debate, including
future of XHTML and HTML standards.
