Hello there.

I've been looking for a comprehensive summary of both the patent issues 
and the alternatives Microsoft is investigating, and have so far found 
none.

Even after some digging, I have found little hard data (which led me to 
some musings over at http://mac.against.org/space/blog/2003-08-29.22:26 
that have some links to information I found relevant).

I have seen other requests for the implications of the suit in the 
mailing-list archives, but as of yet no one seems to have sat down and 
written a comprehensive  overview of both legal issues and 
consequences... Have I missed anything?

Thanks,
