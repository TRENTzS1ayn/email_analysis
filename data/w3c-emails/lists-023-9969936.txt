BTW, My reading of this situation is if Microsoft were willing to pay
ongoing royalities to Eolas, then no technical changes would have to
made in Internet Explorer.  The license agreement between Microsoft and
Eolas should also cover any 3rd party media player that runs in Internet
Explorer.  If such a deal were to be struck, then everyone else could go
about their business.  Ultimately these patent license fees could be
passed along to computer manufacturers who are already paying similar
fees for hardware patents.

Interesting musings Rui,

Please express yourself, but don't call this a comprehensive summary
while
editorializing your opinion at the same time.

This issue affects so many of us in so many different ways, that I think
the
only way to get through this is to focus on the technical issues
objectively.

The case for standardization and conformity for public websites is one
thing, but I'm a private Intranet developer and I'm more interested in
the
impact on the business solutions I provide with MSIE. 

Right now we are all short on technical details and some time-frame for
the
changes.

Thank you for your links, some of these look very interesting.
Cheers....
