I'm quite sympathetic to this concern, but I just looked at the text
of the document the other day, and I'm pretty happy with the way it's
treated:

[[
2.2. URI Ownership
The requirement for URIs to be unambiguous demands that different agents
do not assign the same URI to different resources. URI scheme
specifications assure this using a variety of techniques, including:

      * Hierarchical delegation of authority. This approach, exemplified
        by the "http" and "mailto" schemes, allows the assignment of a
        part of URI space to one party, reassignment of a piece of that
        space to another, and so forth.
      * Random numbers. The generation of a fairly large random number,
        used in the "uuid" scheme, reduces the risk of ambiguity to a
        calculated small risk.
      * Checksums. The generation of a URI as a checksum based on a data
        object has similar properties to the random number approach.
        This is the approach taken by the "md5" scheme.
      * Combination of approaches. The "mid" and "cid" schemes combine
        some of the above approaches.
The approach taken for the "http" URI scheme follows the pattern whereby
the Internet community delegates authority, via the IANA URI scheme
registry [IANASchemes] and the DNS, over a set of URIs with a common
prefix to one particular owner. One consequence of this approach is the
Web's heavy reliance on the central DNS registry.

Whatever the techniques used, except for the checksum case, the agent
has a unique relationship with the URI, called URI ownership. The phrase
"authority responsible for a URI" is synonymous with "URI owner" in this
document.

The webarch doc doesn't say, for example, that for each URI there's
exactly one human being who has final say on what it means.

Is it the choice of the term "ownership" that concerns you most?
Could you help me understand what it is about the text that concerns
you most?

Carsen Lutz does not have complete carte blanch to write anything on
that page, does s/he? The webarch text above makes it reasonably
clear, to me, that the "ownership" of this URI is held by some
combination of Carsen Lutz acting on behalf of some part of MIT.

I don't think we're saying they have control over the weather...
But in this example scenario, they do control the weather report.
I don't think I understand your concern.
