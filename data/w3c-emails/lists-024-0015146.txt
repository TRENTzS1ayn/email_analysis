Well, the assumption that I see in this bit of the document is that there
is a mapping from the normative specifications underlying the architecture
of the internet that in most cases of interest determines a unique agent or
individual that is ultimately responsible for the information that will be
served up in response to dereferencing a URI.  I believe that this is very
seldom the case.  For example, I believe that I am ultimately responsible
for quite a number of web pages, even many pages whose internet authority
is Lucent Technologies, Incorporated.

MIT is not involved anymore, even formally.  (Maybe they never were.)

The authority for kr.org is KR, Inc., but KR, Inc., certainly exercises no
day-to-day control over the contents of http://dl.kr.org/.  In some sense,
kr.org did delegate control over http://dl.kr.org/ to the Description
Logics community who, in turn, delegated control to Carsten.  However, I
do not believe that any of this delegation is accessible by software agents
working from Internet standards.  Certainly the Description Logic community
treats http://dl.kr.org/ as a good place to go for information about
Description Logics, but I don't see how this translates into the contents
of http://dl.kr.org/ being authoritative about Description Logics, let
alone about any other resource, except, perhaps, the resource that is the
current contents of the web page currently accessible at http://dl.kr.org/.

I think that this indeed what is being said, or at least what is capable of
being derived from the document.

I dispute this claim.  At best they control some weather report for
Oaxaca.  They certainly do not control *the* weather report for Oaxaca.

My concern is that the document appears to make it possible for the owners
of Internet domains to claim control over arbitrary resources.
