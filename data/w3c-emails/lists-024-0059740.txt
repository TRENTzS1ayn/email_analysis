Maybe it would help you, but my comment is not directed to the localized
wording of the document.  Instead my comment is directed to the notions
that come from an overall evaluation of the document.

Well, more-or-less.  At least it is the case that if a URI must
be globally ambiguous then it must have a single global assignment.  I don't
see, however, how URI scheme specifications assure this.  I also don't see
how forbidding different agents from assigning the same URI to different
resources prevents a single agent from assigning a URI to more than one
resource.

Well, my reading of this was that it had to do with the delegations that
are actually part of the specifications.  I don't see how this gets to the
cases were an unrecorded delegation happens.

Well I don't see where in this document the informal delegation is taken
into account.

Well, my original comment had to do with the ownership and
authoritativeness aspects of the document.  Here is one case were it
appears to me that the document might want to make an authoritativeness
claim.  However, I don't see how authoritativeness even enters into the
picture here.

Well, then, what is the resource identified by http://dl.kr.org/?  In
general what sorts of things count as resources for the purposes of this
document.  I don't see any delimitation of what can be a resource, and in
the absence of any delimination I, and any other reader, must be free to
consider any delimitation.

Suppose, that I, as the owner of http://weather.example.com/oaxaca intend
that it identifies the Oaxaca weather.  This makes quite good sense to me.
I will serve representations of the weather in Oaxaca, including html
documents that when rendered in browsers inform users of the weather in
Oaxaca, and XML/RDF documents that contain facts about the weather in
Oaxaca.  The thrust of the document appears to me that I then become in
some way authoritative about the weather in Oaxaca (although the document
doesn't quite go this far, I agree) and thus must have some control over it.

Well, this is not what is in the document.  The document always refers to
the Oaxaca weather report as if there was only one.

My main concern, as stated in my initial message, is that the document
does not adequately defines the fundamental terms it uses.  My initial
message pointed to ownership and authoritativeness as terms that are not
adequately defined in the document.  To that list I would also add
resource, identify, and represent.
