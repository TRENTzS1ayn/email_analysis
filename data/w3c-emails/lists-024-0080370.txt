Thank you for your comment: 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webarch-comments/2004Feb/0001
.html 
on the TAG's "The Architecture of the World Wide Web" Working Draft 9
December 2003.

The TAG discussed your Last Call comments at a recent meeting and I am
answering on behalf of the TAG.

The TAG asked me to inform you that we are aware of the dependency
between the WebArch document and a revised RFC 2396.  TAG members are
working hard to ensure that a revised for RFC 2396 is available as early
as possible and we are confident that advancement of the WebArch
document will not be held up by the status of the revised RFC 2396.

Please let us know if you are satisfied by this response to the issue
that you raised.
