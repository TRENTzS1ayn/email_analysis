Hi TAGers,

Thanks for doing a terrific job on the Arch document. It's quite a good 
read. I have one editorial suggestion:

I would find a high-level summary of the principles and good practices 
very useful. You have a section called:

List of Principles and Good Practice Notes

How about an overview of all Principles, Constraints, and Good 
Practices in a form that includes all of the items plus the text you 
tend to include in the boxes. For example:

Principle: Error recovery: Silent recovery from error is harmful.

I would take the principle and put it together with the nice 1 sentence 
explanation. String together all principles, contraints, and good 
practices, with the explanatory material in the box, you'd have a very, 
short, accessible summary of the whole document.

My main interest in such a re-organization, is that many of the 
principles are stated as buzzwords. They mean a lot to people who 
already know them, but are pretty abstract otherwise. I think that this 
short overview of the content of the arch. document would help make 
what is a somewhat long document much more accessible and likely to be 
used.

thx,

Danny
