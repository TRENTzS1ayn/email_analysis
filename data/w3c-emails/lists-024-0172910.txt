Hello,

The webarch document insists that "User agents MUST NOT silently ignore
authoritative server metadata." 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-webarch-20031209/#pr-server-auth

There is a strong bias in this assertion towards HTTP:
- because not all user agents interact in a client/server protocol
- because not all client/server protocols put the "authoriativeness"
into the server role

Should this be reworded in  "User agents MUST NOT silently ignore
authoritative metadata."? If so, is it still worth mentioning? (ie, is
there any point in saying "do what the protocol says to do"?)
