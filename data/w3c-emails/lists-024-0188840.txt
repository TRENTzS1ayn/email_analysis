In 4.5.4. Namespace Documents, "Good practice: Namespace documents" states:

         "Resource owners who publish an XML namespace name SHOULD
         make available material intended for people to read and
         material optimized for software agents in order to meet
         the needs of those who will use the namespace vocabulary."

However, the term "definitive" is missing.  Was this intentional?  Based on 
a quick skimming of the issue, it looks like the TAG is in agreement that 
the namespace document should directly or indirectly provide *definitive* 
material about the namespace, but I'm not sure.

In any case, I think it is important to say that the namespace document 
directly or indirectly provides *definitive* material about the namespace 
vocabulary.  That would provide a clear, deterministic chain of authority 
for determining the meaning of a newly discovered namespace-qualified 
vocabulary.
