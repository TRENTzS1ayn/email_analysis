Hello TAG,

Here is the first of a series of comments on your WebArch
last call doc, some comments on principles, constraints,...

[1] The headline should be worded so that it is easy to remember
     and says the right thing (rather than it's opposite).
     There are numerous examples of the headline saying the opposite
     of what the point actually is. Example 1:

        Constraint: URI uniqueness

     Please reword this to any of:

        Non-Constraint: URI uniqueness
        Constraint: URI non-uniqueness

     Example 2:

        Good practice: URI aliases

     Reword to any of:

        Bad practice: URI aliases
        Good practice: avoid URI aliases
        Good practice: reduce URI aliases

     Example 3:

        Good practice: URI ambiguity

     Reword to any of:

        Bad practice: URI ambiguity
        Good practice: avoid URI ambiguity
        Good practice: reduce URI ambiguity
        Good practice: URI non-ambiguity
        Good practice: no URI ambiguity

     The goal is to be able to use the list of headlines in the
     list of principles and good practice notes after the TOC
     in a way that people easily get the main point.

[2] Numerous collections of terms are used for the same thing.
     The list after the TOC has "principles and good practice notes".
     1.1.3 has "principles, constraints, and good practice". Then
     the list in 1.1.3 has: constraint, design choice, good practice,
     principle, property. This is confusing and should be fixed.
     And when fixed, please use the same order.

[3] Make the list after the TOC more usable:
     - Add the 'Principle', 'Good practice', or whatever part.
     - Don't number these, unless they are numbered in the document
     - Add pointers to section, so that it's easy to find them
       in a printed version.



Regards,    Martin.
