This is a specific example of a somewhat more general problem,
namely the way Issues (and Findings) are referenced in WebArch,
giving virtually no information about how these relate to the
text.

Section 2.6 points to issue DerivedResources-43. When I'm finally
there (not easy because I'm starting from a print copy,
http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/issues.html?type=1#DerivedResources-43),
the only thing I see is 'raised' and 'accepted'. So why should I
go there in the first place? And how can the authors guarantee
that this issue will indeed be relevant?

I propose to not point to issues that don't have reached a
certain maturity (in which case pointing to the finding is
probably better).

Regards,   Martin.
