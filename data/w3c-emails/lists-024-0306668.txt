Hi Martin,

Section 1.1.2 states:

  "Since the findings evolve independently, this document also includes
references to approved TAG findings. For other TAG issues covered by
this document but without an approved finding, references are to entries
in the TAG issues list."

The TAG explicitly resolved to not refer to draft findings.
