Section 1 (Introduction): Section 1 defines "Web agents" as "people or 
software".  This is a marked departure from the definition of the term 
"agent" in an early Web Arch draft ( 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-webarch-20030627/ ), which defines agents as 
"programs acting on behalf of a person, entity, or process", and a 
departure from common computer science usage.  In my experience, in the 
context of software or computer science (as opposed to real estate, for 
example), "agent" has meant a non-human entity -- a piece of 
software.  Furthermore, as far as I know "user agent" has always meant a 
piece of software.  I don't think the Web Arch definition of "Web agent" or 
"agent" should include humans.
Roughly: s/agent/agent or human/g

2.2 URI Ownership:
Following the lessons of the "deep linking" debacle, it might be good to 
say explicitly what rights "URI ownership" does or does not confer.  This 
is somewhat addressed later, but it might be good to say something in this 
section.

4.5.4 Typo (extra word): 'Nadia receives a representation data from 
"weather.example.com" in an unfamiliar data format.' should be 'Nadia 
receives a representation from "weather.example.com" in an unfamiliar data 
format.'
