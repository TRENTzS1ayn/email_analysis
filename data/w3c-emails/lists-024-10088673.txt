Mike,

Sorry for answering quite late (hmmm, May long-lasting week-ends...).
However, it is not very important, since you have almost closed the issue.

Understood.

I have nothing to add.

One never knows... Well, I fully understand that point of view.

A numeric interval is indeed what is to be used to described an [n...m]
interval, but then it does not make sense any more in the sentence

 [owl:maxCardinality can be used to specify an upper
bound. owl:minCardinality can be used to specify a 
lower bound. In combination, the two can be used to specify a
*numeric interval*.
]

since we lose the fact that this interval bounds the property cardinality.
I would sugger to add "bounding the property cardinality" (or a more
suitable verb :
my english vocabulary is quite loose) at the end of your rewording.



Thank you very much for your answers. It helped me to understand some
important points.
I hope my questionning was also helpful for you.

Bye,

Antoine
