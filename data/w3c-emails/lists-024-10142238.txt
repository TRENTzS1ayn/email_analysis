From Appendix D of OWL Web Ontology Language Reference, March 31

   1. The semantics have changed significantly. With respect to
      the three sublanguages, the DAML+OWL semantics is closests
      to the OWL DL semantics."

"DAML+OWL" should be "DAML+OIL"
"closests" should be "closest"

Inconsistent verb agreement: "semantics have" and "semantics is".  I don't
know which is correct.  Maybe both are OK.
