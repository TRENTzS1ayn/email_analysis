Well, I was just about to send a comment along the same general lines, the
notion of "rights" in OWL. In real-world applications, one will need the
built-in ability to manage rights of access and edition on the information,
based on users profiles, definition of workspaces, and the like.

Of course the rights on any given OWL class or individual can be defined by
a specific property in a specific ontology, but it would maybe good to have
a generic built-in property "owl:Rights" used to assert that information on
such class of objects will be available only to such class of users.

This is something that can be somehow achieved in Topic Maps software by an
ad hoc interpretation of "scope" elements - although such an interpretation
of scope is left to the application.
