Graham,

Thanks, good eyes.  I will change it to 

<owl:AnnotationProperty rdf:about="&dc;creator" />

Didn't need the ':'.

Subject: OWL Guide comment



A small editorial comment concerning the Owl Guide [1].  This is just a 
nit, and I don't feel it needs to be recorded and processed as a formal 
comment.

Section 2.2 contains:
[[
Properties that are used as annotations should be declared using 
owl:AnnotationProperty. E.g.

<owl:AnnotationProperty rdf:about="&dc:creator" />
]]

which I expect should be:
[[
Properties that are used as annotations should be declared using 
owl:AnnotationProperty. E.g.

<owl:AnnotationProperty rdf:about="&dc;:creator" />
]]
