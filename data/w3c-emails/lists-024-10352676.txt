You're right that the following sentence in Sec. 5.2 is phrased too sloppy:

[[
The property owl:sameAs has as its domain and range an individual
]]

I propose to change this sentence to:

[[
The property owl:sameAs takes an individual as subject and object.
]]

Please let us know whether this response is satisfactory.

Thanks for comment,
Guus Schreiber
