The DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) program is pleased to endorse the OWL
Web Ontology Language produced by the W3C Web Ontology Working Group based
on the DAML+OIL language developed by the DAML program and its European
Union collaborators.  We view OWL as a major advancement for the Semantic
Web, and are rapidly converting our ontologies, content and tools to use it.
We look forward to the acceptance of OWL as a W3C Recommendation and to its
wide scale deployment on the World Wide Web.
