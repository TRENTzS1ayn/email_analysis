The class axiom for owl:Thing in Appendix B of Reference defines its 
class extension to be the extension of owl:Nothing plus its complement, 
which means all individuals in the universe of discourse. owl:Nothing is 
its complement, so its class extension is the empty set.

Your revised axiom uses owl:Thing to define itself. We would prefer to 
refrain from such recursive definitions and thus keep to the axioms as 
they currently are.

I'm not sure I understand your point. The extension of owl:Nothing is 
the empty set, so it is not "any Class".   owl:Thing and owl:Thing 
fulfill a special role, namely as root resp. leaf of the class lattice, 
cf. Sec. 3.1:

[[
Consequently, every OWL class is a subclass of owl:Thing and owl:Nothing 
is a subclass of every class.
]]

Please let us know whether this response is satisfactory.

Regards,
Guus Schreiber
