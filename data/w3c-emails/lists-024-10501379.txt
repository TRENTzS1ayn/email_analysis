re: any Class, I meant some class with an extension of size > 0.
Given any such class, ABC.

<Class rdf:ID="Thing">
   <rdfs:label>Thing</rdfs:label>
   <unionOf rdf:parseType="Collection">
     <Class rdf:about="#ABC"/>
     <Class>
       <complementOf rdf:resource="#ABC"/>
     </Class>
   </unionOf>
 </Class>

Strictly speaking, Nothing is the class of things that don't exist.
I don't think it's a good idea to base your axioms on Nothing.
