Thanks very much for your comment. This was an omission in Reference. It 
has already been corrected in the editor's draft [1] after a comment 
from the S&AS editor, e.g. see Sec. 7 of [1], introduction:

[[
NOTE: The ontology-import construct owl:imports and the 
ontology-versioning constructs owl:priorVersion, 
owl:backwardCompatibleWith and owl:inCompatibleWith are defined in the 
OWL vocabulary as instances of the OWL built-in class owl:OntologyProperty.
]]

In addition, owl:OntologyProperty has been added to Appendices A, B, and C.

Note: the editor's draft has no official status and is only use by the 
editors to keep track of the editorial changes during the LC period.

Please let us know whether this response is satisfactory.
