Hi Guus,
Thanks for your response.  I assumed that, presuming it wasn't just an
accidental editorial artefact in as&s, OntologyProperty was a variant on
AnnotationProperty, in that it is not allowed in property axioms.  Do the
updated documents explain why both AnnotationProperty and OntologyProperty
are needed?  ISTM that plurality of property types is potentially confusing
to users of the language, especially if the differences between them are
slim, and come down to nuances of the semantic treatment.

Cheers,
Ian
