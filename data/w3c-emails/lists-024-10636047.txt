  OWL Web Ontology Language Semantics and Abstract Syntax
  W3C Working Draft 31 March 2003

  owl:imports, as defined in 2.1 Ontologies
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-semantics-20030331/syntax.html#2.1

A semantic import mechanism for the RDF-based languages looks
potentially useful and in considering if and how to implement it,
there are some problems.

Firstly it seems that owl:imports potentially will import the entire
semantic web of OWL Ontologies.  Have you considered the security and
denial-of-service implications of this mechanism?

Secondly, is not clear at what stage that this (Imports Closure
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-semantics-20030331/rdfs.html#5.3 )
should be done.  In an example where you have some RDF/XML that will
map to RDF triples describing an OWL ontology, what are the steps
that you expect to happen?

A process point - the WebOnt issue list as of 6 May 2003
does not record the details of the objections made when this
syntax based daml:imports was decided:
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/webont-issues.html#I5.6-daml:imports-as-magic-syntax
