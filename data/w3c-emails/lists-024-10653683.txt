  OWL Web Ontology Language Reference
  W3C Working Draft 31 March 2003

  Appendix B. RDF Schema of OWL (Normative)
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-ref-20030331/#appB

The RDF schema for OWL appears in a Normative appendix of the
Informative OWL Reference

Can you have a normative part of an informative document?  It might
be that it would be better to describe more fully the status of this
appendix content.

Please also include the URI of the RDF/XML that this appendix
corresponds to or may be found, if there is one so that it may be
used directly -- for example, in testing.  At present, you have to
cut and paste the HTML.

(This is unrelated to the question of the bits found behind when
dereferencing some XML Namespace URI - I just ask that the URL of the
this content be made available. )

Thanks

Dave
