Yes, this is intended.

The more-complex construction in OWL DL is strictly convenience, as there
it can always be replaced by an intersection.  However, in OWL Lite, this
replacement is not always (easily) possible, leading to difficulties as to
just what can be said in OWL Lite.

Yes, this is as intended.  The Value(_) construction augments the
expressive power of the language and was not put in OWL Lite for this
reason.
