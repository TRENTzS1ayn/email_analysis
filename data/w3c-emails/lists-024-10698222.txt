To all who are bringing comments to WebOnt, we wish to thank you.
  Due to the last minute volume at the close of this week, it will 
take us a few days to individually acknowledge and thank each raiser 
of comments - we will do so as soon as we can, and will provide 
responses as we can.
  Again, many thanks
  Jim Hendler and Guus Schreiber
