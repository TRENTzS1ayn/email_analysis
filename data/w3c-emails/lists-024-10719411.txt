This could be an RDF issue, but given OWL's relationship to DAML+OIL, I 
think it could reasonably be handled by WebOnt.

DAML+OIL had daml:item. While not strictly necessary, i've been 
encountering a fair number of DAML+OIL ontologies which use it, and the 
alternative formulations (e.g., for typed lists) is fairly cumbersome.

So, I'd like it added back in.

Cheers,
