I should have made it clear, that the recent comments I sent in

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webont-comments/2003May/0054.html

are largely editorial and I'm happy to leave dealing with them to the WG's 
discretion.  To lighten the administrative burden on the WG, I don't expect 
any formal responses, except perhaps to the one marked 
'owlref-bwm-inconsistency'
