Brian - thank you for your comment - we will consider this.  Uf the 
RDFCore WG could suggest some specific wordings they'd like to see, 
or give us more guidance than the above, it would help us, and would 
make it less likely that this would become an issue that could hold 
up moving both of our recommendations forward as we work out the 
wording.
