So that means there is no normative description in machine readable form
of the OWL vocabulary, in OWL, as written down in RDF/XML.  Is
all the OWL vocabulary expected to be built-in application knowledge?
What is the purpose of this section?  It would benefit from an explanation.

The location of this work in the OWL reference, not S&AS tends to
suggest it is not "part" of OWL since OWL Reference does not define OWL.

The new reference in AppB of [1] is appreciated.
(Although W3C style probably suggests you give the "http://" part of the URL also)

I would like to get a further explanation of the purpose of this schema and section
before I consider this comment addressed.  If you could propose an explanation,
that may help me.
