>We implemented an OWL Syntax Checker, as defined in OWL Test Cases,

>The approach used was to:
>1: compute the imports closure
>
>2: follow the triple tables found in:
>
>http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2003Mar/att-0089/m
>
>and to work from those to iteratively classify every node in the RDF graph
>
>3: additional actions are used to check that restrictions, for instance, do
>not have too many components, and that blank nodes are the object of 
>at most one triple
>
>4: the syntax checker behaves incrementally in the sense that we can check
>whether any non OWL Lite or non OWL DL constructs have been used
>
>5: when all the triples have been processed we have a final check 
>for things like orphan restrictions, untyped nodes etc.
>
>We have slightly updated the tables.

>B: exact constriants concerning owl:equivalentClass
>C: non cyclic restricition on unnamed individuals

>owl:Class is a possible explicit type for classID and description

>**Comment 4**
>A further clunkiness was with owl:OntologyProperty.
>Triples such as
>owl:priorVersion rdf:type owl:OntologyProperty .
>are permitted by the grammar iff owl:priorVersion is used somewhere else.
>We have correctly implemented this, but it is surprising.
>
>We suggest either:

>modifiying the mapping rules that produce these triples to not do so.

>- allowing user defined OntologyProperty's with annotations with an 
>abstract syntax axiom
>
>**Comment 5**
>We did not work directly from the WD, and cannot imagine how one 
>might easily do so. We found the tables in
>http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2003Mar/att-0089/m
>considerable more accessable than the mapping rules, and suggest that these
>tables should be included in the OWL recommendation.
