After some offlist discussion with JimH about this comment, I'd like to 
emphasize that it concerns an "RDF Document" which was intended to mean 
primarily RDF instance data, though with hindsight might also apply to an 
RDFS schema.

So the request is for some simple rules that, if followed, will ensure that 
an RDF document containing instance data (not an ontology) can be processed 
by an Owl DL reasoner, presumably in conjunction with an Owl DL ontology.

This comment was generated when it was discovered that there is a 
restriction on the use of b-nodes, that had not been immediately 
apparent.  A rule such as "Don't use rdf:nodeID", for example, might be 
appropriate.

I am sending this personal clarification of the comment without consulting 
RDFCore, but am BCC'ing RDFCore so that folks there have the opportunity to 
review it.

Brian
