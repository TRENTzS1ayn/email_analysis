All of the RDF & OWL documents are so preoccupied
with properties that they ignore the things that
have those properties. 

There are at least two classes that are absolutely
essential in order to avoid the current chaos that is 
the result of ignoring those things that have properties.

    Entity
    Group

Entity is the class of primary things which exist, including
those which we perceive directly, e.g., people, trees, cars.
These physical entities have properties which can used to 
classify them as members of various Groups.  Groups are 
abstract entities which are created by people, e.g., sets, 
lists, hierarchies, classes.

Here is a useful high-level class hierarchy which includes 
Entity and Group.

    Thing
        Entity
            Animal
                Person
            Plant
            Object
                Group
                    Set
                    List
                    Hierarchy
                    Class
                    Company
        Property
            Part
            Attribute
            Relation
            Action
            Interaction
        Proposition
            Context
            Sentence
                Statement

The above is a good, general-purpose hierarchy, but
it may not be the best hierarchy for any particular
situation.  It is to be expected that users will
modify the class hierarchy to suit their own purposes.
