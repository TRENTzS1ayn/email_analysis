1. I am not trying to specify *the* hierarchy.  As I said,
I think the end user should choose his/her own hierarchy,
as appropriate for his/her purpose.

2. I personally prefer "existent" over "Thing".  But "Thing"
is not a bad choice.

3. "Entity" and "Group" are badly needed because the current
owl:Classes do not distinguish between "Entity" and "Property".
People are generating many new "Property" classes
(in disregard of Occam's Razor), and treating these classes
as if they were "Entity" classes.
