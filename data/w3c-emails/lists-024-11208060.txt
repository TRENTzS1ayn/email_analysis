Karl,

Thanks for your comments. In this message I have tried to answer your
questions.  They are both good ones, addressing difficult parts of
OWL.

Getting all of the mirrors aligned with entities, namespaces, xml:base
and references has been tricky.  But in this case there is no
conflict.  If rdf:about is explicitly given a value, that is what it
is.  If the attribute value is "", then it is interpreted to be the
base URI of the owl:Ontology element.  Which can be set by xml:base.

Your comment did generate at change to the Abstract Syntax & Semantics 
documents so that it and the Guide were more clearly aligned.

Agreed that this is undesirable.  That said, there are reasons we
left this unspecified.

The formal syntax and semantics describe what well formed OWL
documents look like and how they are interpreted.  It is much harder
to specify what happens operationally if there is a failure of the
supporting infrastructure.  Our general view was that there should at
a minimum be some way to detect failures, but we did not see clearly
how to add such a mechanism to OWL.

Some of our test cases address these issues.  See for example

# 4.2.2. Consistency Checker 
# 
# ...
# 
# An OWL consistency checker SHOULD report network errors occurring
# during the computation of the imports closure.

Consider cases of extensive, distributed ontologies, where the
inability to import a few ancillary facts would ideally not bring all
reasoning to a halt.  Additionally, one of the target consumers of OWL
ontologies are autonomous processes.  How they proceed in the face of
failure to download an ontology component is an open topic.


Please reply to the mailing list as to whether the above response
adequately addresses your comments.

What's happening in case of conflicts between xml:base and rdf:about?

Free to implementations is dangerous and leads to lack of 
interoperability. You should define what the implementation should do 
in this case. Return of a code, etc.
