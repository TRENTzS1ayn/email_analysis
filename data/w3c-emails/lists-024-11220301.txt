Thing and Nothing belong to two separate universes,
the universe of things which exist,
and the universe of things which do not exist.

Axioms for the universe of things which exist
    A is A
    A or not A is Thing
    A and not A is Nothing

Axioms for the universe of things which do not exist
    B is not B
    B or not B is Nothing
    B and not B is Nothing
    B is Nothing
