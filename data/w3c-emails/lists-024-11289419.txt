On 1 May 2003, as recorded in 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2003May/0017.html
the working group decided to add owl:Nothing to OWL Lite.  The Semantics
and Abstract Syntax document has already been updated to reflect this
change.  The other affected documents should be changed in the near future.

I believe that this addresses the last of your comments in this message.  I
have take the liberty of marking this thread as closed.  If you disagree,
please reply to this message, making sure to send a copy to
