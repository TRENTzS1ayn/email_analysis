Thanks for the review; we're working thru these.
Some interim notes...

This is different from the design the WG has agreed to; there
doesn't seem to be any editorial fix that's responsive to this
comment.

The WG decided[29May] to fix this problem.
The minutes aren't all that clear about what the fix looks like;
when the spec text that results from the fix is available, we'll
ask you to let us know if it satisfies you.

This is also a substantive design change; we started discussiong
it [29May] but didn't reach a decision.
