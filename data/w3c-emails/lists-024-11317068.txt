[ Proposed reply to

Thank you for your detailed comments.  Here is a reply that handles most of
them, and defers one until more work is performed.  Let us know if this is
sufficient for now.

Yes, not really true of RDF.  I will remove this phrase.

I will add

<p>
In OWL DL it is permitted to have only one description in an 
<span class="syntax">EquivalentClasses</span> construct. 
This allows ontologies to include descriptions that are not connected to
anything, which is not semantically useful, but makes allowances for
less-than-optimal editing of ontologies.

Actually it does.  The translation would just be the translation of d1.

In this section there is no need to exclude the RDF or RDFS vocabulary.
The next section does all the exclusion (see disallowed vocabulary from
RDF, for example).

Correct.  It is not right.  Fixing it will require some surgery to Section
3.4.  This may need further discussion in the working group.

Yes.  This is the case.  However, in the absence of a mechanism for making
associations between RDF resources and RDF statements it is not possible to
do this.

Agreed.

Thanks.

This would be more precise, but I don't think that it would be any more
readable.

Changed.

Changed instead to ``axioms''.

The intercapping was chosen to alude to ``data-valued property ID''
instead of ``data valued property ID''.

Good change.

This probably was a holdover from something that talked about XML Schema
datatypes and is no longer useful.  It is removed.

Changed to ``v''.

This would require a substantive change.

    ^^ gg [nit]

Actually, using this for n=1 is benign, and thus I can treat the
clarification addition as an editorial change.

Fixed.

Fixed.  :-)

... and the other use is not very good.

I've changed the other use to ``and restrictions''.
I've changed this to ``construct descriptions''.

Please reply as to whether the proposed changes are acceptable.  We will
let you know when the one outstanding comment has been discussed.
