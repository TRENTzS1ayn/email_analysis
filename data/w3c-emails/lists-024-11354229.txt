This message responds to your comments, in each case not suggesting any
changes to the S&AS document.  This is not actually a rejection of your
comments, however.  I feel that you are generally satisfied with the
situation as it stands, but that some improvements could be made, if
possible.

One comment that you make corresponds to a re-opened issue that may result
in a change - if this indeed happens we will let you know.

Yes, the closest correspondences are to SHIF(D) and SHOIN(D), with some
limitations on how datatypes are treated.

It would be useful to have this somewhere.  However, I don't think that the
best place for this is in S&AS.  If you have a suggestion for a suitable
place to stick this information, let us know.  (If the wording fits nicely
in S&AS, it might even make it in there.)

Yes.  :-)  See below.

The simpler axiom forms are intended to be reminiscent of frame systems.
Most people write ontologies using mostly these forms, so it was decided to
provide a syntax slanted towards them.  Some of this is already covered in
Guide.

The tradeoffs in the syntax of OWL Lite are somewhat unusual.  The syntax
of OWL Lite is supposed to be similar to frame syntax, thus the lack of
explicit intersectionOf.  I agree that from the logical point of view there
is no reason for this, but it is supposed to be easier to write and to parse.
There are short allusions to this in various places - a long allusion
would be quite lengthy and probably not suitable.

It may indeed turn out that the OWL Lite syntax limitations are not
correct.  No one gets the syntax right on the first (or even second or
third or ...) try.  However, it should be relatively painless to fiddle
with the OWL Lite syntax.

I agree somewhat, but do find the separated version to be helpful
sometimes.  I was asked to make the switch from a single to a compound
document, and I'm not particularly interested in switching back.

There is the possibilty of qualified cardinalities coming back.  The
working group has re-opened an issue on this.  One sticky point with
qualified cardinalities is their syntax in triples.

Transitive closure is a different matter.  Transitive closure plus inverse
is decidable but even more difficult to work with than transitive roles
plus inverse.  Adding in transitive closure would be a major change to the
language, even without the computational difficulties.

I some sense this is not too hard in the abstract syntax.  There is
accepted syntax for many DL constructs in a form that could easily be added
to the abstract syntax.  However, making the RDF-compatible semantics work
out might require significant work.

Well, hopefully, the tweaking can start in a few months.  I expect that
implementors will not exactly target OWL Lite or OWL DL or even OWL Full.
(I know that I won't, if I can ever get some time to do implementation.)  I
hope that implementors will deal with supersets, leading to implementation
experience that can be used to produce more powerful designs.

I expect that there will remain bugs in the documents forever.  They are,
after all, quite long and quite complex.  I hope that none of these will be
significant.  There has been one significant bug found during the last call
period, having to do with late changes to the mapping rules, which has just
been addressed.

Please respond, copying public-webont-comments@w3.org, as to whether you
are satisfied with this response, whether you need to wait until certain
changes to the design of OWL are done, or whether further correspondence is
needed now.
