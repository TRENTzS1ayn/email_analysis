may have been ambiguous with respect to the issue of when change 
might occur.  To be very clear:

The WG decided:
RESOLVED: - Postpone the a full (sic) treatment of Qualified 
Cardinality restrictions.
as recorded in: 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2003May/0120.html

I am working on a response to another commentor (and to you) to 
explain why we made this decision and the difficulty in adding QCRs 
in at this time.  We thus changed the status of this issue from 
"Closed" to "Postponed" with pointers to some of the messages, with 
the hope that a solution to the general issue of qualified 
restrictions (including cardinality) can be found at some future time.

thanks for you comments
  Jim H.
