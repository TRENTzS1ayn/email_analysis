it is the opinion of the chair of WOWG (me) that we have now met all 
of our exit criteria (modulo potential change in RDF) and thus I am 
going to begin preparing materials for our eventual move to Proposed 
Recommendation -- one thing that would help is if the implementors of 
OWL reasoners, ontologies, or etc. were to share with us their 
experiences -- this is especially valuable (but not limited to) those 
who have contributed their results to our test documents.
  We are expecially interested in feedback with respect to whether you 
were able to implement the langauge based on the documents (were we 
clear), were there other people's tools, products, techniques you 
found valuable, and how long did it take you and how hard was it (in 
qualitative terms is fine).
  Unclear to me exactly how I will use this information, but I would 
prefer responses to this list, and in public, so that I am free to 
forward what you write to the Working Group and/or other W3C lists.
  thanks
  Jim Hendler
p.s. Please feel free (and encouraged) to circulate this message to 
all and sundry who may have implemented in this space
