I had no severe problems in implementing OWLP, either the parsing side or
the reasoning side.  I did not find the OWL documents difficult to read.
:-)

The biggest problems I encountered in implementing the parsing part of OWLP
had to do with the RDF syntax.  Implementing a parser for the abstract
syntax was much easier than implementing a parser for the RDF/XML syntax.
This had less to do with the OWL encoding in RDF than it had to do with RDF
itself.

The biggest problems I encountered in implementing the reasoning part of
OWLP had to do with the RDF embedding, particularly handling annotations
as real parts of the meaning of an OWL ontology.  The other parts of the
(partial) reasoner in OWLP were easy to handle by passing the reasoning off
to a description logic reasoner.

The total effort to implement OWLP was about three months.
