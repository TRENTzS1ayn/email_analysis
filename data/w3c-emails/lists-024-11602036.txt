Benjamin,

Thanks very much for your comments. Sorry for the long delay in responding.

You're right. The note in 3.1 should have been more specific.
It now reads:

[[
NOTE: If one provides an RDF identifier for class descriptions of he 
type 2-6, this is not considered to be a class description, but a 
special kind of class axiom for complete classes.
]]

It should read:

[[
NOTE: If one provides an RDF identifier for class descriptions of
the enumeration, intersection, union or complement type,
this is not considered to be a class description, but a
special kind of class axiom for complete classes.
]]

This excludes named restrictions to be axioms for complete classes.
We will make this change in the upcoming editor's draft.

Multiple rdfs:subClassOf axioms have a different semantics that an 
owl:intersectionOf statement: necessary vs. sufficient conditions for 
class membership. For example, see the "Operetta" example at the end of 
section 3.2.1 with multiple subClassOf axioms. The accompanying text says:

[[
This class axiom states that an operetta is a musical work, that has a 
librettist and is not an opera. The use of the subclass relation leaves 
open the possibility that there are other musical works that have a 
librettist and are not operas. If we had wanted to say that operetta's 
are exactly those musical works that have a librettist but are not 
operas, we would need to use the owl:equivalentClass construct.
]]

Hope this clarifies the difference.

Thanks again for your comments,
Guus Schreiber
