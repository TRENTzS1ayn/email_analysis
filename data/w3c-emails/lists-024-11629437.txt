[[
<owl:Restriction rdf:nodeID="d">
<owl:onProperty rdf:resource="#p"/>
<owl:onProperty rdf:resource="#q"/>
<owl:hasValue rdf:resource="#v"/>
</owl:Restriction>

According to AS&S, this looks invalid, because restrictions can have
only one
individualvaluedPropertyID or datavaluedPropertyID.

But, Jena[1] and OWL Ontology Validator[2] successfully parse the
document.
I'm confused. Any comments on this?

The test states that the file is in OWL Full.
This agrees with your observation, that in OWL DL, S&AS says that this is 
not permitted.
Any RDF document is an OWL Full document.

The OWL Full semantics is given in section 5 of S&AS and we read:
http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/rdfs.html#5.2

Conditions on OWL restrictions
[[
if
<x,y>???EXTI(SI(owl:hasValue))) ???
<x,p>???EXTI(SI(owl:onProperty)))
then
]]


and we see that both properties fulfil this condition.

Hence the expression is semantically equivalent to something like:

<owl:Restriction rdf:nodeID="d">
    <owl:onProperty rdf:resource="#q"/>
    <owl:hasValue rdf:resource="#v"/>
    <owl:eqivalentClass>
       <owl:Restriction>
          <owl:onProperty rdf:resource="#p"/>
          <owl:hasValue rdf:resource="#v"/>
       </owl:Restriction>
    </owl:equivalentClass>
</owl:Restriction>


The software you mention should report that the test file is in Full.
