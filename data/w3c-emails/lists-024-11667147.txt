OWL implementation experience in Euler
======================================
2003-11-20

Running Code
------------
- Euler Proof Mechanism http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2003/03swap/
  is a research component to support logic based proofs
- is a backward-chaining reasoner enhanced with Euler path detection
  and will tell you whether a given set of facts and rules supports
  a given conclusion
- using as much as possible from DanC's and TimBL's SWAP
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/
- implemented in Java and also in C#
- making use of Jena 2 in RDF/XML to N3 triples generation
- small footprint (engine is 32 Kbyte jar file)
  and achieved > .5 Msteps/sec

N3 descriptions
---------------
- for RDFS http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2003/03swap/rdfs-rules
- for XSD http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2003/03swap/xsd-rules
- for OWL http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/2003/03swap/owl-rules
  o 159 rules
  o can handle positive entailment tests and inconsistency tests
    (the latter in a rather clumsy way plus that also some tests
    are actually using an explicit subset of above rule sets)
  o import entailment tests are also done by taking the assumed
    premise files from the manifest (not by executing owl:imports)
  o use of an experimental N3 ``has'' property marker to work
    with explicitly stated facts only (instead of deriving them all
    and get all kinds of combinatorial explosions)

Test results
------------
- part of http://www.w3.org/2003/08/owl-systems/test-results-out
- took some vacation weeks, a few holidays and lots of nights :-)
