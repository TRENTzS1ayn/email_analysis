Hello all

we noted that five tests currently have recorded [1] one pass, and one 
fail, with the failure being from Pellet.

In order to allow us to suggest to the Working Group that these tests 
should be approved, or to allow us to improve the tests please can you 
inspect both the tests and the algorithms you have used, and determine 
whether you think the tests are correct or not.

The tests in question are
   I5.3-014
   I5.5-007
   someValuesFrom-001
   Restriction-006
   Thing-005  (need to regenerate test results to see this one)

If you could reply copying public-webont-comments@w3.org, this would be 
very helpful, especially if you could do so by Wednesday, so that we could 
propose approving those of these tests that you believe are correct at the 
Thursday WebOnt telecon.

thanks

Jeremy Carroll, on behalf of Test subgroup of WebOnt WG
