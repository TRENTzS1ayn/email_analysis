Hi,
This is our experience for the implementation of Pellet reasoner.

Pellet is a Description Logic reasoner based on tableaux algorithms. 
When we started our implementation we didn't have any experience on 
implementing this kind of reasoner. We spent a month or so to understand 
the tableaux algorithms and implement the first prototype of a DL 
reasoner. Supporting reasoning about individuals and entailments took 
nearly a month. Another month was for implementing various different 
optimization techniques. Description Logic handbook was the main 
reference we used.

Implementing the parser to support most of OWL constructs was not so 
hard as we have used Jena toolkit to do the RDF parsing. But 
implementing a full syntax checker that would cover all the features of 
OWL was really hard as there were many corner cases especially about 
structure sharing issues. At the time, there was little documentation we 
could find but the new documents provide more information about these 
issues.

Overall, we were able to implement a full syntax checker and an OWL DL 
reasoner in 3-4 months. In this process, we have found the test cases 
very useful as they covered all the different syntax cases but it was 
still easy enough for us to find the bugs in our reasoning algorithms.

Regards,
Evren
