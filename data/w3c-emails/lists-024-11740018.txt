The Pellet results have been updated now. The results for these 5 test 
cases have been changed to 2 "pass", 2 "no data" and 1 "fail". We don't 
think any of these test cases are wrong but this is how much Pellet can 
handle. The new results for each test case are given inline.

Pellet cannot handle domain restrictions on rdf:type, result is changed 
to "no data".

>   I5.5-007

Pellet cannot handle ill-formed lists in entailments, result is changed 
to "no data".

>   someValuesFrom-001

The error is fixed, result is changed to "Pass".

>   Restriction-006

The error is fixed, result is changed to "Pass".

This test case is true only in OWL Full semantics and not in OWL DL so 
the result is still "Fail" (same for Thing-003).
