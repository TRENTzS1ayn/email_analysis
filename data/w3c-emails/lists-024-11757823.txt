This is a very interesting suggestion, but I wonder if this
version of the OWL specification is the best place for it.

As we said in the status of the 31 March requirements draft...

"Requests for significant changes to the requirements are not
anticipated and will be evaluated in the context of the scope and
schedule of the Web Ontology Working Group charter and other plans for
the W3C Semantic Web Activity"
 -- http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-webont-req-20030331/

As work on this version of OWL winds down, we have started
talking about best practices for using OWL and such.
Coincidentally, part/whole relationships is one of the first
things we've started writing about in this context:
  http://esw.w3.org/topic/PartWhole

See also discussion of a charter for a possible Best Practices
working group:

  SW Best Practices WG - draft charter for discussion 
  Guus Schreiber (Monday, 10 November)
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2003Nov/0055.html


Does it seem satisfactory to take up your suggestion in
a later stage of work? Note the OWL drafts have been
out since March 2002 and we were really hoping
to get all comments on the OWL specs in by 20 September 2003.
