Hi all,

Any help would be appreciated.
I'm struggling with entailment tests for OWL DL.
I have added to my OWL inference rulebase a bunch of inference
rules for owl:intersectionOf and owl:complementOf, and it made
my Bossam engine successfully pass five description-logic-2xx tests,
which are 201,202,204,205 and 207. :-)
But I got two failures on 203 and 206. :-(

What are the purposes of these tests? The descriptions on
the tests just say something cryptic like k_branch, k_d4,
k_dum, k_grz, k_lin, k_path, and k_ph. I cannot see any
differences between the tests by reading premise documents.
They just look very similar to each other.

Can anybody shed some light on me, please?

Best,
Minsu
