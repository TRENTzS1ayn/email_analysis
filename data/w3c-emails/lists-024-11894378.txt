To all OWL implementors, computational logicians, RDF hackers and 
others who may be interested:

  The Web Ontology Working Group (WOWG) call for implementations is 
going quite well - in fact, only two of our approved tests currently 
remain "unconquered" - these are

miscellaneous-001
miscellaneous-002

This message is a request to all implementors to ask you to 
prioritize these two tests and work towards their solution.

To make this more fun, I hereby offer the first group that passes 
each of these tests the coveted OWL.OWL award -- the WOWG chairs' 
award for service "above and beyond the call of duty" in helping OWL 
to advance to eventual recommendation status.
  -Jim Hendler

Note: The first OWL.OWL prize, consiting of a prestigious "WOWG 
stuffed OWL," was awarded to Frank van Harmelen at the October 2002 
Face to Face for his work in brokering the "Semantic Compromise" at 
an earlier meeting.
