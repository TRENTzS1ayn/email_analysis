Network Inference is pleased to announce its submission in response to
The WebOnt Chair's Challenge issued to the W3C community yesterday.  In this
challenge, the chair requested responses on two specific tests, notably

miscellaneous-001
miscellaneous-002

Both tests refer to the wine & food ontologies from the OWL guide.

The system was tested using the Network Inference Cerebra Server
infrastructure and the W3C-originated URL, and was tested using
Network Inference's implementation of XQuery as the querying method.
Both tests are successfully passed.

The RDF results file is available at:

http://demo.networkinference.com/tests/cerebra08102003.rdf

Network Inference is pleased to support the recommendation process.
Further test results may be made available by Network Inference in the
future, pending the resolution of outstanding issues regarding the reporting
and presentation of test results, which have been raised to the WebOnt
group.

Best regards,

Jack
