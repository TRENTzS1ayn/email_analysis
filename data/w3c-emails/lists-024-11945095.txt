The Jena2 syntax checker works and passes all the tests from the OWL Test 
Candidate Recommendation.

It currently fails two tests in the editors draft, one of which is in error 
(miscellaneous-010) and a second which is being debated by the Working Group 
I5.8-016.

The test report is found at
http://jena.sourceforge.net/data/owl-syntax-results.rdf

The syntax checker is availble for download in the developers release 
Jena-2.1-dev-1
