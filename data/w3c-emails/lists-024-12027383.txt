I am sure that the committee for the OWL spec came up with many 
pathological cases when discussing the OWL spec.... such as the ones 
that divided OWL into Lite, DL, and Full.  Is there a list of these 
cases?.. they would make seeing why things are chosen the way they 
are much easier...



Ed Roberts

Ed - good question - we did have some of these, but mainly we focused 
on issues, using test cases to drive resolutions - thus the cases 
where we figured out how to do something mostly ended up in our test 
repository [1], and others were just part of discussion.
  The best place to see the sort of thing you are looking for is via 
our Issues List [2] - each issue has pointers to rationales, 
sometimes to documents and email needed for the resolution, and 
pointers to our scribed meeting notes where the issues were resolved 
-- not really what you asked for, but closest thing we have in an 
easy to find form.
  Finally, all discussions from our WG were archived in public emails 
and are available on the W3C site [3] - reading through the threads 
there sometimes helps, but it is about 7000 total messages, so it 
really isn't easy to look through unless you're searching for a 
particular issue or resolution that has a reasonable phrase.
  Hope that helps
