We have created an ontology for Geographic Information Metadata (ISO 19115) and we like to submit it to ontology library. 

It was created by Prot?g? (beta version 2) using OWL plugin and validated as OWL DL.

We posted it on this page:

http://loki.cae.drexel.edu/~wbs/ontology/   (html page)

and URI for ontology is: 

http://loki.cae.drexel.edu/~wbs/ontology/2003/10/iso-metadata#   (ontology page)

Hope this could be helpful for the community.

Thanks,
