I just finished reading this paper* from the ISWC 2003 
(http://iswc2003.semanticweb.org/) proceedings (p17).

The presentation of OWL to this audience is well done, with a balanced 
presentation of OWL Lite, OWL DL, and OWL Full.

The paper also clearly motivates many of the design choices in OWL DL 
and OWL Lite in terms of the established research results. I copy 
public-webont-comments to make this design rationale available* just a 
few clicks from the W3C specs.

The paper notes only the implementation motivation for OWL Lite, and not 
the ease-of-learning motivation. And I (continue to) disagree with the 
claim that DAML+OIL is "basically a very expressive description logic 
with RDF syntax", but these are minor points.
Overall, the paper gives a very good account of the WebOnt Working 
Group's efforts.


* the full text of the conference proceedings are, unfortunately, not 
freely available via http, or I would give a pointer.
