Frank, Jim, WebOnt community, and others,

The DICE ontology has been represented using OWL.
It contains over 2500 concepts in the field of Intensive Care Medicine, 
such as Reason for ICU admission, Anatomy, Etiology, and Abnormality. The 
aim of DICE is to provide a means for ontology-based registration of 
reasons for ICU admission, providing sufficient detail for clinical 
purposes, and facilities for aggregation at varying levels of detail for 
management and research purposes.

I hope this information is helpful to you.
Currently, DICE is not publicly available. If this changes in the future, 
then we will notify you thereof and provide relevant pointers to the 
project. Contact me if you need any other information.

Kind regards, Ronald Cornet
