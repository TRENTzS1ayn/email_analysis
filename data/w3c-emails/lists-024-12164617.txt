Thanks for your mail -- I think, however, that you might be a bit 
confused -- this page is interested in learning more about ontologies 
people have developed in OWL, but we do not maintain an ontology 
library.  We will add you ontology to the list of ontologies in OWL 
we maintain[1], but if you'd like to submit it to a repository, might 
I suggest http://www.daml.org/ontologies which is a library of 
ontologies open to the public, maintained by the DARPA Agent Markup 
Language program.
