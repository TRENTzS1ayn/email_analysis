Hi Peter,

this is a partial response to your msg.
Specifically I reply concerning test AnotationProperty-003 and test I5.8-016 
which were both discussed at today's telecon.

You are right concerning test AnotationProperty-003. The comment and the 
metadata will be changed in due course.

Concerning test  I5.8-016 the working group decided that minor changes will be 
made to S&AS (mapping rules) to make this test case correct.

We will keep you informed of progress.
We will reply later concerning test miscellaneous-010 - your comments are 
clearly correct, but the appropriate fix has yet to be determined.

Jeremy

PS You might note similarities with our discussion in Florida.
