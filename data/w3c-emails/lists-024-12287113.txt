Picky stuff... sorry : )

Overview, section 1.3, 1.4 wording, 2.1 versioning, 3.3, 4

1.3 Use of the word "emposed"-- should be "imposed".

1.4 "This document first describes the features from OWL Lite, followed by a
description from the features that are added in OWL DL and OWL Full " -- 
Alternate usage of prepositions from/in could be clarified: "This document
first describes the features in OWL Lite, followed by a description of the
features that are added in OWL DL and OWL Full "-- both "in"s could be
changed to "from"-- but the should agree.

2.1 Versioning section: "inCompatibleWith" should be "incompatibleWith"

3.3 InverseFunctionalProperty: "isTheSocialSecurityNumberFor" appears twice,
the character case in the second instance is wrong
"isTheSocialSecurityNumberfor"

4. hasValue: "theNetherlands" appears twice, the character case in the
second instance is wrong "TheNetherlands"

4. cardinality: "(while the property hasChild would have be restricted to
cardinality 0). " "would have be" should be changed.

Finally, I have one small question on the "oneOf" description. The
description states "From this a reasoner can deduce the maximum cardinality
(7) of any property that has daysOfTheWeek as its allValuesFrom
restriction."

 Can it really? It seems that it can infer this, but not absolutely deduce.
For example a property like weekendDays in OWL DL may have maxCardinality of
2, not 7. 7 is the absolute max but additional restrictions would need to be
considered, right?

Cheers,
Jeff Rafter
