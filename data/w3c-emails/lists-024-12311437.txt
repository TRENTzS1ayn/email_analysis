This is a hard question to answer, as both rule-based and 
tableaux-based reasoners are being used on OWL (see [1] for a list of 
implementations that we are tracking, and please let us know if 
you're doing one).  As far as dividing reasoning and query - there's 
not really a known best practice yet - some applications combine them 
in a single process, some do separate processes, some don't actually 
differentiate the two, some do.  The WG is also not chartered to make 
specific recommendations about how to process OWL, so we are not 
working as a whole on specifying this -- however, a very good place 
to ask about what people are doing and to get recommendations of good 
practices is on the www-rdf-logic@w3.org mailing list - it is a 
public list on which such discussion is encouraged.

  thanks for your interest in OWL
