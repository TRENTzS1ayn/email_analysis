The editor's draft is in its usual place so the link on the webont page 
will take you to:

i answer your question below in context.
Thanks again for your careful reading of the document and the comments,

the second occurrence started a sentence thus one would expect the first 
word in the sentence to be capitalized.  I changed sentence wording so 
as not to have the problem.

yes - given an enumerated set with a number of distinct elements in it, 
a reasoner may infer a max cardinality on any property that has that 
enumerated set as a value restriction.  This is not necessarily the most 
specific max cardinality restriction if as in the case you mention 
below, there is a more specific enumerated set (i.e., an enumerated set 
with a  smaller number of distinct elements in it.)

I did not change the text of the document since we do not mention on all 
of the other statements of the form.... "from this a reasoner can 
deduce..."  that of course more specific information will mean that the 
reasoner may be able to deduce more specific information.
