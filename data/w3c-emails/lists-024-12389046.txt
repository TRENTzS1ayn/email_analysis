Short reply for now: Thanks Pat, that goes a long way to explaining
where we are and how we got here. I look forward to your paper. 

So I need to sit back and digest what you just told me and figure out
how to explain it to developers who are smart but often coming at this from an 
HTML/Javascript/XML background.

I should also note that I did have a good rummage around the OWL specs 
looking for a concise answer, and found clues in a few places. It would
be been good if I'd documented that trail, maybe I'll manage to do that as I 
absorb and re-package what you've just explained to me.

Also to note that the Test Cases doc, esp
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-owl-test-20030818/proposedByIssue#proposedIssue-I5.3-Semantic-Layering

...looks pretty useful in figuring out what's what. 

Thanks,

Dan
