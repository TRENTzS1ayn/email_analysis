Pat, this is perhaps a useful perspective on
the matter, but what's at issue in this
public-webont-comments forum is whether the
question is answered by the OWL specs.

Please try to answer the question from
the text of the specs. If you guys just
want to discuss this stuff free-form, please
use www-rdf-logic or whatever.
