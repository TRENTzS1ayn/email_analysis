Dan-
  you asked a good question for which, as you see from Pat's message, 
the answer is more complex than you might think.  From the point of 
view of our documents/CR let me ask you this - which document would 
you expect to look in to see a "human readable" answer?  Seems to me 
my WG should add a paragraph or two that answers in an "informal" way 
to one of our informative documents
