Version 0.5 of OWLP, a parser for OWL DL, is available at

http://www.bell-labs.com/topic/swdist

Navigating through the web site to get OWLP is a non-trivial endeavour,
unfortunately. 

OWLP is available under the Lucent Public License, which allows just about
any use.

OWLP Version 0.5 correctly (modulo proposed minor changes to OWL)
identifies all OWL DL and non-OWL DL documents in the current version of
the OWL test suite
http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/editors-draft/draft/Manifest.rdf"

OWLP Version 0.5 can also be used to transform an OWL DL document into the
OWL abstract syntax.

A newer version of OWLP, which should be available soon, correctly
identifies the level of each OWL document in the current version of the OWL
test suite.  This newer version preferentially transforms into OWL Lite
wherever possible.
