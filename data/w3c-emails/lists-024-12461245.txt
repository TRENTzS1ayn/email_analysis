Hello,

I recently discovered your ezOWL work
  http://iweb.etri.re.kr/ezowl/

I haven't tried it out yet, but it looks very interesting
from the screenshots and tutorial. Nice work!

>From our implementation report
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/impls
you can see that we were aware of another protoge plugin...
  http://protege.stanford.edu/plugins/owl/

but to me, at least, ezOWL is news.

I got your contact information from
  http://iweb.etri.re.kr/ezowl/contact.html

I wonder if you have any feedback to report as a result
of your implementation experience.

Is ezOWL able to load any or all of the documents
from our test collection?
  http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/
Are you aware of any of our tests that don't work
as expected in ezOWL?

Which parts of the OWL specs did you find most useful?
Which parts were most difficult to work with? Did you find
anything that looked like a bug? Are there any features that you
particularly like?

Do you see any missing features in OWL
that aren't adequately explained by our requirements
and objectives
http://www.w3.org/TR/webont-req/#section-objectives
or a decision to postpone an issue?
