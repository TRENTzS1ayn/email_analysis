There's now a web page showing preliminary results for which systems
pass each OWL test: 

    http://www.w3.org/2003/08/owl-systems/test-results-out

If you would like your system listed there, too, just send me e-mail
cc public-webont-comment@w3.org.  It's important to the working group
to see which tests are being passed and which are not, so please do
give us feedback.  

Down at the bottom of the page

    http://www.w3.org/2003/08/owl-systems/test-results-out#about

there's a web form you can use to make sure your results are
understood, or to play around with comparing the results from
different runs of your system, etc.  You can browse the inputs
to the current form, such as 

    http://www.w3.org/2003/08/surnia/test-results/00013/results.rdf

or read the test-results ontology

   http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/resultsOntology

to learn about the RDF vocabulary for publishing your results.  This
work is very much in-progress, and feedback is welcome.
