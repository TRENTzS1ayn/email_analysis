Well, OK. It is, but you have to kind of dig around to find it.

Ok, the specs documents cover this issue at various places, eg see

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-owl-features-20030818/#s1.3
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-owl-features-20030818/#s4
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-owl-ref-20030818/#app-DLinRDF
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-semantics-20030331/rdfs.html#5.1

See also the comments at

which gives a more formal description of the OWL-DL restrictions on 
the RDFS universe.
