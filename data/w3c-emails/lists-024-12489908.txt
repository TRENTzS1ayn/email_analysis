We have used OWL to write OperOnt ontology.
(http://siul02.si.ehu.es/Aingeru/OperOnt.owl)

 OperOnt is an ontology created in the context of the AINGERU system to
describe its operational model. That is, OperOnt describes concepts that
allow the interoperation of actors at a semantic level without
pre-establishing specific protocols. The ontology includes descriptions of
classes, properties and axioms involving actors, messages for the
communication among actors, and subjects of the messages. The descriptions
are presented in three groups. First, descriptions of classes which in
turn are divided in three areas: actors, messages and subjects. Second,
descriptions of properties that shape individuals in the classes. Third,
axioms specifying some constraints and rules.
