Hello,

Belated congratulations on your OWL Semantics Candidate Recommendation
[1]. I only scrolled through quickly and have to tell you how nice it
looks! Hope this gets to you by your deadline Anchorage time.

Section 4
s/characterise/characterize/

Section 5
s/indivdiual/individual/
s/noticable/noticeable/

Appendix A
s/compabile/compatibile/
s/exending/extending/
s/simlar/similar/

Ordinarily the parts of W3C specs are in the same order [2]. Unless
there is a reason to put them first, at your next maturity level, the
Appendix C, index, references and acknowledgements could follow
Appendix B and be in the previous | next | top | contents | link
chain.
