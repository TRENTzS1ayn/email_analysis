thanks for your careful reading of the documents and the comments.

I made the word changes you suggested to the overview document that were 
not already in the editors draft.
I did not make the "members" to "participants" change since there are 
some people who are members of the working group although I have never 
seen them participate.   (I did made the working group to Working Group 
change.)
I will ask internally for one consistent phrasing for the last paragraph 
within all of the working group documents.

The Overview document update is in its usual editors draft location -
http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/people/dlm/webont/OWLOverview.htm

Concerning the paragraph in the Guide section you mention below, I can 
rewrite it but I had never heard of  "IANA  reserved sites per RFC 2606" 
before. 
I do need some examples in that section and could provide more 
description and drop the URLs for which I can not control persistance if 
that is preferable.
Are you suggesting taking the functional url example - 
http://wine-portal.com/ - out of the text and putting in
 non functional url you mention wine-portal.example.com  that has the 
appropriate naming?   This means that people could not click through to 
the site and would just mean I need to do a bit more description in the 
example.

thank you,
Deborah
