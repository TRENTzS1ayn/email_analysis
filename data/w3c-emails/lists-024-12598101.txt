A question, I saw you commented on the compound document structure of OWL 
Semantics & Abstract Syntax. [S&AS] Is the one I've used OK for OWL Test 
Cases.

For many earlier drafts , not having a compound document was perceived as a 
problem. The current solution involves generating the three single document 
versions M.html L.html and XXL.html and then xslt-ing the (informative) 
XXL.html version with the script below to make the normative compound 
document.
http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/editors-draft/multipart.xsl

However, I didn't find any guidance as to W3C policy for such things, and 
basically just copied S&AS and some other TR but I forget which.

I would be happy to entertain changes to the xslt, less happy with suggestions 
that could not easily be addressed that way.
