Susan,

Thanks for the careful read.

Re your comments on the Guide.  I have corrected all the 
typos, members->participants, and am nearly done with the 
references. I am using the citation form suggested.  
While it turns out to be a little verbose, I agree with 
the rationale.   

The references particularly needed fixing and I now need
to run through the various verifiers before publishing to
the web site.  

The following is pending, per Deborah McGuinness' earlier email.

> Section 7.2 most likely needs to be rewritten to point only to IANA
> reserved sites per RFC 2606 (example.org, example.com and example.net
> or if you need evocative names, e.g. wine-portal.example.com).

For the References section, there is an example citation here:
http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/#ref-section

Links outside, like rdf:ID need a reference and section. There is an
example here:
http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/#linking-within

Section 7.2 most likely needs to be rewritten to point only to IANA
reserved sites per RFC 2606 (example.org, example.com and example.net
or if you need evocative names, e.g. wine-portal.example.com). The
examples and links here could be omitted. If they can't be omitted and
you can assure persistence then they can be references. If I can be of
assistance please let me know and I will help rewrite this. I am sorry
to have to say this at CR.

     A number of sites exist today that call themselves wine portals.
     Google for example, provides 152,000 matches for the query "wine
     portal". One of the top matches, a site called "Wine-Portal.com",
     provides access to a number of sites. Many sites claiming to be
     wine portals are mostly informational sites. For example,
     wine-portal.com's first featured site, called 'cork cuisine'
     (www.corkcuisine.com/), provides information about matching wines
     and foods, wines as gifts, etc. Another site billed as "the
     Internet Wine Portal" ( www.cyberbacchus.com/) provides a nice
     organization of a substantial amount of wine information on
     numerous topics.

Similarly, links like these should be omitted or made into citations.
