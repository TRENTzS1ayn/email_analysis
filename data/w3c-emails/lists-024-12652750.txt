Raik-
   A number of the questions you ask were discussed at length by our 
WG and info about what we decided and why can be found on our issues 
list, which is at http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/webont-issues.html
  below I'll give quick answers to your questions with pointers to longer ones

Appendix B of the OWL Reference (http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#appB) 
is an RDF Schema for OWL.  It is also available on line at
  http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl



>2) What are the plans for N3 vs. XML-based Syntax?

I'm not quite sure I understand the question -- OWL is in RDF 
compliant with the new RDF Specs, and N3 works for any RDF thus OWL 
can easily be written in N3.  There's no plans for a specific OWL N3 
document since it is easily produced from the XML-based RDF syntax.

This is actually more complicated than you might think, but the 
bottom line is that the WG decided not to create a new media type for 
OWL.  This is discussed in the issues list as 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/webont-issues.html#I5.13-Internet-Media-Type-for-OWL

This is actually very complicated semantically - the discussion of 
the issue is at
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/webont-issues.html#I4.6-EquivalentTo

I will sum up very informally here, if you then want more info you 
can look in our semantics document or send a follow up question

Essentially, there is a difference between classes and properties vs. 
instances with respect to being the "same" -- roughly the question is 
whether when I say two classes are the same, do I mean they have the 
same elements or they designate exactly the same thing?  If I say 
"All Elephants the size of a pea" and "All mice the size of a house" 
I have two classes which have the same elements (In this case none), 
but clearly designate different things (anything in the first class 
would have to be an elephant, anything in the second class couldn't) 
-- for instances this doesn't come up.  Using the two separate 
constructs, with the slight differences in semantics, makes it 
clearer to a reasoner which is meant.  Because of this, 
owl:equivalentTo and owl:sameAs actually have different semantics - 
and thus is not the parent-child relation you want.
  This is a very informal answer to give you the intuition, please 
look at the Reference and Semantics documents for the details of the 
solution, or the issues list to see some of the discussion the WG had.

This is also a harder question than you might think, and one the WG 
spent a long time grappling with - see
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/webont-issues.html#I5.20-should-OWL-provide-synonyms-for-RDF-and-RDFS-objects

Roughly speaking, there is a tension between making things easier for 
the OWL user by having everything be in one namespace, or for keeping 
things defined in their approved namespaces as an architectural 
preference (i.e. by having things defined in the RDF space, the OWL 
namespace doesn't contain a lot of redundancy that would need to be 
separately maintained).  We decided that, in my own words, Web 
Architecture wins out over OWL-chauvinism :->  (The WG decision is 
linked to the issue above, so you can see the official rationale)

We appreciate your questions/suggestions.  If you have questions 
about using OWL or about building tools which use OWL, the mailing 
list www-rdf-logic@w3.org is full of people who love discussing the 
how-tos and is a good place to go for answers.
