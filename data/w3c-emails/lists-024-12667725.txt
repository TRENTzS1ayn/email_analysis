I've made the results from running the current approved OWL semantic tests using 
the current CVS version of Jena2 available here:
   http://jena.sourceforge.net/data/owl-results.rdf

These are automated tests. Given the earlier discussion on tests with reduced 
comprehension support then we've added a simple query processor which implements 
the comprehensions required for the query. No manual intervention is required.

Note that the rule-based OWL inference support in Jena2 is only aimed at 
OWL/Lite so tests that require OWL/DL features such as complementOf and unionOf 
have not been included (we do include incomplete support for oneOf and hasValue 
due to user requests).

Of the relevant positive entailment tests we are incomplete on four tests:
   description-logic 661 & 662
   I5.2-006 (defining union within OWL-lite)
   I5.8-010 (0 is the only nonNegative and nonPositive integer)
The latter failure could be remedied.

The negative entailment tests are reported as passing in the weak sense that we 
do not find the entailment. These should probably be reported as incomplete 
rather than pass.
