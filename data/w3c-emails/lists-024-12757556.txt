In chapter 3.3. Property Characteristics written:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If a property, P1, is tagged as the owl:inverseOf P2, then for all x, y, and z: 

P1(x,y) iff P2(y,x)

Note that the syntax for owl:inverseOf takes a property name as an argument. A iff B means (A implies B) and (B implies A). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) imho it is better to write simply "for all x and y" (without z)
2) but below in explanation of InverseFunctionalProperty  there is written vice versa "for all x and y" but need x,y,z
3) "IFF" was explained here, but already was used above
