Hi everyone:

How do I tell an XML schema that the only possible values of an element could come from members of a class with some properties defined in an OWL ontology?

My concern is not to duplicate efforts by writing a list of possible values in an xml schema and again in an OWL ontology. 

Best Regards to all,
