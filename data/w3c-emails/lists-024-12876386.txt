Hello all,

In following sentence, in section [3.1.3.3 complementOf],
<http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-ref-20040210/#complementOf-def>,
wording of conclusion is somewhat confusing:

[...]
owl:complementOf is analogous to logical negation: the class extension
consists of *those individuals that are NOT members of the class
extension of the complement class*.
[...]

Shouldn't it read something like:

the class extension consists of those individuals that are NOT members
of the class extension of the class which it is the complement of.

hih,

JJS.
