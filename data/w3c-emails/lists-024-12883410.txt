sorry i missed this message.
i had not tried printing for a long time but just did and did notice the 
printing problem when i printed.
interestingly the one at:
http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/people/dlm/webont/OWLOverview.htm  (which 
was what sandro started with)
had less of a printing problem than the one at the official place:
http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/
so something about the finalization seems at least on my printer using 
ie 6.0 on a windows xp machine.

there was a request for an update from the last version since in some 
browser the previous middle column was overlapping with the previous 
third column.

it is fine with me if someone who knows table nuances for many browsers 
wants to put it in another format to eliminate the printing problems.
one simple solution may just be to have no more than 2 columns anywhere 
so as to minimize problems.
