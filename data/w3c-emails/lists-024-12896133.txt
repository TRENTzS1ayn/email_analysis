ps.  i checked the guide just to see if it had the same problem and it does.

if you look at the guide, reference and semantics cross reference table, 
it has the identical problem with the third column getting cut off with 
printing..

thus if someone is doing the table update to the overview, the same 
solution might be used on the guide tables as well.

it looks like appendix A of the reference has the identical problem as well.

so - it looks like a pass over all of the documents for table displays 
is in order.
