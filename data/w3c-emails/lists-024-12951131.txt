Hi,


Has OWL development stopped? It looks like it... What about RuleML 
and next levels? Are there any official statemnts roadmaps, etc.?


Buggy

THe development of a W3C Recommendation for the OWL langauge has 
stopped - the group accomplished its mission - OWL became a 
recommendation in February (See http://www.w3.org/2004/OWL)  as a 
result, the Working Group has achieved what it was chartered to do, 
and by W3C process it will end its work completely in the near future.

That said, work in OWL and the Semantic Web certainly continues! 
The W3C now hosts a semantic web interest group and two new working 
groups - one to look at distributed access to RDF stores and one to 
develop semantic web best practices -- information about these can be 
found at the W3C Semantic Web page -- http://www.w3.org/2001/sw

and ruleML continues, just not as a W3C effort - they and other rule 
efforts can be found via a web search.

So the work continues, just not here...
