Seventh International Protege Conference
July 6-9, 2004, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA

Call for Participation and for Workshop Proposals
http://protege.stanford.edu/conference/2004/

The Seventh International Protege Conference will be held on July 6-
9, 2004. The meeting will take place at the National Institutes of
Health in Bethesda, Maryland. This meeting is traditionally a forum
for users to meet one another and the Protege team and for us to
meet you. We discuss common problems and solutions as well as
current activities and plans. The meetings are fairly informal and
also help the Protege team to set priorities for development work.
This will be the first meeting to take place in North America in
over 8 years, following a long series of very successful meetings in
Europe.

The schedule for the 7th International Protege Conference is now
on-line at http://protege.stanford.edu/conference/2004/. We have a
wide range of presentations planned, ranging from case studies in
ontology design in various domains to tools and ontology-based
applications.

We are very happy to announce that Dr Christopher Welty (IBM
Research) will give the keynote address at the conference. The topic
of his talk will be "Ontology Maintenance Support: Texts, Tools, and
Theories."

Other program highlights include a poster and demo session, a
"protege-discussion Live!" panel where the members of the Protege
team will answer questions from the audience, and an open discussion
of the future directions of Protege.

This year's banquet will be held aboard a cruise ship sailing the
Potomac river. Dinner, dancing, and fabulous views of the
Washington D.C. skyline make this our most exciting banquet offering
yet.

Registration for the conference, tutorials and workshops is now open
at: http://protege.stanford.edu/conference/2004/

*** Please note that early registration ends on May 28th. ***

Note also that we are still solliciting workshop proposals, such as
in the areas of (the list is not exhaustive):
- ontology development
- frames vs description logic

- standard terminologies
- biomedical applications
- other innovative applications
- interoperability between different formats
- plug-in development
- visualization tools
