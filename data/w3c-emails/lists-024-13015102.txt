We are pleased to announce the first 1.0 release of a Plugin
for Protege to support the Web Ontology Language (OWL).
We are making this release in conjunction with the release
of Protege 2.0 today.

    http://protege.stanford.edu/plugins/owl/

Protege is an open-source ontology development environment
developed at Stanford Medical Informatics, supported by
a large community of active users.  Protege provides an
intuitive editor for classes, properties, instances etc, and
has extensions for ontology visualization, project management,
software engineering, and many other modeling tasks.

The OWL Plugin is a major extension of Protege, allowing users
to load, save, edit, visualize and classify ontologies in the
Web Ontology Language, and to acquire Semantic Web contents.
The OWL Plugin provides interfaces to Description Logics
reasoners such as Racer and allows to access other services
provided by HP Lab's Jena library.

Protege and the OWL Plugin also have a powerful open-source API
for programmers of custom-tailored new components such as additional
reasoners and user interface widgets.  With its extensible
architecture, Protege can serve as a base platform for ontology-based
research and development projects.

Since its first beta release in 2003, the Protege OWL Plugin has
become one of the most popular editors for OWL.  It will continue
to evolve during the next years.  Your contributions are welcome,
and we are eager to collaborate with interested groups.

Parts of this work are funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute
and the National Library of Medicine.
