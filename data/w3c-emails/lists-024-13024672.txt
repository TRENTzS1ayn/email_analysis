Hi,

working on an OWL editor/species serializer I'm a little
bit confused about using rdfs:Literal for DatatypeProps. The
S&AS doc [1] mentions

[[
dataRange ::= datatypeID | 'rdfs:Literal'
]]

but in the reference doc [2] the rdfs:Literal option was removed
from the WD in the august 2003 CR version (After comments from 
RDF Core IIRC). The "Parsing OWL in RDF/XML" note [3] seems to 
ignore rdfs:Literal as well, but I'm not sure on that.


Furthermore, the validators from
Manchester [4] and Pellet [5] both complain:

Mindswap, Pellet:
"Non OWL-DL features used
http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal is an unknown datatype"

Manchester/Karlsruhe, OWL Ontology Validator
"Undefined Datatype: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal"

The vOWLidator at http://owl.bbn.com/validator/ is fine but I don't
know if it does species checking.

I guess it's too late for doc changes but thought this issue
might be of interest. (will send a copy to www-rdf-logic as well).
Maybe this is not an issue at all (a rdfs:Literal range for a 
datatype property doesn't really add information..), but I wonder
how to "translate" an rdf:Property with rdfs:range=rdfs:Literal to
an owl:DatatypeProperty with rdfs:range=??. Simply drop the range?
Or can I keep it because the validators are just incomplete and 
the rdf/xml is DL-ok?


thanx in advance,
benjamin
