Benjamin,

Thanks for your comment.

There is a distinction in OWL between a data range and a datatype. As 
RDFCore pointed out in their review of Reference, rdfs:Literal is not a 
datatype. So, it was removed from the list of datatypes but added to the 
list of valid data-range specifications, see start of Sec. 6:

[[
  OWL allows three types of data range specifications:

     * A RDF datatype specification.
     * The RDFS class rdfs:Literal.
     * An enumerated datatype, using the owl:oneOf construct.
]]

This is in line with the S&AS grammar rule that you quote (which is the 
OWL Lite one, so it leaves out the enumerated option)..

You do not have to drop the range, as rdfs:Literal is a valid value for 
a range specification of an OWL property.

Hope this helps,
