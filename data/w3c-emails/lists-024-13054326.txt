               Call for Presentations, Workshops, and Tutorials

The Seventh International Protege Conference will be held on July 6-9, 
2004.
The meeting will take place at the National Institutes of Health in 
Bethesda,
Maryland. This meeting is traditionally a forum for users to meet one 
another
and the Protege team and for us to meet you. We discuss common problems 
and
solutions as well as current activities and plans. The meetings are 
fairly
informal and also help the Protege team to set priorities for 
development work.
This will be the first meeting to take place in North America in over 8 
years,
following a long series of very successful meetings in Europe.

Registration for the Protege Conference will open in mid February.

The conference will include one day of tutorials and small focused
workshops and two and a half days of the main conference. The main 
program
will include presentations, a poster session, and a demo session. Thus, 
we
would like to solicit your contributions for all the events at the
conference. You can find the detailed Calls for contributions at the
conference Web site: http://protege.stanford.edu/conference/2004/

All events at the conference will address the following topics (the 
list is
not exhaustive):

- ontology development
- frames vs description logic
- ontology development in OWL
- standard terminologies
- biomedical applications
- other innovative applications
- interoperability between different formats
- plug-in development
- visualization tools
- project management
- ontology tools
- reasoning and inference

We look forward to your contributions and to seeing as many of you as
possible in July at the meeting.

The Protege Team
