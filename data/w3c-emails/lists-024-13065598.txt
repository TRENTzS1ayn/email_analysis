About all we learn from this is that Mike likes an inexpensive local wine. 
<quote>

Surely all we learn is that the Wine with the identifier "MikesFavoriteWine" is the 
same as the thing with the identifier "StGenevieveTexasWhite", not anything about 
the value of the "favorite-wine" property of the thing with the identifier "Mike"?

Nowhere else is StGenevieveTexasWhite mentioned, nor Mike, nor that things with the 
id <name>sFavorite<class> have a relationship to the thing with the ID <name>, nor 
that Mike is local to Texas, etc.
