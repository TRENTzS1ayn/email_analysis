Yes.  Note, however, that this inference would also be valid in the
original example.  Note also that your example doesn't make much sense, as
it has lots of unusual consequences.

This is yet another case where the RDF/XML syntax is not helpful, as it
obscures the real semantic relationships.  What you have done is define
FailedStudent as follows


FailedStudent <= Student
FailedStudent = hasGrade : Failed

From this you can infer 

hasGrade:Failed <= Student

i.e., any thing that has a failing grade (perhaps in love, for example)
would be a Student.  What you probably want is

FailedStudent = Student & hasGrade:Failed

or

FailedStudent <= Student & hasGrade:Failed

In both these cases

Brian in FailedStudent

implies

Brian in hasGrade:Failed
