Well, you are now going beyond the logic.  As far as the logic is concerned

Brian in hasGrade:Failed

is how you say that Brian's grade is Failed so there is no distinction
that can be made in the logic.

Perhaps RACER makes a distinction between actual fillers and inferred
concept membership.  This is not sanctioned by the logic, so RACER is on
its own here.
