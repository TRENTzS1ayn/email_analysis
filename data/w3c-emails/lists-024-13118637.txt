Well, Racer does not support individuals as part of class expressions. 
This would require the description logic SHOQ (or even SHOIQ) but Racer 
is still based on SHIQ. The "O" part means the support of individuals 
in class expressions. BTW, I think the same restriction also applies to 
other highly optimized OWL DL reasoners.

Racer supports owl:hasValue for datatype property values (integer, 
real, string) but not for individuals.

If one uses an individual as value for an object property, this is 
approximated as:

<owl:Restriction>
      <owl:onProperty rdf:resource="#hasGrade"/>
      <owl:someValuesFrom rdf:resource="#Failed"/>
  </owl:Restriction>

"Failed" is automatically declared as a class, i.e., individuals are 
mapped to classes with the same name.
If you'll switch on the "verbose" mode of Racer, you'll get an 
appropriate warning...

Hope, this helps.
