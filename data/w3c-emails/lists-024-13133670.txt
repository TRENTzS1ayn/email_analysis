Colleagues - a favor please.  The public-webont-comments list is not 
intended for discussion of OWL per se, but for discussion of the 
specifics of the OWL documents and for reporting errors, etc.   The 
much more widely read www-rdf-logic@w3.org mailing list was designed 
for exactly the sorts of discussions you're having here, and would be 
a much more apt place to continue this discussion - might I suggest 
you consider moving the discussion there?
  thanks
  Jim Hendler
