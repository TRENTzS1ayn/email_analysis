Hello!

I'm trying to use OWL in my research, in which I need a way to represent 
constraints on a semantic network, and while studying OWL and analyzing 
it's completeness, I found no direct way to express "transitive over" 
properties, I mean properties, which are not transitive by themselves, 
but are transitive over another property.
For example "worksFor" may be considered transitive over "consistsOf", 
if we have a company consisting of departments.

Are there any ways in current OWL to express such a relations? I 
suppose, they're vital for part-whole relationship.

Hope, this message is clear to understand ;-)
