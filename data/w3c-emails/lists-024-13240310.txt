Miikhail - this is an interesting question, and Jos de Roo has moved 
it to the www-rdf-logic@w3.org mailing list, as that is a good place 
to discuss such things.   Let me give a factual answer her however, 
just for clarity.  There is currently no mechanism in OWL for 
expressing what you are suggesting directly.
