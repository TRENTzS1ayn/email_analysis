Hi,

it would be great if someone could confirm/answer the following, 
I'm not 100% sure if I got it right. The questions are partly related
to Holger Knublauch's comments on annotation properties in OWL DL [1].

1) I would like to use dc:creator as a DatatypeProperty. If I say
   <owl:DatatypeProperty rdf:about="&dc;creator" />, am I still 
   in OWL DL space?

2) I would like to use dc:creator to annotate my ontology. Now
   I must not have the above statement in my ontology if I don't
   want it to become OWL Full. Right?

3) <owl:AnnotationProperty rdf:about="&dc;creator"/> allows me to
   use it on classes, properties, individuals and ontology headers,
   but reasoners will ignore them. Does that mean, that API builders
   should skip annotation properties in e.g. rdql query patterns? Or
   does this only mean that annotation properties should not be used
   for class modeling etc.? 


I appreciate any help. Thanks in advance.
Benjamin
