The wine ontology is currently broken, because the
food ontology cannot be imported.  I tried the link
http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/wine.rdf
(which is the first match for wine.owl in Google),
but it fails because it cannot import

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-owl-guide-20031209/food

This error is in place for several weeks already.  Whoever
is responsible for this server problem, could you please
solve it, so that we and other OWL newbies can use it?

Thanks
Holger
