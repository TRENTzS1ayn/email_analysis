thank  you for reading the overview document and sending comments.
There is now an editor's draft (at 
http://www.ksl.stanford.edu/people/dlm/webont/OWLOverview.htm) with 
updates from the valuable comments we have received and 3.10 now appears 
in the table of contents.

It would have been appropriate to keep your statement that OWL is 
differentiated over earlier languages such as RDF with its explicit 
representation capabilities for versioning information.

Thanks again for your interest in OWL and congrats on the thesis submission.
