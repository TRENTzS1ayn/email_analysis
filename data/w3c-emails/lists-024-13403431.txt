Mike,

 

Thanks for considering my comments.  

 

I noticed, you responded to my Guide comments by replying to the
Reference comments.  I hope that doesn't confuse anyone.

 

I appreciate the way you responded to each suggestion, and I don't have
any issues with any of your responses.

 

Thanks,

Lee
