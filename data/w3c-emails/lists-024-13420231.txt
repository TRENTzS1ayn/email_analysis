I prefer not to make this change. The document assumes some basic 
knowledge of RDF (see the intro).

Fixed.

You're right. It is stated correctly in Sec. 8,3 but we forgot to update 
the text  in this section. The last sentence of the note now reads:

[[
In OWL Lite the subject must be a class name and the object must be 
either a class name or a property restriction.
]]

We meant the first *opera* example. Changed accordingly.

This was observed by a number of people. The editors of the OWL 
Reference have an action to add some explanatory text about this issue.

Is it posible that you misread this?
In Sec. 7.4.3 it says:

[[
If owl:backwardCompatibleWith is not declared for two versions, then
compatibility should not be assumed.
]]

The typing triples are only needed if the ontology is explitly stated to 
be in OWL DL. That is not the case here.

Link added.

At the moment the value does not conform to xsd:date, so we left this 
unchanged.

We have deliberately refrained from using OWL constructs in this schema.

This is on purpose. There are no dmain/range restrictions for VersionInfo.

Added these to the list.

Yes, a lot. As editor you tend to get blind at some point for errors. 
The work you put into this detailed review is very much appreciated.
