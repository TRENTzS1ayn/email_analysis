Hi, I need some help. I can't seem to get the wine ontology [1] to  
work. From earlier posts on w3 realated mailing-lists I have gathered  
that there has been some problems with this ontology.

First of all, is [1] the correct (i.e. most up-to-date) wine ontology?  
I am using the ontology together with RACER [2]. The problem is that I  
can't realize the ABox. I am told that the ABox is incoherent and that  
doesn't sound right. Anyone with similar experience?

Any suggestions, pointers or ideas would be much appreciated.

Jakob
