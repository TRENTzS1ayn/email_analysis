Hi,

Racer still assumes the unique name assumption (UNA) for individuals. 
Therefore, Racer finds the wine Abox inconsistent. This should be fixed 
soon because we are working on a pre-alpha release of Racer (version 
1.8) that does not assume the UNA anymore as default. It will be 
possible to optionally switch on the UNA.
