Jeff, 

by *not* mentioning A has someValuesFrom C at all is effectively saying
that A optionally has C. 

The semantics is that everything is possible (i.e. it is optional that A
has C, B could be equivalent to A, or to C... A could be a subclass of C
etc etc ). Just like if you don't say B is distinct from C, then the
semantics is that B could be intersecting with C.

To say what you want, I believe the following is enough:

Ontology(
 Class(A
  restriction(has someValuesFrom (B))
 )
 Class(B
  not (C)
 )
 Class(C)
 ObjectProperty(has
  domain(A)
  range(unionOf(B C))
 )
)

Cheers,

The best that I can do seems to be this:

Ontology(
 Class(A
  restriction(has someValuesFrom (B))
  restriction(has someValuesFrom (C)))
 Class(B)
 Class(C)
 ObjectProperty(has
  domain(A)
  range(unionOf(B C)))
)

which contradicts the fact that having C is optional.
