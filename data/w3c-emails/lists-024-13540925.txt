Ok, the hole is getting smaller (or the owl is getting bigger, depending 
on your perspective).

The suggestion to reason about the optional 'A has C' from the range 
definition is a good one.

But this only works well when the domain of the property is just A. If 
the domain is also a union of classes (e.g. in the WSA case already 
mentioned) then a lot of other unintended inferences pop out.

Could I use something like maxCardinality = 0 to rule the unintended 
inferences out?

More specifically, given classes 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E', a property 
'has', and the "reality" that A has B and optionally has C, and that B 
is distinct from C, and that D has E, how do I say that A doesn't have 
E, and that C doesn't have B or C?
