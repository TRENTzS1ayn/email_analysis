Ok, the hole is getting smaller (or the owl is getting bigger, 
depending on your perspective).

The suggestion to reason about the optional 'A has C' from the range 
definition is a good one.

But this only works well when the domain of the property is just A. 
If the domain is also a union of classes (e.g. in the WSA case 
already mentioned) then a lot of other unintended inferences pop out.

Could I use something like maxCardinality = 0 to rule the unintended 
inferences out?

More specifically, given classes 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E', a 
property 'has', and the "reality" that A has B and optionally has C, 
and that B is distinct from C, and that D has E, how do I say that A 
doesn't have E, and that C doesn't have B or C?

Jeff- this really doesn't belong here - this mailing list was 
intended for explicit discussion of the OWL documents, not for 
general discussion of use of OWL.  The mailing list 
www-rdf-logic@w3.org was designated as the right place for this sort 
of discussion - and is also read by a lot more people.  May I suggest 
you take this discussion there - you're more likely to get the 
answers you need on that list.
  thanks
