Benjamin,

Thanks for your comments.

Both your assumptions are correct. In response to your and other 
requests for more explanation on this issue, we have elaborated in the 
OWL Reference document the description of OWL DL constraints on 
annotation properties. See Sec. 7.1 of the most recent editor's draft:

   http://www.cs.vu.nl/~guus/public/owl-ref-recdraft.html#Annotations

(temporarily NOT linked from the WebOnt home page).
