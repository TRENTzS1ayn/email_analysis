Hi,
I have some questions regarding "owl:import":
If one ontology imports another ontology, how are conflicts handled, 
e.g., name conflicts (name already used), semantic conflicts (a similar 
concept that already exists is imported)? How are the imported concepts 
and relationships related to the existing concepts and relationships? If 
one ontology imports more than one ontology, how are conflicts handled 
in this case?
If you consider that these things are only related to OWL tools, are 
there any tools that solve the questions above?
Thanks,
Titi Roman
