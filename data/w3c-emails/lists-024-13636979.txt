We are happy to announce version 1.1 of the Protege OWL Plugin
to support the Web Ontology Language (OWL). We are making this
release in conjunction with the release of Protege 2.1 today.

    http://protege.stanford.edu/plugins/owl/

Protege is an open-source ontology development environment developed
at Stanford Medical Informatics, supported by a large community of
active users.  Protege provides an intuitive editor for classes,
properties, instances etc, and has extensions for ontology
visualization,
project management, software engineering, and many other modeling tasks.

The OWL Plugin is a major extension of Protege, allowing users to load,
save, edit, visualize and classify ontologies in the Web Ontology
Language and RDF, and to acquire Semantic Web contents. The OWL Plugin
provides interfaces to Description Logics reasoners such as Racer and
allows users to access other services provided by HP Lab's Jena library.

Protege and the OWL Plugin also have a powerful open-source API for
programmers of custom-tailored new components such as additional
reasoners
and user interface widgets.  With its extensible architecture, Protege
can
serve as a base platform for ontology-based research and development
projects.

Since the previous 1.0 release, the Protege OWL Plugin has been
significantly
improved in terms of stability and offers many new features.  It already
has
several thousand users around the world and is the base of many
extensions
for ontology visualization and handling.

Parts of this work are funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute and
the
National Library of Medicine.

Also available is a new comprehensive tutorial on OWL and Protege,
written
by Matthew Horridge from the University of Manchester.
