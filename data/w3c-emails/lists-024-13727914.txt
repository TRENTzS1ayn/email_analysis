Hi,

Could someone at the Consortium offices give a reset to the test 
results page for OWL implementations 
(http://www.w3.org/2003/08/owl-systems/test-results-out).  Trying to 
get a re-generation to occur, and its failing on re-importing the RDF 
files from the different implementers.

Thanks,

Jack
