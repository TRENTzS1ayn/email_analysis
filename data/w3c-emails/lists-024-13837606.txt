Hi all,

I second the motion of Alan. I do not see any computational problems by 
introducing qualified number restrictions into OWL DL. For instance, 
Racer incorporates two innovative optimization techniques for 
efficiently dealing with qualified number restrictions. These were 
published at IJCAR and the DL workshop. Racer already accepts an OWL 
extension (in the spirit of DAM+OIL) that allows the specification of 
qualified number restrictions.
