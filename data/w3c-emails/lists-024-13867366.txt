My two cents:
If I understand your modelling, you could introduce a parent property 
for "hasAuthor", "hasTitle", etc. called for instance "hasAttribute" and 
this property could be declared to be the inverseOf "forPaper". As a 
result the implication would be a one way implication for the sub 
properties of "hasAttribute":

X hasAuthor Y => X hasAttribute Y => Y forPaper X

while you only have:

Y forPaper X => X hasAttribute

Best,
