Hello all,

When translating OWL Guide, I stumbled on what is likely a typo:

==========================

5.1.3. Complement [OWL DL]

In paragraph after first example, this sentence:

The class of NonConsumableThing includes as its members all individuals
that do not belong to the extension of ConsumableThing. This set
includes all *Wines*, Regions, etc. [...]

It should read: "This set includes all *Winerys*, Regions, etc."

=========================

hih,

JJS.
