Deb, have you tried printing it lately? I have not.

attached mail follows:
sure... send it anywhere (thanks for your quick attention).

I accessed and printed it from a Window's box using IE 6.0.  The tables are
right truncated, thereby losing the last third of most of the third column
of each of the tables in that section.

haven't seen any other problems with it at this time

thanks again
stu
