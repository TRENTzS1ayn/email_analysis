I find the example for deprecated resources in

http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#Deprecation

very unsuitable.  The class "Car" is defined to be
owl:equivalentClass of "Automobile", but the property
owl:equivalentClass has owl:Class as its domain
- and owl:DeprecatedClass is a subclass of rdfs:Class.
IMHO, a better use of owl:DeprecatedClass would be as
an additional rdf:type for an existing owl:Class.

Very similar, the example defines a property "hasDriver"
to be the inverse of "drives", but owl:inverseOf can only
be applied to owl:ObjectProperties.  Again, it would make
more sense to use owl:DeprecatedProperty as a "flag"
for a property that is also explicitly defined to be an
owl:ObjectProperty.
