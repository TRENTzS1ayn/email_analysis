I have been been observing the development of the Wed Ontology Language. 
Might I suggest to those developing it, that they also provide capabilities within 
the architecture of the language. Such that web content can be logically 
represented in a standard format regardless of the language (ie. spanish, arabic, 
japanese, ect.). Logical arguements are a universal feature of all language; 
whether written from speech or whether writing code in software language. Let 
OWL be capable of representing individual logical arguement, premises, 
conclusions, unstated premises, and unstated concusions of wed data in any language. 
That way foreign web pages could be searched for content pertaining to any 
issue in a more efficient manner. Also such a capabilty would provide endless 
capabilities for artificial intelligence. If the developers of OWL can isolate the 
various parts of an aruement into its logical pieces, then for the first time 
in the History of mankind we can truly have computer capable of learning and 
even capable of invention. The possibilities are mind boggling. I am observing 
OWL's development and deployment with much anticipation.
