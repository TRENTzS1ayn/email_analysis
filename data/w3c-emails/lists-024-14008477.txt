I quick search in OWL S&AS
http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-semantics/semantics-all.html
for ``comprehension'' provides a table of the Comprehension conditions
(principles) in OWL.


They are needed, for example, so that 

ex:a rdf:type ex:b .
ex:a rdf:type ex:c .

OWL-entails

ex:a rdf:type _:d .
_:d owl:intersectionOf _:l1 .
_:l1 rdf:first ex:b .
_:l1 rdf:rest _:l2 .
_:l2 rdf:first ex:c .
_:l2 rdf:rest rdf:nil .

Without the first comprehension principle this entailment would not hold
because 

ex:a rdf:type ex:b .
ex:a rdf:type ex:c .

would not OWL-entail

_:l1 rdf:first ex:b .
_:l1 rdf:rest _:l2 .
_:l2 rdf:first ex:c .
_:l2 rdf:rest rdf:nil .

i.e., there would not need to be a list containing ex:a and ex:b so there
would be no way to form its intersection.

Yes, this is all an artifact of having to encode OWL syntax in
semantically-meaningful RDF triples.
