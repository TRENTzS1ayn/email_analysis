On oil markets, "Lel Bruce Peto" quoting recent comments
by industry AG participant:

"There is no correlation between high prices and fundamentals. We have
not been asked for additional barrels. There have been complaints about
high prices, but there have been no complaints about a shortage of
supply. There is no relation between high prices and supply."
