The current working draft (Web Services Choreography Description Language
Version 1.0, W3C Working Draft 27 April 2004) completely lacks a conformance
clause.  A conformance clause should be added so that implementers, and
others, are clear precisely what the requirements are on an implementation
for it to be deemed conformant.
 
I suggest that we could use the conformance clause in WSDL as a starting
point - refer to Clause 8 of  Web Services Description Language (WSDL)
Version 2.0 Part 1: Core Language, W3C Working Draft 26 March 2004.
 
If we agree that there can be different kinds of implementation of the
language then I suggest that each identified kind of implementation has its
own sub-clause, in addition to any general sub-clauses.
 
For instance, we may wish to distinguish between tools that perhaps support
the creation of choreographies and produce an XML document that conforms to
the CDL specification from implementations that consume such an XML document
and then monitor or police (or generate part of) a choreographed message
exchange.
