In the current CDL specification (Web Services Choreography Description
Language Version 1.0, W3C Working Draft 27 April 2004)  clause  2.3.4
Channels
 
The word 'channel' to me implies the pipe between 'things'.  I therefore
suggest that in the CDL specification text and language definition we
carefully distinguish between this concept of a pipe between two, or more,
end points and information related to a single end of a channel.  We might
use the term 'ChannelEnd' for the latter concept (or some such).
