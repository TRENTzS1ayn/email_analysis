In the current CDL specification (Web Services Choreography Description
Language Version 1.0, W3C Working Draft 27 April 2004)  clause 2.1 Model
Overview: 

 The bullet :

*
Participants, Roles and Relationships - In a Choreography information is
always exchanged between Participants, within the same or across trust
boundaries

is about Participants, Roles and Relationships but only mentions
Participants
 
I suggest amending to something like:

*
Participants, Roles and Relationships - In a Choreography information is
exchanged  by message passing between  roles in different Participants,
within the same or across trust boundaries.  A Relationship is a named
pairing of a role within a participant with another role in a different
Participant.
