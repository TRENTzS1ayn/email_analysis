The current version of the CDL specification
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-ws-cdl-10-20040427/  uses the word
'interaction' as one of the key element names.  I suggest that we use the
word 'interact' for this element (yes, as in the Oracle contribution), and
use the word 'interaction' in its English sense.
 
Rationale: Just because interact is shorter and trips of the tongue easily!
(Interact is a verb and interaction a noun my dictionary says, so not a clue
which one is more grammatically correct in XML - interaction possibly -
interesting but not relevant?)
