Two simple use cases:
1. Alternative paths based on business rules or requirements.

     Relevant points to consider:
     a. Multiple paths can occur.
     b. Is successful completion of any one path substantive or not (affect final outcome)?  Here the seller sees the 'Handle questionnaire' as an obligation.  This may not hold true for the buyer.
     c. Opens question of optional behavior and what is allowed in the context of a business process and choreography (affects interoperability).
     d. Raises questions about pre-post conditions as well as the impact of other business processes or external events.

2. Similar to case (1) except raises exception issue

     Relevant points to consider:
     a. Exception propagation up and down the stack
     b. Business action based on exception

Thanks.
