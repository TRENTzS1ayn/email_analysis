David, if the order submission process and the order status query process are part of the same larger choreography, then  the dependency issue disappears.
 
With separate choreographies for the two processes, the state connecting the two choreographies has to be maintained outside of the choreography.
 
The question now is - whether the choreography language should support references to such external state (perhaps in the form of a language to specify preconditions, post conditions, etc).
 
The alternative may be to simply require that the related choreographies should always be defined under a larger umbrella choreography, such that the dependency state management naturally falls within the scope of choreography.
 
Some of the above may sound like jumping into the solution. However, I am trying to understand myself whether the use case is within our scope at all.

Martin sending out a use case reminded me of another use case involving dependencies between choreographies that I want to provide.
