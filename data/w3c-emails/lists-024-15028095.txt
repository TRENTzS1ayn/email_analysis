This use case describes the idea of creating an *instance* of a choreography
definition (i.e. an actual choreography) that allows one role to inquire on
the outstanding activities being taken by another role after a catastrophic
failure. This allows partially complete choreographies to reach their normal
conclusion.

Assaf contributed to the ideas in this use case.
