+1

Also assuming that we were to introduce an additional level of indirection above WSDL/Schema, let us for a moment think how this layer would look like. Perhaps just like WSDL/Schema!

  Tony -

  I think you hit the nail on the head when you described EDI and ASN.1 as
syntaxes.  I strongly believe that we should tie ourselves to WSDL/Schema,
but that does not mean that we are tied to the XML syntax in the actual
messages exchanged.
  Both schema and WSDL both operate at the xml information level not the xml
syntax level, so, for example, a WSDL interface can easily be used to
describe an EDI or ASN.1 message.  What is missing right now are standard
bindings to EDI/ASN.1/name-your-favorite-encoding+transport, however, there
are plenty of companies already providing and using EDI<->XML converters.  A
processor is, of course, able internally to represent the data however it
chooses, provided it can logically present it as XML when needed.
  I think the cost of adding a level of indirection above WSDL/Schema would
be enormous in terms of extra complexity and user-confusion.  Instead, we
should work to leverage the extensibility and openness already in WSDL and
the richness and expressiveness already in schema.

  Thanks,

  - Bill
