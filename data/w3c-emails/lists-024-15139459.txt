David,
 
Is the handling of errors for every message something that should be in the choreography? If included, then it could prove to be an infinite cycle-e.g., there is an error in the error response message, which is handled as an error, and so on. This seems like another protocol that should be layered below the choreography. True?

Martin sending out a use case reminded me of another use case involving dependencies between choreographies that I want to provide.
