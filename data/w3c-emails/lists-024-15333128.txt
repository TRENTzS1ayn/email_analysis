My motivation is NOT about bi-party vs multi-party collaboration, nor about 
"netural-view" vs "party-centric-view", nor about "choreography" vs 
"orchestration".
Going back to David Burdett's original message about reusing the "process" 
definition across different message structure.  I agree with that viewpoint 
and don't see WSDL/XSDL is abstract enough.

This come quite natural in my mind but I don't know enough to give you 
another concrete example.  But I'm sure David has a lot.

I would think so.  I think WSCI have solved this problem already, although 
it is based on a party-centric view rather than a neutral view
