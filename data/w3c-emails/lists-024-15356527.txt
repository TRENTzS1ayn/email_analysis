I guess a choreography between multiple participants can be defined by laying out the sequence, the direction of message exchanges and the few properties that drive the exchange of messages, etc (that is without depending much on the service descriptions), and hence I thought the abstraction in your example justifiable.

Can't that be achieved by defining the choreography in terms of WSDL 
operations which are not specific to one particular service?
