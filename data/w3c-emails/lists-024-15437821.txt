Assaf,

Thinking more about the XSL/T approach.  I think the AbstractPO doesn't 
need to be xsd:Any.  It can just be the following ...

<complexType name="AbstractPO">
         <element name="shippingAddress" type="Address"/>
         <element name="totalAmount" type="xsd:float"/>
</complexType>

Because you can use a handcode XSL/T to transform any concrete PO (even 
EDI) to the above structure.

Rgds, Ricky
