I don't think I said anything different from this - IMO constructing an 
XML-based binding for something like ASN.1 is practically difficult, and 
even if it were possible to do this without relying on WSDL, such a 
binding would be out of scope for this WG. I think there is still some 
support for preserving this as a possibility, but I don't personally 
favor that view. Even exotic message formats can in principle be 
transformed to XML - and doing so is easier IMO than trying to deal with 
them somehow in their original form.

How tightly tied WSDL is to the choreography definition can still be 
discussed, e.g. whether it is directly embedded or indirectly 
referenced, and if the latter, how much and what kind of indirection is 
desirable.
