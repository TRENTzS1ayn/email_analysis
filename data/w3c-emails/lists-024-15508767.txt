Subject: Use cases



Gentlepeople,

I have been trawling through the archive in search of all submitted 
user cases. Alas this is not easy to do. In fact the subject lines can 
be somewhat misleading. In order to enable us all to get at all the use 
cases submitted would those folk that have submitted them but have not 
prefixed the subject line with the word "usecase" please resubmit so 
that we can get to all of them more easily.

Sorry for the hastle but I want to summarize them (at least in list 
format) for the the next conference call.

many thanks

Steve T
