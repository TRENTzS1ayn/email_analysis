There has been some discussion around the idea of an abstract bindable
choreography so I thought I would provide an example in the form of a
diagram (PDF) which shows the flow associated with the placement of an order
and an XML representation of the same in a declarative style. I strongly
suggest you look at the diagram first.

Comments welcome ;-)
