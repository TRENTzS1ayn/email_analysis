not any more. There are a set of recent standards from the ASN.1 group
that allow XML representation of
types defined in ASN.1 and, by conversion of XML schemas to ASN.1
definitions, the ASN.1 encoding of
XML defined types.   See http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/xml/ for details (and
a schema -> asn.1 converter
that makes it a lot easier to see what's what).

One (deliberate) effect of this work is that XML schema-defined types
can be transmitted using ASN.1
Packed Encoding Rules, which are highly compressed (and have a canonical
encoding). 

There is no difference between ASN.1 and XML - they are just alternative
notations of the same thing !
