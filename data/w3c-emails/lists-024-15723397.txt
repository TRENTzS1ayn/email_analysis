Actually I would phrase it a little differently:

1. It has sometimes been proposed that we not require a WSDL + XML 
Schema definition of messages.

2. It has sometimes been proposed that we remove WSDL definitions out of 
the choreography flow itself, into another layer.

There are partially independent: 1. implies 2., but 2. doesn't imply 1. 
  I.e. there are advantages (I believe) in not directly having WSDL 
definitions in the choreography flow, even if you will assume that WSDL 
exists at another layer.
