In terms of using diagrams for helping to understanding the use cases, I would like to recommend using BPMN, which is a standard being developed by BPMI. This form of diagramming is being developed by business analysts to promote easy understanding of internal and B2B (choreography) business processes and their relationships. Technical mappings from the diagrams to XML languages are being developed for BPEL4WS and BPML. Mappings to specifications like WSCI are planned and certainly the output of the Choreography Working Group would mapped by the developers of BPMN.

I have sent in some examples of these diagrams for some of the use cases.

Any comments?

I think David's XML model serve the purpose of the choreography definition
and I don't see why it can't be a potential candidate for our choice.  I
don't think David is proposing a diagram notation, it is just for helping
to understand his example.
