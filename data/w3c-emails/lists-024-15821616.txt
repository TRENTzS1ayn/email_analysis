I agree with Martin.

I don't want to dismiss the value of purely abstract diagrams that 
depict what choreographies should look like without getting into 
details. There is obvious value in doing that. There are also 
technologies that let you do that (UML, XMI, etc) which are 
standardized, royalty free and supported by a variety of tools.

Is there any value in reinventing UML/XMI capabilities in this working 
group? What would we be adding to the already existing body of standards?
