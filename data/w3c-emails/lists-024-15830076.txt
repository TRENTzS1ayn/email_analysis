I agree using a XML representation of the choreography 
in a declarative style makes sense.

I don't see how XMI is related to web services choreography. 
XMI was developed for XML interchanges between tools and 
applications. It's basically a XML serialization format 
for CORBA/UML tools, right? 

We should focus on describing the structural and processing 
semantics of message exchange choreographies supported by a 
web service, perhaps around WSDL extensions and SOAP 
extensions. WSDL/SOAP extensions are expressible in 
XML Schema and that should be the language to describe 
choreographies as well.

I think David's XML model serve the purpose of the choreography definition 
and I don't see why it can't be a potential candidate for our choice.  I 
don't think David is proposing a diagram notation, it is just for helping 
to understand his example.
