On the one hand I want to say that the choreography language should not 
depend on any particular visual notation. If people prefer to use some 
other notation , abstract or specific, standardized or proprietary, that 
should be allowed. Users may find different notations to be more 
capable, having a better visual represenation or preffered for any other 
reason (e.g. because of tool support).

There is a multitude of notations out there, not just UML and BPMN, and 
users may prefer to use other notations. I don't think we can agree that 
one notation works for all. We definitely can't elect a normative 
notation language, nor should we.

On the other hand, there's a lot of benefit in augmenting examples with 
a visual diagram. A picture is worth a thousand words. So we should at 
least elect some notation strictly for the purpose of illustrating 
examples. If nothing else, it would help the reader to better understand 
the specification.

The notation must be:
a) not specific to one tool
b) as natural as possible making it easy to read
c) but also documented for reference purposes
d) as close as possible to the domain
e) not restrictive - the notation should adapt to what we want to 
express, not the other way

The benefit of BPMN is that it meets all these requirements. If we come 
up with a specific thing we want to express, Stephen can feed these 
requirements back to the BPMN working group to propose a natural visual 
representation, and also to come up with simple mapping rules between 
the visual notation and the language.

I am definitely in favor of using BPMN in a non-normative fashion as a 
means to illustrate examples.

This form of diagramming is being developed by business analysts to promote easy understanding of internal and B2B (choreography) business processes and their relationships. Technical mappings from the diagrams to XML languages are being developed for BPEL4WS and BPML. Mappings to specifications like WSCI are planned and certainly the output of the Choreography Working Group would mapped by the developers of BPMN.
