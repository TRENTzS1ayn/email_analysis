I wouldn't rule out PNG or SVG ;-)

I definitely agree with your assesment. If I wanted to specify a WS 
choreography language that allows tools to know what the hell is going 
on but use XMI, the resulting specification would be incredibly complex 
and practically unusable.

At one end of the spectrum there's the abstract definition of some 
possible flow that is not grounded to any technology. Just saying that 
activity A is followed by activity B. When the definition is that 
abstract, then XMI becomes quite usable. You really only import/export a 
subset of XMI and only handle very generic elements (activity, 
transition, etc), so it's not an unsourmountable problem.

In my experience there is need for a language for expressing WS 
choreographies. But I don't think there's a need for yet another 
language for just expressing abstract flows of activities.
