The publicly released draft of the BPMN specification can be found here:

http://bpmi-notation-wg.netfirms.com/Documents/NWG-2002-11-02R1%20BPMN%200-9-1.pdf

There have been some recent changes to BPMN that are reflected in the diagrams I have posted. There should be a draft of the 1.0 version of the specification soon.

An updated summary chapter (chapter 3) has been posted here:

http://bpmi-notation-wg.netfirms.com/Documents/BPMN%20Section%203.pdf

Any questions that anyone has about BPMN can be directed to me.

-Steve

Is there a reference to where this notation is defined?
