I have looked at the BPMN specification to determine if it will map well 
to WSCI and allow you to express choreographies, including the ability 
to depict two different parties/roles (separate swimline) exchanging 
messages with a clear notion of direction (who sends what) and state 
(who sends when).  Also ability to express any number of exchanges until 
a certain time-out or another message exchange, do things in parallel, 
etc. BPMN seems to fully support these scenarios and the notation is 
very natural to read.

In fact, I think the last point is very important. The notation is self 
explanatory so it's easy to understand definitions - including those 
depicting multi-party choreographies - by just looking at the diagram. 
Just look at the example that Stephen gave and see if you can easily 
understand what's going on without having to read the BPMN spec.

That's an important aspect if you are using a notation in a 
non-normative fashion to help illustrate examples.

As Stephen said, there is no write up of the mapping from BPMN to WSCI 
due to time/bandwidth. That does not mean they cannot be created. I have 
look at BPMN to determine that it can be done and fairly easily. There's 
nothing new or challanging about these mappings, it's just a matter of 
editing the BPMN document to contain them.
