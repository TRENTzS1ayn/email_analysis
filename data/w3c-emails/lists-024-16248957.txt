Hi all,

 

I most sincerely apologize for disrupting the group by putting the
conference call on hold. I blame myself for being so careless, and can
only offer as extenuating circumstances a family member in surgery and a
new phone system that is somewhat unfamiliar. Thus, I thoughtlessly hit
the HOLD button and took the expected call quickly without giving proper
attention to the situation. 

 

Again, please forgive my unintended rudeness. I'm terribly embarrassed. 

 

Thanks,

Paul
