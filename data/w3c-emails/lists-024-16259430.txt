There seems to be several different issues involved in the discussion
of notation.  Let me share my perspective:

1. The target notation for WS-Chor should be XML so that the choreography
specification can be exchanged as part of establishing a relationship
between parties to a web services exchange.

2. It may be useful to have a more visual notation for developing 
examples and exploring problems.  This should not be normative for
this group.

3. The OMG has an RFP outstanding for Business Process Definition 
Metamodel which is intended to define a metamodel for businesss processes
including choreography, but without notation.  The purpose is to define
the modeling concepts to be used by modeling tools, to provide for the
integration of these models with other UML models, to provide for the
storage of these models in a MOF repository, and to provide a medium
of exchange using XMI.  The expectation is that this metamodel will
support a varity of notations and provide a common representation for
their exchange.

4. UML provides some notation for expressing processes (activity diagrams)
and exchanges (sequence diagrams) that may be useful, but they are not
likely to express what is needed in choreography since I doubt that
choreography was considered in their design, and they are not generally
accepted as good notations for expressing business processes.
