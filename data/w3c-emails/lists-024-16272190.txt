I also missed the roll-call today.

I connected to the tel conference one hour after the conference had
started,
and listend to some pleasant music :-)
I didn't know aboud PDT.

in my understanding, PDT=GMT-7.
Is that right?

It means that I have to get up before 5am to be in time for the futer
tel conferences...oops.
