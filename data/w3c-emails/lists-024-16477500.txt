So, you find it useful to tag "both" transition and the state as of type "time-out". Also, I agree that specifying just time-out will not be greatly useful and we need to provide for fully defining the time-out constraints, etc. 

Now, in the choreography language, we could either treat time-out transitions and states as any other. Or define explicitly in the language time-out as a type of transition, a type of state, and also define the bondage that a timeout transition results into a timeout state (I guess we already assume certain types for the state:- start, end, error, etc and timed-out become one more! Is that right?)
