How about:

1. State - a state.

A "start state" is characterized as a state with no input transition. An 
"end state" is characterized as a state with no output transition. All 
other states are intermediary. An "error state" is a state with input 
transitions occuring as result of error events. A "time-out state" is s 
tate with input transition occuring as a result of time-out events. A 
state may be an error state or a time-out state or a message state or 
both or any combination.

I disagree that error necessarily leads to a terminal state.

If someone invited you to their home, you came, knocked on the door and 
there was no one there, do you just give up or leave? Perhaps you should 
try ringing the door bell. Still no answer? Call them on the cell phone. 
You may find that they are back in the garden attending to the roses. 
They may ask you to come around the back instead of entering through the 
front door.

In the majority of cases an error is indeed the end of the choreography. 
You've tried your best but you just can't complete. But in some cases 
you can recover, notify and elect a different path. If you have a vested 
interest in performing the choreography surely you have a vested 
interest in trying to recover and proceed past a point of error.
