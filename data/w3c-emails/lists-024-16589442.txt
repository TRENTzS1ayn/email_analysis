David,

I'm not sure why I haven't received your message directly, but
I like your linkage of state machine to process functionality.
This provides a clean separation of the external choreography
from the internal process.  We can then focus on how messages
are exchanged between participants according to the state 
transitions of their public state machines.

Fred
