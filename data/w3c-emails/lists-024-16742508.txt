Maybe the answer is staring us in the face:

When we talk about external definitions we seem to be implying a shared
state machine. There is a common understanding between all parties about
who is playing what role, what states each role can  get into, the
(shared) state of the process itself etc. [is this what is commonly
called a global model?]

On the other hand an internal defintion seems to define a state machine
that is not shared  (tho may or may not be visible i.e. could be black
box or white box). So what states you need, what tranistions you make,
how you name other parties is totally private.

Obviously the two have to be glued together at some point.
As a group we have to decide whether we are working on shared state
machines vs priavte ones, or both. In all case we will have to look at
the "glue" requirements.

Martin.
