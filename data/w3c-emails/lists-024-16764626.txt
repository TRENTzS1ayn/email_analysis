The basic premise is that you treat everything as events and you find a 
way to agree on the occurrence of events. This also ties the 
choreography to other models the express everything in terms of events 
(e.g. various distributed and consensus algoritms).

There are two ways you can agree on an event occuring. By communicating 
the event itself or by communicating the condition that leads to that 
event. And there are two ways you can communicate that stuff: by sending 
messages (events) or by agreeing to use a particular choreography (a 
form of communication in itself).

An event like 'order completed' is explicitly communicated from seller 
to buyer. An event like 'order completed notificiation time-out' is 
fired internally by each service, but the fact that this event will 
occur at the same time for both buyer and seller is communicated, e.g. 
as part of the purchase order message, or by agreeing to participate in 
the same choreography. By agreeing in one way or the other when the 
time-out would occur, both buyer and seller are synchronized with each 
other, even if they don't exchange messages to signify the event.

This is much like the real world. In the real world I can call you and 
say "your order has completed" (possibly leaving you a voice mail) and 
we both know the order has completed. Or I can call you and say "if you 
don't reply by 5pm, the order is canccelled". If it's after 5pm and you 
didn't call me, we can both conclude the order has been cancelled. 
There's no need for a second confirmation.
