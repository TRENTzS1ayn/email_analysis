Hello TAG,

At TP2004, one of the presentations referred to some material in WebArch 
about extensibility [1].  Karl Dubost started a Wiki topic about it [2], 
because QA also deals with extensibility in the QA Framework (QAF) [3].

In [1] and [3], TAG and QA might have slightly different concepts behind 
similar terminology, and/or might be implying slightly different 
advice.  Even though the QAF is being radically revised and trimmed down, 
it seems clear now that extensibility is one of the topics that will almost 
certainly survive in a new, leaner Specification Guidelines.

At this point, QAWG would like to suggest some liaison or further detailed 
discussion during the revision of our respective documents, with a view 
towards making our respective extensibility-related content consistent.  We 
could participate in a joint teleconference, or QAWG could prepare a 
detailed look at the respective extensibility bits, or both.

Please advise, what TAG thinks would be the best next steps.

Regards,
-Lofton.
