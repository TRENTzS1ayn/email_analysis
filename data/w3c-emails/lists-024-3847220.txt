Hello Patrick,

Your original posting is there and present in the archive at [1]. The
organisation of the archive may be confusing. We asked that it be divided
into quarters rather than months. The initial messages we received are
organised by month, and more recent ones have fallen in the by quarter
bucket - which despite being labelled Jan-March 2004 only contains messages
posted on or after 1st March.

Best regards

Stuart
