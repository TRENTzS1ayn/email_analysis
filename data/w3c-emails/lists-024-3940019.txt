RDFCore would like to congratulate the TAG for making an excellent start on
documenting the principles that govern the design of the architecture of the
web.  We also recognise the great difficulty of the task the TAG has taken
on.

In response to the call for review of [1], several members of the RDFCore WG
have submitted many detailed comments on the document [2][3][4][5] which we
hope the TAG will find useful.  We are confident the TAG will give due
consideration to each comment on its merits with or without specific
endorsement by the RDFCore WG.  RDFCore requests, however, that the tag pay
particular attention to comments that relate to:

   - having a clear vocabulary and meaning for fundamentatal notions such as
resource, representation, naming, identifying etc.
   - reference and dentotation and other forms of use of URIs with and
without fragment identifiers
   - allowing URIs that identify resources such as people that are not 'on
the web'
   - notions of authority and ownership of URIs and resources

We trust that the citation of the RDF Model and Syntax specification be
replaced with a citation of the new RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax
document [6] in due course.

Brian McBride (co-chair)
On behalf of the RDFCore WG
