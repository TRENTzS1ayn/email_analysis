which helps a lot... we started looking at comments by section
http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2003/lc1209/webarchWithIssues.html

We happened to be going backward thru the document, so we
discussed this comment first:

and several of us were sympathetic to that; we made some suggestions
to the editor. I hope you'll hear from him soon.

But then we looked at this one:

and we didn't really know what to make of it.
