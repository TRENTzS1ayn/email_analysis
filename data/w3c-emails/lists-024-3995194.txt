Dan, thanks for the heads-up, I'll gladly clarify any other of my
issues, for the current, see below.

Section 4.5.5 recommends that QNames used as identifiers must be
mappable to URIs. Most such mappings (all that I've seen) use fragment
IDs (relevant to 4.5.8) with the namespace URIs (relevant to 4.5.4) but
this interaction is shown nowhere in the Arch document.

I think the Arch document should describe this most common interaction.
It could say, for example, that it is (or is not) recommended that
mappings use fragment ID syntax (related to draft finding on Abstract
Component References) but that if fragment IDs are used, the language
should also recommend that suitable namespace documents are used.

It doesn't seem to warrant a whole section, but a paragraph or two (or
maybe a story) somewhere around 4.5.5 or 4.5.4 or 4.5.8 would be useful.

Hope it makes sense,
