Marton,

Thanks for you comments, please see my responses below.

Yes, the sentence could be a little more clear.

Indexing could be thought of as classifying resources using terms from
the ontology and adding meta-data about them using properties from the
ontology. Searching is the process of matching a query with these
annotations in order to find relevant information.

A parametric search is one that has one or more parameters. For example,
one might execute a search for a movie where "director=Lucas and
releaseDate < 1980." We'll have to add an explanation to the document.

These use cases don't necessarily need to be localized. A portal could
serve multiple communities with some common interests, and might require
different ontologies to serve the differences between these communities.
A multimedia collection may have a common ontology for describing the
media, but may use any number of ontologies to describe the content of
the media. A multimedia collection fo scenes from Western movies should
probably also use an ontology that describes cowboys, horses, saloons,
gunfights etc. A collection of clips from country-western songs might
also use the same Old West ontology, but might also have other
ontologies that deal with pickup trucks, hunting dogs, or divorces.

For how the language is intended to support ontology interoperability,
look at the requirements and objectives that state that as a motivation.
Keep in mind, that we don't propose to completely solve this problem
with this version of the language. We intend to provide some features
that allow partial interoperability such as establishing equivalence
between terms in different ontologies and using terms from other
ontologies to form complex descriptions of terms in new ontologies.
