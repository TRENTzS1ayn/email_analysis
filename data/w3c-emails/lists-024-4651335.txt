Agreed  - that goes along the lines of what topic maps do. What you call "concept" is (a
subclass of) what topic maps call "subject". If this subject (concept) is represented by a
topic, the corresponding "terms" will be called in topic maps "baseNames". Many
"baseNames" can be attached to one topic - to be used in various scopes.

applications.

I would call these "concept identifiers"

There is no way (and certainly no need) to try and get such a thing as a "globally unique
and ambiguous" (absolute) identifier of a concept. But there can be one or more available
reference definition(s) each one *according to some publisher*, and each one identified by
an URI declared and maintained by this same publisher. That will be used to assert that I
use this term (baseName) to name that concept (subject, topic) as identified by that
publisher under that URI. That's the best disambiguation one can hope to get. And again,
that's what PSIs are all about.
