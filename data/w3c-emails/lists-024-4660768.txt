Alan,

Part of the problem is that despite the medical community having reached
some consensus on terminology, there is much less consensus in other
communities interested in ontologies. Another problem, is that the Web
community has developed its own terminology. Finding a terminology that
makes everyone happy is unlikely.

When we use "term," we refer to any element in the ontology's
vocabulary. This includes class names and property names (elsewhere
called relations or slots). Thus, we are using it in the same sense that
Ontolingua uses non-logical symbol, but since this document is meant for
a wider audience than the logical community, we chose to avoid that
term. Since concepts traditionally only refer to classes, it would be
inappropriate to use that as well.

The use of "label" comes from RDF Schema, where it is a "human-readable
version of a resource name." In this sense, it is more like the
linguistic phrases you describe. RDF Schema even suggests that a "label"
can be used with a "xml:lang" attribute to identify a language for the
label, although there are some questions as to whether this really works
the way it was intended. There is no requirement that a label be
associated with a unique term. As you say, there is ambiguity in lexical
representation, and due to polysemy, the same label may be used with
different meanings. If someone wishes to use them in search, then they
would have to provide a method for resolving the ambiguity.

As for your suggestions about concept names and concept identifiers, I
don't believe Web Ontologies can make the same distinction. Due to the
distributed nature of the Web, I don't believe you could say that there
is a single unique identifer for every concept. How could you enforce
such a thing? Instead every term (our usage) has a URI. Some of these
URIs may refer to the same concept. In this case, an equivalence can be
established between these URIs (see the class and property equivalence
requirement), achieving the same effect as having multiple concept names
for the same identifier.

I do agree with you that there needs to be a distinction between the
conceptual and the language layer, and will encourage the working group
to examine the references you mention when it focuses on the problem of
internationalization. Your comments also suggest that the requirements
document could do a better job of defining the terminology it uses.
Although we may not use the terminology you recommend, this would at
least help you and others to translate it into your own terminology.

Thanks for your comments.
