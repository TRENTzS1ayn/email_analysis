Hi Peter and Jos

I am wondering whether the addition of rdf:List and
rdf:ParseType="Collection" in the RDFMS makes redundant previous
constructs like rdf:Seq and rdf:Alt. From formal viewpoint using lists
we can represent both Seqs and Alts.

I have two questions: 

a) What is the status of rdf:List as far rdfs is concerned? Is-it a
class (instances have a URI) or a structured value (instances without
a URI) ?

b) Why not go one step further in the RDFMS refinement and define also
types for list elements: e.g., list of integers, strings, URIs? Note
that this is of paramount importance for interpreting the results of
an rdf query returned as collections.
