Thanks, and thanks for responding.

Yes, definitely.   I expect that revised versions of all the documents
will be produced in the near future.  In particular there are many open
issues whose resolution may require changes to the documents.

I think that in all cases in the document a brace-enclosed element can
occur zero times without problems.  Of course, many of these may not be
particularly useful, but they do make sense.  For example,
unionOf(<description>) would be equivalent to <description>.  In fact,
unionOf() has a reasonable interpretation, namely equivalent to
owl:Nothing.  

The most questionable of these constructions are the ones like
DifferentIndividuals(John), which has no impact at all.  However, changing 
the production to 
  <fact> ::= DifferentIndividuals( <iid> <iid> {<iid>})
makes the grammar bigger and gains very little in clarity.

I agree that this it would be useful to be able to annotate other types of
constructs.  There is an outstanding issue (number 4.4) that addresses this
lack in the current formulation of OWL, which has been carried over from
DAML+OIL.

There is an ongoing debate within the working group related to this point.
One way of looking at the use of a URI reference as the name of more than
one of a class, a property, or an individual is that there is a
relationship between the class, property, and/or individual so that they
are either closely related or are the same.  This, I think, does not go
against the principles of XML.

Correct.  I'll change the abstract syntax document accordingly.

The next paragraph goes on to state when a property cannot be transitive.
