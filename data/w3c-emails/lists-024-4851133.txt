Jacco,

Thanks for your very useful comments.
The gist of your comment is:

I agree. It's a common problem with documents like these that the authors 
have internalised so many of these arguments that they (read: we:-) forget to 
write them down for the benefit of the readers.

Fortunately, you already suggest two concrete ways of improving the document

One option that I will explore is to link the definition of OWL Lite with the 
use case from our requirements document (see [1]) to achieve what you 
suggest.

You suggested also:

Work is already ongoing within the WG to use UML as a presentation syntax for 
OWL (see e.g. [2]). When this has matured, we should add this indeed as 
motivation, as you suggest.

Thanks again for your useful suggestions,
