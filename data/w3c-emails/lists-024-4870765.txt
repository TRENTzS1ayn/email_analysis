Questions about Feature Synopsis for OWL Lite and OWL:

There is a reference to the predefined class "Nothing" in the section on
complex classes (right before section 5).  Are "Thing" and "Nothing" part of
Full OWL as opposed to OWL Lite?

Also, are "ObjectProperty" and "DatatypeProperty" part of OWL Lite or Full
OWL?
