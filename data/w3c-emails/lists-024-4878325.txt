Thing is in OWL Lite, Nothing is only in Full OWL.
This is also consistent with what the abstract syntax says ([1], just before 
section 4), but I agree that the Feature Spec could give the matter more 
emphasis.
(the justification is probably that the presence of Nothing allows one to 
encode much more expressiveness than we would want to allow in OWL Lite)

Yes, the Feature Spec delegates this issue to the Abstract Syntax doc [1],
which (fortunately) is clearer on this.
They are both part of OWL Lite in a restricted form (see [2]),
with a more general form in Full OWL:

"OWL property axioms generalize OWL Lite property axioms by allowing
 descriptions in place of classes and data ranges in place of datatypes in
 domains and ranges."
(from [3])

Hope this answers your questions,
both are good pointers for us to improve the document.
