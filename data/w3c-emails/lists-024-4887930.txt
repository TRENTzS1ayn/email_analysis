David,

Thanks for your input.
They provide two very valuable datapoints for the language design


One: you write:

> We have implemented components that support semantic information
> integration.  By-and-large the representation features of OWL Lite support
> what we are doing, and we would expect to transition our tools to OWL Lite
> when it becomes a W3C recommendation.

which is very good news.

Two: You also ask for owl:hasValue to move from Full OWL to OWL Lite, and 
give a good motivation for it (your need for it in data-integration 
projects).

The problem is that this adds rather substantially to the expressiveness (and 
therefore the computational complexity) of OWL Lite. For the same reason, 
enumberated classes are not in OWL Lite (actually, you could encode hasValue 
once you have oneOf, using allValuesFrom with a singleton class).

I can see that as a user, you would want hasValue in OWL Lite,
but as a tool builder, it would make your life significantly harder.
Would that change your mind?

Frank.
