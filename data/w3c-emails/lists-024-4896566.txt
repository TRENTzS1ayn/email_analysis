Mike,

Thanks for your comments.
To me this says that in the next version we should definitely put more effort 
in
- difference lists between OWL Lite, Full OWL, RDFS and DAML+OIL
- a rationale for the items in these difference lists

Your comments are very much in line with Jacco van Ossenbruggen's earlier 
comments (see [1]), making the case all the much stronger.
