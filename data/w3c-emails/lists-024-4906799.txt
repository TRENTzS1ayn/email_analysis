Thanks a lot for this Mike,
this is exactly the kind of datapoints that the WG so badly needs.

After taking a first look:
- all of your "must have"s are in OWL Lite,
  with the proviso that OWL Lite only allows 0-1 cardinality restrictions
- all of your "might have"s are also in OWL Lite,
  with the same proviso
- In [1], David Jones suggested that hasValue should also be a "must have",
  which is not in OWL Lite.

Question: did you use other cardinality values than 0,1 in your
          data-integration projects?

Thanks again for this very useful use-case input.
