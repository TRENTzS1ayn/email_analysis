There are pros and cons to adding NOTHING to OWL Lite.
As Ian points out, it is possible to encode it with a little thought.

The thought process that went into the decision in the WebOnt group meetings was
that putting it in the language made it easier for naive users to "hang themselves"
by using it unnecessarily and advanced users already could figure out how to encode
it.

Thus, the decision was made to leave it in full OWL and leave it out of OWL Lite.

Putting it in OWL Lite makes OWL Lite more parallel (since OWL Lite already has a
top class named THING many would expect it to have a bottom class called NOTHING).
