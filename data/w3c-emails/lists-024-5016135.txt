We are trying to build an ontology building/editing environment for business
end users, using OWL as the underlying representation language and it would
be helpful to get some clarifications about the language.

1.  Are local property restrictions not part of OWL Lite? (somewhere the
doc. says OWL DL next to anonymous classes)  Having local property
restrictions specified as anonymous classes, makes it difficult to present
this information to an end buisness user in a clear and meaningful way.  Why
are  local property restrictions specified as anonymous classes instead of
say just specifying the restrictions on the class directly?

2.  Is "rdf:type" the correct and only way for specifying classes as
instances of other classes?

3. Can minCard, maxCard and cardinality restrictions be applied to global
property definitions or are only allowed for local property restrictions?

4.  Are local property restrictions on a class, inherited to its subclasses?

5. We have a requirement for representing user-defined facets.  How can
these be specified in OWL?

Thankyou in advance for your replies
