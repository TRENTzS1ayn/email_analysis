the above is quoted from an introduction to the web ontology language 
work I presented at WWW 2002.  It is a brief summary of the longer 
document [1] which identifies the requirements and objectives for the 
Web Ontology Working Group.  Summarizing what you will find there, 
the goals of our group are not to reinvent these various features, 
but to make sure our solution is maximally compatible with existing 
implementations and/or does not break other standards.  In 
particular, we currently assume we will get arithmetic and string 
manipulation from the "underlying strata" (i.e. XML and RDF) and thus 
do not anticipate creating our own solution for these.
