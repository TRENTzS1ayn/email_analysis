Some minor error corrections and suggestions for the OWL Reference
Description (version 1.11 from 2002/06/07).

In the last item of the list in the section 'Class expressions'
(boolean combination) the elements '<rdfs:Class>...</rdfs:Class>'
should be replaced by '<owl:Class>...</owl:Class>'

There are missing end-tag delimiters ('/') in the list construction
of section 3 ('rdf:parseType="owl:collection"') for #red, #white and
#blue.
In the following paragraph 'DAML+OIL' should be replaced by 'OWL' in
the last sentence.

In the List example (second paragraph of section '3. rdf:parseType="owl:collection"')
I suggest to replace

'For example, the statement'
with
'For example, the collection of the three elements enclosed
 by the oneOf construct in the statement'

because the following list representation for this example is an
equivalent of the collection of the three elements rather than the
whole oneOf statement.

Regards, Thorsten
