To the W3C,

Enough of this!  The W3C has lost it!  How can time and
effort be spent developing requirements for the ontology of the
Web when there are so many existing W3C specifications that are
in such a horrible state.  You people must stop calling yourself
a "protocols development" organization when all you do is write
fatasy documents about ivory tower concepts that prove useless to
everyone.

It's time for the W3C to clean house before it starts writing
new specifications and requirements.  The lorrid state of XML Schema
must be corrected.  The XML Schema specs are in a "straw man" state
and no one is making an effort to fix this.  The lack of interoperability
in the early implementations of SOAP and WSDL must be corrected, or
has it been the plan all along that whatever Microsoft does with .NET
will become the standard?  After all, why write a real specification
when all that has to be done is to wait for Microsoft to set the
de-facto standard.

So now comes "Requirements for a Web Ontology Language" from
the W3C.  Ontology of the Web ... is this a joke?  Here, try this
for ontology (see the original, non computer sci definition of the
word).  The whole raison d'etre why specifications for interoperability
have to exist is in response to pure, un-adulterated, capitalistic greed!
CPUs and network equipment are not made to work with equipment from
other vendors for economic reasons ... not so as to create lofty
professions that figure out how best to achieve interoperability.
The primary and main goal of corporations is to make profit.  The
second goal is to destroy their competitors.  The best way to achieve
the second goal is to make a product that doesn't work with your
competitor's product, and then sell more than your competitor.  Or,
just be like Microsoft and take over companies producing nascent
technology and then simply destroy that which was just taken over.  The
goal is not to cooperate with your competitor.  Rather, the goal is to
destroy your competitor.  Then, the first goal is more readily achieved.
There are no magical nor meta-physical forces at work here that cause the
chaos between computer systems.

It's time for the W3C to clean house before pushing off into
more fantasy lands.  Software developers must stop being fooled by
the W3C because the W3C uses key buzzwords like "e-Commerce" in a
document that promises interoperability, but fails to deliver.
