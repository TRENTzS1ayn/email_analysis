W3C has a process for proposing new work and having it reviewed
before committing resources. In this case, we even asked
for public review before starting:

  Message-ID: <3B8ABA79.8031FE1D@w3.org>
  Date: Mon, 27 Aug 2001 16:24:09 -0500
  Subject: Semantic Web Activity and Web Ontology Working Group
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2001Aug/0207.html

The feedback we recieved during the review convinced us
that it was time to commit resources to a Web Ontology working group.

Since we called for participation in the group, approximately
50 engineers from a variety of organizations and companies
have joined the work; each of them wrote a short introduction
that explains their background and motivation for joining
the work; you're welcome to review them.

I suggest you send that feedback to xmlschema-dev@w3.org
or www-xml-schema-comments@w3.org or any of the other
discussion for listed in
  http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema

Meanwhile, I have copied Liam Quin, W3C XML Activity
lead, to bring it to his attention.

Not so.

"The XML Schema Working Group delivered a Recommendation on a language
for data typing and structural constraints in XML in May 2001. In the
coming months, the Working Group plans to continue its work on a formal
description of XML Schema, to work on collecting and developing test
cases for XML Schema, to handle error reports and requests for
clarifications, and to prepare a release 1.1 release of the XML Schema
language."

No, not "Ontology of the Web"... a language for writing
ontologies in the Web:

[[
1.1 What is an Ontology?

An ontology defines the terms used to describe and represent an area of
knowledge. Ontologies are used by people, databases, and applications
that need to share domain information (a domain is just a specific
subject area or area of knowledge, like medicine, tool manufacturing,
real estate, automobile repair, financial management, etc.). Ontologies
include computer-usable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and
the relationships among them (note that here and throughout this
document, definition is not used in the technical sense understood by
logicians). They encode knowledge in a domain and also knowledge that
spans domains. In this way, they make that knowledge reusable.

I appreciate the value of interoperability and, after
working on open specifications for about 10 years,
I am well aware of the market forces that work
in opposing directions. I think you'll find
that most people working in the W3C community
are also aware.

Where did you see W3C using buzzwords like "e-Commerce"?

Google finds 163 occurences of "e-commerce" at the W3C
web site
  http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Awww%2Ew3%2Eorg+e%2Dcommerce

Most of them are mentions of someone else's e-commerce
conference, e-commerce submission, etc. The only
one I can see that originates from W3C is

 "The W3C Ecommerce/Micropayment Activity is now closed."
-- http://www.w3.org/ECommerce/

I think you'll find that W3C is quite conservative
in its communications, compared to many other
organizations that develop web technologies.

The only occurences of "commerce" in our press releases
  http://www.w3.org/Press/
are mentions of other organizations and activities:

  1 July 1997
    W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee Participates at
    White House Administration's Electronic Commerce Initiative 

  15 October 96:
    W3C and CommerceNet Announce Major Step Toward
    Resolving Industry-wide Internet Payment Challenge [JEPI]

Meanwhile, I have copied Janet Daly, W3C head of communications,
to bring your concerns to her attention.
