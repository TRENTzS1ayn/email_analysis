All this RDF * XML * URI ?stuff? seems the long way around from my perspective. I read your obtuse mumbo-jumbo and wonder why all this energy devoted to a ?scheme? that seems a lot more complex than necessary? 

Over the past two years I have e-mailed a few of you trying to get a response to my contention that my ?whatis? proposal offers a simpler, better way to:  
?Provide the needed foundation upon which a best possible result can be produce regarding the complete and accurate mapping of the internets content architecture.? 
I have gotten no replies. 

At the very least the fact that I am one of the few voices on this internet advocating for ?language consolidation? for the purpose of better navigation, and pushing for a fix to the problem of there being ?No practical (logical or efficient) way to find all sites that fit a "class" of web site? should earn me enough credibility to get some kind of ?why your proposal sucks? commentary from at least one of you w3seers.

Old (got locked, than deleted) message board where I got abused for suggesting we don?t need so many ways to say the same thing:
