Graham,

Thank you for your comments. As for use cases, we did not try to provide
an exhaustive set, we only wanted to find very distinct, representative
use cases. The use case you mention is a good one, but unless it
generates some new requirements, there is no real need to add it to the
document.

I want to clarify that the objectives section of the document lists
things that some members of the group thought would be useful, but there
was no consensus on. Sometimes this was because the objective was not
well-defined, other times it was because it was considered too hard for
the first version of the language. There was no effort to keep these
objectives orthoganal, and thus some may overlap with each other (as you
point out, procedural attachments could be used to perform arithmetic or
string comparisons). Your concerns about procedural attachments are duly
noted, and should be mentioned in the description of the objective. It
is highly unlikely that this objective will be addressed in this version
of the language, but if it is, we'll take your suggestions into
consideration.
