Sorry, I misunderstood you. You can certainly create ontologies that
allow you to express these qualifications. In fact, you can do this even
with RDF. That is, you could create a property called height whoose
values are numbers. Users could then ask for people whose height
exceeded a certain value, or from the persepctive of an ontology, a
person could be considered tall if their height exceeded a certain
value. Although blond and handsome are more difficult to quantify, you
could assign your own numeric scales to these as well.

One of the key ideas of RDF and WebOnt is to go beyond simple keyword
search. We want to enable search that uses structured queries (like you
might use to access a database). Although we are not defining a standard
query language for WebOnt at this point, a query of the type you
mentioned would be feasible with WebOnt, assuming you knew the year of
publication for each article. With the right query tool or query
language, you could even do this with DAML+OIL (see www.daml.org), which
is a predecessor of WebOnt.
