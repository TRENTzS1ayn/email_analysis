A technical point occurs to me leading from your post, Bernard,
and that is in regard to PSI definition documents. It seems that
a good rule for XTM documents would be to *never* use an unscoped
name in a PSI definition topic. As your example shows, such an
unscoped name would likely be incorrectly merged during some
processing of it in practice. All names should be scoped by the
domain within which the term is understood.

I have the ITIS zoological taxonomy in mind. There are a lot of
names of sports teams, automobiles, and hair products in there.
