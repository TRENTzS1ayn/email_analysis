Murray -
  The relationship between pubsubj and WebOnt is an important one, and 
we welcome discussion in ww-rdf-logic@w3.org -- this mailing list is 
aimed at specific comments on the WebOnt requirements working draft, 
such as Bernard's helpful note which started this thread-- technical 
details of how these things might be integrated is a great subject -- 
however, let's move it to an appropriate list and discuss!
