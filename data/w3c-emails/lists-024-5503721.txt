Martin,

Thank you for your comments. You raise a good point in wanting to be
able to attach an author or modification date to individual elements in
the ontology. In RDF Schema, this can be done by simply defining a new
property whose domain is a Class or Property. Whether or not we want to
have predefined vocabulary for this is open to debate. We will certainly
consider it before releasing the next version of the requirement
documents.

As for your comment on "View mechansim," I agree that maintaining
updates between parallel ontologies is a difficult problem, but the
problem of maintaining consistent views in the face of changing
ontologies is almost as difficult. As for the note about the ontology
mapping mechanism, the only point is that we might be able find a
suitable mapping method that is identical to creating a view.
