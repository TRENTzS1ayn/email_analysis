Jim,

You may not be aware, but I'm no longer with Sun Microsystems, having
begun a Ph.D. program at KMi in February. I don't believe I have
access to the W3C list you cite. My comment was also merely an
admonition informing the design of PSIs in XTM, though it may as you
point out have wider ramifications. If I'm eligible for the W3C list
as a KMi student, knowing that would be helpful.

Thanks,

Murray
