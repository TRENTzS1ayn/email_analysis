2.1 web portals
"academic papers are written by one or more authors, which are people;
people have surnames and given names and affiliations, which are
organizations"
affiliations are not organizations, they are relations between people
ang organization. if you would be creating an ontology for these terms,
you would define people, organizations, and a relationship called
affiliated, whose domain is people, range is organization.

2.2 multimedia collections
"Ontologies can be used to provide semantic annotations for collections
of images, audio, or other non-textual objects. These annotations can
support both indexing and search."
what exactly do you mean by indexing vs. searching? indexing as in
determining what directory to list a certain site (piece of multimedia)
under? it seems to me, that one of the benefits of the "web of
ontologies" ("ontology of the web"?) would be, that such people
searching wouldn't have to rely on such directories.

2.3 corporate web site management
"Furthermore, a parametric search is often more useful than a keyword
search with taxonomies."
what exactly do you mean by parametric search? 


the use cases, in my opinion, give "localized" examples. by localized, i
mean that the ontologies only need to describe a limited domain. in
section 2.1, the first sentence states "Web portals are web sites that
collect information on a common topic." in section 2.2, where the
example give is multimedia collections, the domain is again quite
limited. i don't see how this document covers the -problems- involved
with defining ontologies, or relationsships between ontologies that are
"powerful" enough to describe any website available on the Internet,
although it is stated as a design goal: 3.3 ontology interoperability.
