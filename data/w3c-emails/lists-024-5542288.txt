Jeff,

I think the wording you propose below is satisfactory.

I appreciate the fine line that needs to be walked
between
giving a basic example that illustrates the points you want to emphasize 
and 
giving an introduction to logic and semantics.

Perhaps as the language takes shape, something like a detailed
walk through could be developed for each use case?  I think such walk
throughs, in addition to whatever language-centered walk through may
be in the works, could be very helpful to propsective end users.

Thanks very much for your responses to my comments and questions.

Jim
