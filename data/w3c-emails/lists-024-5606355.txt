This issue really is out of the scope of WebOnt. In RDF, which WebOnt
builds on, there is no distinction between attributes and elements,
there are only resources. You may want to address this particular
concern to the XML Schema working group.

Because of the nature of ontology languages simple merging with other
XML DTDs/Schemas is not as easy as it might sound. For something like
this, it would be more appropriate to create a Math ontology in the
WebOnt language. You could then build software that translate between
MathML and this WebOnt Math ontology.

WebOnt and RDF assume that the world consists of classes, properties,
and resources. It is possible to view a datatype as simply a set of
values, and from this viewpoint a datatype is a class (although it may
have additional information, such as ordering, equality, etc.). As for
defining datatypes in the same file, that would put extra burden on
WebOnt parsers. They would have to be XML Schema parsers as well. By
keeping them in separate files, the parsing of datatypes can be handed
off to a separate program and common datatypes can be handled with
special purpose code.

Yes imports is a key feature. DAML+OIL had an imports property and the
WebOnt requirements document has "Explicit ontology extension" listed as
a requirement (this is basically imports under another name).
