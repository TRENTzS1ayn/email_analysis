To be honest, I wrote those down as parsed from an email by Dan Connolly --
and the entailment parameter just occured to me -- i.e. this is probably a
half baked idea that I've posted for discussion.

Indeed, this would be a better idea. e.g. application/owl+xml;
entailment=http://example.org/OWL#DL

My idea is that each value of the entailment parameter might license
distinct entailments e.g.


ex:foo rdfs:range owl:Class .
ex:bar ex:foo ex:baz .

simple:

=> nothing new

RDFS

=>

ex:baz rdf:type owl:Class .

lite, DL:

=> error, classes can't be instances

full:

=>
ex:baz rdf:type owl:Class .

Not a document under our control.

Surely and media types are limited, not a perfect means to indicate
semantics, particularly when any or combinations of several semantics might
apply, but this is (just) a media type registration, not part of OWL syntax.

On the other hand, this is not to say that a similar parameter off <rdf:RDF>
would not also be useful.

well, perhaps .rdf, .rdfs, .owll, .owldl, .owl ...

Thanks, to be honest, I'm not sure that this is the solution to the problem
of how to deal with the various possibilities of which entailments are
licensed according to which part of the various specs, but this is a
proposal on the table.
