What is the difference between the proposed owl:individualOf and rdf:type?

How do you propose to express owl:definitionOf in triples? What would
differentiate that from being a combination of owl:subClassOf (or
rdfs:subClassOf) and whatever triples one would need to express the
differentia.

What advantages does speciesOf have over a combination of owl:subClassOf (in
one direction) and the owl:inverseOf owl:subClassOf (in the opposite
direction) - is it intended to be a short hand for this?
