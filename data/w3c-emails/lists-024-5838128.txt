Some brief comments on the latest version of the OWL Abstract Syntax
document (prompted by trying to use the abstract syntax in a tutorial
style document).

o The mixed use of "feature=X" and "feature(X)" forms is ugly and
  potentially confusing -- e.g. cardinalities use "()" and someValuesFrom
  uses "=". Why not stick to one or the other?

o There are places where parsing could be unnecessarily tricky, i.e.,
  something like "union ( person restriction (...))" where restriction
  could actually be a class called restriction or the start of some restriction
  syntax.

Tidying up the syntax a little and adopting some consistent conventions
(e.g. keywords always followed by parentheses) should alleviate both these
problems I think.

Cheers,

Sean
