Sean raises a number of points here that are somethat more than editorial
changes, but are not big changes.

I have made changes to the abstract syntax document to address his
concerns.  The changes amount to:
1/ Using keyword(...) uniformly throughout the document.
2/ A few other minor changes.

Parsing the revised OWL Abstract Syntax does require a bit of lookahead,
but it does fit within yacc, except for restrictions where it is difficult
to distinguish between restrictions on datatype and individual properties.
(I actually have a yacc grammar for OWL now that finesses this.)
