Isn't that a contradiction in terms?

I thought with an abstract syntax, you just got handed parse trees.
There is no parsing.

Now you're talking about implementing the abstract syntax,
and you're treating comments on it as "more than editorial".

This is taking on the character of a presentation syntax,
not an abstract syntax.

I'm concerned that this distracts readers from understanding
the actual syntax of OWL, which is RDF/XML syntax.

the RDF graph"
"RESOLUTION: The exchange language for OWL is RDF/XML "

I note that the WG hasn't taken any decisions about the
role of the abstract syntax in our design (except to
publish a WD to get feedback). From the feedback we're
getting, I'm opposed to the continued use of the
abstract syntax in our design work.
