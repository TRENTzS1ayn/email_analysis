Recommendations:

(1) Toss out cardinalities altogether in OWL-Lite.  FunctionalProperty already
covers the MAX1 case.  Add a 'RequiredProperty' property to cover MIN1.
Invent a third property to cover MAX0.

(2) State upfront whether or not OWL-Lite is intended to be
upward compatible with RDF(S).

(3) Toss out TransitiveProperty and SymmetricProperty.  They add little
if any value, and make things harder to implement.

(4) Forget about OWL-Heavy (for now; maybe forever).

Question:

What happened to 'first' and 'rest'?  The 'bag' stuff in RDF is hideous.
If 'first' and 'rest' clash with some other properties from a computability
standpoint, consider eliminating those other properties.
