Bob, I'll let the editors respond to the specific comments, this 
latter is definitely an issue the group will consider - it's already 
in our issue list (i.e. whether to have levels or just "heavy" or 
just lite)

the RDF Core WG has announced that they intend to provide a 
collection parsetype similar to the one used in DAML+OIL (i.e. first 
and rest) -- we currently intend to use their solution to closed 
sets, at the time we wrote these documents we didn't have details of 
their solution.
