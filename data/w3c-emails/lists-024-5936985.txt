Dear all,

I has just minor comments on the language itself:

2.1.4: OWL Lite cardinality

I think that this depends on the policy:
- having a minimal set of primitives (but then why cardinality and 
FunctionalProperty)
- providing no-brainer restrictions for the user of OWL-Lite.

I take the second standpoint: It is very difficult to refrain 
fram using (cardinality 3). If you look at the combonatorics of these 
primitives, we can provide 3 values for each min and max cardinality 
(NOVAL, O and 1). This generates 9 possiblities (and I do not count 
cardinality).
Of these only 4 are useful:
- (maxcard 0 || maxcard 0 && mincard 0)
[0 ?] EMPTY // alg. nothing
- (maxcard 1 && mincard 1)
[1 1] SINGLE(TON) // alg. X
- (maxcard 1 || mincard 0 && maxcard 1)
[0 1] FUNCTIONAL // alg. X?
- (mincard 1)
[1 +inf] NONEMPTY // alg. X+
- (mincard 0 || VOID)
[0 +inf] NOINFO [this is useless] // alg. X*
- (mincar 1 && maxcard 0)
INC [this is an error] // alg. does not exist

Retaining, empty, single, functional, nonempty as four primitives 
replacing maxcard, mincard and card would strongly reduce the risk of 
errors from the user standpoint:
- by avoiding cardinality 4
- by avoiding the use of multiple expressions (meaningful: mincard 0 
&& maxcard 1 or meaningless: maxcard 0 && mincard 1).
- more generally by requiring at most one keyword for expressing any 
meaningful property!
It would not put additional burden on the implementers.
Only the documentation developers will have a bit more work.

I would be greatly in favour of this solution.

3.6, DublinCore and Version info:
Why not have only one "Annotation" or "Metadata" header and 
leave the room open to any kind of metadata here. I mean:
- not just Dublin Core;
- not just RCS id, and not just as a string but as a structured object as well.

Please if you want to yell at me, leave me in copy since I am 
not recipicent of this mailing list.
