I tend to agree; in fact, thanks for the prod; I ought
to raise this as an issue.

The WG discussed this in July in Stanford;
at the time, a proposal for named cardinalities,
rather than min/max, wasn't very well developed, so we fell
back to the DAML+OIL status quo:

"""
DanC [or was it Deb?]: PROPOSED: hasExactlyOne, as in BaseballTeam
hasExactlyOne pitcher. likewise for hasAtMostOne/hasAtLeastOne

IanH: do we really want to add this sort of new, redundant terminology?

MikeS: indeed, let's stick to owl:cardinality, restricted to 1 or
owl-lite

straw poll: 8 to 5ish

3ish would object to cardinality "1"

RESOLVED: to go with owl:cardinality/min/max, restricted to "1",
dissenting: Evan. abstaining JimH abstained, Deb, Jos, Connolly.
