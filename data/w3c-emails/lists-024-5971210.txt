Thanks Bob for your comments on the Feature Synopsis Document and, in
particular, on the choices
concerning OWL Lite.
We greatly appreciate comments on the documents and particularly value
comments from people like
youself who have spent many years designing, implementing, and using
knowledge representation and
reasoning systems.
(for those on the mailing list who do not know, Bob MacGregor is the
original author and later
technical lead for Loom and PowerLoom among other things).

Specific responses below.
We welcome any additional input.

thx,
Deborah
