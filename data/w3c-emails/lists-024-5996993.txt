Hi:

I'm replying to those portions of your message that are
concerned with the portion of the documents that I'm currently in charge
of.  I've elided other portions of your message; many of theses will
probably be dealt with by the other editors.

A very good point.  I'm going to bring this up for consideration by the
Working Group.

Yes, in some sense.  Section 6 was added later.  I've revised the paragraph
to claim no ``definition'' of the exchange syntax.

Agreed, but order is difficult to incorporate, particularly as RDF is
essentially unordered.  The issue does remain as an issue for the working
group.

OK, I'll make these changes.  :-)
Good reading, by the way.

This used to be true, but the document was reordered a bit.  Thanks for
noticing.

Another good catch.

This is partly by design, as the full conditions on when a property can be
transitive are mentioned in the next paragraph.  The ``or'' in the wording
does not mean ``at most one of''.  However, I found a better way of saying
the same thing, which happens to match the axiom better.

It is possible to state minCardinality=5 maxCardinality=4.  There will be
no instances of the restriction but this is not an error.  It doesn't help
to rule this out syntactically.

Maximum cardinality of 0 even more acceptable, as all it is stating is that
instances of the restriction have no values for the property.  This is
needed for definitions like bachelor, a man with no wife.

> Section 5.2.4 should be Section 5.3.4.

Actually 5.3.3 should be 5.2.3.

> Section 6  DataType Property. Transformation lists owl:uniqueProperty should

Yes, this was an oversight as the name was changed some time ago.
