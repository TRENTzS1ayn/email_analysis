No problem.  You all did excellent work.  I was only able to pick out the
questions and issues I had because all the documents were very readable and 
they all did a good job describing the same underlying language.

Hmm.  This may be a bit of a bug.

minCardinality(0) is a null restriction - it has no effect.

This could be.  It is most probably an issue for either the Feature
Synopsis or the Reference document.

In conjunction with this explicit allowance of minCardinality(0), the
restriction to positive integer is certainly a bug.  I'll change it.

Thanks for picking up this divergence between the various documents.
