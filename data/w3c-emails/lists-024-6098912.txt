Thanks, Jim. I am glad to hear this. For the time being, it might be useful
to include comment or pointer somewhere in the OWL Web page, or in the
current documents indicating that this changes document is forthcoming. If
it is there already, I missed it.

Mike

Mike, thanks for your comments - we are currently working on this - 
Mike Dean will add a section to the reference document with the 
specific changes, and I expect either the guide documents or others 
to mention critical changes.
