You bet it is controversial. This very issue has been one of the topics on 
the debate that has been very active in the WG in the past few weeks, see 
e.g. the thread at [1].

One of the positions taken in that debate is exactly yours: the URI of an 
ontology is an identifier, not (necessarily) a locator, but others have taken 
other positions. Your arguments on this would certainly be appreciated.

Frank.
