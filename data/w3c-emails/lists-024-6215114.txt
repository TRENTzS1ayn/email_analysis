In fact, that scheme is not culturally neutral either, though it does help
with Chinese, Japanese, and Hungarian.  Icelandic, however, has names of
the form "given-name patronymic", and sorting by given name is correct.
Many Arabic names are also of this form, sometimes with multiple levels
of patronymics.  Most Indonesians, OTOH, have only one name.

The only really safe scheme is "full presentation name" vs. "sortable
name".  This does not leverage the typically high redundancy between
these two values, but it does work in all cases.

To say that Bilbo's breath was taken away is no description at all.  There
are no words left to express his staggerment, since Men changed the language
that they learned of elves in the days when all the world was wonderful.
