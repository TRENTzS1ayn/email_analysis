That would be an excellent example, as it is testable.  The 
experiment would be:

A.  Concatenate:

    1.  the unique-within-domain-part

    2.  the "@" character

    3.  the domain name

B.  Send a mail to the resulting address, requesting a reply.

If you get a reply, the experiment is a success.  If you don't, 
then ... hmmm ... choose someone who is willing to answer :-)

I see.  Thinking this further, I think any operation or interpretation
of the personal names cannot be culturally neutral.  Perhaps
a better example to use would be something like the internet email 
address, composing of a name, "@" and a domain name ?
