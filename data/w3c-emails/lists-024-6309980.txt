Thanks to you all for the comment (and for the enlightenment on the 
many international variations on names).  We were not trying to be 
offensive, but anything that helps us in reaching a wider audience 
and avoiding offense is a great help.  Your recommendation that we 
use the email address example is a very positive one, and I am 
recommending to the editor of the use case document that we make this 
change.
