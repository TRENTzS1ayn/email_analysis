The Web Ontology WG is pleased to announce the publication of five 
last call WD's for the OWL Web Ontology Language.  Our WG has made 
its best effort to address all comments received to date, and we seek 
confirmation that the comments have been addressed to the 
satisfaction of the community, allowing us to move forward as a 
Proposed Recommendation following the Last Call process.

The following are our Working Drafts in Last Call:
* OWL Web Ontology Language Overview
     http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-features-20030331/
* OWL Web Ontology Language Reference
     http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-ref-20030331/
* OWL Web Ontology Language Guide
     http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-guide-20030331/
* OWL Web Ontology Language Semantics and Abstract Syntax
     http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-semantics-20030331/
* Web Ontology Language (OWL) Use Cases and Requirements
     http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-webont-req-20030331/

==========================================
ADDENDUM: Specific feedback sought from other groups:


RDF Core:  Review of all documents, particularly reference and 
Semantics, with respect to design and compatibility with RDF.

i18n: Internationalization is specified as a Goal in our Use Cases 
and Requirements document.  Do our requirements meet that goal, and 
does our langauge design meet our requirements.

RDF Interest Group: General feedback on all of the documents, 
specifically on issue of implementation and compatibility with RDF.

RDF-Logic community (Subgroup of RDF IG): Feedback on choices with 
respect to logical design, limitations of Lite and DL, and the formal 
model theory.

Semantic Web Advanced Development: The SWAD projects participates in 
the DARPA Agent Markup Language program and has been developing 
Semantic Web applications based on DAML+OIL (among other projects). 
We seek confirmation that our design is consistent with the 
experience and tools developed in SWAD.

XML Schema: Our handling of xsd: datatypes is based on the XML Schema 
Datatypes design and its limitations (with repect to URI naming of 
user-enumerated datatypes).  We seek confirmation that our design is 
consistent with current XSD and also if there may be forthcoming 
changes to XSD URI naming or other issues that we should be aware of.

Web Services Choreography; Compatibility with the Semantic Web 
Activity is specified in the WSC WG charter.  We have identified Web 
Services in our Use Cases and Requirements document as a valuable use 
case, and we request feedback on whether our requirements satisfy the 
needs of the WSC WG.

Web Services Architecture: We have identified Web Services in our Use 
Cases and Requirements document as a valuable use case, and we 
request feedback on whether our requirements satisfy the needs of the 
WSA WG and if we have met those needs.

Web Services Description; Compatibility with RDF languages is 
specified in the WSD WG charter.  We have identified Web Services in 
our Use Cases and Requirements document as a valuable use case, and 
we request feedback on whether our requirements satisfy the needs of 
the WSA WG and if we have met those needs.

DARPA Agent Markup Langauge (DAML) Program: DAML+OIL was the primary 
input to our langauge (per charter) and we seek feedback from the 
DAML community as to our design and the implementability thereof.

Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents ontology working group: 
FIPA has identified ontologies as an important work area.  We seek 
feedback as to whether our langauge design provides a proper basis 
for FIPA's development needs.

OMG Ontology Platform Special Interest Group: OMG has identified 
ontologies as an important work area.  We seek feedback as to whether 
our langauge design provides a proper basis for OMG's development 
needs.
