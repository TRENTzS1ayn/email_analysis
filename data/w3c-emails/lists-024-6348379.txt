The overview covers this question...

"OWL has more facilities for expressing meaning and semantics than XML,
RDF, and RDF-S, and thus OWL goes beyond these languages in its ability
to represent machine readable content on the Web."

  -- 1. Introduction
  OWL Web Ontology Language 
  Overview 
  W3C Working Draft 31 March 2003
  http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/#s1

and the reference covers it in a it more detail...


"OWL is a vocabulary extension of RDF."
  -- 1.4 OWL and RDF semantics
  OWL Web Ontology Language 
  Reference
  W3C Working Draft 31 March 2003
  http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#Semantics

The exact nature of the relationship is covered in
excruciating detail in the semantics document,
and there are a number of relevant test cases.

But I suspect the two sections above are most responsive
to your question. Do they answer your question well enough?

Tools are emerging. We're starting to collect tools
and implementation experience...
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/#Tools

Strictly speaking, this question isn't in scope of the specification;
you're welcome to ask in www-rdf-logic@w3.org , a forum
where many of the tool developers participate.

On the contrary, thank you very much for translating your
question to English. It is W3C's policy[1] to conduct official
business in English, but we see this as a necessary evil,
not an optimal situation. We do what we can[2] to facilitate
participation in other languages.

In particular, I believe we have a certain amount of
resource available to work with OWL feedback in Italian,
right Massimo?
