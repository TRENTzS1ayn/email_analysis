ISO/TC46 has produced standards in this general area, and of course
AACR2 and various national and interantional MARC specifications also
have something to say about it, and these are rather more heavily
used, and more in evidence on the web through web versions of library
databases etc. Generally these name conventions are reasonably
consistent.

Citation conventions in Harvard etc, may vary again.

Open question: what should be the basis?

Best regards
