1. 

[2.1. Ontologies 

There are two built-in classes in OWL,....
 The class with identifier owl:Thing is the class of all individuals, and is part of OWL Lite. The class with identifier owl:Nothing is the empty class. 
...
]

It should be explicitly specified whether or not owl:Nothing is included in OWL Lite. 
It would be nice and elegant to include owl:Nothing in OWL Lite if there is no harm to do so.

2.

[2.3. Axioms
...
However, **most information about properties** is more naturally expressed in restrictions, which allow local range and cardinality information to be specified. 
...
]
Restrictions are about to define new classes, not to specify properties. So the above sentence should be modified if possible. 

3.

[2.3.1.2. OWL Lite Restrictions

cardinality ::= 'minCardinality(0)' | 'minCardinality(1)' |
            | 'maxCardinality(0)' | 'maxCardinality(1)' |
            | 'cardinality(0)'    | 'cardinality(1)'
]

There are two reduantant symbols '|'.


4. About individual

Just suggestion:
The named individual and the anonymous individual should be explicitly separated. There are some essential differnce between facts about named individuals and the ones about anonymous individuals.
