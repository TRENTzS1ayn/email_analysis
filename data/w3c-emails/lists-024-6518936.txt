Nikola,

Thanks for your feedback.

OWL uses the conventions from RDF:  names of classes are
UpperCamelCase while names of properties are lowerCamelCase.
I agree that it would be good to cite or add an explanation
of this convention.  While this convention is accepted
practice, other naming conventions are also allowed.

Mike
