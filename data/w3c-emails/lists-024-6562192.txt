I'm glad Mike's response helped and answered your question.  The 
mailing list www-rdf-logic@w3.org is available for open discussion of 
RDF/RDFS/OWL issues relating to logic, properties, etc. and is a good 
place to get help as you learn the langauge - people there will be 
happy to help you out as you progress.
