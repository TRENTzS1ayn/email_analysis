And you've succeeded by large. Thanks. Nevertheless, as explanations always
raise more questions, I have some further comments. In this mail I only left
the pieces of your previous mail that were relevant to these comments.

OK. It is just like if we tried to assert

<CabernetSauvignon rdf:ID="SantaCruzMountainVineyardCabernetSauvignon" >
  <locatedIn>SantaCruzMountainsRegion</locatedIn>  
  <hasMaker>SantaCruzMountainVineyard</hasMaker>   
</CabernetSauvignon>

without "rdf:ressource=" pointing towards already-defined ressources, or
without "real" inserted OWL instance definitions. Isn't it ? With such an
assertion, a system couldn't infer that those literals are the names of a
Region and a Wineyard.

I finally managed to understand (and to agree with) your rewording, but it
still sounds difficult. Perhaps it would be better to cancel it or to
exemplify it with your wines and wineries. Even if

[If ChateauMargotWinery producesWine ChateauMargotWhite and
ChateauMargotRed, then {ChateauMargotRed} gives a key for
ChateauMargotWinery, as well as {ChateauMargotWhite}, as well as
{ChateauMargotWhite, ChateauMargotRed}]

is still confusing, at least it gives something more concrete.

Recalling some math courses, I wondered whether "injective relation" could
be used, but a quick search on the net revealed that people used this
expression to refer to injective *functions*, thus not fitting our
one-to-many inverse-functional property. Unless people turn the definition
of "injective" into something like "if p(a) and p(b) are not disjoint (a and
b being instances, p(a) and p(b) sets of instances, the sets of the values
of property p for a and b) then a=b", "inverse functionnal" will probably
remain the best choice. Or something like "disjointValuedProperty", if it
has not been rejected by the WebOnt group yet.

For my humble brains it stills sound confusing. A numerical function may
have something called a "numeric range", but in my opinion it would still be
the "owl:range" meaning (even though restrected to a set of numbers). How
about using "cardinality range" ?

Thanks for your concern,

Antoine
