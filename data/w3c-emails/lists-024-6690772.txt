Hi there,

A few small nitpicks regarding some of the latest OWL documents, feel free to 
use at will...


Re: http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-features-20030331/

3 (second paragraph):
- Incomplete sentence; [[[... are also only allowed between named classes, 
...]]].

3.4:
- The example for allValuesFrom could benefit from being one having the 
domain being different from the range (for clarity)


Re: http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-guide-20030331/

3.1.1:
- The rdf:ID reference example says that [[[Other ontologies may reference 
this name using its complete form, 
"http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/guide-src/wine#Region".]]], but since there 
is no xml:base declaration, they can't do that (in a reliable fashion), right?

5.2:
- rdf:label for #White should be rdfs:label.
