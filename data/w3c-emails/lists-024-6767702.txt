In OWL Lite the domain of owl:equivalentClass must be a named class
and the range must be be either a named class or a restriction..

We will delete the phrase "or subjects of owl:intersectionOf
triples" from the first bullet of the list in Sec. 8.3 of Reference.

"rdf:resource is written with a lowercase in constructions like:

<rdf:Property rdf:ID="backwardCompatibleWith">
    <rdfs:label>backwardCompatibleWith</rdfs:label>
    <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#Ontology"/>
    <rdfs:range rdf:resource="#Ontology"/>
</rdf:Property>

It is in the RDF namespace, so it should really be "rdf:"

We think so. The class axiom for owl:Thing defines its class extension
to be the extension of owl:Nothing plus its complement, which means all
individuals in the universe of discourse. owl:Nothing is its complement,
so its class extension is the empty set.

This comment will be answered in the context of your comments on OWL
S&AS, see Peter Patel-Schneider's message:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webont-comments/2003Apr/0043.html

Thanks for spotting this. We will make the appropriate editorial change
to Appendix C.
