Dear Misha,

Thank you for bringing up the issue that the firstname/lastname example
in Use Cases and Requirements was not culturaly neutral. In the current
editor's draft, I have ammended that paragraph with an e-mail address
based example as suggested earlier in this thread. Here is the updated
text:

O11. String manipulation 

The language should support string concatenation and simple pattern
matching. These features can be used to establish interoperability
between ontologies that treat complex information as a formatted string
and those that have separate properties for each component. For example,
one ontology may represent an e-mail address as a single string, while
another may divide it into a string for user name and a string for
server name. To integrate the two ontologies, one would need to specify
that the concatenation of the user name, the '@' character, and the
server name is equivalent to the single value used in the first
ontology.

Please let me know if this is satisfactory.

Sincerely,

Jeff Heflin
