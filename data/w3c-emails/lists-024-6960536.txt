I was just browsing through your response again, and noticed something
that bothered me.  You suggest that only "individuals" are owl:Things,
and that "literals" are not owl:Things.
It was my understanding that owl:Thing is the universal class which includes
everything that exists.  Since literals exist, they must be owl:Things.
