http://www.daml.org/2002/06/webont/owl-ref-proposed#OWLDocument,  
section 2.1 reads:
"An OWL document consists of optional ontology headers (generally at  
most one).."

Yet  
http://www-db.research.bell-labs.com/user/pfps/owl/semantics/ 
mapping.html, section 4.1, the first two lines in the table require an  
O rdf:type owl:Ontology triple. Shouldn't there be a few [opt]s  
scattered in there? (I take that 4.1 of S&AS is the normative section  
and would trump the reference.)

Tricky reading that table backwards, btw :)
