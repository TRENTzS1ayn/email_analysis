Whoops, I forgot to add:
What happens with multiple O rdf:type owl:Ontology s?

Reference says that there are "generally *at most* one" (emph added). I 
see several reading of the mapping table reversed, including having to 
generate two Ontology(...)s which differ only by their Annotation s.

Cheers,
