Dave,

The WebOnt WG discussed this restriction on bnodes at the Jul 24 telecon 
[1] and decided not to lift the restriction at this point, but to mark 
this as a "feature at risk" in the request for Candidate Recommendation 
[2]. This request now states that this restriction is "at risk" for 
changes, based on implementation experience.

Thanks again for your     ,
Guus Schreiber
