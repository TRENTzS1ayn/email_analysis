I see.

As you may be aware, the Working Group has requested CR status,
noting your oustanding dissent
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/rqim.html
  $Revision: 1.41 $ of $Date: 2003/07/30 23:09:12 $

Regarding this part of your message...

The WG has identified part of what makes the mapping complicated
(constraints that rule out structure sharing, cycles), discussed
a way to remove those constraints, and asked that this part
of the spec be designated "at risk" during CR. We have also
accepted an exit criterion to exhibit "two owl syntax checkers
passing all tests".

The Director is interested to know if moving to CR this
way would be a satisfactory response to your comments.
