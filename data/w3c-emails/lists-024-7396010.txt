Hi,

I am new to the owl subject and I don't know if this is the appropriate
place to ask my question.

As far as I understand, OWL DL is the part of OWL that enables a sound and
complete inference calculus and where the entailment of statements is
decidable. I just couldn't find any proofs for these properties of OWL DL.
Can anyone give me directions?

Thanks
Chris
