 Hi ,

  OWL-DL is considered equivalent to the SHOIN(D) description logics ( 
an extension of ALC including transitive roles, role hierarchies, 
nominals, inverse roles, unqualified number restrictiones and 
datatypes).

 A mapping can be established between OWL-DL entailment and concept 
satisfiability in SHOIN(D) and thus the decidability of OWL-DL 
entailment can be proved from the known decidability of SHOIN(D).

 For more details, there a couple of interesting papers published this 
year that provide a deep insight on these topics:

  -" From SHIQ and RDF to OWL: The Making of a Web Ontology Language"
     writen by Ian Horrocks, P.F. Patel-Schneider and F.Van Harmelen

 "Reducing OWL-entailment to Description Logic Satisfiability"
   by Ian Horrocks and P.F. Patel-Schneider

 These papers can be downloaded from Ian Horrock's web site.
 
 If you are not familiar with description logics get a copy of the 
description logics handbook.

  Viel Gl?ck !
