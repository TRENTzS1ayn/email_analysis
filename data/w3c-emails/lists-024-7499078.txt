Yes, this would be a work-around.  But then I would have to
introduce a new non-standard annotation property that other tools
will not understand.  From my point of view, the allowed values
of an annotation property are of general relevance, not only for
editors but also to inform users of my ontology about the
intended usage of the annotation properties I define.

In addition, I think the OWL specification is already complicating
enough: I don't see any reason why there should be a different
mechanism for specifying annotation properties than for other
properties.  This is not only confusing but also means an
unnecessary implementation overhead.  Why don't we simply regard
owl:AnnotationProperty similar to owl:FunctionalProperty, so that
it can be attached as a "flag" to any other property?

Holger
