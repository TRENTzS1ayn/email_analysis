Holger, I must admit some confusion - if you know the types and 
properties of these things, why do you want to make them annotations? 
If you goal is to have metaclasses (I.e. classes with properties) you 
can certainly use OWL Full, it was designed to allow that.  If your 
goal is to refer to remote properties, you can still make local 
assertions about them.  Annotations were primarily added to handle 
some of the RDF(S) properties like label, seeAlso, and comment, which 
we wanted to allow, but did not want to try to classify on -- as Ian 
argued, if you know the info, put it in the ontology, if you don't, 
use an annotation but expect DL to ignore it
  So, in essence, you cannot have it both ways -- if you want to live 
in DL, you need to accept its restrictions.  If you don't want these 
restrictions, you should use OWL Full -- afraid that logic will not 
let us have our cake and eat it too (believe me, the WG tried hard to 
find a way to do that :->)
  For what you are suggesting doing, why can you not just use RDF 
comments, etc. or to define things directly in OWL?
