Yes, that is exactly right -  the OWL DL profile is defined with 
decidability and completeness in mind - you cannot have those 
gaurantees without some restrictions.  Owl Full is defined to be more 
compatible with the wild, wooly RDF world --more seriously, for 
applications where the logical guarantees can be traded off with 
other issues -- performance, expressivity, database compatible, etc...

So  this means you need to be in OWL Full, which is fine - nothing 
wrong with that, and many nice reasoners are being written for OWL 
Full - but you won't get certain guarantees.  For what it is worth, 
the projects in my research group include some which use Lite and DL 
and others which use Full.  All of our "web presence" (the 
http://owl.mindswap.org web site for example) currently uses special 
purpose reasoners that only do some small sets of inferences (and 
don't need to do classification) and those work with relatively 
arbitrary mixes of RDF and OWL (i.e. OWL Full) -- there are other 
projects where we use Pellet, our OWL DL reasoner, and we must make 
sure the documents are more structured.   There seems to be some myth 
that somehow DL is better than Full or something like that, but if 
you look at our documents you see it is all OWL -- you just get to 
choose what you need.

Hope that helps -- and let me encourage you to allow Protege users to 
create OWL Full documents when they want to -- there's no reason for 
it to insist everything be in Lite or DL -- however, would be nice if 
those users who want to stay in those profiles could - perhaps 
putting the output through Pellet or WonderWeb or such and saying 
"You have created an OWL Full document.  To make it Owl Lite you 
could <xxx>" - doing that with full generality is probably hard or 
impossible, but catching most of the main errors isn't that bad -- 
several of the implemented systems already do some of this
