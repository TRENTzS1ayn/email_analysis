Holger,
  This mailing list is really aimed at specific discussion of the OWL 
langauge design and documents, and your message asking about 
annotation was quite appropriate.  However, followup discussion on 
the reasons why DL is restricted and about other systems would make 
more sense on www-rdf-logic@w3.org.  This mailing list has a very 
limited readership, that one has a much larger one, and I suspect 
you'd be more likely to get answers there.   That's not to say askign 
here is wrong, just that you'd have a better shot at more answers 
there...
