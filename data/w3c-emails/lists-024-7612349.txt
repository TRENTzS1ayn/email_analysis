Just follow your question: I have the same feeling.

For example: suppose there is a property HasYield (integer), but what about the unit this property is using,(Kg, g, etc.)? It is the quesion of property about property.

Could OWL figure out this situation?

Thanks in advance!

All,

I've been following OWL language evolution for a while and ever
since I learnt about it, I had a question on my mind which I still
haven't found a solution or explanation:  Why Properties cannot have
properties?  That is, why is it not possible to decorate a property with
attributes and associations (using the UML terminology)?  I found this
very frustrating as, for example, a simple mapping between a UML
Association Class and a OWL Property is not possible.

Thanks in advance for your clarifications.

Regards,



Justo Ruiz Ferrer.
