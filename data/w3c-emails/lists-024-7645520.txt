Emacs does quite well as an editor :-). Seriously though, OilEd [1] is a 
tool that supports (most of) OWL. It was originally built as an editor 
for OIL and DAML+OIL, so there are one or two things that it doesn't yet 
do, but we are working on it. As a basic editor for OWL ontologies it 
should do fine.

If you're interested in an OWL parser, our OWL API [2] provides 
functionality for parsing OWL in RDF/XML.
