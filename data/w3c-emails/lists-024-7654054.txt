Hello Yongchun,

> I did not see much material that talks about the relation among
ontology, >database, and OOP (object oriented programming). But I want
to say some idea that I am thinking recently to share with you all, and
of course any comment is welcome. 

perhaps this is interesting for you:
[Bek2003] Dave Beckett, Jan Grant, "SWAD-Europe Deliverable 10.2:
Mapping Semantic Web Data with RDBMSes", 
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/scalable_rdbms_mapping_report/ 

especially
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/reports/scalable_rdbms_mapping_report/#
sec-mapping
 
If you follow this trail, you might find other stuff that is related to
them, perhaps someone quotes it or the like ...


> The Semantic Web is based on the current web. Does this mean that
Semantic Web will run on HTTP too? 

Hm, there is much fuss about this.
Checkout Uriqa
http://sw.nokia.com/
And Joseki
http://www.hpl.hp.com/semweb/joseki.htm
and Sesame
http://sesame.aidministrator.nl/

for Semantic Web Server interfaces.

A good example how Semantic Web exists is RSS:
www.syndic8.com

thousands of RSS streams, I have "trillian" and watch them. This is
typical SemWeb stuff.

hth a little
