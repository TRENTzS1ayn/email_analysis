Bernard - you are right that someValuesFrom is the appropriate thing 
to use -- this is a common confusion, and it is embarassing that we 
missed it in the Guide

owl:someValuesFrom requires at least one value meeting this 
restriction be there  (i.e. it is like "there exists" - it mandates 
that one exists) - there can be more than one value with the 
property, or other values without the property, but at least one if 
there.

owl:allValuesFrom does not require a value be there, but does require 
that if there are one or more values of this property they must all 
meet this restriction

good catch
