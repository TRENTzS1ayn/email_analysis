Mike, Ian

Thanks for picking up the issue. Better late that never :))

BTW my suggestion would be to give up the Texas Thingies altogether, and
maybe take the same examples than in the Reference document (Mozart's
operas). The point for it is a very simple and generic pedagogic principle:
any introductory example should offer as small as possible space for
interpretation and discussion. Which means that the reader should instantly
be provided with a clear notion of what is an instance and what is not. In
that regard, Texas Thing, even with a someValuesFrom restriction, is still
confusing. Take the following examples.
There is no indication of cardinality for "locatedIn". Is a company with
several offices, some located in Texas and some not, a Texas Thing?
There is now indication of time extension. The Texan boots I bought 23
years ago in San Angelo (authentic) have been located in France ever since.
They've been Texas Things at a time at least, but are they still now?
And so on. Trying to figure out the extension of the class, the reader is
led astray to such irrelevant paths by too open definition, and misses the
point of "equivalentClass". See my "BlueThing" example in rdf-logic ...
OTOH, providing a non-ambiguous definition of Texas Thing would be very
arbitrary and controversial, and would need more restrictions, which would
make the example confusing by its complexity.

It figures. Finding good examples is difficult but important. 99% of users
will build their understanding from examples, not from abstract syntax.
