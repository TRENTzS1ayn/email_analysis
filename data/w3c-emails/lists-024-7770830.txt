Hi,

I already posted a related comments/question on Dec 4th [1]:

In the OWL Web Ontology Language Overview" document[2] the
section "3.10 OWL Lite Versioning" is missing in the table 
of contents. And I have a question concerning that section.
It says: "RDF already has a small vocabulary for describing
versioning information".

It would be great, if someone could tell me, if there
really is such a thing. (In my thesis, which I have to submit
by the end of december, I wrote that one difference between
OWL and RDFS is OWL's support for versioning. I'd just like to
know if I can keep that sentence or should better drop it...)

thanx in advance,
benjamin
