Ivan, thanks for your comment.  This is something we are actively 
working on now.  You might look at the Overview document (formerly 
called features) which answers some of that, and Reference which has 
a more comprehensive discussion of the OWL sublanguages -- we haven't 
yet stabilized our discussion of the relation with RDF(S), in part 
because we were waiting for their documents to reach a stable state - 
since they've gone to LC, we've been able to make some progress on 
this
