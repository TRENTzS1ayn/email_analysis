Catching up on email.  

This is just a note to say that the changes you proposed to the OWL
Semantics doc in your email of 4th January[1] responding to my
comments on your pre-draft of 2nd January[2] look good.

I'm not proposing to comment further on pre-WD documents at this
time, I'll wait for a public WD.

Thanks

Dave
