Subject: Fuzzy about what defines an ontologies' namespace

This is unfortunate wording.  It should instead say something like
"The first namespace declaration provides a default namespace.  
Unprefixed element names are expanded into elements of this namespace."

There also needs to be some wording to the effect that it is conventional
to make the default namespace correspond to the Web location where the
ontology is located.

RDF is also currently wrestling with the differences between an XML
namespace, a vocabulary, and the Web location of an RDF document.  (I
actually don't think that they have yet put the third element into this
mix, but they should.)

The name of an ontology could be totally different from the location of
ontology document.  However, really the only thing that matters for an
ontology is where it is located, as that is really the only thing that
matters for ontologies.  

The only thing that you can do with an ontology is load it (outside of the
OWL spec) or import it.  Loading would either be done directly by feeding
an ontology as a character sequence into a tool (which doesn't involve any
naming issues) or tell the tool to load the ontology document at a
particular Web location.  Importing is always done by looking for the
ontology document (if any) at a particular Web location.

It is, at least I think that it is.  This is, however, the realm of the RDF
specifications.  The namespace stuff is also the realm of the RDF
specifications.
