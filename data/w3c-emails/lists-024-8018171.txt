Dave and Brian-
  thanks for your recent comments - I will leave it to the editors to 
send specific responses.  Please note that we are in preparation for 
a face to face this week, and working hard to get things ready and 
cleaned up.  It may take a little longer than usual for you to get 
our responses and, if so, I apologize in advance, but they will 
certainly be read and taken into account as appropriate before any 
documents are approved for release by the WG.
  thanks
  Jim H.
