Summary of changes:

I make a lot of stylistic changes which I hope help matters here.
I've added a bunch of links.  I'm going to add more links.

> General comments

I was asked to make this a composite document. There is a
non-normative single-file version.  The single-file version is
machine-generated from the multiple version so they do line up
correctly.  I have also added next (and previous) links to the bottom
of the pages.

This is in progress.  I've added a bunch of links already.  Some of
the links that I want to add are problematic, as the RDF Core WG
documents are not in their final location.

I believe that the sections are integrated.  There are too few links,
however, so I have added some, and will add more.

I've added a lot of these.  I probably need to add more, which will be
done in subsequent passes.

I'll add indications of the important definitions.

Paragraph added.  This table has also been tagged as informative.

This paragraph was removed.

> "RDF graph" link

Will do.  I need to wait on Concepts being published.

I changed over to the XML way.  It is not as nice to look at, however.
I now think that the benefits later in the paper, most of which you
point out, more than balance the reduced readability of the productions.

> P5 "OWL/Lite"
> This isn't defined till 2.3.1 - please make a link.

Done.

> "RDF Schema" link

Will do (or maybe done already).

> P6 "OWL/DL" Isn't defined till later, please make a link.

Done.

Some changes made.

> not the URI-references of the datatypes.  That seems slightly
> confusing too.

I think that it is better to point to the definition.

> No references to XML Schema, or XML schema data type specs as
> documents.

Added.

> You seem to be using the RECOMMENDED etc words with significance.
> Point to the relevant RFC if that is how you are using them.

Changed.

There are reasons to not put all the productions for a nonterminal
together.  It is also useful to use |.  I've changed to uniformly
using | where the productions are together.

Changed to identifier.

This sentence was removed.

Do you mean a reference to the discussion in the document itself?

> "If a URI reference is a datatype, i.e., the URI reference points to
> an XML Schema datatype, as described above"
> This sentence seems to imply all datatypes are XML Schema datatypes

Modified.

Done.

> "In OWL, as in RDF" => add a reference

Will do.

> an example of the oddness of ID as I read it.  Surely that is just 
> the same as "The class with identifier/URI reference owl:Thing" or just

I changed "ID" in the text to "identifier".

> Section 2.2
>

Done.

Will do.

> Here you use lots of brackets in <propertyValue> rather than just
> repeat the terminal, as you did in 2.1 for <directive> and

See above.

> "the full abstract syntax types can be general descriptions, "
> Whoa.  Where did that come from?   

``full'' is used here only to distinguish from the Lite portion.  I've
changed the wording.

> full abs syntax", or is this Section 2?  Does it have a name?  Full OWL,

This is confusing, so I'm changing to OWL/DL throughout.

The indenting was improved.

This is in the vocabulary index.

This is in the vocabulary index.

The document is split by section.  I'll add links to the end of each
section.

Will do.

The syntax change makes this less a problem.

Explained.

Fixed, I think.

Done. Done. Will do as appropriate.

Will be done.

Done.

Done.

Will do.

The semantics table makes it hard to do the exactly correct thing.
This is close, in that it covers all the syntax, and gives the correct
meaning to all axioms.

Will do.

These have been more-heavily emphasized.

Added.

I have been told not to refer to N-Triples, as they are only
internal.  I'm using the syntax from the RDF MT, which is different.

I've added some stuff.

The new EBNF helps.

> P5 "0." - typo?

I'm not sure what this was, but I can't find any "0." now, so I guess I
fixed it. 

> P8 new terminology, <> is a document reference URI.

I'm using a different thing for this now.

Done.

...

All <> are now gone, except where they are additional parts of the
transformation.

This should be somewhat better now.

Fixed.

Done.

Done.

I don't believe that these definitions need more emphasis as they are
only used in this section.

> The triples in-line in sentences
> don't read too well, I'd suggest pulling them out:
> "of the form  x owl:oneOf rdf:nil . or  x owl:oneOf is . where i"

I'll probably use a particular style to show them off better.

Will do.

> these all must be satisfies.

Where this is so, I've made sure that there is explicit wording.

> Is this paragraph of much use?

This is the wording that I expect to be used elsewhere.  I'm including
this here just as a general indication of what is going on.

More links will be added.

Will do.

The semantic definition of OWL/Full is here.  A good place to point
would be to the Reference document.

> Section 5.2
> <> are tuples again

The changes to the EBNF result in many fewer <>s.

I've put some text around them.

I'll consider this.
