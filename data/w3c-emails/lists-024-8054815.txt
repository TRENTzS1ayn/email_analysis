Brian,

Thanks for your elaborate review. See for comments inline.
The review was very helpful and has contributed to substantial
revision of the document.

The revised version will become available within a couple of days as an
editor' draft. We will let you know when that happens.

Guus

Refs from abstract have been removed. RDF concepts document is cited
at the first place where RDF is mentioned in the running text.

This was an error. It now reads: "An OWL ontology is in fact a set of
triples".

This sentence has been removed and the section has been rewritten (see

Currently, all version statements have no logicakl meaning except for
the RDF meaning. This is now explcitly mentioned in the document.

This has been completely rewritten. These sentences do not occur
anymore. See Sec. 7 on Datatypes.

This sentence now does not mention class equality, but just states
that such cyclic staements have the effect of enforcing the same class
extension for both classes.

A WG decision has been made to rename "sameClassAs" to
"equivalentClass". All documents will be updated to reflect this. The
documents will make explcit statements about
the difference between
class equality (the same concept, the same intensional meaning) and
class equivalence (the same values, in this case the same class
members).

All this stuff has gone:

"sameAs" is a synonym of sameIndividualAs (this was a decision of a
while ago, but was never properly reflected in the document).
This is the "real" eqiality relation. sameAs has individuals as its
domain and range, so class equality can can only be exoressed in OWL
Full (which allows treating classes as individuals).

W.r.t. "samePropertyAs": this has (in a similar vein as sameClassAs)
been renamed to equivalentProperty, with a similar meaning (same
property extension / set of tuples/pairs/instances).

Wording has been changed.

Has been changed to owl:Class

In many places in the document this change from "the class" to "a
class" has been made.

Wording has been changed for both to rule out other types of mebers.

See above.

In a number of places URI has been changed to URT reference.

Yes, see above.

It is now called a data range.

No. Changed.

Chaged , as above.

This part has been completely rewritten.

This part now points to the relevant RDF documents, and discusses OWL
specifc aspects of using these (e.g. using class descriptions for domain
or ranges).

See earlier remark, now renamed to equivalentProperty

No, see earlier comments.

In the revised owl.owl it says:

owl:sameAs equivalentProperty sameIndividualAs .

Comments in owl.owl were out of date and have for the moment been removed.
We'e considering putting them back, but in the form of isDefined
links (this requires some semanitc problems to be solved.).
