Dear Pat

Your response is clear and satisfactory, and sums up clearly a few 
exchanges I had about it since the question was set, through which, I 
hope, my understanding of the debate about URIs as names vs 
URIRefs linked to a particular addressing protocol has clarified a 
bit. It figures interaction between OWL and Subject Indicators might 
turn out to be less obvious than what I imagined a few months ago. 
But I still hope to come out with some proposal about it.

Thanks for your time
