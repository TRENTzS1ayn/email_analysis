Dear Sandro,

Thank you very much for this detailed answer.

That's definitely good. We plan to have a long period for the Ops and 
Spec Guidelines to test their implementations with the WG and so to 
know how to address some issues. The QA Framework will be effective 
only with the participation of every people implied in the WG life 
and specification editing.

not exactly. I read the others but didn't comment on it, because I 
was short on time. But I will explain how my comments relate to each 
parts.

OK. I agree with your answer, except for a detail.

http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/#s1.1
In this part of OWL Web Ontology Language  Overview, you do not make 
references to the Tests Spec which contains the tests very useful and 
also the Conformance section.

Maybe I have missed something, but I tried to reach the "Test spec" 
from the different specs and I was unable to find them, which is bad 
because it's not very helpful for developers and diminishes the 
importance of the work of Jeremy Connell, who has given a lot of 
himself inside this work.

The way I see it (not mandatory) it's a kind of Master documents 
which articulates the different section (spec) of your ontology 
framework. So in each spec you could refer to this master document. 
"OWL Web Ontology Language
Overview" seems to be the right place for that, though I would move 
the conformance section from the Test Spec to the  Overview one.

I tried to think as a user who's navigating through the specs and 
wants to access all the information.

GrantedSpec as a whole if the Overview is really the 
entrance to the OWL framework.

1.1 yes
2.2 yes
3.4 yes
3.5 yes
10.1 yes
13.1 yes
13.4 NO. see my point above... it's very difficult to find the test
Case and conformance document
14.1 is a bit tricky. Test Assertions are not test cases.
I'm still not sure about it.

Maybe the QA WG can give an opinion on that.

14.2 conditional to 14.1
2.3  yes

So you see in fact it's not so difficult. The QA Framework seems 
hard, but it's just a very modular way of applying it to your spec.

All my yes are conditional to the Granted comment before.

ok
For example XHTML Modularization has an extension mechanism.
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xhtml-modularization-20010410/introduction.html#s_intro_whatismod
They describe how you can extend.
They define the notion of validity and Hybrid document types.

For XSLT 2.0, you have a whole chapter dedicated to it.
http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#extension
When we say extensions are bad, it's because it can lead to 
not interoperable technologies, but the nature of the web for 
certains technologies like OWL is in part the extensibility.
So it's what we recognize this fact but encourage people to 
define it, under which conditions, and to ask other people to declare 
what they do, when they create an extension.

ok waiting for the email. Fine by me.  I have seen it was done in one 
of your documents.

Thank you very much Sandro and all the people of the OWL WG. It's 
very useful. I hope it will be beneficial as it is for the QA WG.
