Another question, this time about unsupported datatypes.

In the reference doc, it says:

"For unsupported datatypes, lexically identical literals should be
considered equal, whereas lexically different literals would not be
known to be either equal or unequal. Unrecognized datatypes should be
treated in the same way as unsupported datatypes."

The first half of the sentence would suggest to treat a literal of
unknown type as just a string. However, I am not entirely sure what is
expected from a reasoner with respect to the behaviour of "would not be
known to be either equal or unequal".

Views?

Cheers,
