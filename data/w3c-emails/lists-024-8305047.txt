Richard,

Thanks for your comment and sorry for the late reply.
The domain/range of some of the built-in OWL
properties is left open on purpose:

[[
owl:hasValue      domain: owl:Restriction range:
]]

The object of owl:hasValue can be either an individual or a literal,
not just an individual (as a range of owl:Thing would imply). See
sec. 3.1.2.1.3 of Reference:

[[
The value constraint owl:hasValue is a built-in OWL property that links
a restriction class to a value V, which can be either an individual or
a data value.
]]

[[
owl:versionInfo domain:   range:
]]

The subject of owl:versionInfo is not restricted to a particular
type, see Sec. 7.4.1:

[[
Although this property is typically used to make statements about
ontologies, it may be applied to any OWL construct.
]]

The object of owl:versionInfo is often, but not necessarily, a string:

[[
An owl:versionInfo statement generally has as its object a string ....
]]

Please respond, cc-ing public-webont-comments@w3.org, whether this
response is satisfactory.

Regards,
