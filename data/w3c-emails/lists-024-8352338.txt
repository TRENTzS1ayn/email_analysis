Rigo-
  thanks for your comments to WebOnt about the privacy section in our 
Guide Document.  We have extended our discussion to integrate your 
comments -- here is the wording from the Editor's Draft of the Guide 
document (similar wording in the Editor's Draft of the Reference).
   Please let us know if this satsifies your comment
    thanks
     Jim Hendler for WebOnt

2.3 Data Aggregation and Privacy OWL's ability to express ontological 
information about instances appearing in multiple documents supports 
linking of data from diverse sources in a principled way. The 
underlying semantics provides support for inferences over this data 
that may yield unexpected results. In particular, the ability to 
express equivalences using owl:sameAs can be used to state that 
seemingly different individuals are actually the same. 
Owl:InverseFunctionalProperty can also be used to link individuals 
together. For example, if a property such as "SocialSecurityNumber" 
is an owl:InverseFunctionalProperty, then two separate individuals 
could be inferred to be identical based on having the same value of 
that property. When individuals are determined to be the same by such 
means, information about them from different sources can be merged. 
This aggregation can be used to determine facts that are not directly 
represented in any one source. The ability of the Semantic Web to 
link information from multiple sources is a desirable and powerful 
feature that can be used in many applications. However, the 
capability to merge data from multiple sources, combined with the 
inferential power of OWL, does have potential for abuse. Users of OWL 
should be alert to the potential privacy implications. Detailed 
security solutions were considered out of scope for the Workng Group. 
Work currently underway is expected to address these issues with a 
variety of security and preference solutions. See for example SAML 
and P3P.
