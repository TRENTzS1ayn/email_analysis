The Web Ontology working group reopened deliberations on qualified
cardinality restrictions, but on 8 May 2003 decided to postpone work on
qualified cardinality restrictions.  The official information on this
postponement can be accessed at

This has been added as a Note just before Section 2.1.  To see the change
look in

This is a question that will most likely be answered by developers of
OWL-related systems that include user interfaces.  It is probably easier
for implementors of such systems to internally use a syntax that is close
to syntax that they present to users, and the abstract syntax might be such
a syntax.

It is part of the design criteria of the abstract syntax to

facilitate[] access to and evaluation of the language.  This
particular syntax has a frame-like style, where a collection of
information about a class or property is given in one large
syntactic construct, instead of being divided into a number of
atomic chunks ... [Section 2 of S&AS]

which indicates that a more accessible syntax is better even though that
might somewhat obscure the actual expressive power of the language.

The statement of correspondence between OWL Lite and SHIF(D) should help
here.

OWL Test Cases is a compound document.

No change is likely to be made here.

OFFICIALLY POSTPONED, see above.

DONE, see above.

NOT DONE, but as you say, it is possible to easily access the combined
document.
