I accept this outcome given with two provisos:

1) Some mention goes in the "Changes from DAML+OIL" section:
http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#appD
2) It's made clear that such manipulation of lists puts one 
in OWL full. I'm finding that many people are rather surprised by

Bijan, the editors of the Reference document have agreed to make the 
changes you request above.  (Guus is currently traveling, so it will 
be a couple of weeks until you see them in the editor's draft)
  please let us know if we can close this comment
  thanks
  Jim H.
