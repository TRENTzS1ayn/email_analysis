Ken - as your comments mostly address the Requirements document, I 
asked Jeff Heflin, the editor, to write the response.  However, there 
were a couple of things where he felt the chair needed to be 
involved, so I've done some editing and am sending this - consider it 
a joint effort (but he did most of the work)
  please let us know if you'll accept this response.

We do not believe the Use Cases and Requirements is the right place for
the discussion you desire. To truly explain how OWL meets a particular
requirement would require a detailed description of the relevant
features, duplicating much material from other OWL documents. However, we
can understand how the document might be read in such a way as to lead
to a false impression of the intended capabilities of OWL. In some cases
below, I suggest alternative wordings that should help prevent this
confusion.

Instead, we propose to add:

"These use cases served as a guideline in choosing requirements for the
OWL language (see Section 4). The requirements were chosen based on the
aspects of the use cases that the working group considered most
important, while considering the scope of the OWL charter and other
design constraints. As such, one should not assume that OWL will
directly support every aspect of the use cases."

Okay, we will make this change.

Actually, the use case was talking about defeasible inheritance
reasoning, not probability. Although probability can be clearly of use
in some use cases, the working group did not consider it an important
requirement, although support for probabilistic information is implied
by Requirement R12. Attaching Information to Statements. However, 
you are right that the "typically" is misleading here, and therefore 
we will change this to read
"...a `Late Georgian chest of drawers', in the absence of other 
information, would be assumed to be `made of mahogany.'  This 
knowledge ... "
which we agree will be less misleading.

Good suggestion. We will make the change.

Given our revised statement to the opening of section 2 and the fact that
fuzzy reasoning is not in the list of requirements, we'd prefer not 
to add such a statement.

We will change the paragraph to:

"This type of agent requires domain ontologies that represent the terms
for
restaurants, hotels, etc. and service ontologies to represent the terms
used in the actual services. These ontologies will enable the capture of
information necessary for applications to discriminate and balance among
user preferences. Such information may be provided by a number of
sources, such as portals, service-specific sites, reservation sites and
the general Web."

Excellent change. We will make it.

We agree that doing what you ask here would be a useful thing to 
have, but doing it right would go well beyond the scope of this 
requirements document (and will be the job of those who write the 
eventual OWL books).   However, it is the case that a way to track 
where each of our objectives and requirements are discussed in our 
documents would be useful.  During the CR period we will endeavor to 
produce this mapping and consider including it in as an Appendix to 
this or one of our other documents.

This is a good idea, we'll accept it although slightly changing the 
wording to be more consistent with the remainder of our document:

"Design goals describe general motivations for the language that do not
necessarily result from any single use case. Along with the use cases,
these motivate the requirements and objectives in Sections 4 and 5. In
this section, we describe eight design goals for the Web ontology
language, in particular those dealing with:
  - using established ontologies
  - changing established ontologies
  - integrating established ontologies
  - detecting inconsistencies across ontologies and instances of use
  - providing a balance between expressivity and scalability when
creating
  ontologies
  - avoiding unnecessary complexity which may discourage widespread
adoption
  - maintaining compatibility with other standards
  - supporting internationalization
For each goal, we describe the tasks it supports and explain the
rationale for the goal. We also describe the degree to which RDF and RDF
Schema supports the goal."

We think this is redundant with sections 3.2 and 3.3 and would prefer 
not to add it.

The degree to which this design goal influenced our design can be
discovered by looking at what requirements it motivated. In this case it
is: R7. Class definition primitives, R8. Property definition primitives,
and R14. Cardinality constraints. It also motivates objectives O3, O4,
and O14.

For this particular case, we do not believe that the Requirements 
document is the right place for this discussion.  In particular, the 
intent of the overview document was to provide more of such 
discussion, and we think that it is addressed well there.  Thus, we'd 
prefer not to add this discussion again here.

The details of how we meet this objective are discussed in great 
detail throughout the guide and the overview document - thus, what we 
proposed above, tracking which requirements and objectives are 
handled where, should help with this.

The working group did consider adding this in response to an earlier 
comment , but decided not to (see the reply Dan Connolly sent at 
[1]).  There are some syntax issues that make it difficult to express 
the way you propose above.  However, there is a workaorund where one 
does not need the N^2 statements, as described by Ian Horrocks in 
[2], and we will add a pointer to that to our issues list to make it 
clearer what to do when the number of classes is large.
