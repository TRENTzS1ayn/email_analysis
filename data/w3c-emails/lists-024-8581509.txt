Sure, I'll move the naming discussion to the rdf-logic list, but that was only 
the first part of my comment.

The second was that I, at least, was confused about whether (in OWL-DL)
owl:Class'es are owl:Thing's. I thought the idea is that they're not, but then 
I came across the "Class instances are all OWL objects" statement (AS&S, Sec 
5.2, see below). What does this mean? Does this mean owl:Class'es _are_ 
owl:Things? Or does it mean they're both in the range of owl:ObjectProperty 
(contrary to the range given)? And if not, then what subclass of Property 
includes rdf:type? Some class there's no name for?
