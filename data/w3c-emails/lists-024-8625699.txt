Dave - Jeremy Carroll points out that a different previous response 
was more responsive to your question:

We agree that there may be cause for concern, but note that the changes
>requested would minimally require a major rework of the direct semantics of
>OWL DL. (Section 3 of S&AS).

>We have created a new issue and postponed it, so that a future group may,
>with
>the benefit of deployment experience, assess whether these concerns were
>legitimate, and whether the quantity of work required to attempt to address
>this issue is motivated.
>
>We are still considering relaxing some of the constraints on bnodes
>corresponding to class expressions; however, this does not seem to be your
>main concern. We will notify you of any change.
