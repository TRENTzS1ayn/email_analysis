Thanks for your messages concerning the relationship between classes and
individuals.  I've taken the liberty of revising and rearranging your
messages to just select the relevant parts for the comment.

I agree that the use of ``object'' here is misleading.  I've made several
editorial changes to the document, which you can see at
http://www-db.research.bell-labs.com/usr/pfps/owl/semantics/, to replace
several uses of ``object'' with ``individual''.  This results in the use of
object (by itself) for only the objects of triples.  Individual is then
used to refer to elements of the domain of discourse that can be instances
of OWL classes.  Instances of ObjectProperty are referred to as
individual-valued properties, which is longer but more precise, and
consistent with usage from Section 2.

Not changed is ObjectProperty itself, which is somewhat of a misnomer, but
is the result of considerable working group discussion.

Changes have been made to Section 2.3.1.2, 2.3.2.3, Appendix A.2.  The most
changes, however, have been made to Section 5.2.  In particular, 
``Class instances are all OWL objects.'' has been replaced with ``Instances
of OWL classes are OWL individuals.''   This should make it clear that it
is not OWL classes that are OWL instances in OWL DL, but that instances of
OWL classes are OWL individuals.  In OWL DL individuals (IOT) and classes
(IOC) are disjoint.

Please reply to public-webont-comments@w3.org indicating whether this 
resolution is satisfactory.
