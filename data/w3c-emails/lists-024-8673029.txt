Jim,

Thank you for your response to the Jena team comments on these issues.
Overall this response is not (yet) acceptable. 

(a) Issue: Named data ranges
     Your response: postpone

We understand that the working group cannot name user-defined XSD datatypes 
and that matter should be raised with the XML Schema working group.

Our concern was more one of uniformity - it seems possible to have both 
named and unnamed classes, why not data ranges? The more uniform a language 
is, the easier the API and the fewer the support calls.

As an example could this:

<owl:DataRange rdf:about="#MyDR">
    <owl:oneOf>
       <rdf:List>
         <rdf:first>foo</rdf:first>
         <rdf:rest rdf:resource="&rdf;nil"/>
       </rdf:List>
    </owl:oneOf>
</owl:DataRange>

be included in OWL DL, for greater uniformity with other unnamed things in 
OWL DL (which can optionally be named).

I confess to not understanding the research problems that you refer to as 
being raised by naming data ranges. If there is some non-trivial problem 
here then we certainly accept this is not a sufficiently important issue to 
warrant additional research at this stage in the process.

Has the WG discussed this question?
None of the three links you gave seemed directly related to our request:
[1]
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/webont-issues.html#I5.8-Datatypes
[2]
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/webont-issues.html#I4.3-Structured-Datatypes
[3]
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2002May/0040.html


(b) Issue: bNodes as object in multiple triples
     Your response: no change due to lack of working group consensus

The links you gave were all to the discussion before the last call.
Please give an indication of the WG discussion of this issue in response
to last call comments.

Specifically you said:
[[
The WG was concerned that the handling of blank nodes has not yet been 
shown to be able to be handled in the correspondence proof of Appendix A of 
the Semantic Document [6].
]]
However the following messages claim to provide such a proof:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2003Jun/0294
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-webont-wg/2003Jun/0017

If this proof is indeed in error an analysis demonstrating the error could 
supply the test case that we requested.
   [[
   A rationale for not permitting this in OWL DL
   should be given, preferably as a test case in OWL Full
   showing an OWL Full non-entailment that would hold in
   OWL DL if such triples were permitted.
   ]]


(c) Issue: cycles of bNodes
     Your response: postpone

Your follow up response was disappointing but acceptable.
