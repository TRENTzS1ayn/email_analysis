             EXTENDED DEADLINE : June 30

---------------------------- * -----------------------------

                  Semantic Web Services for
              Enterprise Application Integration
                  and e-Commerce (SWSEE03)

         Workshop held in conjunction with ICEC 2003

              Pittsburgh, PA, September 30, 2003

Scope
=====

The workshop "Semantic Web Services for Enterprise Application
Integration and E-Commerce" focuses on the proposed intersection of
three domains that very recently started drawing enormous attention
throughout academia and industry and is of utmost importance as well as
relevance for computer science and the business world:

* Web Service Technology (manifested through SOAP, WSDL and UDDI)
* Semantic Web Technology (manifested through ontology-based modelling
   framework such as RDF, RDFS, DAML+OIL and OWL)
* Enterprise Integration (manifested through Enterprise Application
   Integration (EAI) and E-Commerce in form of Business-to-Business (B2B)
   Integration as well as Business-to-Consumer (B2C)).

The currently brought forward 'promise' is that Semantic Web Services,
i.e., Web Service technology in conjunction with Semantic Web
technology, will make dynamic Enterprise Integration and Virtual
Enterprises possible for all types and sizes of enterprises compared to
'traditional' technology like Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) or Value
Added Networks (VANs).

These strong promises raise a series of questions: to what extend are
these different technologies already integrated today? How does the
combination of those technologies look like? How does this combination
make the Enterprise Integration problem easier to solve and the solution
more reliable?

'Traditional' technologies exist (in some cases for over 30 years) and a
lot of progress has been made over time due to the lessons learned in
real world and sometimes large scale deployments. Today, the major
problems of Enterprise Integration in form of EAI and E-Commerce are:

     * Endpoint Discovery
     * Semantic and Syntactic Unification
     * Interaction Protocols
     * Message Security and Trust Relationships
     * Process Management
     * Integration Standards
     * Legacy Application Connectivity

Traditional technologies are able to address individually all these
major problems today; they can implement predictable and reliable
Enterprise Integration. However, Semantic Web Technologies may have the
potential to lay the foundations for frameworks seamlessly addressing
these requirements as a whole, at the semantic level and relying on
unified standards.

The workshop seeks contributions that address the Enterprise Integration
problems with the new technologies. Submissions are sought that address
specifically the intersection of Web Service Technology, Semantic Web
Technology and Enterprise Integration. It is the goal to show the
relevance and applicability of the new integration technologies in that
they provide a 'better' solution to well-understood problems in the EAI
and E-Commerce space.

Contributions are encouraged to make a very good and well-founded case
for the new technologies based on rigorous and solid arguments. However,
contributions that are critical in nature based on a solid argumentation
and also state the deficiencies that have to be overcome are equally
welcome. Case studies that are very detailed are encouraged, too, in
order to show the applicability of the new technologies.
