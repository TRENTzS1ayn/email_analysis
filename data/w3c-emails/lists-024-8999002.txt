Here is a reply for the unanswered issue in your message.

The newest editor's draft of S&AS (of 4 June 2003, available at
http://www-db.research.bell-labs.com/usr/pfps/owl/) has a new Section 3.4
that should satisfactorily address this issue.

The basic change is that the interpretation of Ontology Annotations is done
in an environment where there is a resource for the ontology, named or not
as evidenced by the following wording:

there is some o &isin; R such that 
for each Ontology Annotation of the form
<span class="syntax">Annotation(</span>p v<span class="syntax">)</span>,
&lt;o,S(v)&gt; &isin; ER(p)
and that if O has name n, then 
S(n) = o;

Please reply to this message as to whether this response is satisfactory,
