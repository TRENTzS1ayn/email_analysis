Here are responses to the remaing questions from your message:

Sections 2 and 3 have been modified to make rdf:XMLLiteral a built-in OWL
datatype and rdfs:Literal not a built-in OWL datatype.  Data ranges now
include rdfs:Literal as a special case.  VD is then the built-in OWL
datatypes plus rdfs:Literal.  This has no real effect on the semantics.
You can see the revised document at

Datatype theories could include more than the built-in datatypes.  However,
there would have to be a private understanding as to the meaning of these
datatypes, as OWL has no mechanisms for providing such meaning.
