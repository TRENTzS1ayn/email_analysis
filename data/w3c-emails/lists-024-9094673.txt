Discussion of whether and how to specify mappings between OWL abstract
syntax and RDF graph syntax is the subject of this issue:

  5.26-OWL DL Sytntax
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/webont-issues.html#I5.26-OWLDLSyntax

The working group discussed various alternatives, but eventually
decided, 27 March 2003, on the design in the last call document.
Note the outstanding dissent:

  5.26 OWL DL Syntax - Formal Objection

While the points in your comment are well-made, they don't seem
to provide new information which would justify reopening
the issue.

You may be interested in continued related work, meanwhile...

You may be interested in some related work by individuals in the
working group:

Parsing OWL, Sean Bechhofer, University of Manchester, June 02 2003
http://wonderweb.semanticweb.org/owl/parsing.shtml
 
While this doesn't provide an actual specification of the reverse
mapping, it does "describe a basic strategy that could be used ...
to construct an OWL ontology that corresponds to the triples
represented in the RDF"

In order to clarify the path from RDF to OWL DL,
informative section is being added to the OWL Reference:

  Appendix E. Rules of Thumb for OWL DL ontologies
  http://www.daml.org/2002/06/webont/owl-ref-proposed#app-DLinRDF

Note that "non-deterministic" does not mean "not completely specified";
it just means "not 1-1"; i.e. one abstract syntax structure corresponds
to a number of RDF graphs. For example, for the intersection
of classes A, B, and C, it doesn't matter what order they appear
in an RDF collection.

Taken literally, your request is to specify that exactly one RDF
graph is allowed for any OWL abstract syntax structure. Could
you confirm that this is what you're suggesting? It seems unlikely.

Please let us know if you find this response satisfactory.
