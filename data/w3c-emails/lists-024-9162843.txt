Alan- thanks again for raising this issue.  I, personally, will 
encourage people (and invite you as well) to work on the publication 
of a Note that explains QCRs and how they could be added to OWL once 
we get the current version out the door.  I appreciate your being so 
understanding of the complexity of the undertaking to develop this 
recommendation.
