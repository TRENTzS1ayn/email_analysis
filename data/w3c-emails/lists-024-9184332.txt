David-
  For what it is worth, the paper you cite is just the authors' 
opinions, not necessarily that of most of the others working on the 
Semantic Web.  Personally, I would suggest you ignore it as far as 
practical impact goes - but my "scruffy" opinions on this issue have 
long been a matter of the public record.

Hi,
I'm an italian student of computer science and I'm interesting in OWL 
and Semantic Web. I've written time ago an e-mail in
<mailto:www-rdf-logic@w3.org>www-rdf-logic@w3.org mailing list on the 
problem of layering the languages for the Semantic Web. I asked how 
RDF and RDFS
are in relation with OWL, and how they work well togheter....
The situation seemed quite clear but now I've read in [1] that the 
problem is not solved. Rather there are now more thesis for the 
layering of the languages and RDF/RDFS seems to be problematic. In 
the article I've understood that the approach using First Order Logic 
insted of RDF/RDFS is better but is now problematic because it's too 
late for a change of this type.

I'm very confused and I don't understand why only now these problems 
arise, what's happen?
What's the real situation of layering? Can these problems are serious 
for the realization of Semantic Web?

I need more informations about it. Where can i find them? Someone can 
tell me why only now this problem arise?
Does the layering of the Semantic Web will change in the future? ( 
FOL instead of RDF/RDFS ..)

It's like a shock.... :(

Thank you very much for your answers,
Davide.
