Danny- Thanks for your email about the presentation syntax Working 
Draft.  I have written a long reply, but have taken the liberty of 
moving it to www-rdf-logic, which is also a public mailing list. This 
will help people who want to follow this thread without being 
inundated with responses to last call comments on our previous 
documents and avoid confusion with the current Last Call on the Test 
document.
  The thread on RDF logic can be found at:
   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-logic/2003Jun/0046.html
for those wishing to continue this discussion.
