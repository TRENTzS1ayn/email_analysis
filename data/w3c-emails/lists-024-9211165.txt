I've taken a quick look at the OWL XML presentation syntax at

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/NOTE-owl-xmlsyntax-20030611/

and it actually doesn't look that different from the RDF/XML syntax.
It would be useful if the document contained an appendix listing the
differences.  That might clarify why it was felt necessary to produce
an alternative XML serialization.

   The issue about whether to have an XML presentation has been in 
   our publicly available issues list since Oct 2002...
   ... if you search on "XML presentation syntax" you will find close
   to 150 messages dating back to May 2002...

The note I'm recommending would save me from reading those 150 messages.
