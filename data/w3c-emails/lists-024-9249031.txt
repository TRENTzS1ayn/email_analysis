Thanks for taking the time to comment on the spec;
sorry for the delay in responding...

In section 5.3. Disjoint Classes in the Guide, you can see
an explanation of the topic...

  The  A common requirement is to define a class as the union of
  a set of mutually disjoint subclasses. 

  -- http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/#DisjointClasses

it goes on to explain the details of exactly how to do it.

A special language construct for this is the subject of
issue 5.21 drop disjointUnionOf
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/webont-issues.html#I5.21-drop-disjointUnionOf

We decided, 24 Oct 2002, to drop the special construct because...

  The only thing going for owl:disjointUnionOf is that it uses
  fewer triples than the alternative. However almost all disjoint
  unions are small so the number of owl:disjointWith triples will not
  be that large. [...] 

Unless we have new information, information that the working
group didn't have at the time we made our decision, we prefer not to
re-open issues. The points you raise in your commenst are a good
ones, but they don't seem to be new.

Please let us know if you find the explanation in the Guide
and the rationale for the decision not to adopt a special
construct satisfactory.
