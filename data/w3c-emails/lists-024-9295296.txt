Yeeess. I think that's right.

Qualified cardinalities right?

FWIW, I think this is a huge issue for many existing daml+oil users. I 
worry that people will just try to use the daml vocabulary with OWL, 
which seems icky.

I strongly disagree. S&AS is, in my opinion, reasoner implementors will 
go, especially those interested in implementing complete reasoners. 
That was my experience, and I lost a LOT of time trying to figure out 
how OWL lite was lighter than SHIF(D) (in a substantial way) and how 
that made anything easier.

I would suggest that there be an "implementors note" break out box 
somewhere early in S&AS, prolly toward the end of the Abstract Syntax 
presentation. It could say something like:

*****
IMPLEMENTORS' NOTE: OWL Lite and OWL DL closely correspond to the 
description logics known as SHIF(D) and SHION(D), with some limitation 
on how datatypes are treated. The abstract syntax for  OWL Lite doesn't 
contain many of the common explicit constructors associated with 
SHIF(D), but the expressivity remains.

I actually can't think of a better place to put it.

That explains why in the *concrete* syntax, but not in the *abstract* 
syntax. I.e., why not
represent multiple subclassings as the subclass of an intersection (in 
the abstract syntax)?

I mean, I could imagine that it would complicate the mapping to 
triples, but I don't see off hand.

Are ANY users (as opposed to implementors) going to look at the 
abstract syntax, or S&AS for that matter? If so, I would suggest that 
S&AS should be made convenient for implementors, not end users. That 
you have to use natural language to explain something that could easily 
be directly expressed in the abstract syntax makes the abstract syntax 
a bit less useful.

Right, and that's fine for OWL lite, but it doesn't explain bubbling up 
these restrictions to the Abstract syntax level.

I would accept language along the lines I gave above. My favored 
solution would be a more explicit abstract syntax, but that's probably 
too much work. But then there *really* needs to be a blocker of the 
misunderstandings that in my own experience, and from that of my 
students, are far too easy to make.

Er...but none of the other documents, afaik, either in webont or 
rdfcore are compound. Few if any, again afaik, modern W3C recs are 
compound. I would have thought that that would be determinative :)

Not a biggy, but it does annoy me each and every time. And I often 
forget that it's compound and thus load up only the first page and find 
myself off line with not what I wanted. Oh well. Bookmarking the single 
file will work. But I predict other people's annoyance.

CardinalityQ: need to wait
Adding "Implementors' note": I will be satisfied if something like this 
is added. I won't be if not. I think
S&AS is exactly the right place for this information and it doesn't 
seem like a large change.
Single HTML file: Looking at: http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/#Large, 
I'm not convinced that S&AS is actually "large" enough to count as a 
large one. It certainly doesn't need
compression to facilitate download in most circumstances. But I guess 
if it is "large", then
as long as the other advice is followed, I can't strongly object. I 
might then object that similarly
long documents *aren't* broken up.
