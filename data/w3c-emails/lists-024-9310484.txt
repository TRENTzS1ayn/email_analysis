Sorry this is an acronym for "Positive Entailment Test".

Ok, I understand that 
"http://www.w3.org/2002/03owlt/SymmetricProperty/premises001#premises001#path"
is not a valid URI, and if I read the "RDF/XML Syntax Specification" 
correctly, the fact that "a fragment identifier is transformed into a 
RDF URI Reference by appending the fragment identifier to the in-scope 
base URI" means I have to extract the fragment identifier "#path" from 
the identifier before concatenating it with the base URI.

Thanks.

Fab.
