Richard - I am a bit confused about this comment.  I agree with what 
you say above, but you are bringing up this problem in the context of 
as RDFS description of owl -- and RDFS has no way to directly express 
identity (other than using the same URI) instead one must create 
something like what we have done below -- making two things 
subproperties of each other.  In OWL we would be able to do what you 
want, but the appendix you are asking about was designed to be an 
RDFS document.  That is, Owl certainly has the ability to express 
identity directly.  For example, I can say

:JohnKennedy a person.
:JackKennedy a person.
:JohnKennedy owl:sameAs :JackKennedy.

So I see that we can do exactly what you ask, we just can't put it 
into the appendix you're asking it to go in, because that appendix is 
written in the less expressive RDFS
