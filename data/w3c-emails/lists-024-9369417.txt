Dave,

The role of the RDF Schema is to give ontology builders and tool
developers structured information about the OWL vocabulary.
In Sec. 1.7 the role of Appendix B is explained as follows:

[[
Appendix B contains an RDF schema for the OWL language
constructs. This schema provides information about the OWL vocabulary
in a form that can be understood by RDF Schema
processors. Conventionally, classes have a leading uppercase
character; properties a leading lowercase character. Thus,
owl:Ontology is a class, and owl:imports is a property. Appendix C
gives a tabular overview of all OWL language constructs in terms of
the built-in OWL classes and properties (the latter with their domain
and range).

NOTE: The RDF Schema file for OWL is not expected to be imported
explicitly (i.e., with owl:imports) into an ontology. The schema has
an informative status and is meant to provide the classes and
properties to be used in the RDF/XML syntax. . People that do
import this schema should expect the resulting ontology to be an OWL
Full ontology.
]]

We suggest the second sentence could have been phrased more clearly as
follows:

[[
This schema provides information about the OWL vocabulary that could
be a useful reference point for ontology builders and tool
developers. The restrictions provided by the schema on the OWL classes
and properties are informative and not complete.  Also, this schema
does not make distinctions between OWL Full, OWL DL and OWL Lite.
]]

[The last sentence was moved forward from the NOTE..]

That was sloppy of us. We added the "http://".

The editor's draft [1] contains the suggested changes.

Thansk againg for the comment. Please let us know, cc-ing 
public-webont-comments@w3.org, whether this response is satisfactory.
