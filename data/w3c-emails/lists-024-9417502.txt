into the archives)

Dear Lacy,

Thank you for your comments on the Overview document dated 21 April
(at 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webont-comments/2003Apr/0047.html)

Below is our response.
Our apologies for not responding to these sooner.

> Introduce acronym (RDF-S) after terms "RDF Schema" in first paragraph of
> abstract.
> Change "for" to "to" in first paragraph of section 1.1.
> Change "Owl" to "OWL" in first bullet in section 1.1.
> Change "glossary" to "a glossary" in second bullet of section 1.1.
> Section 3.5's bullet on minCardinality, change "has Offspring" to
> "hasOffspring".
> Section 3.6, first sentence, change "has contains" to "contains".
> Section 4's bullet on unionOf, change "OWL allows" to "OWL DL allows".
> Section 4's bullet on complex classes, change "OWL also" to "OWL DL also"
> and "OWL full" to "OWL Full".

All implemented.

Your reading of our statement is indeed correct,
suggesting to us that no change to the document is needed here.

> The annotation properties listed in section 7.1 of the OWL reference
> document don't appear in the list synopsis for OWL DL constructs in section
> 2.2 of the OWL Guide.

(We assume that in this comment and those that follow,
 you refer to section 2.2 of the OWL *Overview*, not Guide)
We have added the annotation properties to the synopsis table in
section 2.2. of the Overview document, plus a new section 3.9 to list
them and point to the OWL Reference for details.

> The owl:datarange class listed in section 6.2 of the OWL reference
> document didn't appear in the list synopsis for OWL DL constructs in
> section 2.2 of the OWL Guide.

Added.  In the process, we also included owl:DatatypeProperty, which was
also missing.

> The owl:versionInfo property, deprecatedClass class, and deprecatedProperty
> class listed in section 7.4 of the OWL reference document don't appear in
> the list synopsis for OWL Lite constructs in section 2.1 of the OWL Guide.

Added. As a result, we've also rationalised the sections of the table
in section 2.1, and added a new subsection (3.10) on versioning in OWL.

Thank you again for your comments.
Can you let us know (with a Cc to public-webont-comments@w3.org)
whether you are satisfied with our answer?

Frank van Harmelen.
