Brian,

Thanks for your comment. In the post-LC editor's drafts this discussion 
on recommended datatypes has been moved from OWL S&AS to the RDF 
Semantics document.

We suggest the OWL Reference document simply lists the recommended 
datatypes and points for further details to the relevant section of the 
RDF Semantics document.

The link to RDF Semantics currently is:

http://www.ihmc.us/users/phayes/RDF_Semant_Edit_append.html#dtype_interp

but this will be updated at some appropriate later point in time.

Please let us know, cc-ing public-webont-comments@w3.org, whether this 
response is satisfactory.
