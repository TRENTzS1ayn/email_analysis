Peter,

Thanks for your reply to the last call comments. This email contains
comments to your reply and the online editor's draft of the S&AS document
[1].

In section 2.1 of [1],

> The other built-in OWL Schema datatypes are problematic for OWL, as
                              ^^^^^
discussed in the RDF Semantics [RDF MT].

Do you mean the other built-in "XML" schema (instead of OWL schema)
datatypes? And it is not clear to me where in RDF MT can I locate the
discussion about why the datatypes are problematic. It might be easier for
the readers to follow if some more details (e.g. section number in the RDF
MT document) are provided.

I am not sure about this. Usually a URI reference of this form
http://any.domainname/anyxsdfile.xsd#sss will be understood to denote a
user-defined XML Schema datatype named sss.  Even though it is not a
standard way in XML Schema, there is no harm adding that in OWL (implicitly
require that the datatype sss be derived from one of the built-in OWL
datatypes). Or do we want to support more datatypes than XML Schema
datatypes, so we don't like the file extension xsd?

Yep, it is clearer now.

It is good to have more than the built-in datatypes. However, it is not
clear to me how this "private understand" approach works.
