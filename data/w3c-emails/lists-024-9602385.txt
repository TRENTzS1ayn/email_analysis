Can you please link to 1.7 from appendix B.  If you go to the appendix,
there is no path back to that much earlier declaration. Web documents
aren't always read serially!   I didn't see that paragraph.  Words about
the purpose of this section would better live in the section itself.

Some suggestions

In AppB, "The RDF/XML ..." would read better.

It would be nice to know if it is intended to be put behind the
URI &owl; eventually ends at http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl
(or whatever).  That is likely to be the most useful way to
use this document, than appended in a WD, and that
it isn't intended to be owl:imported.

However, overall: this response is satisfactory.

Dave
