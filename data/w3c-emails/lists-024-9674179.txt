Sorry if the previous message was not clear. The class hierarchy is (see 
Appendix B of Reference)

rdfs:Class
     owl:Class
         owl:Restriction
     owl:DeprecatedClass

So, owl:Restriction is a specific kind of owl:Class.

This is true in a weaker sense in OWL Full (owl:Class 
owl:equivalentClass rdfs:Class), but not in OWL DL. See the note in Sec. 
3.1 in the editor's draft of OWL Reference [1]:

[[
NOTE: owl:Class is defined as a subclass of rdfs:Class. The rationale 
for having a separate OWL class construct lies in the restrictions on 
OWL DL (and thus also on OWL Lite), which imply that not all RDFS 
classes are legal OWL DL classes. In OWL Full these restrictions do not 
exist and therefore owl:Class and rdfs:Class are equivalent in OWL Full.
]]

owl:Restriction is not a property, it is a class of which the class 
extension is defined in terms of property constraints. See Sec. 3.1.2:

[[
The class owl:Restriction is defined as a subclass of owl:Class. A 
restriction class should have exactly one triple linking the restriction 
to a particular property, using the  owl:onProperty property. The 
restriction class should also have exactly one triple that represents 
the value constraint c.q. cardinality constraint on the property under 
consideration, e.g., that the cardinality of the property is exactly 1.
]]

 >      owl:DataRange

This is not a property, but a class that can act as a datatype. See Sec. 
6.2:

[[
In the case of an enumerated datatype, the domain value of owl:oneOf is 
a blank node of class owl:DataRange ....
]]

 >      rdfs:Datatype
 >      rdfs:Literal

This is outside the scope of the OWL specifications. I would think this 
is not the case, however.

 >      owl:DeprecatedProperty


Correct, see Appendix B:

[[
<rdfs:Class rdf:ID="DeprecatedProperty">
   <rdfs:label>DeprecatedProperty</rdfs:label>
   <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&rdf;Property"/>
</rdfs:Class>
]]

The WG does not see the rationale for introducing owl:Entity at this 
time. I would suggest the discussion of this issue at the 
rdf-logic@w3.org discussion list.

Thanks again for your comments. Please let us know, cc-ing
