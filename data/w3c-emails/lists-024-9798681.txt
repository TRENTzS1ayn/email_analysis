Hi,
I don't understand why in owl:imports you didn't put an attribute to 
set up a shorthand notation for names of the elements imported.
There is a redundancy between the namespace declarations and 
owl:imports statements like in DAML.... why you didn't add an 
attribute like in SHOE to specify the prefix of the elements? Is 
there a motivation that giustify the redundancy?
Thank you in advance for you answers,
Davide.

Davide - this mailing list is primarily intended, at this point, for 
the Last Call comments on OWL documents - and the last call on the 
reference and semantics closed more than a month ago.  I'm taking the 
liberty of forwarding your mail to ww-rdf-logic@w3.org which is where 
our documents suggest discussion of issues such as this.
