The intro of the appendix now reads:

[[
See Sec. 1.7 for a description of the purpose of this appendix. The 
RDF/XML version of this appendix can be found at 
http://www.daml.org/2002/06/webont/owl

   @@ reference to be replaced in final version by
      http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl

I have  closed this thread for issue-tracking purposes, but please feel 
free to suggest additional editorial changes.
