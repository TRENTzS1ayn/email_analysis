Unfortunately, I don't believe that we can capture this in OWL, as
there is no way to apply a unit to an XML Schema data type, and
certainly not to specify the relationship between two values having
different units.

If OWL supported binary datatype predicates (in fact it only supports
unary datatype predicates), then one way we could do this would be to
define a pair of functional datatype properties called something like
kLength and mLength, and a binary datatype predicate called something
like ratio1.6:1. Then we could make the assertion that
allValuesFrom((kLength,mLength),ratio1.6:1) must be true in all cases
(i.e., subsumes Thing).

Even this doesn't exactly give you the inference you suggested - it
tells you that anything having both a kLength and an mLength that are
not in the ratio 1.6:1 is logically inconsistent.
