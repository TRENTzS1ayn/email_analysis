In http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-guide-20030210/

the Wine example ontology OWL document
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-owl-guide-20030210/wine.owl
is not legal RDF/XML.

It fails to validate with the RDF validator and it reports the error:

229:   <VintageYear rdf:ID="Year1998">
230:     <yearValue rdf:type="&xsd;positiveInteger">1998</yearValue>
231:   </VintageYear>

You can't give a literal a type like that.  You can give it a RDF
datatype with the rdf:datatype attribute - I expect that is what you
meant.  The RDF validator may not pick that up since it is out of
date; there are several separate tools you can use to check this.
