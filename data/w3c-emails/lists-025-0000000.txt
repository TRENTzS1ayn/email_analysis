I agree.

We have different opinion on how much capabilities we want in the 
language in terms of what it can describe. Some want a language that is 
only capable of expressing shared states that are general enough but 
satisfactory for most B2B use cases. Others want more capabilities that 
*in addition* to the above and not as replacement, also support more 
complex scenarios, e.g. the ones you would see in A2A or optionally 
exposing part of the white/black box.

We can go either way, but if we fail to consider the importance of the 
"glue" requirement, I have the feeling we will end up with a superb 
specification that has no practical use.
