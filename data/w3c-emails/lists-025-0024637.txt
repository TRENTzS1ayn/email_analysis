Here "observable behavior" means "message exchanges". Right ?
"Observable" also means "observable by at least two roles that are 
exchanging messages".  It doesn't mean observable to all roles.  Right ?
I think "Timeout" is an observable thing.  Basically, if you haven't 
observed message exchange happen within a time period, you have observed a 
"timeout".
