IMO the choreography should be defined in terms of MEPs. That gives us 
the best bang for the money. And we should agree to use the MEPs 
provided by WSDL 1.2, both the pre-defined and extensions that can be 
added in the future.

It then becomes an issue for the implementation to support these MEPs, 
something it has to do anyway whether or not you do that in the 
choreography language. This may be very complicated, or it may be more 
trivial than you think. At least in my experience. I'm sure the 
orchestration languages would be extended to take advantage of WSDL 1.2 
when it becomes a proposed recommendation.

I take it for granted that implementations and other specifications will 
be made to work with WSDL 1.2 and take advantage of the variety of MEPs 
supported by the WSD WG framework. So if we also utilize WSDL 1.2 as the 
basis for the choreography language, our work will be cut out for us.
