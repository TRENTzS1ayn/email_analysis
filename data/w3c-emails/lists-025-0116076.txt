I am wondering whether this "glue" (or silver line, etc) also address the much blamed for Busienss-IT divide issue. I mean, does the discussion around external/internal also apply to solving the use case where - the sole responsibility of IT is to take care of the nitty-gritty of standalone services, and the Business folks are empowered with "building and owning" the dynamic, flexible business processes.

I have seen in numerous recent articles (and books also, see Howard Smith's book, I forgot the name) an outcry for supporting business processes as first class applications and not necessarily to be perceived as a solution for integrating legacy applications. 

In doing so, a critical requirement it seems is that the designer, user and manager of the business processes should be the business folks themselves. I guess we don't expect the business people to read XML language itself, but perhaps we can serve them better by limiting the details when it comes to providing them a limited but complete view.

I agree.

We have different opinion on how much capabilities we want in the 
language in terms of what it can describe. Some want a language that is 
only capable of expressing shared states that are general enough but 
satisfactory for most B2B use cases. Others want more capabilities that 
*in addition* to the above and not as replacement, also support more 
complex scenarios, e.g. the ones you would see in A2A or optionally 
exposing part of the white/black box.

We can go either way, but if we fail to consider the importance of the 
"glue" requirement, I have the feeling we will end up with a superb 
specification that has no practical use.
