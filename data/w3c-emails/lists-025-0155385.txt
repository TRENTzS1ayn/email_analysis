We don't expect business people to write XML documents, whether it's a 
simple language or a complex one. Nor do we expect them to write 
specifications using some BNF syntax or pseudo code. We expect them to 
use high-end modeling tools with clear visual notation, something that 
makes it very easy to express and communicate intent.

The question is, how do you get that high level representation of the 
business process down to the IT level and ensure that the implementation 
conforms to the business intent? One way to do it is to agree on some 
abstract model that is common to the modeling tool and the execution 
tools, and use XML as a way to transform the key parts of the 
information, i.e. the sequencing rules - colors and shapes are not 
important in the choreography definition.

I mean, does the discussion around external/internal also apply to solving the use case where - the sole responsibility of IT is to take care of the nitty-gritty of standalone services, and the Business folks are empowered with "building and owning" the dynamic, flexible business processes.

I guess we don't expect the business people to read XML language itself, but perhaps we can serve them better by limiting the details when it comes to providing them a limited but complete view.
