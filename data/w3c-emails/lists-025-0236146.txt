I understand the "nested state", basically you breakdown a state into finer 
grain, but this is still mutually exclusive.  You can only be at one of the 
substate.

In David's example, lets say the seller interact with the manufacturer as 
well as the credit check.  In the public state diagram, the seller want to 
express that the purchase order will be confirmed only when the credit 
check passes as well as the manufacturer have the product in stock.

So, does the seller has two non-exclusive states "credit-pass", 
"product-available" ?

or 4 mutually-exclusive states "credit-pass and product-available", 
"credit-pass and NOT product-available" .....

The latter is easier to understand.
