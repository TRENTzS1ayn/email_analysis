Practically speaking, also as far as statechart is concerned, the seller 
has two non-exclusive states that are part of the same parent state. 
Although the startchart chart does not depict this, the statechart model 
actually accomodates for that type of state (aka state variables).

There's one thing to demarcate a state. You do something and you enter a 
state in which you can do other things until you leave that state. 
State-transition diagrams talk about these states. Another thing is to 
have a particular state that does not demarcate any activities, e.g. the 
balance in your account.

Let's say you have 6 products to ship as part of a purchase order. At 
some point in time you have already shipped two products, are currently 
preparing to ship two other products and will later ship the last two 
products. What state are you in?

If you think in terms of binary states, you need an endless number of 
combination to account for such scenarios. On the other hand, you can 
have variable states, a state that is defined by a range of values. For 
example: { shipped=2, shipping=2, remaining=2 }. Along side you can also 
have demarcated states, e.g. "in the process of shipping" which is 
contained in "in the process of fulfilling an order".

The state you are in is usually defined in terms of the possible values 
you can have and also the possible activities you can perform.
