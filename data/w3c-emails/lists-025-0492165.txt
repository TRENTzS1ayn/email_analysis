A fundamental issue here is whether the state transition dependencies
between two or more binary exchanges are to be represented in the
choreographies or are private to the participants.

A buyer-seller relationship may proceed to a certain point before the
seller wants to know that the buyer has credit.  The relationship 
between the buyer-seller choreography and the seller-creditor
choreography can be left entirely to the seller to determine, and will
be reflected in the seller's public state transition at a particular 
point in the process.

In designing choreographies, it would be useful to reflect this
linkage so that it is considered where it might impact the efficiency
of the exchange.  That does not mean that it is necessarily expressed 
in the choreography. At the same time, if the lack of credit results
in a transition to a unique state, then it will be reflected in the
choreography, implicitly.  But the event of learning that the buyer
does or does not have credit does not directly affect the choreography.
