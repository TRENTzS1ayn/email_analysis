Fred,
 
Based on the interest in pi-calculus and the languages that have used pi-calculus as a model (e.g., BPEL, BPML, WSCI), I was expecting that the language produced by this group would be similar to these past efforts. IMHO, such languages are for business people who implement the technology (programmers) and not for the business people who manage and design them. Putting a one-to-one graphical front-end within a tool that has nice usability features will not help with this situation. 
 
The work of OMG through a business process definition metamodel and BPMI through BPMN will provide the abstraction layer that will business users and managers to design, manage, and monitor both internal processes and choreographies. But this kind of work is out of scope for this working group.
 
I know that we haven't fully clarified the scope of work for this group, but from following the discussion and seeing the complexity of the use cases, I wasn't expecting a ready-for-business people language from this particular working group. 
 
-Steve

Steve,
 
I believe the choreography language should express the exchange at the level of abstraction that is appropriate for business people to understand.  This does not mean that the form of expression is appropriate for business people.  I beleive we should focus on the XML form of expression as that is the form that will be appropriate for retrieval from registries and exchanged between potential participants in a web services exchange.  A form suitable for business users should be deferred since this requires different skills and can be done in different ways by different tools without adverse impact on the computational web services protocol specifications and implementations.
 
Fred

I believe that there is another layer of work to be done to create a presentation layer for the business people. If BPEL and BPML are examples of the language that might be developed (in style, not in content), a direct presentation of this kind language will not be suitable for the business user or manager. Especially if the choreography is based on the pi-calculus model. There needs to be a higher level of abstraction for the presentation and then a binding to the lower-level language. Unless this group comes up with an XML language that can be canonically notated and still be acceptable to the business user, then the output of this working group will not address the business user directly. That would be a nice feature of the language, but should probably not be a requirement.

We don't expect business people to write XML documents, whether it's a
simple language or a complex one. Nor do we expect them to write
specifications using some BNF syntax or pseudo code. We expect them to
use high-end modeling tools with clear visual notation, something that
makes it very easy to express and communicate intent.

The question is, how do you get that high level representation of the
business process down to the IT level and ensure that the implementation
conforms to the business intent? One way to do it is to agree on some
abstract model that is common to the modeling tool and the execution
tools, and use XML as a way to transform the key parts of the
information, i.e. the sequencing rules - colors and shapes are not
important in the choreography definition.

I guess we don't expect the business people to read XML language itself, but perhaps we can serve them better by limiting the details when it comes to providing them a limited but complete view.
