I agree. And I think that Assaf should inform us of any other mandatory
"process calculi" concepts we are going to need, based on his work at
BPMI.org developing BPML, and it's practical implementation in n3.

It is absolutely right to identify the problem first of course. Steve, am I 
right that the
primary interest from a W3C perspective is to further the goal of 
distributed computing
on the web. Choregraphy was seen as a key step, not only because it was 
coming up
in other W3C work (arch), but because the B2B community were using that 
term and it
appeared in various specs and papers surrounding BPM standards, such as BPML,
WSCI, WSCL,  BPEL4WS, WSFL, XLANG, BPSS ... The time was right.

The language in the charter speaks of adding precision to WSDL natural language
supplements, and also to support business process integration. It does not 
speak of
BPM or BPMS. May I offer this suggestion, especially since BPEL4WS has not yet
been submitted to this group, and may be submitted elsewhere. Surely, the group
should split into a couple of activities:

1. To look at ALL related specs in the field, and make a compendium of all 
the constructs
they use to support this "choreography". Work should be done to identify 
overlaps,
differences, etc, and to look for the powerful mechanisms that are the 
"simpleness"
you are looking for.

2. Separately, another group make a use case list, as is being done, to 
document
the expected applications. This is quite hard, because the expected 
applications are
only the ones we can think of, and this will be dominated by the difficulty 
people have
had being B2B, BPI etc. There are of course a host of "BPM" applications 
that might
fall outside because when a breakthrough like BPM happens, we just dont 
know what
clients will do. I wonder whether Codd and Date could have predicted ERP. 
However,
such a use case list has to be done. The trouble is, its endless. There are 
a myriad
"choreographies". So we are going to need advice on how to bottom this out, 
from
the p-c theorists. Isn't it something about types, not of values, but of 
behaviors?

3. So we need a 3rd group, a theory group, a group to look at pi-c and 
other process-c
stuff, and to document the experience of groups such as BPMI.org and 
Microsoft, who
have looked into this.

Group 1 can get started right away. They should be people not involved in the
development of the specs, but they need access to the primary spec author in
order to clarify the purpose of the spec.

Group 2 is already started, and I recommend including Customers in this group.
Formally. This would add considerable weight to the W3C effort.

Group 3 is a small group of people already into this p-c stuff. Their job is to
educate the group, succintly, and therefore are really consultants to the 
group.
This would include Assaf, Lucian, Greg Meredith etc.

I see us going forward only in terms of a plan like this. The mailing list 
right full is full of
posts and responses, and this helps, but its not going to get to a result 
very quickly.
Really, I suggest time boxing with a plan and deliverables from the three 
chartered
groups.

Just my suggestions.
