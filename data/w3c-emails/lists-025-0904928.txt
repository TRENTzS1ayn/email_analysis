Greetings,

      I've uploaded (with a little help from my friends) the 0.0 version of
the WS-Chor requirements document to the following URL:

http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/chor/reqs/2003/04/WD-ws-chor-requirements-20030414.html

This version is not headed for the bestseller lists; it's essentially an
outline and some boilerplate text. It has some obvious problems. It does
however, provide us with an initial document. Let the critiques begin!
(Send all flames to dev/null; would-be critics are required to suggest
alternative text.)

This "Spring Fever" edition is intended as a strawman only; some parts of
it may prove controversial. Please read and comment to the mailing list.
Perhaps we can discuss it in this week's teleconference.

Regards,

D-
