Following your comment that "everything" is a process, shouldn't we
expect that any 100% pi-c based solution will follow the same fate of
other "uni-cratic" systems like Java, C, SQL, COBOL, ... i.e. severe
limitations/complexities outside the realm of applications for which
they were designed (e.g. EJBs versus Classes).

From what I can see the web-service architecture has a rich set of
constructs that can only be diluated if everything becomes a "process".

The way I understand the role of ws-chor is to provide a metamodel with
which one can model "choreographies" message exchange between web
services. If there is a requirement for this metamodel to be as simple
as possible, there is also a requirement that this metamodel must be
rich enough such that expressing choreographies does not become "heary".
Of course we can always talk about tool(s) breaking that hearyness, but
then the babel effect comes into place where each tool coming with its
"features" will in essence create semantic island which will make
comparing choreography specifications difficult at best.

With respect to pi-c no matter how I stear at it I don't see an explicit
choreography specification. All I see is the specification of the
behavior of agents which are capable of communicating which each other.
If you take the example: _xy.0 | x(u)._uv.0 | _xz.0, it expresses the
behavior of each agent and the composition "point" but by no means the
"choreography" is "visible" there. Furthermore, pi-calculus seem to be
limited to request/response message exchange patterns (I'd be curious to
know how one would model complex MEPs).

Ultimately, a ws-choreography can and should be expressed in abstraction
of the agents that will implement this choreography and how they will
implement it. 

Respectfully, I would be very interested to know the opinion of Prof.
Milner about whether a choreography specification is already present in
the theory or not, and its relevance with respect to the design and
binding of collaborating agents. Milner took the perspective of
autonomous agent that need to communicate with each other via very
simple protocols, he has not necessarily addressed the problem of
expressing choreographies for which agent will be designed (or
configured). Of course the problem are intimately related but aren't we
looking at the specification (ws-chor) and the implementation (pi-calc)?

Overall what is needed is an appropriate metamodel for web service
choreographies. We should leave the implementation details to the
vendors where some could decide that the best way to implement a given
"side" of the choreography is to use a pi-c interpreter, hence compiling
the choreography into a process definition.

>>You said:

them.

>> >2. Following on in the same theme, using "process seller" and
"process
