I tend to have a different view of these issues (captured to some 
extent in 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-ws-chor/2003Jul/0146.html).  
To respect the autonomy of participants, a choreography specification 
should only specify externally visible behaviour and I would argue that 
it is correct to do so: from the perspective of other participants, 
this is non-deterministic behaviour.  If another participant requires 
visibility of the internal inputs, then those inputs should be made 
explicitly visible in the choreography and we need to find a mechanism 
to do so.  I would also argue that if you distinguish between local 
participant behaviour and interaction behaviour (causal relationships) 
then you do not lose flexibility to add new interactions or local 
behaviour.
