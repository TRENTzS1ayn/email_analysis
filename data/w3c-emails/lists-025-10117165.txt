Arkin, your idea here is very interesting to me.  I try to use an example 
to confirm my understanding ...

Business-level MEP
===============
- Submit PO
- A one-way message (no response is expected at the business level)

MEP SubmitPO {
         role: buyer, seller (implements PO-HandlerPT)
         sequence {
                 buyer invoke seller (operation = submitPO, portType = 
PO-HandlerPT)
         }
}

PortType PO-HandlerPT {
         Operation submitPO {
                 Input: (PO)
         }
}

However, since the PO must be send reliably (ie, it has certain QOS 
requirement).  Therefore, at the implementation level, this "business-layer 
MEP" is build on the RM MEP

Infrastructure-level MEP
==================

MEP RM {
     role: sender (implements RM-SenderPT), receiver (implements RM-ReceiverPT)
     sequence {
         while (no Ack received) {
             sender invoke receiver (operation = sendMessage, portType = 
RM-ReceiverPT)
             switch {
                 case1: {
                     receiver invoke sender (operation = sendAck, portType 
= RM-SenderPT)
                 }
                 case2: {
                     timeout
                 }
             }
         }
     }
}

PortType RM-ReceiverPT {
         Operation sendMessage {
                 Input: (Message, Ack-CallbackAddress)
         }
}

PortType RM-SenderPT {
         Operation sendAck {
                 Input: (Ack)
         }
}

Here is what happens at runtime ...

1) The buyer engage in the SubmitPO MEP when it follows the choreography 
definition and invoke the "submitPO" operation.
2) There is separate QOS requirement specified by the buyer (maybe 
communicate out of band) that the operation must be done reliably.
3) The binding layer (this is what you call the "protocol handler", 
consider it to be the client stub of the POHandlerPT) decides to use the RM 
services.  So it invoke the "sendMessage" operation of the RM-ReceiverPT 
instead (the client stub may encapsulate the business SOAP message inside 
the RM SOAP message).
4) The implementation of sendMessage (at receiver side, which you call the 
"protocol handler") invoke the sendAck operation of the sender side.  At 
the same time, it also invoke the "submitPO" operation of the receiver side.

The key point here is that the binding between the business-level-MEP and 
RM-MEP is captured "somewhere else" (what you call "out-of-band"), so that 
they can essentially decoupled with each other.  This "decoupling" 
introduce tremendously reusability and flexibility and still retain simplicity.

Do I accurately rephrase what you mean ?

Rgds, Ricky
