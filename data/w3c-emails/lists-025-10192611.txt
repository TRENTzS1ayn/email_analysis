I am less in agreement on this point. While I perfectly understand the 
premise and agree with it from one specific perspective, it is not clear 
why there would be a constrast since causality can both occur inside a 
locality, and can depend on things that may be true regardless of 
autonomy or locality.

For example, if we know that a service receives X and replies with Y, as 
a requestor of that service, without violating my autonomy and 
regardless of my location, if I send X I expect to receive Y. I am fully 
autonomous in every respect, and my locality can change, but that 
causality is something I expect to happen, hence define an interaction 
around it.
