I have enclosed some pointers from Hugo to enable us to have a  
meaningful discussion about the atoms of choreography.
The reason for sending these links is to ensure that we are all on the  
same page with respect to MEP's and choreography.
The debate, as far as I see it, has been hindered at least by my lack  
of understanding of what an MEP is and where it might
live.

Cheers

Steve T
