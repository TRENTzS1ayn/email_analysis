The fact that the service user explicitly identifies a single service 
as receiving the X and replying with the Y restricts your options with 
respect to composition.  Extending your example, let us say that 'X' is 
a request for a flight, car, and accomodation and the 'Y' response is 
booking references for each of them.  Distinguishing between the local 
behaviour (requesting X and receiving Y) and the way it is bound to one 
or more service providers allows us to satisfy the request for X using 
a choreography involving distinct airline, car hire and accomodation 
providers without changing the behaviour of the requestor.  We only 
have to change the way that behaviour is bound to one or more providers.

In other words, local behaviour defines your service expectations, and 
the interaction behaviour defines how those expectations are met by a 
particular choreography of service providers.  Note that the service 
providers themselves have a similar view of the interactions, meaning 
they are also able to participate in different choreographies.  For 
example, it would be possible for the airline identified above to sell 
airline tickets with an adventure holiday package using the same 
service interface as that used above.
