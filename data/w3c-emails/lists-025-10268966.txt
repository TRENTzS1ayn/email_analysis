<FAC>While there may be an implicit contract (law), it is not generally 
desirable to pursue the legal channels to enforce it.  It's better to hold 
the shipment until you are sure of being paid (through a highly reliable
and legally enforceable mechanism), rather than ship it and hope you
will get paid without a lawsuit.  So it's desirable to design the
exchange accordingly.
