Fred:
   I may have a slightly funny view of the concept of role; but I 
understand the term in a strictly relative sense: a role is *always* in 
relation to some context.

   From a programming language perspective, roles seem analogous to the 
distinction between parameters of a function and arguments to a 
function call. When a function is called, parameters (roles) are bound 
to actual values (agents). However, within the body of a function, 
parameters are (nearly) always indistinguishable from actual values -- 
or rather an identifier in a function body is treated equivalently 
whether it is a parameter or a local variable.

  In the context of choreographies I see something similar: in a 
`concrete' choreography, there will be identifiers of the agents in the 
choreography. When a concrete choreography is *abstracted* some of 
those names are re-interpreted as parameters and hence as roles. A 
choreography is then *applied* by instantiating some of the roles with 
`real' names; of course, those real names may themselves be role-names 
rather than agent names ... its turtles all the way down.
