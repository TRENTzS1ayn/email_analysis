That's a separate issue. I don't think anyone here is interested in 
defining choreographies in terms of specific services, which indeed 
hinders reuse. On the other hand, we are talking about a choreography 
between services. Even though you write it using generics (e.g. WSDL 
interfaces) so it can be reused, what eventually transpires is a 
choreography between two services. As far as discussion goes it's much 
more fruitful to talk in terms of services interacting.

My expectation from a service is based on what eventually the service 
would do. I would write it in terms of the service interface so I can 
use any number of services, e.g. one or more airlines. But I always 
write what I expect some airline (= some service) to do, hence that is 
part of the causality.


What you said in the previous e-mail is consistent with the mobile 
process calculus model which does indeed deal with autonomy and locality 
(or mobility as it happens) and one of the obvious benefits is reuse and 
composition, just as you suggest in this e-mail.

But that model does also point out to the fact that causality does 
extend across two or more interacting processes, since by defining their 
interactions you are extending the casuality model across the chain of 
interactions.
