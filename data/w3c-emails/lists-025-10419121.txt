Agree except for this bit:

I think you are pretty clear later on that WSDL-level MEP != business 
exchange, but it's not clear in these couple of sentences.

I'm not sure where WSD will go wrt MEPs. There have been proposals at 
one time or another to even further restrict (rather than generalize) 
the MEP patterns in WSDL 1.2, which is the wrong direction IMO - one 
problem with WSDL 1.1 is the somewhat incomplete support for 
asynchronous message exchange patterns. But this is an issue different 
from those WS-Chor is trying to solve, IMO.
