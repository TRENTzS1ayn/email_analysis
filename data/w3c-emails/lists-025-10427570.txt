Dear Colleagues,

I am a bit behind with mail, so someone may have already made this
point, but I would like to suggest that we need (at least) two terms not
just one (agent).  Some other groups have used 'party' and 'role' where
a party is a single administrative domain (at least - I am sure has
other characteristics as well) and can play several roles
(simultaneously, overlapped or sequentially or any combination).  There
can by 'internal' communication between the roles a party plays but all
communications between the roles that different parties play is via
external communications (messages / interactions of direct interest to
the Choreography).

Thus if we do not use these two terms I think we need two which are
their 'moral equivalent'.

Best Regards     Tony

Choreography composition suggestion



So a Web Service Choreography does not choreograph Web services, it 
choreographs agents?
