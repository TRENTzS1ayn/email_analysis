I've had quite a number of requests for web links to the work 
referenced in my previous email.  There is no specific web page, but 
the following links might be useful:

Abstracts for the first two papers with links to full text are at:

   http://computer.org/proceedings/isads/1065/10650187abs.htm
   http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=330560.330666

If you have IEEE and ACM membership, you will be able to download the 
full text.  Unfortunately, copyright prevents me from making them 
publically available on a web site (at least, that is my understanding 
of the copyright agreement) hence the "on request" in my original email.

I've also put the PDF for my PhD up at:

   http://www.whyanbeel.net/phd/phd.pdf

Ciao,
