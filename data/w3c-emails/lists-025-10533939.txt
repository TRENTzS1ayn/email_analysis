Greetings,

        The most recent draft of the requirements document has been 
uploaded to the archive list (still having problems uploading to W3C). 
It's here:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2003Jul/0024.html

        This version is labeled 1.0, and is dated for July 30th, next 
Wednesday, for publication after our next call, based on the group's 
approval. 

        Please review this document carefully. Much has changed since the 
last version. Here's a summary:
* requirements (some 60+) have been added to the document.
* the use cases have been largely rewritten
* references are now available (though not yet footnoted)
* many other changes

        I'd like to ask that the entire group carefully review this 
document with a view to publication on July 30th. The document is not 
entirely ready to be published, there is still some minor publication 
clean up to be done. Otherwise, it's not a bad first working draft of the 
group's requirements.

On behalf of my fellow editors,

D-
