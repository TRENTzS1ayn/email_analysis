Dear Fred,

I quite agree.  I was merely making the point that it has been
emphasised to me that there is in fact always at least an implicit
contract and framework of law in place for 'trade' interactions.
Certainly in designing business processes / interactions one should take
account of the implicit or explicit legal framework and follow best
practice.  Working back from this, in designing the language we should
have some awareness of the fact that this is the way the language will
be used, even though the tools we are providing are technical ones and
contribute to the fulfilment of the 'technical' aspects of the
contractual situation (subject of another mail I sent).  So I think we
are agreed.

Best Regards     Tony

<FAC>While there may be an implicit contract (law), it is not generally 
desirable to pursue the legal channels to enforce it.  It's better to
hold 
the shipment until you are sure of being paid (through a highly reliable
and legally enforceable mechanism), rather than ship it and hope you
will get paid without a lawsuit.  So it's desirable to design the
exchange accordingly.
