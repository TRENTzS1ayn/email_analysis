Kudos and thanks to the editors for getting this out.

A few comments:

re: 4.3 Scalability. One of the requirements I have mentioned is 
re-entrancy: execution of a choreography flow should not block execution 
of another instance of the same flow (e.g. two orders coming in from 
customers should be able to be processed in parallel). (This is in the 
F2F minutes, I believe). This may be purely an implementation issue, but 
we shouldn't preclude it at the spec level, or assume serialized execution.

(This is different from D-CR-040 or D-CR-041 because I'm not talking 
about parallel flows within a choreography, but parallel execution of 
choreography instances).

D-CR-009 is a special case of D-CR-061, I think. Maybe they should be 
grouped together.

Re D-CR-049 (design-time validation): it isn't really clear to me what 
this means. What does "correct behavior" mean at design time? Absence of 
deadlock, or ?

The doc needs a spell check.
