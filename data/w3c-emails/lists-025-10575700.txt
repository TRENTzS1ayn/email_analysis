mm1: Jon, actually there are a few inferences here that are potentially 
lost if you use the alternate .gif you provided. To explain:

    * An agreement is understood prior to entry.
    * At entry, business rules can be applied or the rules can be
      applied dynamically during the process execution:
          o Parallel processing - A dependency exists and the parallel
            processes are combined at the end (quality check applied
            prior to completion).
          o Dependency: See ordering process Jon specifies above
            (quality checks used as a subprocess). Note, that business
            rules are applied at entry.
          o Dynamic: See ordering process Jon specifies above where the
            quality check may or may not be applied during process
            execution.

Therefore, the drawings could be updated.  The simplification Jon did 
only reflects part of that.
