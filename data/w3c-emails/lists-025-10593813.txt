Ok, then I understand that the use case really illustrates two very 
general things:

First, choreography execution may be dependent on business rules (one 
example is a rule that selects a behavior based on the identity of a 
party to the interaction).

Second, the use case also illustrates the combination of a dynamic, 
business rule driven decision into a choreography flow. There could be 
several kinds of combination: parallel processing, dependency, and dynamic.

I notice the latest draft has incorporated some of my proposed text (and 
maybe my diagram, I'm not sure).

I don't want to obsess on this one use case, but I would still like to 
see the following text bits made more clear:

>  Note: In this case, independence is maintained. The Handle Questionnaire is actually executed against business rules during process execution, although it is either path is known prior to execution. Each is a valid path. The business rules related to the quality check are applied 'in' the process, even though a business context rule is applied prior to the order process initiation to maintain process independence.

 >  Note: In this case the business rules are applied first and either 
path is is actually executed before and during process execution. 
Although either path is known prior to execution. Each is a valid path. 
The business rules are applied overall before and 'in' the process.

These are quite opaque to me, although I understand them a bit better 
after Monica's explanation.

"Either path is known prior to execution"? It seems to me the point is 
that the path taken is not known prior to execution, but is dynamic; 
however, the text might suggest the opposite.

Since in the last two diagrams "Handle Questionaire" (should be "Quality 
Check", for consistency?) is in both alternate flows, it appears it is 
not actually optional here, but instead how it is performed can be 
different, depending on some rule. Is this accurate?

I'd suggest some rewording, but I'm not clear enough on the intent. 
Maybe Monica can help.
