I think there might be some truth in this.

That said, there's work being done on extending pi with "session types" 
... roughly speaking these allow protocols to be encoded as the types 
of channels. It's possible that this might be useful approach to making 
choreographies visible in the way you want.

I think this paper,

  http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~vv/papers/stipc.pdf

by Simon Gay, Vasco Vasconcelos and and Antonio Ravara might be helpful. 
Also this one,

  http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~simon/publications/TR-2003-131.pdf

which uses POP3 as an example of a not completely trivial protocol which 
can be encoded in this way.

Cheers,


Miles
