The use case describing a cDI makes clear that it's not executable; in 
fact, it does not even correspond to an abstract processs description 
(in WS-BPEL).

IMO annotation by itself is not problematic - in fact having text 
annotations is a requirement (D-CR-015), which I'd certainly support.

More problematic is the proposal to use prose annotation to replace or 
to abstract away some constructs. Specifically, the proposal to "remove 
control logic from the cDI .. the cDI programmers would have to annotate 
the logic with human readable statements in order to explain their 
intent." (3.2.3.6). IMO this is not something on which we have consensus 
(at least not yet). In fact I think it is possibly in conflict with some 
of the other requirements, such as D-CR-035 and D-CR-038.
