The draft I'm looking at was in SRT's agenda mailing (for some reason) 
and doesn't have diagrams, AFAIK. I'd be happy to review these if I 
could see them.

  Therefore we have:

This is a nice breakdown and it would be nice to have it in the use case 
intro. Do I understand that main difference between "dependency" and 
"dynamic" is that in the first case you are altering the process flow by 
calling a subprocess, and in the latter you are, in effect, re-writing 
the process diagram (adding in some activities). Also, don't both these 
cases really amount to a conditional branch triggered off some flag the 
business rule sets? At least that would seem the most straightforward 
way to accomplish it.

But I am still looking for some text to replace/supplement the two paras 
I found murky .. although with more context I understand them better now.

When you say "business rules unknown prior to entry", unknown to whom? 
Both parties or only one? You could imagine the seller has a rule that 
is not being published to the buyer. Or do you really mean "I am going 
to make up the rules when I get a message - they're determined by 
something outside the choreography, e.g. phase of the moon".

In either interpretation, IMO the third case may be a level of 
complexity that is best omitted here. You can always add more dynamism 
but maybe this use case has enough for illustrative purposes.

My original proposal was to rev the diagrams to say "Quality check" 
because that's what the text says, but your proposal is probably good 
enough.
