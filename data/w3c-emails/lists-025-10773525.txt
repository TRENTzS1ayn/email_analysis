Dave,
You said:

This depends on at which level you are talking about messages. If you are talking at the level of abstract messages (i.e. portType/Interface level in WSDL), then our choreography is based on those message descriptions (this comes directly from our own definition of Web services choreography, i.e. the fact that it is grounded on WSDL) and it should be legitimate to talk about those abstract message formats within the choreography itself.

If you are talking about concrete message formats (after the WSDL interfaces defined in the choreography are bound to specific end points) then I agree with you that the choreography should not depend on them.
