This formulation doesn't help at all IMO.

We're talking about design time, i.e. prior to execution. So what would 
consitute a choregraphy defintion that didn't "work according to 
specification"? I guess it could be syntactically incorrect, i.e. not 
validate according to the specification's schema, but I suspect 
something else was meant by design-time validation.

The requirement is that design-time validation be possible, but nothing 
is said about what a design-time validator might do, or what kinds of 
error it might detect. Without saying this, the requirement isn't 
meaningful IMO. N.b. I am not sure there is a meaningful level of 
validation that can be done prior to execution, on a design language 
complex enough to meet the other requirements.
