If it's fairly simple, and most choreographies are, then you can easily 
do that. If it's more complicated you need to break it down and use 
heuristic and you can tell with some level of confidence. If I can 
determine that it's most likely deadlock free, that's good enough for 
me. It's much better than having a choreography that's prone to deadlock 
and not knowing about it.

Because of the way it's structured, it's easy to analyze it and even 
break it down to different activities and analyze them separately and 
then as a whole.
