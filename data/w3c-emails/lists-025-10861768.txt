Ok .. but back to requirements: what restrictions does D-CR-049 
(design-time validation) place on the choreography language? You 
mentioned one: that it be machine-processable. I guess this rules out 
the suggestion that all decision logic be expressed in human language 
(since machines still don't process that very well). But you are 
stopping short of saying that deadlock be formally decidable (which I 
also do not think is reasonable).
