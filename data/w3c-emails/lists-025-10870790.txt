Some structuring would help. For example, if you can compose (here we go 
again) a choreography definition from smaller components and validate 
them individuallty, that would make validating the entire choreography 
easier.

In my understanding of the requirement list, I would not ask to include 
'deadlocks should be formally decidable'. It's definitely a requirment 
for me as a vendor to be able to do that for a large class of 
choreographies. And I would judge the resulting specification 
accordingly. I just don't know if this should be a formal requirment for 
the language. Maybe other members feel it should.
