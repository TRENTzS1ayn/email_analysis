I agree as long as we actually realize a clear distinction between the
levels and don't blur them. If you write separate specs then you are forced
to do this. If you don't then there are many temptations to take short cuts

David,
 
I would go with a single spec that addresses the three levels of message
description, discusses the role played by each level in the choreography,
and maps these concepts to the two levels WSDL provides. Since levels 2 and
3 are already pretty well understood in the Web services community, I
imagine this exercise should primarily focus on explaining the value of
level 1 and describing its mapping to the other levels.

Ugo 

I agree that this needs clarification. I actually think that we could do
different specs, e.g: 
1. Three specs where there is one spec for each of the three levels 
2. Two specs where either Levels 1 and 2 are combined with a separate Level
3, or Levels 2 and 3 are combined with a separet level 1

3. A single spec covering all levels. 

I'm not sure I know what the right answer is although my best guess would be
either separate specs (i.e. option 1) or a single spec in three sections.

What are your thoughts? 

David

David, 

I think I understand your levels. At the same time, your classification
makes me think that we need to better clarify how our choreography is
grounded on WSDL. In particular, we should clearly specify if and when the
specific message descriptors defined in WSDL interfaces can be used
(including things like abstract XPath selectors) when talking about messages
exchanged within our choreographies.

Without this clarification, many people would naturally infer from the WDSL
grounding that our choreography deals with messages at level 2.
