What you are stating as a requirement is that it should be possible to for
two choreographies "executed" at the same time.

To fully define this requirement you actually need some extra statements,
more specifically the requirement should be ... "It should be possible for
two (or more) instances of the execution of choreographies of the same type
to occur between the same service instances".

A simple example of this is a single buyer placing two (or more) orders
*simultaneously* with the same seller where the buyer and seller send and
receive using the same instances of their order placement and order receipt
software.

If you accept this requirement, it implies a further requirement which is
... "A role in a choreography must be able to identify the instance of a
choreography to which any message in a choreography belongs".

I think the only practical way of meeting this requirement is by carrying in
the message metadata that allows the two following information items to be
identified:
1. Choreography Type - which identifies which choreography is being followed
2. Choreography Instance Id - which identifies which particular instance of
a choreography the message relates to. This item was called a "Conversation
Id" in ebXML messaging.

Kudos and thanks to the editors for getting this out.

A few comments:

re: 4.3 Scalability. One of the requirements I have mentioned is 
re-entrancy: execution of a choreography flow should not block execution 
of another instance of the same flow (e.g. two orders coming in from 
customers should be able to be processed in parallel). (This is in the 
F2F minutes, I believe). This may be purely an implementation issue, but 
we shouldn't preclude it at the spec level, or assume serialized execution.

(This is different from D-CR-040 or D-CR-041 because I'm not talking 
about parallel flows within a choreography, but parallel execution of 
choreography instances).

D-CR-009 is a special case of D-CR-061, I think. Maybe they should be 
grouped together.

Re D-CR-049 (design-time validation): it isn't really clear to me what 
this means. What does "correct behavior" mean at design time? Absence of 
deadlock, or ?

The doc needs a spell check.
