If all you have is a request response over the same channel, then I agree it
is not necessary unless that request response is part of a larger and longer
interaction.

But if you do need to do this, it is hardly rocket science and has also been
done in other specs such as ebXML messaging.

What we really want to do is have one *definitive* way of providing this
functionality. Now identifying which choreography you are following is
definitely, IMO, part of our scope. However identifying that a set of
messages are related is broader as you could have some sort of "correlation
identifier" without specifing the choreography which being followed.

+1

Then there's always the possibilty to use the extended addressing 
mechanism of WS-Addressing, or the message sequencing of WS-RM.
