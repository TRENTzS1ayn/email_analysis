I disagree. I think identifying a choreography is a special case of 
message correlation. What you really need to know is, what messages 
share a common context. If possible it would be desirable to use one of 
the existing or emerging specs for this, rather than inventing a new 
mechanism. But also, if this is a more general problem (as I believe), 
then it is not really within the scope of WS-Choreography to specify a 
solution.
