I'll have to side with Jon on this. Correlation is a generic and 
flexible mechanism that can also be used for that. A more specific 
mechanism would be too narrow in scope and would impose some 
limitations. Since we're dealing with WS in general, and not 
specifically PO scenarios, let's have the more generic mechanisms.
