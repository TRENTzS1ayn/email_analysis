+1 from me too!!

I don't think I expressed what I said very clearly.  Let's recap.

I think that:
1. We should use one of the existing specs for identifying how to correlate
the set of related messages that belong to an instance of a choreography.
However our spec should specify which one it is for interoperability. The
also needs to be in development in either OASIS or the W3C to make sure
there are no IP issues
2. We should include in our own spec how to specify in a message the
choreography *type* that is being followed as it is directly related to what
we do.

I hope this makes sense ;)

I'll have to side with Jon on this. Correlation is a generic and 
flexible mechanism that can also be used for that. A more specific 
mechanism would be too narrow in scope and would impose some 
limitations. Since we're dealing with WS in general, and not 
specifically PO scenarios, let's have the more generic mechanisms.
