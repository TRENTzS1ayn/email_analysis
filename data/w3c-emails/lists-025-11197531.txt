mm1: Doesn't it all get down to business context?  The paths selected 
are based on specific business rules that may be linked to internal 
logic restrictions and/or agreements between parties. Either way, the 
context via the decision point provides an 'indicator' of the path and 
can affect the outcome.  One option is to provide a reference to the 
rule or (what Ricky calls the decision point) or, based on the business 
context (roles, agreements, etc.), substitute the logic for the 
appropriate decision point (within the choreography).  Would we consider 
this an external event?
