Graduated degrees of "contract-ness":

* A choreography as a technical contract, as in Design By Contract.
* A choreography as an agreement between business partners as to how
they will conduct electronic commerce.
* A choreography for how business partners will form legally binding
contracts.
* A choreography referenced in an economic contract, for example a
yearly supply chain replenishment contract, governing electronic
transactions under the contract.
* A choreography referenced in an economic contract applying financial
penalties for failure to fulfill commitments.

Each graduation increases the legal implications of the choreography.
And probably the number of lawyers involved.

E.g. see UNECE Recommended Electronic Commerce Agreement:
http://www.unece.org/cefact/rec/rec31/rec31_2000_00tr257.pdf

It specifies lots of rules for how to conduct a legally binding
offer-acceptance transaction.
