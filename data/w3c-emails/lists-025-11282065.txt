mm1:  It is an expression that can reference back to an agreement. I 
would ask: (1) Is it appropriate that WSDL be an expression of a binding 
agreement or optionally designated as legally binding or not, and/or (2) 
Is it appropriate that the WSDL point to the overriding agreement 
associated with the context the agreement provides for the expression?

mm1:  See first response.

mm1: Let's separate the fact that there is a contract, that it is 
binding and whether than binding is attached to the WSDL (as well as to 
the execution later....).
