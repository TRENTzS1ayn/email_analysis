Again the question here: is this necessary?

If under the contract I'm obliged to send someone a package do I need 
the FedEx slip to reference the contract? If under the contract I issue 
an invoice demanding payment, does the invoice need to reference the 
contract? Why would a choreography definition be any difference?

This is just not my understanding of how the legal system works and so I 
don't see why back referencing is necessary in a court of law or even 
arbitration. Time to bring in the legal guns and see if they consider it 
an issue ;-)
