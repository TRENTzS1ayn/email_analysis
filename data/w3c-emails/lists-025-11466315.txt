You can't prove a negative. You can claim that goods or money
was not received and the respondent can rebut with message logs.
You can claim that a payment was late, especially if it was electronic
and you have a good timestamp.

Or say that an economic contract contains two commitments:
1. a commitment to deliver some goods by a particular time, and
2. a commitment to pay a penalty for late delivery.
Evidence that the supplier agreed to both of those commitments
would be necessary to claim the penalty.

Probably the more business protocols get automated,
and good evidence is available, the less people will sue,
and the more they will fulfill their commitments.

A public record of commitment-fulfillment could also become
a basis for a reputation system.
