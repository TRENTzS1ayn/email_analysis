Greetings,

      I have an action item to post some logistical information about the
next f2f meeting hosted by Grainger here in Chicago. Here is this info:

Location of meeting:
 W. W. Grainger, Inc.
100 Grainger Parkway
Lake Forest, Illinois 60045

We'll provide a final location for the meeting room as we move forward.

Hotel:
Grainger has obtained a greatly reduced rate for WS-Choreography members at
a local hotel:
Staybridge Suites by Holiday Inn
100 Barclay Blvd
Lincolnshire, IL  60069
Tel: 847 821 0002
Fax: 847 821 0003

The Grainger rate is $105/night. Please mention "W3C" and "Grainger" when
arranging reservations. This hotel is literally brand-new; it will open on
June 1st. It's literally right across the street from the office in which I
work and appears quite nice! There are also many other hotels in the
neighborhood, there at least 4 within a 1-mile radius. There are two
Marriotts and several others, search for the 60069 zip code.

This hotel is approximately 5 miles from Grainger's main HQ, where the
meeting will take place.

Directions:
I'm attaching mapquest maps for two trips: a) from O'Hare airport to the
hotel and b) from the hotel to the meeting place. Hopefully this will be
helpful as you make your arrangements. Please feel free to contact Len or
myself if you have questions about the local area. Here are some text
