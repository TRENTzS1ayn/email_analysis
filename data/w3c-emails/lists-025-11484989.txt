Greetings,

      I took an action to attempt a second revision of our mission
statement, taking into account all of the comments and discussion
surrounding the first draft. I've tried to gather all of the commentary and
unify the various proposals. In my role as WG member I don't agree with
some of the comments; in my role as editor I've tried to be fair and
account for all the varying views.

      As a group, we need to make some fundamental decisions about where we
are going. Do we tie our work to WSDL? Do we deal with the problem of
run-time dynamics? Peer-to-peer or hub and spoke or both? All of these
issues need to be decided, which is why I doubt that this will be the final
revision of this misson statement.

      I've actually come up with two possible mission statements as below.
They each take a different approach to our mission. Let's discuss both
options and see where it leads us.

Just for review, here is the original first draft statement:

<mission statement group = "ws-chor" type="CSF level 0" version = "1.0">
The mission of the Web Services Choreography Working Group at W3C is to
specify the means by  which Web Services may collaborate with external
systems, specifically in the composition of multiple services and the
sequencing of messages among them.
</mission statement>

This version is based on comments from Yaron, Assaf, and others. I hope I'm
capturing the essence of their meaning. My apologies for any violence done
to your text comments.

<mission statement group = "ws-chor" type="CSF level 0" version = "1.1a">
The mission of the Web Services Choreography Working Group at W3C is to
specify one or more XML-based languages building on the foundation of WSDL
1.2 to provide interoperability among Web Services in their communications
and ordering of events.
</mission statement>


<mission statement group = "ws-chor" type="CSF level 0" version = "1.1b">
The mission of the Web Services Choreography Working Group at W3C is to
specify the means by which Web Services interoperate, how composition of
Web Services is performed, and how the sequencing of events among services
may be regulated to ensure interoperability.
</mission statement>

As always, just my US$0.02, YMMV.

Regards,

D-
