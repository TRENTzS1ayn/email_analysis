I have a few comments on the specifics of the definition, but what I 
like about this definition is that it's so generic that it allows us to 
consider alternative outputs. Back in May, Mike Champion proposed the 
idea (quoted below) that we specify the way in which existing 
technologies should be used to handle choreographies. Considering all 
the discussions we've had on WSDL yes/no, XSDL good/bad, pi-calculus vs 
no-calculus, best practice and implementation nightmares, I think doing 
just that would by itself offer tremendous value to the community.

3. Basically do what WS Aarchitecture should do but doesn't really have the
focus or the expertise to do well: Make sense out of the bleedin' nightmare
that is WS Choroegraphy  / Orchestration / Business Process Execution /
Business Process Description / Workflow / etc.  Define the principles,
describe how they apply to the various "standards" out there now or in
production, and generally act as a referee in the food fight that is going
on.

That definition is not bad, just a bit too generic. WS-RM.1 and WS-RM.2 
already do that ;-)
