Jon:

I also like 1.b. However, I don't see means but one goal, i.e. "to
specify the means", I don't think that any means is explicit?

I was wondering if we could insert a "peer-to-peer" connotation as I
think this is fundamental to this group and the truly innovative portion
of ws-chor. Of course "interoperate" sounds a bit like peer-to-peer, but
I think it is not strong enough since it should be more than
interoperability.

<mission statement group = "ws-chor" type="CSF level 0" version = "1.1b"
revision="jjd"> The mission of the Web Services Choreography Working
Group at W3C is to specify <inserted>on the foundation of
WSDL</inserted> the means by which <inserted>peer </inserted>Web
Services <replaced text="interoperate">interact</replaced>, <replaced
text="how composition of Web Services is performed">can be
composed</replaced>, and how the sequencing of <replaced
text="events">messages</replaced> among services may be regulated to
ensure <inserted>conformance to </inserted>interoperability. </mission
statement>

Which in clear gives:
The mission of the Web Services Choreography Working Group at W3C is to
specify on the foundation of WSDL the means by which peer Web Services
interact, can be composed, and how the sequencing of messages among
services may be regulated to ensure conformance to interoperability.
