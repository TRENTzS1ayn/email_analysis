I for one, am willing to go with 1.1.b. If we want to add the caveat
suggested by Jon, that's fine. I'd really rather not burn too much time on
this issue; let's take a stab at it and then let it go. We can revise it
later if circumstances require.

Regards,

I think 1.1b is ok. A mission statement is supposed to be generic. IMO
it should specify goals, not means.

Re 1.1a: I'm actually ok with the idea (I've generally been in the
pro-WSDL camp) but IMO it's specifying the means to reach the goal, not
so much the goal itself.

Perhaps we could pick 1.1b and follow it up with the statement that "It
is expected that this group's mission will be achieved by specifying one
or more XML-based languages [or insert better word - descriptive
systems?] building on the foundation of WSDL 1.2".
