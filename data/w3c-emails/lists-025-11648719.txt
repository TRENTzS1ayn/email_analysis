Having taken a quick look at the document you attached, it seems to me that
really it describes a legal framework that identifies how businesses would
interact. It does not necessarily specify the detail of how they would
interact.

I am also wondering what your thoughts are about separating agreements into
three levels:
1. Technology agreements that cover messaging, technical protocols,
security, etc
2. Process and data agreements that cover the choreography and data to be
used, and
3. Business agreements that specify how individual parties will interact.

I think that technology agreements could be developed that could be used by
multiple industries, and process and data agreements could be developed for
individual industries and that the Business agreements could link the two
together for use in a particular instance.

Thoughts?

David

Dear All,

I have been following all the very interesting discussions and work 
going on in this group for sometime and if time permitted I would have 
joined.

The reason I jump in here is that Im leading a effort within UN/CEFACT 
to look a agreements and contracts in a project called Unified Business 
Agreements and Contracts , UBAC for short. In UBAC we approach 
electronic collaborations from an agreement point of view, i.e. how do 
we make global business level agreements electronically interpretable 
and integrated with varous mechanisms for business collaborations / 
choreographies ?

When reading Davids email I realized that we are touching the same 
problematic areas and It may be if interest to you to know that we 
exists and were working on the border of profiling business realtionships.

I have attached a contribution from EDIFICE / RosettaNet / ESIA/EECA 
that shows a way to legally organize business relations. The UBAC 
project is also going to work with business level artifacts such as 
commitments, fulfillments of for example payment, delivery.

Best Regards
/anders w. tell
