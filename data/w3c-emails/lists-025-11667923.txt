<DB>You could expose it as part of your WSDL definition. However before it could be used, someone else would have to write software that could interpret the semantics of the definition so that it could make an appropriate decision. Although this is possible, I don't see it happening unless and until there is some standardization of the semantics around how you describe the rules and regulations as the cost of developing the software for all the different ways of describing the semantics would be prohibitive.</DB>

The WSD group just started discussing how to integrate RDF into WSDL, and ontologies support should follow. So there is already some standardization work happening in this area. Of course, only time will tell how effective these semantics technologies are.
