There are a lot of other scenarios like that. I don't care how they came 
to be, I know that they exist, and like Visa and Mastercard are very 
commonly used. So let's support them. I agree that we should also help 
the "deal get done faster". But where the agreement problem doesn't 
exist, why not leverage that?

Probably not, but my computer can still make selections without having 
to understand semantics. The proposal I made was to name things, so you 
only need to recognize the names, and that a computer can easily do.

Not contradicting anything I'm saying. I could also make it a property 
in a UDDI entry and do a search based on that property. If only I could 
have something I could reference ;-)
