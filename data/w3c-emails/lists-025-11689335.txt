I like it. I do have a few minor comments, though, with suggested text 
where applicable.

What about iterations?

Not sure what the difference is from above. Whould it be just easier to 
say something like "parallel, serial, exclusively"?

"By referencing their role" is too restrictive. Perhaps the role would 
reference the messages it expects to receive, or they would be listed in 
the same container, etc. Can we just say something like "identify the 
role that will receive a message"?

Contrary to what may have been assumed, I +1 that.

I would also add that the choreography description format MUST enable 
the naming of all actions and decision points such that they could be 
referenced from other specifications (e.g. an RDF-based specification 
may say interesting things about them).

I'm not sure I understand this, or perhaps we're using the term decision 
point differently. More clarification would help.

We should change the language such that the choreography doesn't have to 
reference the BPEL, but the BPEL can reference the choreography. That 
would allow me to come up with two different BPEL's for the same 
choreography.

And, of course, this assumes we can even reference BPEL in a normative 
way. I suppose at some point we'll bite the bullet and take a vote on this.

I am absolutely not clear what this last requirement says. What is an 
abstract mechanism used to reference machine readable logic? In fact, 
what is machine readable logic? The first requirement suggests machine 
readable logic. Also, I suggest the text say "specify concrete binding" 
and also allow referencing to be used as alternative to extension 
specifications (in the same way you can reference a WSDL and don't have 
to explicitly extend it just to say something about it).
