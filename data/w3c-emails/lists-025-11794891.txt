Working out how RDF and WSDL work together sounds useful. Is this work
focusing on the semantics of operations? There is also a separate
requirement to specify the semantics of XML schema through annotation.

<DB>You could expose it as part of your WSDL definition. However before it
could be used, someone else would have to write software that could
interpret the semantics of the definition so that it could make an
appropriate decision. Although this is possible, I don't see it happening
unless and until there is some standardization of the semantics around how
you describe the rules and regulations as the cost of developing the
software for all the different ways of describing the semantics would be
prohibitive.</DB>

The WSD group just started discussing how to integrate RDF into WSDL, and
ontologies support should follow. So there is already some standardization
work happening in this area. Of course, only time will tell how effective
these semantics technologies are.
