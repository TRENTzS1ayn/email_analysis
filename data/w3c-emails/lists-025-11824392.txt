I have been chatting to Bruce since Budapest. He is very interested in 
our activities and has submitted the following use case.

One of his concerns is the format of the use case itself, I have 
assured him that I would take a use case on the back of a milk carton 
if it helps move the whole process along and grounds it in real 
requirements derived from real situations. This is one such situation.

Cheers
