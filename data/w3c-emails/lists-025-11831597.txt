The WSD group just started working on WSDL connections to RDF/OWL. During the WSA/WSD combined F2F day last May a presentation (see [1]) was given on OWL and how it could be used in combination with WSDL (by the way, I am a member of WSA, not of WSD, so WSD members on this list can probably give better accounts of WSD group's specific plans in this area).
 
At the end of the OWL presentation a few people observed that, given the complexity of OWL and Semantic Web-related technologies, it's probably easier for somebody working on SW to become familiar with WSDL and provide help to the WSD group than the other way around. So hopefully something in that area will soon get started.
 
The latest WSD thread on the subject can be found at [2].

Working out how RDF and WSDL work together sounds useful. Is this work focusing on the semantics of operations? There is also a separate requirement to specify the semantics of XML schema through annotation.

<DB>You could expose it as part of your WSDL definition. However before it could be used, someone else would have to write software that could interpret the semantics of the definition so that it could make an appropriate decision. Although this is possible, I don't see it happening unless and until there is some standardization of the semantics around how you describe the rules and regulations as the cost of developing the software for all the different ways of describing the semantics would be prohibitive.</DB>

The WSD group just started discussing how to integrate RDF into WSDL, and ontologies support should follow. So there is already some standardization work happening in this area. Of course, only time will tell how effective these semantics technologies are.
