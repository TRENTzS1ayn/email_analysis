David:

 

Your example (proposal?) does not make use of Message Exchange Pattern,
it is also clear from the example that there will be a series of
"standard" errors that can be handled at the specification level rather
than leaving each choreography designer re-invent what a "document
error", "transmission error", "timeout error" is. Do you plan on
including these kinds of concepts in the spec?

 

Thanks,

I do have a spec, but it is not quite ready for prime time. I do though
think I could get it ready in time for the F2F if others think it would
make sense?

 

Thoughts?

David, you're right. We are thinking about pretty much the exact same
thing. I don't suppose you have a spec laying around someplace for that
XML? Would save us a bunch of time. :)
