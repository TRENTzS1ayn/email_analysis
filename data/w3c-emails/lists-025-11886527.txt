This could simply be a request to resend some earlier message that got lost.

Forgive me, but if this has been discussed earlier, I missed it, or 
don't recall it.

The first requirement is talking about some kind of introspection 
facility, where a choreography instance can report its own state.

I'm not really clear here how this would work, e.g. are there 
standardized states?

There are also some possible security implications, related to the 
earlier privacy discussion, especially if this query can cross the 
boundaries of a single choreography definition, as suggested.

The second one is less problematic. Although if you are using something 
like a standard reliable messaging protocol, then I presume resend is 
handled at the level of that protocol, not explicitly in the choreography.
