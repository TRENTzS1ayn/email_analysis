For brevity sake, two comments and +1 on everything else.

That depends on how you define a role. You can define a role as being a 
component of the choreography in which case a role participants in one 
choreography. That does not restrict an entity from being multiple roles 
in multiple choreographies. You can define roles that participate in any 
number of choreographies, but I'm not sure what it buys you, and if 
you're having problems reaching agreements you probably would have a 
problem agreeing to use the same role in multiple choreographies. 
(Again, won't restrict the same entity ...)

I accept that as a party intending to buy products I would assume the 
role 'buyer' in one choreography, 'procurer' in another, and 'sucker' in 
a third one. On the other hand, I may be expected to operate in the same 
way in all three choreographies, i.e. implement the same interface, but 
that brings us back to the role=interface equality, mobile process model 
and all other undesirable solutions.

Yes it does. And if it doesn't then pi-calculus wouldn't be relevent to 
our work.
