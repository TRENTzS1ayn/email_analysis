Dear Daniel et al,
 
I would like to highlight that if the point that if the gist of what Fred
says below is agreed, then it contains a requirement in the language that
should be in our Requirements document.
 
That is it shall be possible and practicable to store instances of use of
the WS-Chor language in a Registry / Repository, to be a able to search for
such instances and to retrieve them.
 
Best Regards     Tony

Steve,
 
I believe the choreography language should express the exchange at the level
of abstraction that is appropriate for business people to understand.  This
does not mean that the form of expression is appropriate for business
people.  I beleive we should focus on the XML form of expression as that is
the form that will be appropriate for retrieval from registries and
exchanged between potential participants in a web services exchange.  A form
suitable for business users should be deferred since this requires different
skills and can be done in different ways by different tools without adverse
impact on the computational web services protocol specifications and
implementations.
 
Fred
