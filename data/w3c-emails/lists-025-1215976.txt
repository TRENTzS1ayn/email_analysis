Hi Folks,

      This sort of mail needs to also be CC'd to the issues mailing list.
Has that been established yet?

Dear Daniel et al,

I would like to highlight that if the point that if the gist of what Fred
says below is agreed, then it contains a requirement in the language that
should be in our Requirements document.

That is it shall be possible and practicable to store instances of use of
the WS-Chor language in a Registry / Repository, to be a able to search for
such instances and to retrieve them.

Best Regards     Tony

      Steve,

      I believe the choreography language should express the exchange at
      the level of abstraction that is appropriate for business people to
      understand.  This does not mean that the form of expression is
      appropriate for business people.  I beleive we should focus on the
      XML form of expression as that is the form that will be appropriate
      for retrieval from registries and exchanged between potential
      participants in a web services exchange.  A form suitable for
      business users should be deferred since this requires different
      skills and can be done in different ways by different tools without
      adverse impact on the computational web services protocol
      specifications and implementations.

      Fred
