3. A process that participates in two choreographies needs two different 
identifiers correlated to its instance (or N correlations for N 
choreographies)

What about the possibility that each participant just picks its own 
identifier and all participants communicating with it agree to use that 
identifier to maintain the notion of a session? If you have n 
participants than you have n different identifiers. You can talk to a 
participant only if you know its identifier (which is opaque - means 
nothing to you), so you can't join the choreography unless invited to 
join it. Would a scheme like that work?
