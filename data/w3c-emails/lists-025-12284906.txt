I assume what you mean by same role is not the fact that both 
choreographies choose to call it 'buyer', but the fact that in both of 
them the buyer would be able to act in the same way against the seller. 
Am I correct?

In that case, would it make more sense to define the buyer's participant 
and then create two choreographies using that reusable definition?
