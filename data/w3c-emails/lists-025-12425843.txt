When I build a system to participate in a choreography what role it 
takes has no meaning to me unless the role also says what it should do 
or expect other participants to do. Essentially, I need a definition of 
its commitments. If the commitments are similar across two 
choreographies then that system can participate in both of these 
choreographies. If the commitments are widely different but they so 
happen to have the same name, it really doesn't help the system 
participate in more than one choreography.

So again, it boils down to: is the role just a fancy name, or is there 
more information associated with that role, and in this case, can we 
define that information specific for the role and use it to define any 
number of choreographies?
