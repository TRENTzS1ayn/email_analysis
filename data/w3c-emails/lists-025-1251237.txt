Subject: [members] OASIS TC Call For Participation: WSBPEL



A new OASIS technical committee is being formed. The OASIS Web Services 
Business Process Execution Language Technical Committee (WSBPEL TC) has 
been proposed by the members of OASIS listed below.

The proposal for a new TC is appended to this message. The proposal, 
which includes a statement of purpose, list of deliverables, and 
proposed schedule, will constitute the TC's charter. The TC Process 
allows these items to be clarified (revised) by the TC members; such 
clarifications (revisions), as well as submissions of technology for 
consideration by the TC and the beginning of technical discussions, may 
occur no sooner than the TC's first meeting.

As specified by the OASIS TC Process, the requirements for becoming a 
member of the TC are that you must 1) be an employee of an OASIS member 
organization or an Individual member of OASIS; 2) notify the TC chair of

your intent to participate at least 15 days prior to the first meeting; 
and 3) attend the first meeting of the TC.

For OASIS members, to sign up for the TC using the new OASIS 
collaborative tools, go to the TC's public page at 
http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/wsbpel and click on the button for 
"Join This TC" at the top of the page. You may add yourself to the 
roster of the TC either as a Prospective Member (if you intend to become

a member of the TC) or an Observer. A notice will automatically be sent 
to the TC chair, which fulfills requirement #2 above. You must sign up 
for membership at least 15 days before the first meeting and must attend

the first meeting of the TC in order to become a member.

Note that membership in OASIS TCs is by individual, and not by
organization.

For non-OASIS members, a public comment list 
wsbpel-comment@lists.oasis-open.org is available for the public to make 
comments on the work of this TC; the public may subscribe to this list 
by going to the mail list web page at
http://lists.oasis-open.org/ob/adm.pl.

The archives of the TC's private and comment mail lists are visible to 
the public at http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/

Further information about this topic may be found on the Cover Pages 
under the topic of "Business Process Management and Choreography" at

Proposal for Oasis Web Services Business Process Execution Language 
Technical Committee

Name of the TC:

OASIS Web Services Business Process Execution Language (BPEL)


Statement of Purpose:

The purpose of the Web Services Business Process Execution Language TC 
is to continue work on the business process language published in the 
Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS) 
specification in August 2002 [1]. Continuing the approach and design 
used in BPEL4WS, the work of the BPEL TC will focus on specifying the 
common concepts for a business process execution language which form the

necessary technical foundation for multiple usage patterns including 
both the process interface descriptions required for business protocols 
and executable process models. It is explicitly not a goal of the TC to 
specify bindings to specific hardware/software platforms and other 
mechanisms required for a complete runtime environment for process 
implementation.

The Technical Committee will take advantage of the OASIS provided 
services for such things as e-mail lists and archives, and also web 
pages for tracking progress. E-mail archives will be visible to the
public.


Identification of Existing Activities:

Many efforts related to business process management and related 
technologies are underway throughout the industry. The following work 
may be relevant to this Business Process Execution Language TC:

* OASIS Universal Description, Discovery and Integration Specification 
TC, http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/uddi-spec/
* OASIS Web Services Security TC,
http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/wss/
* W3C XML Protocol Working Group, http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/
* W3C Web Services Description Working Group, 
http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/desc/
* W3C Web Services Choreography Working Group, 
http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/chor/
* BPMI BPML 1.0  www.bpmi.org/specifications.esp
* ebXML Business Process Specification Schema v1.01, 
www.ebxml.org/specs/index.htm
* Web Service Choreography Interface (WSCI) 1.0, www.w3.org/TR/wsci/


Technical Committee Deliverables

The TC has the following deliverables:

* The specification of the core elements and functionalities of BPEL4WS.
* An extension specification for business protocol description
* An extension specification for executable process description

The two extension specifications for the usage patterns of business 
protocol description and executable process description are normative, 
mandatory extensions to the core specification and will include only the

essential feature extensions required for the given usage pattern.

The scope of the Web Services Business Process Execution Language 
Technical Committee is the support of process mechanisms in the 
following areas:

a. Sequencing of process activities, especially Web service interactions
b. Correlation of messages and process instances c. Recovery behavior in
case of failures and exceptional conditions d. Bilateral Web service
based relationships between process roles

Specification work in areas not explicitly listed in the scope above is 
out-of-scope for this TC but will be considered for future TC charters 
layered on the results of this TC. It is the intent of the proposers 
that the TC address requested clarifications to this charter; seeking to

resolve ambiguities and narrowing the scope of work. Other requested 
charter changes that are not clarifications may be noted and archived 
for possible future work after the conclusion of this TC's lifecycle. 
Each of the process mechanisms will use implementation and language 
neutral XML formats defined in XML Schema [2].

The OASIS Web Services Business Process Execution Language TC will:

1. Accept contributions as input within the TC's defined scope. BEA, 
IBM, Microsoft, SAP and Siebel intend to submit the Business Process 
Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS) V1.1 specification [3] at 
the first meeting of the TC. This BPEL4WS document is an update to the 
BPEL4WS specification published by IBM, Microsoft, and BEA on August 9th

2002. The revised document is a modularized and updated version of the 
original specification that clearly identifies the core concepts and 
required extensions for BPEL4WS.

2. Produce as output a specification, in one or more documents, for the 
"Web Services Business Process Execution Language", hereafter referred 
to as the "resultant specification". This resultant specification will 
reflect refinements and corrections that are identified by the TC 
members within the scope of the TC charter. In the interests of 
stability, continuity and speed, the committee will not make arbitrary 
changes, i.e. scope will be limited to material technologic 
improvements. At the TC's option, suggestions for future features, 
out-of-scope extensions, harmonization with other or broader work and 
the like may be noted and archived for possible future work after the 
conclusion of this TC's lifecycle. The final draft of the resultant 
specification will be due within 9 months of the first meeting.

3. Identify relevant Web services efforts to assist in leveraging the 
resultant specification as a part of their specifications or solutions.

4. Establish appropriate relationships and coordinate with the chairs of

the other business process related standards organizations and industry 
groups as appropriate, and in accordance with the OASIS Bylaws and TC 
Process.

5. Oversee ongoing maintenance and errata of the resultant
specification.
