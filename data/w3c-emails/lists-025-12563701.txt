[JJ] I am not sure I would translate it this way. Signals are not just
application level processing error messages. You may also have "message
format errors" that could be trapped above the system of record. 

I would suggest:

>>The WS-Chor message sequence description language MUST take into
>>consideration the need to manage signals where a signal is defined as
<a choreography state synchronization mechanism> that is expressed as a
<standard> message visible
>>by
>>other partners in the choreography.
