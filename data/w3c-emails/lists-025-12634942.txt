Since the agenda for the F2F calls for discussion of use cases and 
requirements, I wonder if Daniel, or someone else, has a reasonably up 
to date list of candidate use cases/requirements (including recent 
proposals). The draft requirements doc on the member page is from April, 
which was a while ago. I'd benefit from a summary, if there was one.
