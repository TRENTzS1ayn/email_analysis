    Business Services Orchestration: The Hyper-Tier of IT

Recognizing that business processes are the engines of competitive 
advantage in any company, Fuego co-founder Felix Racca and EDS 
Enterprise Consultant Waqar Sadiq champion the importance of Business 
Process Management technology in their new book: Business Services 
Orchestration: The Hyper-Tier of IT. Readers gain a firm understanding 
of how a company's bottom-line can be managed through an added layer of 
software that focuses directly on the execution of business process, 
independent of the people or underlying systems used to implement it. In 
this excerpt from the book, Business Services Orchestration is defined, 
and readers learn how it closes the gap between business strategy and 
execution to boost earnings. The chapter also provides general 
information about business processes and how to improve the operations 
of any company through smart process management:
