Greetings All,

      Your erstwhile editors have been busy producing a new version of the
requirements document, but have had a small hiccup in terms of delivery,
that being that we aren't just yet able to post to the W3C site properly. I
take responsibility for this delay, I should have checked things before the
last minute. Mea culpa & etc.

      I've posted the latest version of the document to the archive list as
a poor man's substitute; please have a look at the URL below.

      This version of the document is appropriately labeled version 0.5, as
it is certainly half-baked. Hopefully I've managed to account for the user
scenarios; draft requirements themselves are not yet included, as I have
not managed to harvest them all from the email archives. Nevertheless the
doucment is shaping up and should provide some subject for discussion at
our meeting.

      Once again my apologies for the posting problems and other delays.

Regards,

D-
