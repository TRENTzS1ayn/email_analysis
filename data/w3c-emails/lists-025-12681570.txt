Greetings,

      Here is some more logistical information for the face-to-face meeting
this week.

1) When you get to Grainger HQ, there is a security station on Grainger
Parkway. Please let the security guard know that you are attending the W3C
meeting and he'll direct you to the right place.

2) You'll be directed to visitor parking (lucky you). From there you'll
want to go to the main entrance toward the west side of the building. It's
not easy to miss, don't worry. You'll be met by a Grainger employee who
will help point you to the meeting area.

See you there!

Regards,

D-
