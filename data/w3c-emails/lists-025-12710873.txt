I REALLY want to review this but I can't do so until the IP issues are
clear. I'm afraid it is not sufficient to say that if the group wants the
spec then y'all will submit the IP since this means that the group could
potentially not want the spec and having read it I could be contaminated
with your IP. So I must ask that you officially submit the spec for
consideration by the WG under W3C's IP guidelines. That way there will be no
IP issues.

    Thanks,
            Yaron

  Subject: Draft Choreography Spec


  Here, as promised, is a *draft* of the WS Choreography specification that
expands on the sample XML for a Choreography definition that I provided in
April [1]. It includes a number of additional features that were not
illustrated by the earlier example but is essentially the same. The zip file
at [2] contains:
  1. The draft WS Choreography spec as a PDF
  2. The Choreography XML Schema
  3. Sample XML choreography definitions.

  Also please note that the copyright statement in the spec reserves
Commerce One's rights to the specification. However, if the WS Choreography
group sees fit to want to take this specification further, then Commerce One
will donate their IP in the spec to the W3C.
