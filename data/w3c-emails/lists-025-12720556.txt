I have to admit that the term 'choreography state synchronization mechanism'
makes me really nervous only because it is so broad that it could
potentially mean anything. But let's adopt your proposed new language anyway
and when we do the full requirements review we can do a pass to look for
phrases such as that one and make sure they are used in a consistent and
well defined manner throughout the requirements.
