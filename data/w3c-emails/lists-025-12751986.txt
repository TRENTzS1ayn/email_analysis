Yaron
 
I understand your perspective and in principle submitting it to the W3C
should be no problem except that it takes time as I will HAVE to go through
our lawyers. I need to do a more detailed check, but I don't think Commerce
One has an patents in this area, so really we are talking about copyright.
 
Also the spec is not complete, and there are some issues and gaps in it,
although I think there are a lot of good ideas <big grin>.
 
Finally, as it might help to read the licence in the spec without actually
downloading it, I attach it below. Is this enough so that you can read it
Yaron?
 
Finally, can anyone point me towards the procedure/process for making a
submission.

I REALLY want to review this but I can't do so until the IP issues are
clear. I'm afraid it is not sufficient to say that if the group wants the
spec then y'all will submit the IP since this means that the group could
potentially not want the spec and having read it I could be contaminated
with your IP. So I must ask that you officially submit the spec for
consideration by the WG under W3C's IP guidelines. That way there will be no
IP issues.
 
    Thanks,
            Yaron

Here, as promised, is a *draft* of the WS Choreography specification that
expands on the sample XML for a Choreography definition that I provided in
April [1]. It includes a number of additional features that were not
illustrated by the earlier example but is essentially the same. The zip file
at [2] contains:
1. The draft WS Choreography spec as a PDF
2. The Choreography XML Schema
3. Sample XML choreography definitions.
 
Also please note that the copyright statement in the spec reserves Commerce
One's rights to the specification. However, if the WS Choreography group
sees fit to want to take this specification further, then Commerce One will
donate their IP in the spec to the W3C.
