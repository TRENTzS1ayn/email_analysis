Unfortunately the license isn't sufficient as it only covers the text itself
and not the ideas contained therein. For me to evaluate it, it would have to
be submitted to the W3C and covered under the W3C RF policy so that both the
text and the ideas are protected.

  Yaron

  I understand your perspective and in principle submitting it to the W3C
should be no problem except that it takes time as I will HAVE to go through
our lawyers. I need to do a more detailed check, but I don't think Commerce
One has an patents in this area, so really we are talking about copyright.

  Also the spec is not complete, and there are some issues and gaps in it,
although I think there are a lot of good ideas <big grin>.

  Finally, as it might help to read the licence in the spec without actually
downloading it, I attach it below. Is this enough so that you can read it
Yaron?

  Finally, can anyone point me towards the procedure/process for making a
submission.

    I REALLY want to review this but I can't do so until the IP issues are
clear. I'm afraid it is not sufficient to say that if the group wants the
spec then y'all will submit the IP since this means that the group could
potentially not want the spec and having read it I could be contaminated
with your IP. So I must ask that you officially submit the spec for
consideration by the WG under W3C's IP guidelines. That way there will be no
IP issues.

        Thanks,
                Yaron

      Here, as promised, is a *draft* of the WS Choreography specification
that expands on the sample XML for a Choreography definition that I provided
in April [1]. It includes a number of additional features that were not
illustrated by the earlier example but is essentially the same. The zip file
at [2] contains:
      1. The draft WS Choreography spec as a PDF
      2. The Choreography XML Schema
      3. Sample XML choreography definitions.

      Also please note that the copyright statement in the spec reserves
Commerce One's rights to the specification. However, if the WS Choreography
group sees fit to want to take this specification further, then Commerce One
will donate their IP in the spec to the W3C.
