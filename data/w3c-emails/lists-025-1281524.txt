As per my action point here is a list of proposed requirements extracted
from the minutes of the tues 8 April con call.

1. A Choreography should be independent of message formats

2. A Choreography may have run time changes:
   a. the actual participants can vary
   b. the actual choreography can vary [ed: I think we ruled this out
but have listed it for completeness]

3. It should be possible to query the state of a Choreography

4. Error/fault handling and compensation features need to be able to be
expressed in the language.

5. Choreographies should be composable (into a hierarchy)


Martin.
