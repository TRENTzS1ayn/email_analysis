Dear WS-CHOR team,

Im follow the very insightful discussions in this team as interesting in 
/ teaching the subject of business collaborations.

However Im also a Swedish delegate of UN/CEFACT UMM/BPSS team and I feel 
that I must point out that the presentation about BPSS given by 
Jean-Jacques Dubray must be considered as his own view and not the view 
of the UMM team or members such as me.

best regards
/anders
