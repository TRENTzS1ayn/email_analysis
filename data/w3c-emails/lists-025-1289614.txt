For point 2a, is this related to multi-party choreography ?  I can't 
imagine a use case of participant change in a bi-party choreography.

In multi-party choreography, we need to look into the constraints of such 
changes.  For example, in a buyer/seller/shipper choreography, I see 
"changing a shipper" can still be the same choreography instance.  But I 
have a hard time to understand if the "seller" can be changed, even harder 
if the "buyer" is changed.

So I'm thinking a stricter one ...
1) For a choreography to start, there needs to be at least two roles being 
binded.
2) These two initial role binding cannot be changed

as well as a looser one ...
1) For a choreography to start, there needs to be at least one role (the 
initiator) being binded.
2) The initiator role binding cannot be changed.

Comments ?

Rgds, ricky
