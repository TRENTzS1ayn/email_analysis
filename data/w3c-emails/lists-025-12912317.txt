View of what Monica? You know my view of next maintenance release of 
BPSS which I posted in appropriate BPSS team forum. I dont want to 
burden this with out of scope issues.

I can share one view with you that may interest this groups and that is 
how I prefer to create meta models. Its the same principle Ive used for 
BPSS and CoreComponents.

I have a strong preference to create meta models based on MOF which is 
the same meta meta model used to define UML. By using MOF I can create 
java API's, XML Schema, reading writing source code automatically using 
standardized specifications. Kind of nifty since all I have to do is 
create one single file and the rest us generated automatically. The 
manipilation java binary code is actually generated on te fly when 
loading the metamodel.  The best is that all is open source !

Im working with ArgoUML team to evolve the ArgoUML open source platform 
into UML 2.0, MDA and MOF domain.

Hope there was something of value in there.

BTW has this group had a look at UML 2 as a foundation for the 
specification ?
