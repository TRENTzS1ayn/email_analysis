Jean-Jacques,

I did not have a chance to listen to your presentation, so you might have already explained this. In your slides you talk about a "choreography protocol", and I am not sure whether it is just regular messages plus an instance ID (as you mentioned in a previous message to the list) or it is more than that.

Thank you,
Ugo
