Ugo:

Basically a choreography protocol is needed to ensure that each peer in
the choreography has the same view of the state in which the
choreography instance is. Imagine a situation, where you send me a PO
and I am not supposed to respond until the goods are shipped and I will
respond by sending you an invoice. So you send me a PO and the RM tells
you "I got it" (just like a fax). The next thing that should happen then
is you receive the goods and later on an invoice. If there was a human
behind a fax machine, and the order was garbled he could call and figure
out the right information. In this case, the sender things the
choreography is going ok. The responder on the contrary thinks that the
collaboration is terminated on an error. This is why you need a
protocol: to tell you that no exception occurred, each party has the
same view of the state of the choreography.

If you take a "highly-connected" system that has several hundred /
thousands participants (not all participating in the same choreography
instance but rather having 2 by 2 conversations). You cannot expect that
every message that will be exchanged in this setting would be of high
quality (the structure may be old or wrong, the content may be
incoherent making the processing of the message impossible, i.e. a
response cannot be created because the message could not get into the
system that was supposed to create the response). 

At this point, you can say I don't need/want a protocol. That means that
when a choreography is designed, the designers must account for these
possible (yet common) errors. They will create specific messages to say
"could not process your orders, it contains errors", and make these
messages part of the choreography.

On the other hand if you had a protocol, you would have a standard set
of exceptions (common to all message exchanges) and materialized with a
set of standard messages. You could then express the choreography paths
based on these error conditions (if success ... if failure ... if
timeout ... if structure invalid ... if content invalid ...) with an
implicit message exchange. The simplest set of exception for me are:
message did not get there on time, message could not be processed by
system/service of record.

Again, all this has nothing to do with RM. The problem here is not that
your message did not get to the recipient, it is rather that the
recipient got a message that he could not process, hence interrupting
the choreography instance. A protocol would help you cover 80/90% of the
common exceptions. Others can be dealt with at the design level.

Cheers,
