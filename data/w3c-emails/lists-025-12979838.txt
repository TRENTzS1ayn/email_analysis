Steve:

As I said, I was not completely sure. I would also concur that a
combined approach could prove best suited to model the use cases
(elegance/simplicity of block structured combined with the efficiency of
events). I can take the action item to make a proposal in that sense. 

Note that BPEL also resulted to a combined approach (pi + state /
transition) since there seem to be no way to express "synchronization"
in pi. But again, I am no specialist.

JJ-
