Its simpler than one thinks, Personally I used Poseidon UML tool (free) 
to create a UML 15 model for BPSS and CoreComponents. Then I ran a tool 
UML2MOF to generate/translate the MOF metamodel.

A well though out metamodel is usually easy to translate, once one 
handles relations/associations properly.

In the ArgoUML team were working towards MOF and UML2 compliance.
