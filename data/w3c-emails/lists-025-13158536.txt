Just to be clear - these patterns are not agreed to in the WG yet.
This is still work in progress.

My personal feeling is that its better to just have request-response
and not say at the abstract level whether or not the response is on
the same channel or not. That's a binding characteristic - the 
abstraction is that there's a request and there will be a response.
Take an SMTP binding - every response would be on a separate channel
vs. and HTTP binding where the response can be on the same channel.

Sanjiva.
