Damn, we already started building an implementation around this! Just

I agree.

I think it should be a matter of protocol selection, and we actually 
took the liberty in trying to do that with WSDL 1.1 and it seems to work 
pretty well. With one caveat.

If you have some process that tends to use other services, as defined by 
their interface, that insist on such high latency request/response 
cycles, then obviously you can't invoke that process using HTTP and wait 
for a response in the same connection. So there needs to be some way to 
mark the interface as using one means of communication vs another, so 
you can tell how it affects all other involved parties.

Perhaps using F&P?
