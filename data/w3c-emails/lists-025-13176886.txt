Yes, relying on the WSDL binding works when you can express that binding in your spec. But what if you are writing a spec (e.g. a choreography spec) that prefers to leave WSDL bindings unspecified but still wants to talk about request/response on the same channel vs. on different channels? WSDL right now does not specify any way to express that. 

It looks like BPEL got around this problem by saying that a request/response on the same channel maps to a WSDL request/response MEP, while a request/response on different channels maps to two separate one-way MEPs (where the response one usually gets labeled "callback" as an additional syntactic sugar).
