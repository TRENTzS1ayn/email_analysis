First, can we view it in a more generic sense as a conversation where 
participants can join and leave?

Second, can we make a distinction between roles and participants. Roles 
are not bound - they should be defined as part of the choreography. A 
seller is always a seller. Participants are bound and they could change. 
It could be Amazon today and CDNow tomorrow.

For the choreography to be defined there need to be at least two roles 
otherwise no one is communicating. No value for services talking to 
themselves ;-)

For the choreography to start you need one participant to be bound to 
one role, otherwise nothing will happen. Everything else is optional.

At some point a participant for some role may have no further 
contribution to the choreography, but the choreography must progress. At 
this point do we force the choreography to stop because a participant 
has no contribution to make? Do we force the participant to send "I am 
alive, I have nothing to say, but I am alive" messages?

Can you explain the value that these restrictions bring to the 
definition of the choreography?
