Assaf, thanks for feedback !  My comments embedded.

We certainly can take this more generic view.  But I try to explore whether 
certain roles (e.g. initiator) has some distinct behavior, although it is 
not very clear to me at this moment.

I mean the same thing as you, maybe just the terminology 
difference.  "Role" is like a named variable and "Participant" is like a 
value.  Binding is like an assigning a value to a variable.  (e.g. seller = 
"Amazon")

Of course, but I think the question is whether these two roles need to be 
bound at the creation of the choreography instance, or whether the second 
role can be bound one day later.  And my vote is the former.

This one participant must be the initiator who send the first message.  But 
to whom he sends the message... Isn't the participant who receive the 
message also need to bind to another role  ?  Then there must be at least 
two roles being bound when the choreography start.

"Inactive" is different from "leaving" (or "unbound").  "Inactive" is to 
describe the "role" while "leaving" is to describe a participant.  For 
example, once the order is place and shipment arrange.  All the 
interactions are between the role "buyer" and role "shipper".  The role 
"seller" is "inactive" but not "unbound".  On the other hand, the role 
"shipper" is very "active" even though the participant "Fedex" has already 
left that role (and replaced by participant "UPS").


>Can you explain the value that these restrictions bring to the definition 
>of the choreography?

Back to the Amazon selling use case, should Amazon define each online 
transaction as one choreography instance ? or should Amazon define a 
"RunTheBusiness" choreography which has only one instance running for many 
many years ?

I think this restriction may help to limit the life span of a 
choreography.  And this reflects most real life scenarios.  When a buyer 
switch to a different seller, he is starting a new conversation rather than 
using the existing conversation.  Can you give me a real life example where 
changing the initial two roles doesn't start a new conversation ?

A participant is NOT equivalent to a web service endpoint.  Changing an 
endpoint is not the same as a role rebind.  E.g. Amazon can change its 
endpoint address and pass the endpoint reference around to other 
participants (somewhat like passing channel in mobile process calculus), 
but this is NOT a role rebind.  But Amazon may appoint Fedex as the shipper 
and send the endpoint of Fedex to the buyer.  This is a role binding.
