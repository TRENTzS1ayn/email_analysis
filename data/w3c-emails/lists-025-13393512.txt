My understanding is, the states you transition from and to as a result 
of an interaction are declared in the InteractionDef. Then in the 
Interaction, which references the InteractionDef, you can also specify 
one or more Precondition elements.

I'm not advocating the removal of the ability to specify a precondition 
using Boolean logic. I was only talking about the simple case where the 
transition is based on a single state, and it's the same as the 
fromState in the InteractionDef. In that case you shouldn't need an 
explicit Precondition element (it is currently required).
