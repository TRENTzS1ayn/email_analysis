The initiator role is a very special role. It's stable or sticky 
depending on which terminology you want to use. If you are the initiator 
then you are the initiator. But that's an honorary title and I don't see 
the interest in describing it. Roles such as buyer and seller are more 
interesting, and though a buyer may be the initiator it's more 
interesting to talk about what a buyer does. After all, all initiators 
in all choreographies do the same thing - send the first message.

The role is sticky - it's part of the choreography definition. If the 
choreography says that some message is sent by the buyer then it will 
always be sent by the buyer. It may be a different buyer at different 
point in times, but it's always a buyer. I don't see the value of 
changing roles, I can only imagine a choreography where all roles are 
known in advance.

What you bind is a participant. So you're not binding a seller, you are 
binding a particular seller, like Amazon. And maybe Amazon says "out of 
stock" and you decide to bind some other participant like CDNow. Both 
are sellers.

What about the airline and truck shipper example. They both compete for 
a message and the first one to receive it and respond gets the lucrative 
deal of shipping some product. So when do you bind the participant: when 
the first message is sent, or after that message is received? And if 
that happens after the message is sent, does that mean there is no 
choreography instance yet?

Second question, what does binding mean? Let's say I start a new 
choreography instance as a buyer. Do I have to do any extra step to 
"bind" myself to the choreography? Now I send an order request to Amazon 
which I assume they will receive. Do I have to do any extra step to 
"bind" Amazon to the choreography?  Do I need to communicate anything 
other than my callback address?

I perfectly agree about this terminology.

Once the order is in place and shipment arrange, is it the roles that 
are interacting or the participants?

I'm not sure why it makes a difference. Amazon has a specific use case 
for a three-party choreography. That does not lead me to conclude that 
we need a tri-party choreography language. Just leads me to conclude 
that a multi-party choreography can support their use case.

Multi party choreography between buyer, seller and shipper. Say buyer 
decides which shipper to use, seller contacts shipper and finds out 
shipper cannot deliver, buyer and seller agree to use a different 
shipper. Time to go back and start a whole new conversation between 
buyer and seller?

Agreed. But isn't the mechanism still the same. If Amazon is appointing 
Fedex as the shipper and sending that endpoint (or even multiple 
endpoint or just some generic form of identification) to the buyer, then 
it's passing channels around.

I just wouldn't write a language that has specific mechanism for letting 
you change only roles called "shipper". I would think it's much easier 
to apply this logic symmetrically, i.e. all roles are the same and 
binding rules are equivalen to all roles. From experience, a language 
that is based on the general case is easier to define and use than a 
language that makes a lot of special provisions.
