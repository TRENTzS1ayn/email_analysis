Pi-c describes how concurrent processes interact.

Here is an example:

P ::= ch?x.P'
input on channel ch, data x and then continue to do P'

Q ::= ch!y.Q'
output on channel ch, data y and then continue to do Q'

System ::= P || Q
compose P and Q, by running them concurrently

When these two processes are composed and run concurrently (P || Q) they make progress by reacting, since one process outputs to the channel and the other process inputs on the same channel. After they react, P continues to do P' and Q continues to do Q'.

The important point is that both processes progress at the same time, in a lock-step fashion. The alignment comes from the fact that the sender process has to know that the receiver process received the message and the other way around, the receiver process has to know that the sender process sent the message before both of them progress. There is no intermediate state where one process sends and then it proceeds independently or the other process receives and then it proceeds independently.

To go back to your business example, the point is that the observable business state needs to be alligned, otherwise in case of failures the buyer may thing that the order is sent and then proceed happily, while the seller has not received the order and is stucked.


In practice though, implementing a distributed system to support this type of handshaking is *challenging* because of failures and loss of messages.

This is why our CDL4WS will propably require support from a reliable messaging protocol and/or a coordination protocol.
