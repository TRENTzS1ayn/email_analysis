I haven't received any feedback to the use case diagrams I drew up.

Are these sufficiently realistic to be useful? Is the use of UML 
diagrams helpful, or are there too many limitations? Is it worthwhile 
adding additional text around these so that they could be included in 
the requirements doc?

Also, IMO this exercise results in requirements that impact the 
choreography language. In particular, the need to have nested 
sub-choreographies (with MEPs a special case of these) and to have error 
handling facilities. Any comments on this?
