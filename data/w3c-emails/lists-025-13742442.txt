As a practical matter, we can't rely on WS-RM* because the existing 
specs are only drafts.

There is also another point. Reliable messaging is a "native" feature of 
some transports, such as JMS. If such a transport is part of the Web 
services stack then you will get certain guarantees about message 
delivery; however, you won't necessarily get a visible alteration in the 
message flow (JMS sends acknowledgements, but they're consumed by the 
messaging layer: they are not considered messages of the same class as 
the data payload delivered to a recipient).

In other words, the fact that RM may involve extra messages (e.g. 
acknowledgement) visible at the application layer is not inherent to RM 
per se, but is an artifact of implementing RM over an unreliable 
transport such as HTTP.

The implication is that you have to treat reliable messaging as a "black 
box" at the choreography layer. I.e., if it exists, its supporting 
messages are not part of the message exchange captured at the 
choreography layer. It is a QOS, nothing more.

There is some implication that you may have to handle timeouts in the 
absense of RM.
