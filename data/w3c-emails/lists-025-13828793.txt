>mm1:  The definitions were a compilation on various types of composition from the team.  We have not settled on one definition, although I have provided one below that seems appropriate here for consideration.  The definitions provided span different areas of composition, and whether the team agrees they are all the same, I can not speculate on.  I think it evidences the multiple levels of discussions that are occurring.  Don't shoot the messenger. I would propose: **A service composition is a composition of services that results in a new service. The new service can be the combination of distinct parts to form a whole of the same generic type. The web services could be combined to achieve a specific goal.*  *This integrates parts of the definitions of recursive, web service and choreography composition.
