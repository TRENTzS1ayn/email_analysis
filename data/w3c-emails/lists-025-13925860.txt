mm1: Graphical representations help regardless if they are use cases, 
activity diagrams, or process flows. Although, I don't think they 
replace but augment textual descriptions.  It would help to see all the 
flows together as they decompose to a lower level. 

More specifically, please consider how to handle cancellations on 
BookVacationActivity (Would this also be shown at the use case level for 
TravelAgencyUseCase?).  What about error conditions? On 
ProcessBookingActivity, what is the context of Finalize ......?  Is this 
just the compilation of the reservation detail for submittal and actual 
payment commitment?  Perhaps this should be specified. On 
SelectHotelActivity, when the booking is confirmed, that exits in 
Success.  Therefore, it should say such (rather than OK).
