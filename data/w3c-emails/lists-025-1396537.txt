Ricky,

all I have done is extract requirements from the minutes. 
I'm not really the requirements gatekeeper here (that would be the
requirements doc editors),
and how we deal with these requirements is up to the group.

Saying that I will add me 2p worth!
I tend to agree that we should expand this particular one to separate
the concepts of role from participant, 
where participant is the actual instance being bound to (one or more)
roles.
I also think that we should allow the choreography designers to decide
what invariants are placed on an instance of a choreography in trems of
wich roles can be rebound, whether all roles have to be bound at all
time etc, what the starting binding are etc. In the particalur case the
Dale points out, that is really a design decision by at to whether the
buyer is aware of the shipper i.e. it could be designed as a three-role
choreograpghy, or as two two-role ones, with the seller linking the two.


Martin.
