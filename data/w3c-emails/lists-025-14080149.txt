These are requirements because they occur in real business processes, and 
real business processes are what technologists should
be focussed on supporting, not our ideas about how companies should and 
should not do B2B. I dont think B2B is the scope. I think
BPM is the scope, and in BPM, a lot more happens than in narrower 
definitions of B2B.
