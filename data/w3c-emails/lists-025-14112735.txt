My name is Ricky Ho and (once my AC rep confirms in reply to this
message), I will be an alternate representative of Cisco Systems in
this working group.

I have been developing enterprise integration and business process workflow
system for many years. In my current organization, I have involved in design
and developing technologies in web services and application integration area.

I see web services as a very viable technology for B2B integration. But
standards to support complex web services interaction need to be defined.
I'm very interested to see this workgroup to drive this.

I agree to participate per the charter
http://www.w3.org/2003/01/wscwg-charter

I do not have personal knowledge of any IPR claims held by Cisco Systems
regarding web services choreography.
