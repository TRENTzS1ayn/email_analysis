Hello, my name is Jeff Mischkinsky and I will be representing Oracle 
Corporation on the WS Choreography Working Group. As Oracle's AC rep, I can 
confirm myself.

My background is in database systems and distributed systems, most recently 
in their current incarnation as Web Services.

I participate in several of the other W3C Web Service Activity Working

I look forward to working with the other members of the Working Group in an 
open royalty free standards forum.

I do not have personal knowledge of any IPR claims held by Oracle Corporation
regarding Web services choreography.
