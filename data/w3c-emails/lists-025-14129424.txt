My name is Kevin Liu. I will be representing SAP in this working group, and our alternate representative is Ivana Trickovic. Though my AC rep has already approved my participation and I don't have to go through the introduction process, I found others' introduction very helpful and feel obligated to introduce myself to the group before the first F2F.

I am a technology architect at SAP Labs. In the last two years, I have been representing SAP in various web services related working groups, including ebXML CPPA TC, W3C Web Services Description WG, and WS-I Basic Profile WG. My background is in ecommerce applications, especially for financial industry.

Web services technology plays a critical role in our product strategy. We have been active contributors to other W3C web services activity working groups, including XMLP, WSD, and WSA. We believe web services choreography is one of the essential next steps to make web services work for large-scale business applications and for integration intra and inter enterprises.  

I look forward to work with other members in this open forum to build a vendor-neutral choreography standard that represents wide industry consensus and thus have the chance to gain wide industry adoption.

I agree to participate per the charter  http://www.w3.org/2003/01/wscwg-charter <http://www.w3.org/2003/01/wscwg-charter> 

I do not have personal knowledge of any IPR claims held by SAP regarding Web services choreography.
