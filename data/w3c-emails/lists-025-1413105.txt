For the convenience of people who wish to try to gleen the rationale behind this move, I have collected
many of the press articles that have and are covering it, here:

http://www.bpm3.com/standards/index.html

We all have our theories. I've seen and heard all of the following theories touted:

Patents, intellectual property, royalties, vested interest from existing technologies, genuine differences of 
technical opinion, egos, an attempt to stifle early innovators, politics and commercial short-term tactics.

Only time will tell. There is no doubt that, once again, the strategic significance of BPM has been 
confirmed.
