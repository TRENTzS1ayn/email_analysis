Hello, my name is Andre Huertas I will be representing the Uniform Code
Council on the WS Choreography Working Group.

I am a software engineer for UCC and have been recently working on various
projects concerned with the implementation of standarized business processes
primarily for the Retail (grocery) industry. At the moment, I am also active
in other standards organizations that deal with the semantics of business
processes and their respective implementations (UN/CEFACT -TMG, BPSS).  

I am very interested in the choreography area and I agree to participate in
this working group as per the charter.

I do not have personal knowledge of any IPR claims held by the UCC regarding
Web Services choreography.

Andre Huertas
