My name is Monica J. Martin and (once my AC representative confirms in
reply to this message), I will be a representative of Sun Microsystems
in this working group.

I have been involved in eBusiness and enterprise architecture for more
than 10 years in several operational settings.

The definition of web services focused on choreography and simple binary
collaboration are near-term requirements to answer current business
needs.  Focusing our working group on accomplishing those near-term
requirements in a concise manner will enable us to answer the business
need quickly and effectively.

I agree to participate per the charter
http://www.w3.org/2003/01/wscwg-charter.

I do not have personal knowledge of any IPR claims held by Sun
Microsystems regarding web services choreography.

Thank you.
Monica J. Martin
Sun Microsystems
