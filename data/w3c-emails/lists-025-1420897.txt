I would lean toward the Message flow as our goal is to handle a 
choreography with a view of the process and its
audience.  I suggest we refocus on our goals, our audience and business 
requirements and objectives.

I believe if we look at those parameters, this will give us the answer 
on what technical options we pursue.

Pi-Calc doesn't seem to fully accommodate the audience nor the overall 
visibility to our primary purpose.
