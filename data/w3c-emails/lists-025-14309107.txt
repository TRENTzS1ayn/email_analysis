The following is a list of questions relating to external v. internal 
design decisions, developed by abreakout group at the first face to 
face:

------------

What are the business problems we're trying to solve?
- what is the distinction between internal and external
* internal = building implementation?  Awareness of details?
* external = interface/contract
[explain w/use cases]
- as a consumer/developer, what do I need to know to use ws-chor?
- are we trying to develop a lang to tie together WS?
If not, what are we developing?
- what definitions/terms must we have consensus on, how do these
effect our ability to make the int/ext decision?
- does external exposition require communication of internal details
* how does the description of the service related to int/ext
* separating the description from impl langs (GPL, WSDl, etc.)
- how do we ensure we have a set of abstraction at various levels,
such that the relations among levels are complete and
well-formed (relate to int/ext)
- does the distinction stay consistent for both inter- and
intra- company choreographies?
- what is choreography w respect to:
* a lang to tie together WS
* separate desc language
- if choreography must be internally consistent, how can we
view it externally
- what is the theoretical "definition" of choreography, and
does this imply external v. internal?
* e.g. does pi-calculus constrain us to a particular view
- does compositionality require internal view/details?
* composition @ runtime
- is the thing that gets composed itself a service?
* does this imply int or ext
- how can we understand what we're trying to do relative to
existing specs (BPEL, BPSS, WSCI, WSFL, etc.)
* do other specs have internal/ext distinction
What are the technical problems we're trying to solve and how do 
these relate to the business problems?  Are these different problems 
for internal vs. external?
