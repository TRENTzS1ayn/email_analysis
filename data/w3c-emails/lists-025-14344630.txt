Can simulate a Universal Turing Machine. The definition of a Universal
Turing Machine is uniform and about one page long, I doubt if we want to
repeat it but can definitely reference it from a non-normative reference.

As for everything below, I have one question. We live in the WS world, so in
my opinion we should define activities that a WS performs and proceses in
which the WS is involved. If the WSA decides that WS only perform 'business
activities' that this term would be adequate. Similarly if the WSA decides
that WS are business entities, the a choreography of Web services is in fact
a choreography of business entities. But unless such a definition is
proposed by the WSA, should we make this restriction in our glossary?
