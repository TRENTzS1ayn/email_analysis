Dear Colleagues,
 
Just to put in a message what I stated at the inaugural F2F.
 
Non- requirement for MEPs:
It presently seems to me that it is a 'non-requirement' to standards
message exchange patterns (MEP) as part of the WS-Chor work.  MEPs act
as a constraint on what you can do, so if one, or more, are defined we
will have to be very sure that users of the technique can live within
that set of constraints without having to 'jump through hoops' such as
extending the standard MEPs or having to chain them together to get the
pattern they actually need.
 
Requirements:
We certainly need to specify the 'construct'  for sending a single
message so that should be added to the requirements list.
 
We may also wish to standardise as part of the specification (in a
normative appendix perhaps) some standard business messages, such as a
generic error reporting message and an acknowledgement message
 
Best Regards     Tony
