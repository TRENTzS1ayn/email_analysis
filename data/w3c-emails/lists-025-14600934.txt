MessageTony,

I think that there is an implication of this exclusion. It is that the
choreography would be tied to WSDL based MEP's. If however we make MEP's
part of the scope then we could extend the reach of the groups
work to include non-WSDL based formalisms.

Cheers

  Subject: [Requirements] Non-requirement for MEPs


  Dear Colleagues,

  Just to put in a message what I stated at the inaugural F2F.

  Non- requirement for MEPs:
  It presently seems to me that it is a 'non-requirement' to standards
message exchange patterns (MEP) as part of the WS-Chor work.  MEPs act as a
constraint on what you can do, so if one, or more, are defined we will have
to be very sure that users of the technique can live within that set of
constraints without having to 'jump through hoops' such as extending the
standard MEPs or having to chain them together to get the pattern they
actually need.

  Requirements:
  We certainly need to specify the 'construct'  for sending a single message
so that should be added to the requirements list.

  We may also wish to standardise as part of the specification (in a
normative appendix perhaps) some standard business messages, such as a
generic error reporting message and an acknowledgement message

  Best Regards     Tony
