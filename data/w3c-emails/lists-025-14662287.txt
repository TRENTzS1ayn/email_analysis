<mm> The state synchronization should be maintained if possible.  Otherwise, the
terms and conditions of the business collaboration may not be met.

On the dynamic rebind if the terms changed, this may not meet the contractual
requirements for a business collaboration and particular business rules may
apply.  This potentially a more complex issue than the scenario for which you
decompose it.
