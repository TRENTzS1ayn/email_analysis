Steve et. al:  for those of us who cannot get to the calls (and, 
probably for those who can as well) it is really helpful to have URIs 
included in the minutes for actions like this week's:


*All: Review requirements document and provide feedback to editors.

*All: Everyone should read the CSF(critical success factors) 
part of the WSA spec to understand what it is about.


Can someone let us know where the latest versions of req documents 
and a pointer to which version of the WSA document to use? I checked 
the WG home page (public and member) to see if there were pointers, 
but didn't find them
  thanks
  JH
