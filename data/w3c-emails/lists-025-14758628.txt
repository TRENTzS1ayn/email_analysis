Agreed. This is an example where all terms and conditions are met without
synchronizing everything. The terms and conditions between the buyer,
supplier and carrier are fully met without having the carrier know
everything about the purchase order (e.g. the quoted price, the line items,
the billing address) but only some details (e.g. the weight, delivery date,
who pays for the shipment).

Arbitrarily updating anyone about everything is the easier way
technologically speaking, and it may meet the goal of simplicity but in fact
it violates a key business goal of security: information should be
disseminated only to those parties who need them to meet the business goal.

So, in fact, by specifying what information is communicated between which
parties we can in fact express:

1. What information is shared to allow some business conditions to be met

2. What information is not shared to allow other business conditions to be
met

And a combination of both is one of the compelling reasons for multi-party
choreographies.

I am making an assumption that the choreography is defined to meet the
business goals and not that the choreography is defined with the hope that
given enough runs it will meet some business goal.

So if the business goal is one which dictates a requirement that all parties
be known upfront, I would assume that the author of the choreography (or a
tool that is used to meet these restrictions) would not allow such usage. On
the other hand, I can came up with more than one scenario where the business
goal is written such that not all parties are needed to be known upfront, in
which case I would like to be able to write a choreography that supports
this business goal.
