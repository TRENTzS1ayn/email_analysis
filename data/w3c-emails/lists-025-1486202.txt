ACTIONS THAT NEED SOME HELP:

*All: Review requirements document and provide feedback to editors.

*All: Everyone should read the CSF(critical success factors) part of 
the WSA spec to understand what it is about.

Could anyone in the know pls provide a uri to the WSA spec that can be 
included in teh actions of the last minutes. I think I already have the 
requirements uri but if Daniel has an update I'll include that if 
appropriate.

Cheers

Steve T
