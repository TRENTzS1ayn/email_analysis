This appears to miss my point completely. It has nothing to do with 
REST vs the rest.

Either you have a programmatic element that represents the composite 
service or you don't. In the former case, we are not talking about 
service composition within the framework of the architecture (since its 
a prerogative of any service provider how it delivers its services); in 
the latter we have the issues I identified.

What is needed is an extra level of indirection: separate notions of 
service and of transport endpoint; plus the description to glue them 
back together.
