Hi Folks,

      The most recent version of the WSA requirements doc is always
available on the TR page:
http://www.w3.org/TR. You can also find it linked here:
http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/. The latest version is much more up-to-date than
the reference Monica found below. I'm going to update the document soon,
but the changes are trivial.

Regards,

D-
