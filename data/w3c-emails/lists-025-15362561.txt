It is absolutely important to make this distinction between information and
the message as being a container for that information. Let's for a second
call it an info bit (alluding to the fact that it can be represented as an
infoset).

An info bit can be an address or the order details. An info bit can be
represented at rest by storing it in the database or as part of the process
instance, it can be manipulated for example using XPath, or it can be
communicated as part of a message. Info bits don't move around, they get
duplicated and communicated.

I tend to prefer a distinction between the concept of a location and the
representation of a location by its identifier which may be an end-point
(WSDL port) or in abstract form a channel. I know this adds another layer of
indirection, but it may be beneficial.

Absolutely.

How about using the term action for such simple interaction, and the term
interaction for interactions or arbitrary complexity (one or more actions)?
<DB>Sounds reasonable.</DB>

The definition that uses "as a result of an event" is quite useful for
defining some forms of processes but not others (parallel composition in
pi-calculus or BPSS collaboration). In the later case the process includes
both the emittence and recipt of that event and the triggering event is not
defined as part of the process (though implicitly everything starts
somewhere, including the universe).

This is one definition of control domain, but may not be accurate. For
example, as a company I may own two processes and have full control, but for
modularity and reuse would like to treat them as separate control domains.
On the other hand, I may use a service hosted by some service provider and
choreograph my interaction with it, yet may have full management and control
over that process.

I would like to think of control domain as one in which the sequencing of
activities is managed in an unspecified way, as opposed to the need to
exchange messages in order to sequence activities across control domains.
<DB>So how about this as an updated definition...
A Control Domain is a description of the set of Processes that the entity or
operator of those processes chooses to manage and control together. The
sequencing of the processes within a Control Domain is under the control of
and can only be changed or altered by the entity that manages them. A
Control Domain can support one or more Roles.

I agree with the former but not the later. A conversation that requires two
parties cannot be accomplished by the execution of an orchestration but by
the execution of two orchestration.
<DB>Agreed. So how about "A Conversation is an instance of the execution of
a Choreography". But what would you call the instance of the execution of an
orchestration?</DB>
