Assaf raised the same point suggesting that Conversation be restricted to an
instance of a Choreography, in which case we need a word to describe the
instance of an execution of an Orchestration. Generically, an orchestration
instance is a process execution, but process executions are much more
general. Do you (or anyone else) have any ideas?

David, I agree with all except the last one "conversation".  How can an 
object be an instance of two different classes ?
