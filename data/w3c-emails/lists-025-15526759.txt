Actually I think some participants were considering whether something 
like ebXML interactions could be modelled in WS-Choreography - they have 
their own metadata, it isn't WSDL. RosettaNet is another example. Maybe 
it's out of scope, but if you emphasize the "choreography" part of the 
definition and take a liberal view of what "web serivces" could mean, 
then this might make sense.
