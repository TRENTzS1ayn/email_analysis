I suggest that section 4.2 should be Specific Requirments.
Use Cases are already covered.  I don't believe it is 
necessary to have a use case to have a requirement, so not
all requirements are use-case based.  Section 5 covers the
relationships.

I'm not sure why there are Normative References in the
appendix since this is not a specification, i.e., nothing
in this document is normative.

Where are the requirements that were discussed at the meeting?
