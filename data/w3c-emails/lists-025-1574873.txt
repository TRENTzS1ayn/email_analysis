As indicated, attached is the working glossary with the comments I 
received from Assaf and Hugo. I also heard from Mike Brumbelow, who 
wishes to assist on glossary. Mike, please do a pass over this for 
tomorrow and once the discussion gets going, we'll do so as well. Those 
items in red in the document are changes made from comments received. 
Comments / questions are also inserted in these sections, for team 
discussion at the appropriate time.

As well, as requested last week, I've added additional detail to my two 
cases for consideration with some potential areas to mine for 
requirements. These scenarios were based on real world requirements in 
European and high technology/electronic component industries.

Thanks.
