Since I have already started discusions on the list I thought that I better
formally join the WS Choreography activity ;-)

My Name is David Burdett and I will be representing Commerce One in the WS
Choreography Working Group. I am also the AC rep for Commerce One and so I
can confirm myself.

My background is around 20+ years as a management consultant with companies
such as Ernst & Young which means I am looking at WS Choreography very much
from how it can be used by businesses for B2B and EAI perspectives. Since
the mid 90's I have also worked in various XML/Web Services activities
including the first XML based B2B spec IOTP, as well as being the editor of
ebXML Messaging. I also participate in WS Architecture and various WS-I
activities.

I am looking forward to working with this group as generally agreed public
choreography definitions for eCommerce is essential to succesful widespread
adoption of B2B.

I agree to participate per the charter
    http://www.w3.org/2003/01/wscwg-charter

As far as I know, there are no IPR claimes held by Commerce One that
directly relate to Web Services Choreography.

Regards

David
