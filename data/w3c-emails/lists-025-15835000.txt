Sorry to belabor this point, but do we see value in clearly distinguishing the two different entities, that is the global view vs. the individual participant's view, which the discussion on orchestration  vs. choreography was getting at. 
 
I am not entirely sure if the envisioned summary on this topic would also account for the issues with the internal vs. external choreography, but to me, the discussion sounded very similar. Others, any comments?

see my previous mail. I thought we had agreed not to make any distinction for the time being.

David/Assaf, would it make sense to capture these definitions (at least the ones for orchestration and choreography) in a document? We could even use the set of characteristics that David listed in his original email to highlight the differences between orchestration and choreography, perhaps in a tabular form. Once again, I am personally keen on clearly distinguishing the two conceptual areas and it doesn't matter to me much which words we stick to them. 
 
I am sure there are others on the list who would prefer to review the summary of this discussion before making any further comments! Chairs, any thoughts?

You'll have to excuse me for confusing people again. I also think of choreography in terms of roles, so it can support any number of services, but most of the time when I write down examples I use the term service. I did mean what you said and said not what I mean ;-)

Assaf 

I agree with your response completely, but with one exception. 

Choreographies should be expressed in terms of roles not services, e.g. 

Role J 
  activity A1 send request 

Role K 
  activity A2 receive request 

I think this is important as it enables reuse of the choreography definition, to take a more realistic example .. 

Buyer 
  activity order send request 

Seller 
  activity order receive request 

If you don't use roles then you would have . 

ABC Co Buyer service 
  activity order send request 

XYZ Inc Selling service 
  activity order receive request 

... and every interaction done in business would each have its own separate choreography. This won't scale. 

Choreography really should be abstract in order to enable reuse. This also applies to the message definition as well as the service.

Thoughts? 

David

I would tend to define a message as a container of information. The 
container notion is important because it lets you compose different bits 
of information that can be reused in different messages, and different 
bits of information may have different significance (e.g. the business 
request, the topic of request, the requesting party). WSDL does that 
pretty well. 

The message definition is that of a message at rest. It says nothing 
about which direction it goes on, or which service can consume or 
produce it. That information is provided by the operation. The operation 
tells you whether that message is an input or an output, and in fact 
what it signifies. The action then tells you which service is 
responsible for performing that operation either as the requestor or 
provider, and in relation to all other actions.

I think that the use of the term 'domain of control' depends on context. 
We can talk about who owns the definition, who runs the instance, even 
who serves the coffee. But I think there's a very clear and precise 
meaning in terms of choreography. 

Let's say that some service X sends a message (request) to service Y, 
service Y receives that message, does something and then sends back a 
response. Service X performs some activity A1 which sends the message. 
Service Y performs some activity A2 which receives the message, and 
later on some activity A3 which sends back a response. Service X and 
service Y belong to different domains of control. 

Service X can't just start an activity in service Y by wishful thinking. 
And ESP technology is not proven yet. So service X "coerces" service Y 
to start an activity by sending it a message. Service Y needs to perform 
two activities one after the other. Service Y has some unspecified means 
to do that, maybe because it has a big piece of Java code, or because it 
uses some internal mechanism to chain these activities together. But 
it's not important to express how these activities are chained together 
in the context of a choreography. 

So in the choreography we would say something like: 

service X 
  activity A1 send request 

service Y 
  activity A2 receive request 

We show the relation between two activities executing in different 
domains of control by expressing how they communicate, which is 
important information for both services to understand. 

On the other hand, the choreography definition of service Y could say 
something like: 

service Y 
  activity A2 receive request 
  activity A3 send response 

Exactly how service Y chains these two activities together is not 
interesting for service X (or any other service in the choreography). 
It's an implementation detail. Service Y may have some other message 
that is send by A2 to start A3, or it may update some record in the 
database, of have some person flicking switches on a big panel. That's 
not important. 

We show the relation between two activities executing in the same domain 
of control using some form of sequencing that does not require explicit 
form of communication, e.g. in a procedural way, using state transition 
diagrams, or by expressing a process flow 

(WSCI takes the third approach since it makes it easier to model 
activities that occur in parallel. Unfortunately, due to the choice of 
syntax - and I'll be first to take the blame - it is often confused with 
being procedural and non-cyclic despite the intent of the authors)
