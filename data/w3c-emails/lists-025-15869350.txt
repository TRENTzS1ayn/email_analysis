Agree, not all errors would result into stopping a conversation. And sometimes the conversation for which an error/exception is received has already exited (or never kicked off), which will not be an uncommon scenario, IMO.

I guess, an additional requirement for the specification would be to provide support for defining behavior of the system, when valid error/exception messages arrive for choreography instances after their completion (or before their initiation). 

We may want to look into the solutions offered by previous work for this problem, such as the PIP 0A1 by RosettaNet - http://www.rosettanet.org/PIP0A1

Remember to account for those 'errors' that are actually exceptions or
less traveled paths that may not be substantive in nature. Therefore,
the exception may or may not result in stop the conversation.
