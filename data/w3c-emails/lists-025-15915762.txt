The MIND Lab presentation in powerpoint was a quick throw together 
because we couldn't run the full composition demo.  Rather than 
include it, I would prefer people to go to 
http://www.mindswap.org/demos and click on the "Web Service Composer" 
which will take you to [1].  This page includes a link to examples of 
some web services marked up against the DAML-S model [2] and 
explicates a bit about what we are doing with them.  If you have Java 
Web Start installed (and are either outside a firewall or somewhere 
where normal ssh tunneling works) you can run the demo (described 
near the bottom of the page) which will take you to [3].  (note that 
the demo downloads and runs a fairly complex java program, so it may 
take a bit before the window shows up on some machines)

  the interface isn't totally intuitive, but a little fooling around 
and you should be able to make it work - I expect a "how to" file to 
be there in the near future.

  If you compose a couple of services and then hit the "display 
workflow" button, you'll see what I need choreography for in this -- 
I'd like that to return an executable set of WS calls that would run 
the appropriate composed service in some way where it could be 
grounded on various different service types (WSDL, Grid, etc.) and, 
in an ideal world, relocatable to other groundings with little or no 
human intervention.

  -Jim Hendler
p.s. If you hit the "run" button, the services will actually make 
appropriate calls to the web services via our server -- if this gets 
used to much, or abused, we may have to limit access to the demo - 
for now, however, we'll be trusting (naive) academics.
