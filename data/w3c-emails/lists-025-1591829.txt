There is potential conflict between the efforts of the Choreography WG and
the OASIS effort on WSBPEL.  I suggest that we should find a way to be
complementary.  This certainly is a more productive use of my time--I am
participating in both as a matter of business necessity.

The first step is to focus choreography on the external exchange and the
specification of the language which will be used to publish choreographies
as a basis for agreement on exchange protocols.  

We should encourage the BPEL effort to focus on the internal processes that
complement the choreography. A BPEL appication should incorporate a
choreography specification and specify processes that will support or comply
with the choreography.  The BPEL may then comprehend an enterprise haveing
one or more related processes that incorporate multiple choreographies to
accomplish broader business objectives.
