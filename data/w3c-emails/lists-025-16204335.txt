I agree. I think there should be:
a) an abstract definition of a choreography that is independent of SOAP and
WSDL, AND 
b) a binding of the choreography specification to SOAP and WSDL.

This will also make it easier to evolve the choreography specs as SOAP and
WSDL change and evolve - you just produce a new binding. If others want to
bindings, e.g. for ebXML or RosettaNet then they can.

I wasn't suggesting (nor was anyone, I think) that ebXML or RosettaNet 
bindings be included. But if you take a sufficiently abstract approach 
to specifying message exchange, and avoid restricting message contents 
to SOAP (for example), then using WS-Choreography with a variety of 
message formats would be possible. Cf. David Burdett's message asking 
for "detailed message format independence"
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-ws-chor/2003Mar/0084.html).
Although I am not sure he was envisioning things like ebXML signals.
