I picked this interesting definition from, or all places, pi-calculus:

A process is generally nothing more than a set of commitments.

+1 with a minor objection.

Some state transitions are better defined as graphs depicting the 
possible transitions between a finite set of states. For example from 
submitted to approved to pending to shipped. Other state transitions are 
not easily modeled as graphs like that. For example, if I have a price 
for the order and I need to add shipping & handling based on the 
destination and weight, the transition is from some number N to some 
other number N. Do I write a graph with all possible state transition s 
or are there some transitions not modeled as a graph? Can we identify 
more generically these two types of states and transitions?

WSDL interface defines some of the expected behavior of a service type 
and WS-Chor defines other part of that behavior. WSDL can also define an 
interface beloning to that type by associating it with the interface. 
However, somewhere along the actual concept of service type managed to 
escape and I think we need to introduce it in more generic terms than 
the particular type of WSDL definition used to capture its behavior.
