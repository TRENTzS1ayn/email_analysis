I am with Martin here: I thought we agreed at the F2F not to try to 
define orchestration.

Re the other proposed glossay terms, I do envision a glossary being part 
of the output of this group (or at least additions to the WSA glossary), 
but my understanding is that the near-term deliverable is a requirements 
doc. So I'd like to suggest that the priority should be to capture that 
part of the F2F + recent email discussion that bears on requirements.
