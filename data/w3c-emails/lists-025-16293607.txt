During the F2F, we did define orchestration as being the same as choreography. Any glossary item we have should just reflect that-e.g., orchestration: see choreography. A clear understanding of the meaning of choreography, however, will help in the capturing of requirements.

I am with Martin here: I thought we agreed at the F2F not to try to
define orchestration.

Re the other proposed glossay terms, I do envision a glossary being part
of the output of this group (or at least additions to the WSA glossary),
but my understanding is that the near-term deliverable is a requirements
doc. So I'd like to suggest that the priority should be to capture that
part of the F2F + recent email discussion that bears on requirements.
