Although "choreography" can be used to described low level protocol (even 
TCP).  I think the interests at this group is at the business protocol level.
I totally agree with you that some of the low level one are given (MEP is 
defining that), and so don't need to be expressed at the business level, 
they just refer to that.

The reason I use 2PC is because this is a well-known choreography to 
illustration the deficiency of the bi-party model.

Best regards,
Ricky
