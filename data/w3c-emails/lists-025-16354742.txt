Patil:

Having some sort of explicit error message is useful, however the
exception types must be limited to the ones that will be used in the
choreography definition to specify alternate paths, i.e. paths to
process the exceptions. I am not sure that you may need to specify a
different path whether the document is not well-formed, is not valid
because an element of the document is missing or an attribute content
does not conforms to its datatype. Of course you may want to convey back
the exact error message, but not as individual exception types.

So I concur with Assaf and don't think we need to detail a large number
of exceptions types.
