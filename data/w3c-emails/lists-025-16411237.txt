I am not suggesting that we define complex business processes (e.g. how to
place an order), I am suggesting that we define a language that allows
others to define these processes. I also think that this realistic to
accomplish. If you don't I would like to understand your reasons why?

Are we expanding the scope to encompass the complex business processes,
evident in B2B or bounding what we can realistically accomplish?

Thanks.
