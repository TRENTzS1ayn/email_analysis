  I quite like the definitions:
  - The process defined by an orchestration is executed by a single
  role/service type
  - The process defines by a choreography is executed by a combination of
all
  roles/service types

  ... but would add ...
  -  A process defined by an orchestration is constrained by the
choreographies in which the process takes part.

  How about:

  - The process defined by an orchestration is executed by a single
  role/service type
  - The process defines by a choreography is executed by a combination of
all
  roles/service types

  If I understand the other terminology list correctly then a message would
be
  something like a WSDL abstract message definition, and a representation
  would be the protocol binding/encoding. So if we express the choreography
in
  terms of WSDL operations (as WSCI and BPEL4WS do), it would meet the
  abstraction requirement.

  I know that there are issues with WSDL if you want more abstraction in the
  message definition. But I don't think this is a problem that occurs only
  when you use choreography, and I'm not sure if this group should try to
  solve it, though we should highlight problems/issues/proposals. I am fine
  working with WSDL here and then working in the WSD to improve what needs
to
  be improved. I'm not too excited about the possibility of redoing WSDL
  outside of the WSD WG.

  The way I see it, to draw a very loose analogy, is like interface,
abstract
  class and class. (Or if you like you can substitute abstract class with
some
  templating mechanism). A choreography is like a definition of interfaces
  that mesh together (think one interface per role for a second). An
  orchestration is like a class.

  An orchestration can be as full as the implementation (a concrete class),
or
  it can be less than an implementation (abstract or template) to the point
  where it's so abstract that it parallels the interface. In fact, if you
look
  at Java, an interface is an abstract class that has no non-abstract
methods.

  So one orchestration can extend another. I may have an orchestration:

  orch A
    do X
    ...
    do Z

  and another orchestration:

  orch B extends A
    do X
    do Y
    do Z

  orch A may say what my constraints are for participating in the
  choreography, and orch B may include some other things I do in private and
  may well be my implementation. Being able to say that orch B extends orch
A
  is useful because if I can understand how A fits with the choreography I
can
  also understand how B can fit. I may also have another orchestration
called
  C (a different implementation altogether):

  orch C extends A
    do X
    do U
    do V
    do Z
    do W

  but notice that both B and C extend A so I may use either of these
  implementation orchestrations for the choreography requiring me to use A.

  A behavioral type system based on mobile processes deals with exactly that
  kind of type checking: not just the input/output, but also the sequencing
  rules. (This example is simplified, but it can deal very well with more
  complex things like parallel flows, branching, exceptions, cycles, etc)
