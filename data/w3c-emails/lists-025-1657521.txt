[fac] This seems a bit too simplistic.  One could infer that a process
does'nt actually accomplish anything.

[fac] I wonder if we couldn't leave this discussion to the definition
of state transition.

type?  If not, what will distinguish one service type from another if not
the WSDL and choreography?
