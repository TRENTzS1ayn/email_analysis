Have we seen any official word from Microsoft on this yet? Rumours abound
in our business, and hopefully this one is not true. I cannot read the
article, it requires registration, so perhaps the text of the article
should be posted. Of course if MS wanted to address the question directly
through the mailing list, that would be okay too.

There is an article in Computerwire that says Microsoft has quit our group
already.

It sounds like they will work on choreography, in addition to
implementation specifications (e.g., BPEL4WS), somewhere else. I could see
an argument that implementation specifications could be done outside of
W3C, in spite of potential technical dependencies, but I would think that
choreography fits within the working area of the W3C quite well.
