Assaf, Ricky,

There is another dimension to changing participants assigned to
roles.  The question is when can the entity behind the URI change. For
example, it is possible that a participant wants to receive initial
requests at one URI and redirect subsequent actions to different
URIs, potentially depending on the nature of the request or
the availability of resources.  The entity could be the same
but the requests are directed to different processes or business
units within the entity, or simply to different servers.

From a business standpoint, the participant sending the messages
wants to know who he is dealing with.  Is it acceptable to have his
messages redirected to a different entity?  I think this gets us into
questions about the content and security of the messages, and beyond
the scope of the choreography.

A participant should be able to delegate to an "agent" to continue
the exchange.  The delegation will require more than a simple "change
of address."  The agent must be able to speak for the principal,
and have appropriate credentials.

So, I think dynamic changes to a participant (i.e., URI) assigned to 
a role should be considered something quite acceptable at the 
discretion of the participant.  It should make no difference in the
choreography because the role remains the same. The message structure
and content must provide for communication of such changes along with the 
appropriate credentials to be associated with the new URI.
