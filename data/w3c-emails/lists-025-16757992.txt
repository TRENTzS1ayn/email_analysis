Hi, 

        I've been lurking in on the discussion, very interesting and useful
it is too. 

        I thought that there are a couple of things that might be
interesting for people: 

        -  I have made a document that we have built for Agentcities
available at  <http://193.113.27.14/services/documents/DAML-Sacs.pdf>
http://193.113.27.14/services/documents/DAML-Sacs.pdf 

        - I would like to draw your attention to the openNet project that is
currently in formation before submission to the EU for funding 

         <http://www.agentcities.org/openNet/>
http://www.agentcities.org/openNet/ 
        It would certainly be good to have a link between openNet and
ws-chor, but I don't really know how to make that happen... - suggestions
welcome. 

        - and of course Agentcities itself 
         <http://www.agentcities.net> http://www.agentcities.net 
        

        Si.
