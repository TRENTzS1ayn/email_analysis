I briefly commented on that in the WSD or perhaps WSA (hard to keep 
track) ongoing discussion about using URIs to identify services.

I think that a service needs the concept of an address. The address can 
contain multiple points of contacts. For example, the service could say: 
use this URI between 5 to 9 and the other URI the rest of the time. Or 
use this URI if you can sign/encrypt messages and another URI if you opt 
to use SSL. So it should be able to represent an address that is more 
than just one URI, maybe by providing a WSDL service definition or 
something akin to WS-Addressing.

Perhaps a change of address could be addressed out-of-band using a more 
generic protocol that is not specific to the choreography, so all 
choreographies could leverage that capability without having to 
complicate all of them. Whether a buyer can allow the seller to change 
its point of contact midway through a choreography would depend on the 
use of this protocol, keeping the choreography simple.

But there's still needs to be some ability for a participant to be 
replaced at the discretion of all remaining participants, as per the 
choreography definition (i.e. the fact must be communicated to all 
affected parties). And also for the participant to be able to delegate 
responsibilities to other participants. For example, as a seller I may 
not be able to fulfill the order but I may delegate that to some other 
seller (by special agreement with that seller). Since that should occur 
at specific states and should not cover the buyer, it should be 
expressed in the choreography.

So these are three different use cases, and I think only the last two 
are something we should be addressing at some point.
