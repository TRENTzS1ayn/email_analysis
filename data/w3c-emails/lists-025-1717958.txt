[fac] An "address" implies location, I prefer to use "entity" as
implying a point of accountability/responsibility, as in "legal
entity."  

A "service" is something an entity is willing to provide or perform.
An entity might perform a variety of services.  It might provide
alternative services through the same interface, although we might
then just consider it a composite service (a service consisting of
services).  Maybe a service reduces to a role an entity is willing
to perform.  In which case, maybe all we need to talk about is
roles.

[fac] This sounds good to me.

[fac] I think the issue becomes how transparent can the redirection
be.  This depends on the nature of the transaction.  If the buyer
is given the opportunity to accept or reject the delegation by the
seller, then this will show up in the choreography.  If, on the
other hand, delegation is just accepted, then it just becomes a 
footnote in a message, and is not relevant to the choreography.

As a practical matter, if I submit an order to A, I don't expect
to receive an invoice from B unless there is some notice of 
transfer of responsibility.  But if I receive an invoice from A
sent from a different address, or directing payment be sent to
a different address, that's probably okay, as long as I can
authenticate the sender as A.  This issue is the legality of 
the delegation, not the addresses involved.

[fac]I think there are still three issues/cases to consider:

1) Different addresses for the same entity in the same role.

2) Transparent, dynamic redirection of messages for a role.

3) Redirection that requires some explicit acceptance or 
acknowledgement (probably because there are accountability
implications).
