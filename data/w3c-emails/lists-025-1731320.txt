I would suggest these initial set of definition comments confirms that 
we should have a very basic set of core glossary terms first. As we 
define our requirements and context we will have a better idea what 
further definitions are appropriate and what they actually entail.

I'll take these initial comments and try to represent them in the 
document, concentrating on a discrete set for first round, and label the 
others as future consideration.

Simple 'correlation': red is scarlet is blood is wine is rose...well.
