I am not convinced (at least, not yet) that this couldn't be 
accomplished by either expanding the number of allowed participants in 
the choreography, or making the set of participants open-ended (dynamic 
participation in the sense it has been discussed earlier).

E.g. if I can start an interaction and then delegate to another party to 
finish it, then perhaps the choreography should explicitly allow that 
party to "join" mid-conversation, and initiate or respond to one or more 
of the possible interactions.

Fred actually gives some good reasons why you wouldn't want to 
dynamically change the binding of a role during the scope of a 
choreography execution, security being one of them .. although depending 
on exactly how things were implemented, this might or might not be an 
actual problem. E.g. you could make "rebind role" be an explicit step in 
the process, and have it imply re-authentication.

Another comment: per my earlier remark, some business justification for 
this facility would be helpful.
