The business case is me submitting an order and before the order gets 
processed I would like to change it. Changing an order may be more cost 
effective than cancelling the order and starting from fresh.

There are a lot of things I can ask you to change. Some of them affect 
which products you would send me, others affect how you would package 
them, or whether you would ship them on the same day or in multiple 
steps. Some of them affect where you would be sending stuff.

If long-lasting means anywhere between one minute and 24 hours, then 
worst case if something has to be decided later or change, we'll just 
abort the choreography and start a new one. But if long-lasting is 
unconstrained, I want to account for the possibility that some things 
may happen and be able to accept them and carry on without scrapping 
everything.

Also, I like to think outside the box. There's an implicit assumption 
that as a supplier all the services for ordering, invoicing, payment, 
shipping, etc are handled at the same location (one address). On the 
other hand there are many companies who would like to outsource these 
services - they may do the marketing but outsource the inventory to one 
service provider and the invoicing to another. WS is one of the enabling 
technologies for service outsourcing, so let's factor that as a use case 
we want to support not shun from.
