Hi:

Fred has raised good points. I see the BPEL vs Choreography effort as similar
to that of workflow technology vs agent technology, respectively. I'm enclosing
one of my earlier papers on how these technologies can be modeled together. In
fact, my paper adopts an approach similar to that enunciated by Fred.

After reading the discussions about defining conversations and choreographies,
I feel that the ideas in my paper can be useful here. Hence I look forward to
feedback on my paper.

Thanks a lot.

best regards,
-NCN
