Assaf,

Do you think the Choreography model should allow constraints being 
specified among roles which is independent of the message exchange ?  For 
example in an "auction" scenario, lets say there is a "potential buyer" 
role and "ultimate buyer" role.  And I want to specify the following 
constraints regardless of the flow (in fact, I want to validate the flow 
conform to such constraint) ....  These are my required constraints

1) There can be multiple entities binded to the role "potential buyer", but 
only one entity binded to the role "ultimate buyer".
2) The entity binded to "ultimate buyer" must be one of the entities who 
previously binded to "potential buyer"
3) Once the "ultimate buyer" is binded, no further binding of "potential 
buyer" should happen

Do you think the choreography model should allow such constraints being 
specified ?

Rgds,
Ricky
