Hi,

You are right. If you want more and you work on the top of WSDL + UDDI
stack, a
tModel is the place where you can define what your service does perform.

However, in my opinion,  WSDL should be for service description, so that
it should describe also service type in its generic meaning.

Best regards,
Stanislaw
