Dear Diane and John,

Congratulations on the formation of the WS BPEL TC in OASIS.

As co-chairs of the W3C Web Services Choreography working group we
understand the efforts that will be involved, and wish you the best of
luck.

We firmly believe that the orchestration/choreography is a big space.
Furthermore we believe that there is room for non-overlapping specs in
this area, that can lead to a family of complimentary languages. This
will benefit the community and more importantly customers. It is our
intention to liaise closely with groups in this space in a manner that is
constructive and non-intrusive, in order to ensure we can provide
maximum benefit to the community and customers.

With the formation of your group, the WS BPEL TC, and the focus of your
groups work we would very much like to pursue a liaison with you. In
addition the two groups will no doubt have common requirements on other
groups such as, for example, the need for end-point references in WSDL
1.2. We feel it makes sense to explore these requirements together and
submit them to the appropriate group as one voice, albeit from two
groups.

To further explore possible liaisons and to ensure that we understand how
we can be of mutual benefit we cordially invite you to our next face to
face meeting on 18-20 June in Chicago. We would like you to meet the
group, of which we share a considerable overlap in membership, and talk
about ways in which we can work together for mutual benefit.

For the purpose of clarity, we are not requiring you to join the working
group to pursue this, merely to attend the face to face meeting as
invited guests. Please let us know if you are interested and we can
forward on registration and logistics information when they become
available.

Best regards,

 Martin Chapman (Oracle) & Steve Ross-Talbot (Enigmatec)
 Co-chairs W3C Choreography Working Group
