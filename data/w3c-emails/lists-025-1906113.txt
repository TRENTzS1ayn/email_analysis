This is a good guideline for people who design the choreography flow.  But 
I'm not sure this is relevant to us (who define the choreography model 
itself).
In a multi-party choreography, each party has his own goal.  Are we talking 
about ALL parties fulfill (or give up) their goal before the choreography 
instance end ?

I think the same way before.  But I think this is less clear after seeing 
Assaf's comment.
For example, if I'm a seller who want to start a choreography instance to 
conduct an Auction.  Lets say this auction is open to public and the seller 
no idea about who will buy.  Does it mean that the choreography cannot be 
started until the seller receive the first proposal ?
I think the minimum requirement is at least one role being binded, not sure 
about two role.

One entity can also bind to more than one roles of the same choreography 
instance.

Not sure about the first statement ("subject to at least 2 bound roles 
remaining ...")
I think any roles can leave or join at any time as long as the choreography 
flow definition demand or permit.

+1.  But the number of entities that can be bound SIMULTANEOUSLY to one 
role doesn't have to be finite.
