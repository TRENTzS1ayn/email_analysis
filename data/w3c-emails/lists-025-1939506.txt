Gentlebeings,

      I'm attaching a white paper written by my colleague Len Greski on the
CSF technique, as well as some links to CSF-related material on the Web.
Hopefully this will prove useful to those not yet familiar with this
technique.

Here are some links:

Here are references to Rockart's original papers on the subject, the first
one being the original paper:
