heavy stuff for sure but thought I ought to send it in regardless.

Kobayshi's papers on deadlock free, livelock free and time boundedness 
in processes using pi and linear types.

Yoshida's papers on similar things (with Honda who did async pi)

http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~yoshida/paper-ic.html#TYPES

 From a formal perspective what we need to understand is what 
restrictions have been placed on pi by Yoshida and by Kobayashi in 
order to get freedom from livelock and deadlock and to ensure time 
boundedness. Not something I can do right now but I am on the case.


Lucian Wischik's papers on pi/fusion and web services (most of you have 
this stuff from Lucian already)

Happy reading ....
