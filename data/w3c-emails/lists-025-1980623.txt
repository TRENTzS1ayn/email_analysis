As requested in the conference call, here is the use case that I described.
 
In this use case, two businesses agree at the business level, that they want
to do business with each other electronically (e.g a buyer wants to place
orders with a seller). Once the business agreement is reached, the
technology to enable the businesses to interoperate and exchange business
documents needs to be set up. This involves agreement on such things as:
1. The business documents and messages that will be used
2. Use of reliable messaging and security technologies
3. The choreographies that will be used (i.e. the sequence in which the
messages will be exchanged)
 
In order to reach agreement, the businesses conduct an automatic negotiation
with each other that consists of the following steps:
1. Sharing with each other, information about the documents, messages,
reliable messaging, security and choreographies that each supports,
2. Identifying the common set of information that both businesses support
3. Where there are multiple choices of techology, agreeing between them the
optimum set of technologies they will actually use which they then record in
an agreement for future reference
 
For all the information that is shared (including choreographies) there is a
comment requirement that the information is classified or categorized in a
way which allows the negotiation and agreement to occur.
