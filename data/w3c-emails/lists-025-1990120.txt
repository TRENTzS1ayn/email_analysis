David, I am sorry I missed the call today and therefore I do not know the context in which this use case was discussed. 
 
From reading the use case itself, I am not able to identify the relevance of his use case to our working group. I guess the use case mainly references activities such as classifying information, negotiating the information, formulating agreement, etc. 
 
The use case itself is very clear to me (having participated in ebXML and other B2B forums) and I can see how it can be relevant to other Web services related groups, in particular Web services architecture, Description or a Registry group. 
 
However as far as choreography is concerned, the only relevant requirement arising from the use case I can see is - an ability to describe and classify the choreography. Is there more in the use case that I may have missed?

Subject: Use case on choreography negotiation


As requested in the conference call, here is the use case that I described.
 
In this use case, two businesses agree at the business level, that they want to do business with each other electronically (e.g a buyer wants to place orders with a seller). Once the business agreement is reached, the technology to enable the businesses to interoperate and exchange business documents needs to be set up. This involves agreement on such things as:
1. The business documents and messages that will be used
2. Use of reliable messaging and security technologies
3. The choreographies that will be used (i.e. the sequence in which the messages will be exchanged)
 
In order to reach agreement, the businesses conduct an automatic negotiation with each other that consists of the following steps:
1. Sharing with each other, information about the documents, messages, reliable messaging, security and choreographies that each supports,
2. Identifying the common set of information that both businesses support
3. Where there are multiple choices of techology, agreeing between them the optimum set of technologies they will actually use which they then record in an agreement for future reference
 
For all the information that is shared (including choreographies) there is a comment requirement that the information is classified or categorized in a way which allows the negotiation and agreement to occur.
