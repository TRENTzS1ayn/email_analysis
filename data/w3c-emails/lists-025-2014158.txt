Here are some answers to questions in your document:

Interface is PortType's new name. I am not sure that this change has
been reflected in their draft yet, but John's definition looks right.

The Web service definition has been a source of _long_ discussions in
the Web Services Architecture Working Group and has been discussed
again lately, but there are still disagreements about it.

Regarding service types, what happened to Sanjiva's proposal? It seems
that the name "service type" echoes the name "port type" which was
dropped for interface. There may be a better name for it (or not --
just my 2 cents).

Regarding the rest of the definitions where my name was mentioned, I
am not sure where exactly we are standing and if we are ready to deal
with discrepancies with the WSG.

Regards,

Hugo
