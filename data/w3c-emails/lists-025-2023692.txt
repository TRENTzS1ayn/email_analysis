"My" definition is from the WSA glossary and should be credited to that.

There was a workable definition of service type at one point in WSDL 1.2 
  but it's not in the current draft. Unlike "port type", I don't think 
it's been renamed, just dropped. See 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-wsdl12-20030303/#changelog. If we require 
this, IMO the requirement needs to be fed to ws-descr.
