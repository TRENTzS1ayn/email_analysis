I agree, which is why we might have no option but to define our own way of
doing, or, alternatively, write our own separate spec in a way that could be
used by others.

There are many small specs which need standardization like this. For example
there is no standard way to specify a "MessageId" on a SOAP message. IMO, it
would be a good idea if these separate specs were developed somewhere.

I'm not so sure about this as most of the candidates are not in a final 
release form, nor am I aware of a timeline for getting them there.
