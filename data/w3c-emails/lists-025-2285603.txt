Subject: Draft Choreography Spec


Here, as promised, is a *draft* of the WS Choreography specification that
expands on the sample XML for a Choreography definition that I provided in
April [1]. It includes a number of additional features that were not
illustrated by the earlier example but is essentially the same. The zip file
at [2] contains:
1. The draft WS Choreography spec as a PDF
2. The Choreography XML Schema
3. Sample XML choreography definitions.
 
Also please note that the copyright statement in the spec reserves Commerce
One's rights to the specification. However, if the WS Choreography group
sees fit to want to take this specification further, then Commerce One will
donate their IP in the spec to the W3C.
