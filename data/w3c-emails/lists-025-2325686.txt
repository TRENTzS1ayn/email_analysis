I'm not sure actually there was agreement.

My take was that it was necessary for implementations to support 
simultaneous execution. The assertion was made that this requires 
conveyance of instance identity. I think this is actually true, but I 
considered the mechanism for it out of scope for this WG. Others, 
however, do seem to think it is in scope.
