I can't point you to a concrete use case, but typically any type of
automated auction involves time as follow:
1. The time the auction starts
2. The time (and sequence) in which the bids are placed, and
3. The time when the auction closes.

Think of doing an eBay auction but using SOAP/XML documents instead.

Hope this helps.

David
PS. Everyone, do we want to include this as a use case for choreography?

Hello Everyone,

For my work I am looking for well defined Choreography use cases which 
involve time as first-class citizen, explicitly at the specification 
level. Does anyone have any idea about where they can be found. Any help 
in this regards is well appreciated.

Thanks,

Monika
