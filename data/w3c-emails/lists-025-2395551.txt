<DB> +1 ... and this is *exactly* what I tried to do in the WS-Choreography spec. However since this is the WS Choreography group I think we *also* have to define how the our Choreography spec binds to web services.</DB>

+1 to defining how WS-Choreography binds to Web services. 

The Charter specifically says: "The language(s) should build upon the foundation of the WSDL 1.2". 

WSDL 1.2 defines interfaces and end points. If we don't at least define some precise mapping between WS-Choreography and WSDL interfaces, then I don't see in which way we are building "upon the foundation of WSDL 1.2".
