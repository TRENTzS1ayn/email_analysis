[FAC] I believe we can do that without sacrificing broader applicability of the choreography.  I'm more concerned that we not link the choreography to the message formats. 

If your concern is about about linking the choreography to the message formats on the wire, I would like to point out, as I have done before, that a portType/interface message structure does not imply any commitment to a format on the wire. It's only when the portType/interface is bound to a particular service that the wire format is defined.
