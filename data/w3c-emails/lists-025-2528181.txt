You left out addressing (to/from/reply to/fault to). Yes, IMO these are 
fundamental facilities. They are really below choreography in the 
overall WS stack, although choreography is a user of them. Ideally you 
need them closely integrated with WSDL, because there are WSDL 
constructs such as MEPs that cannot be reasonably implemented without 
them (see related thread in WSA).

But as to how best to make this happen, I am not sure.
