Message Ids, and time information, although very useful may not be easy to
define in an absolute manner. A requirement to have globally unique MsgIds
is too restrictive to be acceptable, as some devices won't be able to
generate them (and it puts restriction on choreographies using such Ids).

I would be interested to see them, why not involve XMLP as well?
