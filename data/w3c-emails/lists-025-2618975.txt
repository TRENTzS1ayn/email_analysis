Perhaps this is something that should be done by XMLP - I don't have a
problem with that. However I think that the implementation of a solution
that is using the choreography definition specification that this group will
produce NEEDS information in the SOAP header such as Conversation Id,
Message Id, etc.

This, in turn, makes our spec dependent on the existence of such specs that
we can reference in our own work.

So I think this IS an issue for us which means that perhaps we should make
it a formal liaison point/request with XMLP.

Does this make sense?

mm1: I believe, if only informally, this discussion has occurred in 
XMLP.  Dave, can you please re-address this with XMLP and let us 
concentrate on what is our primary objective? Thanks.
