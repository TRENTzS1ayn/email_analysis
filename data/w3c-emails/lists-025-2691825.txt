A very good point Martin - I was presuming "a" solution which is perhaps
premature.

So let's do this the "right" way and think about it in terms of requirements
so here's my $0.02c on what they might be ...

Requirement 1
If a message is being sent between roles as part of the "performance" of a
choreography, then that message MUST identify the "choreography instance" to
which it belongs

Requirement 2
A choreography instance MAY be identified by specifying a unique identifier
in "metadata" (e.g. a SOAP header) associated with the message.

Requirement 3
A choreography instance MAY be identified by referencing a combination of
one or items of data in the "payload(s)" (e.g. the SOAP body and/or
attachments) of the message.

To make these complete, we should also define, roles, performance,
choreography instance, metadata and payload, but that can come later!

Thoughts?

David

This is of course assuming a certain solution. 
We should discus whether we would like a specific solution (e.g. message
ids) or a generic correlation 
mechanism e.g like that found in BPEL, where any parts of a message header
or body can be defined as the 
correlation "keys" for a particular choreography instance. Lets discuss the
relative merits and requirements 
and then we can work out the appropriate actions and group(s) to talk to.

Martin.
