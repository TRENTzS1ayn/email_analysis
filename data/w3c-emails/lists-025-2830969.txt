I would like to understand why it is important to leave so many different
ways of carrying correlation information.  Our job is to produce a
specification that will ensure interoperability.  If there are an infinite
number of ways to communicate correlation information, then we haven't
really specified anything, have we?  
 
The reason I am probing this is because I want to understand what is the
underlying "requirement" that we avoid being prescriptive.  It clearly would
be a benefit to the entire industry if we could stick with your requirements
1 & 2, except change 2 to specify exactly which header field MUST contain
the choreography instance id.  Why is it that "you don't want to have to be
forced to use an identifier in the header."?  Seems to me that the effort
and cost to put this in a consistent place would be far less effort and cost
that would be incurred by coding all the various point-to-point variations
due to each implementation using a different way of coding correlation
information.

Monica 

The reason I included requirements 2 and 3 is that they reflect two use
cases ... 

If we assume that there has to be some data in the message that can be used
for correlation when the message is taking part in a choreography then
requirement 2 arises becaus it is possible that there is no data in the
payload (or anywhere else) that can be used for correlation purposes.

Requirement 3 arises because there maybe data that can be used in the
payload and therefore you don't want to have to be forced to use an
identifier in the header.

However, I can also see your point that the existing requirement definitions
could be a bit too presrcriptive, so how about these as alternatives, I've
added a fourth requirement which hopefully makes it clearer. The complete
set is as follows ...

Requirement 1 (not changed) 
If a message is being sent between roles as part of the "performance" of a
choreography, then that message MUST identify the "choreography instance" to
which it belongs.

Requirement 2 (changed) 
A choreography instance MUST be identified by specifying a separate
identifier associated with the payloads in the message where there is no
combination of data in the "payload(s)" that can be used to uniquely
identify the choreography instance that is being performed.

Requirement 3 (changed) 
A choreography instance MAY be identified by referencing a combination of
one or more items of data in the "payload(s)" of the message where that
combination of data can be used to uniquely identify the choreography
instance that is being performed.

Requirement 4 (new) 
A choreography  instance MAY be identified by specifying a separate
identifier associated with payload(s) in the message even if there is a
combination of data in the "payload(s)" that can be used to uniquely
identify the choreography instance that is being performed.

mm1: I would suggest on Reqt 2 and 3 that we specify the requirement not 
the solution, of which these requirements appear to do both.  
Particularly, a choreography instance may be referenced, - do we specify 
how?
