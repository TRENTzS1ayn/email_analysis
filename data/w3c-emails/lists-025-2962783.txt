If you can participate in multiple threads of discussion at the same 
time, than a simple header is not going to buy you much. You need a more 
extensible mechanism for correlation. Although you'll have to specify 
that per choreography, specifying it means it's specified. Once 
specified there is exactly one way to communicate it, and so you can 
ensure interoperability.

The correlation mechanism in BPEL and WSCI is fairly generic but very 
precise in its specification, and so allows for more complex use cases 
that more simplified (one header) mechanisms can't deal with. Having 
implemented it, I can attest that it's easy to use in a manner than 
ensures interoperability.

However, in the simple case it's redundant. In the simple case you would 
not use this mechanism, but rather get the correlation from the message 
header. Two options that seem to work very well for us are using the 
sequence group (RM), or using an addressing mechanism where each service 
is addressed by a instance-specific address.

A header used specificaly to indicate the choreography instance seems 
like the simple solution to a simple problem, but from the more 
interesting use cases we have, it seems to be too restrictive and hard 
on the implementation. Notice that other specifications that work that 
way tend to create a gap between the interaction and the excutable, but 
specifications that work in the "non intuitive" way (like BPEL and BPML) 
can seamlessly do both things. Perhaps that's a lesson to be learned there.

Just my 2c
