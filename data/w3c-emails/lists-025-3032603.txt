I agree that we should not define a correlation solution, however I think
our success is dependent on the existence of one as described in "The specs
we need ..." email.

Do you agree?

Subject: Re: Correlation Requirements


Yes, I have looked at WS-Context. It could be used for the purposes that 
have been discussed in this thread.

I don't think this is really a choreography requirement at all. 
Correlation is a general requirement for effective use of Web services 
in multiple ways, including composite applications, choreography, 
transactions, and asynchronous processing.

Unfortunately there are multiple emerging standards in this area (of 
which WS-Context is one).

I do not think WS-Choreography can, or should, take on this problem.

In particular I do not think we should get specific about header 
information required for choreography participants. This issue is going 
to get resolved eventually, external to this group. (It would be nice if 
there was one agreed-on resolution, but the outcome may be there's more 
than one way to handle it). When that happens some re-alignment of 
WS-Choreography with other standards may be necessary.

But meanwhile IMO it is possible to make progress in the choreography 
area without having a resolution to this issue (and IMO any resolution 
at this point by this group would be premature).
