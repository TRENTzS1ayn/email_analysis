Actually, I do, but perhaps we disagree on the timing of the resolution. 
It is possible that by the time we are going into final draft there will 
be a reasonably mature mechanism for this, or maybe the choice of a 
couple of ones, so we can leverage parallel work that is already going 
on. Probably also we need to think harder about how a choroegraphy 
description might be used with BPEL. This is going to be a FAQ, I am sure.
