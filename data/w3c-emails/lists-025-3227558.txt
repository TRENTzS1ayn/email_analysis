OK, so should we set up liaisons with other groups, and if so, which ones?

I also agree with your comments about relationship with BPEL. I think that
using a choreography definition to automatically and indpenently check that
the execution of a BPEL defintion is following it correctly, is one reason
as it then removes the need for the BPEL spec to check for errors.

Actually, I do, but perhaps we disagree on the timing of the resolution. 
It is possible that by the time we are going into final draft there will 
be a reasonably mature mechanism for this, or maybe the choice of a 
couple of ones, so we can leverage parallel work that is already going 
on. Probably also we need to think harder about how a choroegraphy 
description might be used with BPEL. This is going to be a FAQ, I am sure.
