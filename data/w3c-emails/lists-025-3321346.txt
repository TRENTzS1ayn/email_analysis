Makes sense to me.

David,
 
I think the different document formats that you are talking about would
correspond to different concrete bindings of the same abstract WSDL
interface, probably corresponding to different ports (your point 1 below).
So my assumption would be that the two parties exchanging the concrete
document format would both be capable of dealing with that particular
binding (otherwise they would not be talking directly to each other, and
some kind of intermediary node would be interposed between them which would
translate from one concrete message format to the other). Part of the
binding definition would be the knowledge of how to find inside the concrete
message the parts that were defined at the abstract level as components of
the correlation.

Assaf 

Having rechecked the BPEL spec, I agree that having multiple ways to
identify a choreography instance makes sense. It also seems that the exact
way in which you do correlation will depend on the implementation. For
example a sales management application may accept orders in various
different document formats, e.g. UBL, RosettaNet, EDI, etc.

I am wondering how this would work from a practical perspective as the
service that receives the message MUST know where to look for the data that
acts as the correlation. Also, what do you do if there is no data in the
payload that can be used for correlation purposes?

For the first problem I can think of two ways of making it work: 
1. You send the messages to different ports (URLs) depending on the format
of the message, or 
2. You have something in the header of the message that identifies the type
of the message which can then be used to identify where to look for
correlation purposes.

Thoughts? 

David

If you can participate in multiple threads of discussion at the same 
time, than a simple header is not going to buy you much. You need a more 
extensible mechanism for correlation. Although you'll have to specify 
that per choreography, specifying it means it's specified. Once 
specified there is exactly one way to communicate it, and so you can 
ensure interoperability. 

The correlation mechanism in BPEL and WSCI is fairly generic but very 
precise in its specification, and so allows for more complex use cases 
that more simplified (one header) mechanisms can't deal with. Having 
implemented it, I can attest that it's easy to use in a manner than 
ensures interoperability. 

However, in the simple case it's redundant. In the simple case you would 
not use this mechanism, but rather get the correlation from the message 
header. Two options that seem to work very well for us are using the 
sequence group (RM), or using an addressing mechanism where each service 
is addressed by a instance-specific address. 

A header used specificaly to indicate the choreography instance seems 
like the simple solution to a simple problem, but from the more 
interesting use cases we have, it seems to be too restrictive and hard 
on the implementation. Notice that other specifications that work that 
way tend to create a gap between the interaction and the excutable, but 
specifications that work in the "non intuitive" way (like BPEL and BPML) 
can seamlessly do both things. Perhaps that's a lesson to be learned there. 

Just my 2c
