It seems to me that we need to be practical in our approach and focus on 
solving a problem in the world of WS. If in the future we would find a 
different architecture, we can always carry the lessons learned and work 
out a solution for that architecture. But at this point I just don't see 
the benefit of doing anything that is not WS related.
