Dear Colleagues,

Sorry, I am behind in with my email due to holidays (and also in my reading
of the Use case document) so may be ignoring subsequent discussion, but I
would have thought that we should consider including this as a use case, if
we do not already have support for the following requirements:

The WS-Chorography language needs to be able to express relative time
dependencies (and possibly absolute time dependencies as well).

I am not assuming that we will agree this requirement - only suggesting we
should consider it.

Best Regards,

Tony

Monika

I can't point you to a concrete use case, but typically any type of
automated auction involves time as follow: 1. The time the auction starts 2.
The time (and sequence) in which the bids are placed, and 3. The time when
the auction closes.

Think of doing an eBay auction but using SOAP/XML documents instead.

Hope this helps.

David
PS. Everyone, do we want to include this as a use case for choreography?
