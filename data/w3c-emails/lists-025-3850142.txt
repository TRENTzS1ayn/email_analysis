David, I perfectly agree with all these three options and the fact that 
there's no right one.

In all three cases, if I read them correctly, it seems that you would be 
doing different activities depending on which path you follow. It may be 
a different choreography (hence different activity) or different 
activities in the same larger (composed or not) choreography. So it's 
easy to associate a different operation with each activity, and build 
these operations using a common set of types.

For example, you can define a generic type for a PO, a specific type for 
a local PO and a specific type for an export PO (extended to include 
export-related information). You then use the appropriate type when 
defining the operation to perform as part of a particular flow. So you 
get a lot of commonality which helps the implementation - you can have 
one way to handle billing or item allocation for both cases - but you 
also have specific knowledge of which message type is used where.

Would this approach be consistent with what you had in mind?
