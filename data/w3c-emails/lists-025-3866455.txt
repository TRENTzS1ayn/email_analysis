This is a technical definition which we should observe as a minimum
requirement
of our efforts.  However, I believe we need to comprehend a business
definition
which should not be locked into SOAP and HTTP unless that is the only way to
achieve a practical solution

For your reference, you can find the latest definition of a Web service, as
specified by the Web Services Architecture WG, at

I agree with David's approach. I personally believe we should develop a
solution that has broad
application--it will survive longer and be more robust.  However, if you
want to constrain the
solution to "web services," you need to define what "web services" is/are.
HTTP and SOAP
are current implementations.  I expect this to evolve, and I expect there
will be other
techniques that should fit under the choreography and business process
specifications.  I 
am also concerned that I should be able to develop applications and define
business processes
that are independent of how their messages are exchanged--so they may use
"web services" 
or MOM, transparently.
