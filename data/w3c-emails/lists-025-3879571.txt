Here, I believe, is a new use case to consider.

In OMG, we are defining standard interfaces to business
process/workflow systems to achieve interoperability 
between different products.  The proposal submitted
by EDS and others defines these interfaces using
web services.

The interfaces are generic to business process/workflow
systems, in other words, the same interfaces would be
used for any type of business exchange.  Through the
same interface, any supported process could be invoked
and any processes could participate in an exchange, but
the WSDL operations are generic, not specific to the
business exchange.

Consequently, a choreography would define the exchange
of messages for a particular type of business transaction,
but the type of transaction and the types of messages
would be defined by the type of exchange initiated and
the types of messages exchanged as determined by message
content.  Similarly, only generic roles would be defined
in the WSDL, where specific roles would be needed for 
reference by the choreography.

It should be possible for a process execution environment
to support these generic interfaces and still participate
in a variety of web services exchanges, based only on
the processes initiated and the types of messages exchanged.
Perhaps the roles are implied by the message type sent by
the initiator.
