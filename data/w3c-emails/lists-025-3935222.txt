My $0.02c would be that the choreography definition should specify *what*
decision has to be made but not *how* the decision is made as it is
implementation dependent. For example decisions that can validly go in a
choreography are:
- Loops, for example sending the same message multiple times as in sending a
"request for quote" to multiple suppliers
- Decisions, for example specifying a compensating action if a message is
not delivered.

I think you may very well need some type of business retry parameters in 
order to accommodate business requirements.
