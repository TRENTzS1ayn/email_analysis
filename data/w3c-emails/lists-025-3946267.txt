It all depends, for example I can think of three ways of solving this
problem all of which could be appropriate depending on the circumstances.

1. IT's A BUSINESS PROCESS
You could imagine a business process (i.e. it's under the control of a
single entity) that decides independently which of two choreographies to
use. In this case, the decision would probably be part of a BPEL or some
other process-oriented language and not in the choreography

2. IT's A COMPOSED CHOREOGRAPHY
In this case you have two separate choreographies one for
"export-restricted" and one for "non-export restricted" orders. These
separately defined choreographies are then referenced by a third higher
level choreography that uses "choreography composition" to combine them.

3. IT's ONE BIG CHOREOGRAPHY
This is similar to the second example above, except that all the
interactions in the choreoraphy are in one single choreography definition so
there is no referencing of separately defined choreographies.

Which style you use is a choreography design decision that depends on such
things as:
a) Whether all the parties involved need to know about combined choreography
or can treat them as separate. If they don't then you can do the BPEL
approach, if they do, then you need to do have one big choreography of
compose two choreographies.
b) The degree of commonality between the choreographies, if they are
similar, then you might want to do one big choreography to avoid the
duplication.
c) Whether or not there are some pre-existing choreographies that you can
just reuse. If they already exist then a composed choreography could be the
way to go.

As in all design decisions, there is rarely one right way of doing things
that applies to all situations ...

Hope this helps

David

Are you saying that a choreography would select one of two alternative 
flows based on this state, or that there are two different 
choreographies, depending on which type of order is being sent?
