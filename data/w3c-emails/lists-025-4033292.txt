Assaf,

A few comments about modelling data inline.

While I see your point, this must be approached with some care: each 
system typically has a different way of modelling addresses and line 
items.  While the concepts "address" and "line item" are well 
understood by the humans, the realisation of these in a common 
framework is particularly difficult and often requires the application 
of external standards.  Consider the effort that has gone into 
ontologies and data modelling for RosettaNet and OAGIS.  My preference 
would be to have concrete "bindings" both to the underlying service 
infrastructure and to the ontology in a manner independent of the 
abstract choreography definition.  So for example, we "bind" PO from an 
abstract choreography definition to the RosettaNet definition for a 
particular community and infrastructure.

That said, if the behaviour of participants in a choreography 
definition explicitly references particular data, then it must be 
modelled.  The approach I've taken in my model is to allow the language 
to apply functions to typed items.  For example, the billing address 
associated with a purchase order would be expressed as 
BillingAddress(PO) in the choreography definition.  In this way, we do 
not constrain the structure of the data, but explicitly reference those 
aspects of data that are relevant in the choreography specification.
