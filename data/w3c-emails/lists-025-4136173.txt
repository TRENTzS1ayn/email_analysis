This message may be moot, but please bear with me:)

RE: Requirement 1

I think that there may well be cases where a service agent is 
participating in a choreography without it knowing! Consider legacy 
systems (and yes, even tomorrow's fully choreographed systems will 
legacy the day after) that are built today without the benefit of a 
CDL. We will want to be able to hook in such a service in with other 
services that *do* support our CDL; but a requirement that every 
message be decorated with a means of identifying the choreography 
instance will *not* be possible for a service that does not know about 
choreographies (it is just doing its thing)
