Thanks for posting this Carol. Yes, I admit to a new book, which rebutts the 
arguments put forward in Nicholas Carr's HBR article that "IT Doesn't Matter".
www.bpm3.com/hbr/. Your posting also prompted me to remember an article I 
wrote a while back, which tried to explain the nature of business processes 
as conversation:

http://www.darwinmag.com/read/020103/waveprocess.html

BPML was designed to support these types of processes where the exchange
of information can infinitely extend and flex the design of the process, as it
adapts under use or undergos deliberate design change. I use email
as an example, where from a simple process design pattern involving three participants
(sender, receiver and address book) complex, end to end, persistent, conversations 
can develop (like public-ws-chor itself) that involve more parties through the 
exchange of email addresses.
