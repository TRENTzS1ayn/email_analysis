Semantics should really only be specified by the author of whatever is being
designed. So if someone is creating a WSDL definition for a Web Service,
say, then the semantics associated with that WSDL definition HAVE to be
understood before anyone can use it effectively. If they are not defined in
the WSDL itself, then either they need to be defined in a separate document
e.g.in HTML, or the user of the WSDL works out what to do using their
intuition or by trial and error and hope that they are right.
 
So what I really mean by saying that Semantics definitions are required, is
that it should be possible to include in the definition of what is being
designed (i.e. in a WSDL definition, a Choreography definition, etc.) some
text or other information that allows a user of the definition to understand
how to use the definition correctly with minimum chance of error.
 
I recognize though, that even if the Choreography Definition Language we
develop includes structures that allow the semantics to be included, there
are no guarantees that designers of Choreographies will actually define
them, or, if they do define them, they will be unambiguous.
 
Or to put it really simply, the Choreography Definition Language we develop
should be "self-documenting" by including XML elements and attributes that
allow explanations of the Choreography to be included in the definition
itself rather than separately.

Please keep in mind that all the standardization work done so far with Web
services (SOAP, WSDL, etc.) basically does not support any explicit
semantics to be associated with Web services definitions. Still it would be
hard to claim that it is not possible to build interoperable solutions with
them.

Monica 

I am curious to understand why you say semantic definitions are outside the
scope of WS-Chor. Here's my thinking: 
1. Semantics are the meaning of things. 
2. Choreographies defined using the WS Chor language we create will contain
statements which will follow the syntax we devise.

3. Without including descriptions of the semantics of the statements in a
choreoraphy, the choreographies will not be understandable with any
certainty

4. But the choreography definitions MUST be understandable by everone who
builds solutions that will follow a choreography if each solution is to be
interoperable with every other.

So without semantic definitions I don't see how interoperable solutions
could be built. Secondly, a Choreography Definition Language that does not
make it easy to build interoperable solutions is, IMO, useless and we may as
well all go home!

Have I misunderstood?

mm1: 

    * Choreography 'of web services' only 
    * Bounding of the abstract level 
    * Semantic definition outside of WS-Chor 

These all seem to provide some boundaries of our scope, do they not?
