Hello, 

I don't think we have spoken before.

Highlighting the Pi Calculus was deliberate, in order to clarify the difference in foundations between BPMS (as defined by BPMI.org) and 
classical WFMS. Wrt to the issues of locality or partial state, those are inherent to BPML. BPML was inspired by the Pi calculus, but is
not limited by it.

That is correct, and that is what BPML/BPMS provides.

Explicit synchronisation processes, while solving the problem for a given process, require that the >programmer reason about distribution and locality outside the bounds of the Pi Calculus semantics.

There I disagree. It is very possible to model those processes using Pi calculus, and this is made explicit in BPML.

If you wish to discuss this in voice, I'd be delighted, where I can share some of our initial experiences with BPMS.
I would also encourage a greater analysis of BPMS by theorists such as Wil Aalst as has been done before with WFMS.
We took the step to create this paper, and map out the patterns, partly as a confidence for ourselves. 

Best,

Howard
