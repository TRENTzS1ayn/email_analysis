JJ,

I think we are in violent agreement on most things.

Syntactic sugar is certainly very useful. And you are correct in 
suggesting
that syntactic sugar with meaning is just adding semantics. A meta-layer
if you will. I agree. All of which *can* be done using the pi-calculus 
but it
might not be the best approach (see earlier email).

On the observation that we have lost focus on the right things in 
standards land
you are both right and wrong. I think the work that you are doing at 
the higher level
is probably pitched correctly. The work of BPMI, WS-BPEL and WS-CHOR is 
at a
different level (lower in most cases and higher and overlapping in 
others).

Why is this the case? Alas we (the community as a whole) do not have 
the same set
of beliefs and do not have the same set of constraints and do not have 
the same set of
values. They may overlap and much may be common but they are not the 
same.
This is one reason (and probably the most important) as to why we have 
diverse
efforts. It takes time to get such a large community to a point of 
consensus. It certainly
takes vendor support but more importantly it takes user support. Win 
the users and the
vendors will follow.  Easy to say but hard to do.

I hope that you continue the debate and win users over. I certainly 
will continue to do so
and who knows one day we might get to the necessary consensus and 
create the set
of standards that really do meet out vision of distributed systems.

Cheers

Steve T
