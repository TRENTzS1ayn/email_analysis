Howard,

A good unifying post.  Thanks for that.  Just one immediate followup:

I agree with the focus on defining processes at an appropriate level of 
abstraction.  We must be careful, however, not to build-in the 
assumption that processes are executed or controlled by a central 
broker.  In terms of execution/operational semantics, this is the big 
jump that must be made when moving from a single-organisation 
process/workflow management environment (where a central broker is 
practical and appropriate) to an environment for processes than span 
autonomous and physically distributed organisations (where a central 
broker is often neither practical nor appropriate).  The issues we're 
raising with respect to Pi calculus semantics are related to the latter 
type of process when there is no central broker.  I would be interested 
to know if you have attempted to implement/use BPMS without a central 
broker.

Ciao,

AndyB
