Good question. 

Firstly, I have to say that I am totally in favour of federation and distribution:

1. In respect of end to end process design

2. In respect of end to end process management

3. In respect of end to end process execution

All three are in fact different. I can see the need for shared BPMS, distributed BPMS's talking to one another,
and/or a distributed BPMS execution environment. Similarly, a BPMS, distributed or otherwise, will need to 
support distributed process design activities, as well as management activities, for different companies may
wish to work together to collaboratively manage processes, such as taking different responsibilities for
different aspects of a process design lifecycle - from discovery, reengineering, deployment, operational
management, analysis, optimization, etc.

Well, the question is, with all these topologies, to what extent can the vendors of different solutions agree
on what is needed in standards. I know of one BPMS vendor who is doing p2p agent based BPMS. 
I know of another doing a very centralised transactional environment, similar to a database. I think
different vendors will have different requirements for emphasis in standards. So, the approach we took
at BPMI.org was to develop a model that didn't require one approach or another, and I don't think BPML does. 

At CSC, we have proposed BPML-based, BPMS topologies as follows:

- a single enterprise BPMS, clustered for performance
- a shared BPMS among several firms
- a federated BPMS topology, where end to end processes span BPMS systems owned by different agencies
(where swimlanes are actually different BPMS systems, just as in a centralised model swimlanes might represent
different enteprises ERP and SCM systems)

At the level of BPML I see no limits to the creativity vendors will make in allowing their BPMS to be centralised,
distributed or otherwise. 

Now, this is quite different from the issue of interoperability between different BPMS products. 
I think the approach we took at BPMI.org was to assume that, as with databases, end users would
be less interested in BPMS to BPMS interoperability then they would the opportunity to consolidate processes
from multiple systems (as with RDBMS data aggregation). We saw BPMS as being the enabler to practically
share processes, as Web Services allows the sharing of functions and RDBMS the sharing of data. In this
respect we were not in the p2p, b2b, very extended, very loosely-coupled camp. Although, we accept some
vendors might be. Rather, we would see a gorilla in an industry managing BPMS operations on behalf of
a trading group, and, last mile connectivity into the value chain might be provided by, for example, deploying
an agent based approach at the periphery. In fact, we would treat such agents as participants (swimlane sense)
in an end to end process managed on BPMS. In fact, CSC is currently brokering a conversation between
an agent based BPMS company and a centralised BPMS company for that very reason. We want to develop
a projector for the agent coupler so that it can be included in end to end processes managed on a BPMS.

Does this help clarify? Clearly, massively distributed topologies will impose different requirements, and 
for some in the b2b world this is the dream. I have to admit to not being in that camp, but this does not mean
that I am not in favour of distributed BPMS from either an execution, platform or process management perspective.
And as JJ points out, I am only one voice.
