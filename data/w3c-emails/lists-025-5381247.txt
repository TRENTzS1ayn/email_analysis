Yes, most companies will buy sets of software from a vendor. The biggest
value of a standard will be in the design/implement language (like SQL,
XQUERY, BPEL) for the purposes of enabling a workforce. Making products work
vendor-to-vendor will happen over time.

Our products are in the loosely coupled/distributed arena. Personally I see
both models being very useful and complimentary. The trading group example
is similar to a VAN like GEIS/EDI, except much more sophisticated.

BTW, I'm glad we abandoned pi-c for this thread.
