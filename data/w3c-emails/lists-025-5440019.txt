Is that a technical argument regarding Intalio's architecture and 
product capabilities, or an attempt to portray Intalio in a negative light?

I'm happy to dispute that statement on a technical basis and even 
demonstrate its fallacy. But in the meanwhile, I do cordially request 
that if you have a personal agenda against Intalio please, for the sake 
of all other members, consider taking it off the public mailing list.

I've said that two years ago and used an early version of BPML (0.4) to 
illustrate that point by example. At that time my argument was rejected. 
I am glad to learn that we finally see eye to eye on this. Perhaps, 
moving forward we could see eye to eye on more subjects. It will 
definitely help advance the level of this discussion.

Since we don't experience any difficulties representing users or 
allowing the human element to be introduced, and actually take pride in 
our human interface capabilities, I would say that we present solid 
evidence that this statement is not entirely accurate.

This change in strategy is more then welcome, I personally believe and 
have expressed my clear interest in unification of these specifications. 
But we have to acknowlege that considerable time was spent due to the 
need, which I fail to understand, to reject various ideas and 
specifications. Once we root out the NIH thinking, I believe we will 
find it much easier to get our work done in a collaborative fashion.
