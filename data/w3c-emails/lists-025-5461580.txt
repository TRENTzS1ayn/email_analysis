That is also our understanding.

I could not agree more. I believe pi-calculus provides the most 
compelling foundation for a model of interconnected processes/services. 
That's where we see the value in using it. That is not the entire 
problem we're trying to solve, just a significant piece of the puzzle. 
Other problems do require additional capabilities, including business 
semantics, ontologies, QoS, security, etc. These are introduced at other 
layers in the process definition, or layered separately. But they are an 
important component of the overall solution.

That is basically the coarse grained requirement list for a 
specification such as BPQL.
