Answers/questions below ...

>>>I believe the team had already discussed that the business aspects were
outside of the scope of our effort. Are you indicating we are revisiting
that issue?<<<
No I'm not if it is actually the same iussue. However I don't understand
what you mean by "business aspects" and I don't recall the thread on the
list where this was discussed, description of "business aspects" defined, or
a resolution/vote made. Can you point me to the relevant documentation?

>>>What is a 'self contained collaboration' and how does that map to a
business collaboration?<<<
What I meant by a "self contained collaboration" was one that was not easily
divisible into smaller parts. For example a collaboration that described how
to place an order either works or it does not, you can't easily split it up.

>>>If we are interested in the control (or data flow, for Nick Kavantzas
benefit) for the choreography definition to support is one thing. To infer
we take on the business aspects of such an interchange is quite another.<<<
The **only** business aspects we are including in the model are
annotations/description elements in the model that **allows** (but does not
require) the designer of the choreography to explain what the different
parts of the model mean. Steve RT has also said he would like to see these
things in a more structured format as well. I hope you think that
documenting what you design, which is all we are taling about, is a good
idea ;)

>>>If you are basing the metamodel on these assumptions, I would request
there be more discussion in the group prior to the development continuing
any further.<<<
I need to better understand what you mean by "business aspects" before I can
respond to your point - you will also be getting the model definition very
soon.
As far as continuing development is concerned, please remember that the
model we are working on is a development by Oracle and Commerce One that we
are contributing to the group. It has no formal status within the group
until it is accepted. It is really an attempt to synthesize the many ideas
and requirements that have been raised in the group in to a form that,
subject to agreement of the group, can be the basis for the spec.

Regards

David

mm1: David, I believe the team had already discussed that the business 
aspects were outside of the scope of our effort. Are you indicating we 
are revisiting that issue? What is a 'self contained collaboration' and 
how does that map to a business collaboration? If we are interested in 
the control (or data flow, for Nick Kavantzas benefit) for the 
choreography definition to support is one thing. To infer we take on the 
business aspects of such an interchange is quite another.  If you are 
basing the metamodel on these assumptions, I would request there be more 
discussion in the group prior to the development continuing any 
further.  Thanks.
