JJ,

 

You're conclusion is mistaken. Because pi is effectively
message-passing, the only way P_i interact with each other is via the
sending and receiving of messages. Any given process has no clue how the
others are implemented or what makes them execute. To illustrate the
point, suppose your process looks like this

 

P = P_0 | ... | P_N

 

then

 

P_0 | ... | P_i can be running in one process virtual machine (call it
PVM1)

 

P_i+1 | ... | P_j can be running in another process virtual machine
(call it PVM2, which implemented by a different vendor, even)

 

P_j+1 | ... | P_N can all be legacy message-passing processes
implemented in home grown technologies.

 

This works just fine on lots and lots of implementations of pi. Of
course, you want to add features that make the management of this -
especially in the face of txn's - simpler. But, nothing prevents this
from working in even toy implementations of pi. You could get this up
and running in an afternoon, if you wanted. The only bits you need are
uniform naming - oh, but the web already gave us this years ago - and
some way of getting messages into and out of execution domain
boundaries. For example, a message from a process running in PVM1 to a
process running in PVM2 or a legacy process has to get into and out of
format and transport accepted by both.

Assaf: 

I am not the one who originally linked pi calculus to Intalio's designer
tool. Looking at some papers recently published which are portraiying
Intalio's designer tool as the best pi calculus tool (which I agree, it
is the closest that I have ever seen, you guys did really a great job
with that respect).

Now, speaking of pi-calculus (as illustrated by examples using Intalio's
designer tool), I don't see how you can technically refute that by
making everything a process:

A) it requires high levels of compositions (nesting) to be able to
support all layers from UI to DB. I content that the numbers of level
makes it impractical

B) that pi calculus does not allow you to explicitly specify domains of
control that are collaborating with each other (they are at best
implicit)

C) as a result, pi-calculus based solutions must implement a single
"process virtual machine" which "executes" all the processes that are
composed. I think this is Intalio's architecture

I would be really interested in your opinion about choreography versus
orchestration. Howard thinks that choreography are necessary. I have
heard otherwise from some of the prominent pi-calculus experts.

Cheers, 

Jean-Jacques

Is that a technical argument regarding Intalio's architecture and
product capabilities, or an attempt to portray Intalio in a negative
light?

I'm happy to dispute that statement on a technical basis and even
demonstrate its fallacy. But in the meanwhile, I do cordially request
that if you have a personal agenda against Intalio please, for the sake
of all other members, consider taking it off the public mailing list.

I've said that two years ago and used an early version of BPML (0.4) to
illustrate that point by example. At that time my argument was rejected.


I am glad to learn that we finally see eye to eye on this. Perhaps,
moving forward we could see eye to eye on more subjects. It will
definitely help advance the level of this discussion.

Since we don't experience any difficulties representing users or
allowing the human element to be introduced, and actually take pride in
our human interface capabilities, I would say that we present solid
evidence that this statement is not entirely accurate.

This change in strategy is more then welcome, I personally believe and
have expressed my clear interest in unification of these specifications.


But we have to acknowlege that considerable time was spent due to the
need, which I fail to understand, to reject various ideas and
specifications. Once we root out the NIH thinking, I believe we will
find it much easier to get our work done in a collaborative fashion.
