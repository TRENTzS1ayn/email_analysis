Assaf: 

That's great, so I assume that you mean that in the future people should
refrain to reference Intalio's products to illustrate pi-calculus concepts?
Or is it okay when somehow it is positive and not okay when somehow it does
not look as positive?

I'd be really interested to understand how you define and manage the role
boundaries. I could not infer that from the pictures I have seen. What I
understood from Intalio's product is that swinlanes were not associated to
"roles" but simply represent a process in the pi sense.

I do not understand why you imagine that our product is a pi-calculus engine
equivalent to, say PICT, and not a fully grown BPMS. It is, in fact a BPMS.
And as such, it fulfills all the requirements of BPMS. I don't think our
expertise with pi-calculus has clouded our judgment, just like I don't
believe our expertise with SQL or TCP has prevented us from realizing a
BPMS.

So to answer your questions:

a) nope. you can have any arbitrary level of nesting that meets your needs,
and different levels of nesting at the same time.
b) maybe pi-calc doesn't allow that, but our product does. we do quite
neatly express domains of controls, as you can see in the screenshots.
c) nope. that's not our architecture and we never even considered that
option.

So again, it's very helpful to ask questions before arriving at conclusions,
especially if you're expressing an opinion about another vendor's product in
a public mailing list dedicated to working on a vendor-neutral
specification.

If that was a conceptual question, I would agree with other pi-calculus
experts. But I do have to take other considerations into account, including
interchange of definitions, modeling tool, management and deployment, etc.
What we call real-life requirements. In pi-calculus you don't need to label
an action. In a process definition language you do need to label an action,
because it helps the designer and administrator, hence the @name attribute.
It doesn't exist in pi-c, but it's absolutely required in a process
definition language. Similarly, there are many other additions that are
introduced in order to meet non-conceptual requirements.
