Is there a set of realistic canonical business processes that can help one
evaluate various BPM/Workflow systems, standards, and such? With all the
efforts towards standardization, I'd presume such a set would be useful. I
am familiar with workflow patterns, but they only offer a partial framework
for evaluation.

If there is no such set, perhaps it is important that the community put
together one.

Thanks in advance,
