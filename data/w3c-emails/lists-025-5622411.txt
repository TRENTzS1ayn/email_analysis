I don't particularly like the tone of this e-mail.

You somehow equated our product with what you may imagine a pi-calculus 
machine looks like. As Greg pointed out, that was a misunderstanding of 
what one can do with pi-calculus. I corrected you on those false 
assumptions.

If you want to look at a product that draws influence from the 
pi-calculus model to provide BPMS capabilities, then by all means do 
that. If you want to imagine our product as anything other than what it 
is, that's your prerogative. But please, for the 100th time, this is not 
the appropriate forum to discuss vendor products.
