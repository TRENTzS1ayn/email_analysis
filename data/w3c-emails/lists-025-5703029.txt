It all depends upon your definition of these terms.

Frankly, I dont think definitions exist. And I dont believe the matter can be easily
discussed in the abstract. For some, the matter is important to the direction in 
which standards are developing, to others, to the development of products,
to others, the adaptation of existing products. The issue is, given the VERY WIDE
set of DIFFERENT needs at OASIS BPEL TC and WS CHOR, what COMMON
GROUND exists. Unless common ground is defined, no one will have any reason
to implement BPEL. 

Of course, there will always be a core group with a clear BPML/BPEL mission
and who are or have developed products. 

For me, processes have an inside and an outside. Processes can be put together
in a bunch of different ways. Some may be called composition, some orchestration
and some choregraphy. BPMI.org took the view that technology should treat the result
as a first class citizen entity.
