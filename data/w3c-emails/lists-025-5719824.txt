I can confirm it is a full BPMS. One of the most complete I have seen, and I've seen a lot.

Yes you can. I know this from experience.

True, and its how things like process calculi are used to create innovation products that makes the difference.

Again, I can confirm this from experience.

Yup. 

After this, I promise never to mention a real technology ever again on this list. Let's keep conceptual
