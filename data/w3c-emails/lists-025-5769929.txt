IMO the BPM space should consist of a stack of specifications, each 
targeting a well defined problem, In much the same way we approach the 
WS space. Rather than doing everything inside WSDL or SOAP, we have 
specialized specifications that deal with specific issues, like 
security, reliable messaging, addressing, coordination, policies, 
portals, management, etc. Similarly, we need to look at the BPM space as 
a space allowing for the existence of multiple specifications, and at 
specifications like BPEL/BPML as specialized specifications in this 
space. They are important, but they are part of a larger picture. Trying 
to solve all problems in one specification, in my opinion, leads to less 
capable specifications. Building a stack allows you target specific 
problems with the best possible tool, and combine all these tools into a 
powerful toolbox.
