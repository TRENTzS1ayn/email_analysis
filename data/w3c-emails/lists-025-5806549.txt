I'd love to see us flesh out section 3.8 on structured references at 
some point -- but at least the hooks are there for doing what it says 
in our charter  (section 1.4)  so I can live with this for now, as 
long as we make sure to come back and some time and work on this. 
Also, I suspect the "document reference" should be a URI, not a URL, 
that is could also point to other kinds of resources than text 
documents -- I can imagine businesses that want to use URNs to point 
to non-web resources, URIs (with the fragids included) to point to 
parts of documents, etc.
