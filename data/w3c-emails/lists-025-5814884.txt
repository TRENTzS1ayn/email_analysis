You are right, this part of the spec is under-developed. Both Nick and I
realized that the importance of this part of the spec, but also realized
that we were not the real experts in this area, so if you want to make some
more concrete suggestions then please do ...

I'd love to see us flesh out section 3.8 on structured references at 
some point -- but at least the hooks are there for doing what it says 
in our charter  (section 1.4)  so I can live with this for now, as 
long as we make sure to come back and some time and work on this. 
Also, I suspect the "document reference" should be a URI, not a URL, 
that is could also point to other kinds of resources than text 
documents -- I can imagine businesses that want to use URNs to point 
to non-web resources, URIs (with the fragids included) to point to 
parts of documents, etc.
