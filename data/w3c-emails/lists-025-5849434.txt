>IMO the BPM space should consist of a stack of specifications, each targeting a well defined problem, In much the same way we approach the WS space. Rather than doing >everything inside WSDL or SOAP, we have specialized specifications that deal with specific issues, like security, reliable messaging, addressing, coordination, policies, portals, >management, etc. Similarly, we need to look at the BPM space as a space allowing for the existence of multiple specifications, and at specifications like BPEL/BPML as specialized >specifications in this space. They are important, but they are part of a larger picture. Trying to solve all problems in one specification, in my opinion, leads to less capable >specifications. Building a stack allows you target specific problems with the best possible tool, and combine all these tools into a powerful toolbox.

BPMS consolidates all the pieces along the lines of a set of explicit standards. It certainly could not be done in one specification.
