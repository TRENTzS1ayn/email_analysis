No one is asking anyone to base technology just on a theory like pi-c. I've explained the background to the paper before.

BPML is, funnily enough, also less than pi-c, in the sense that no one would put BPML forward as a universal
theory of all processes, but that is precisely what pi-c is. Funny old world, isnt it.
