What I mean is, there is nothing in ERP that I cannot model in BPML or BPEL. And, most significantly, when I do this, I am still in the domain
of processes and process lifecycle, ie, there is no bottom, when the engine takes over and I cannot change the behaviour. This is what we
mean by a native process platform.
