What, in your view, is the difference between Web Services
Choreography/Orchestration and Business Process Modeling?

I think a process technology must be neutral to business semantics. It
should not impose one way of thinking about
business. Our approach with BPML or BPEL is:

- to allow it to transport business semantic information
- to allow process reuse so that developers can capture semantically
meaningful idioms and reuse those in other processes
