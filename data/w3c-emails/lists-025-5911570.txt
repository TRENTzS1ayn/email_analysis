(This probably is not the best forum for this post, but couldn't find a
better place to post it.)

Gartner is pushing "Business Process Fusion (BPF)" buzz, which I view as
very synonymous to BPM. What are the significant differences, if there are
any? Or is BPF so vague that it is hard to figure out what it really is
about?

Please comment. Thanks,
