Dear Colleagues,
 
Sorry this is a touch last minute, but please find attached my contribution
on adding in transaction demarcation to the emerging WS-Choreography
description language.  (Peter has not has had as much time to assist me as
he would of liked so please blame me for the imperfections.)
 
This contribution is based on the Oracle language proposal, but the
principles should be adaptable to any language specification that emerges
from the group that is reasonably similar in its fundamentals.
 
Best Regards     Tony
