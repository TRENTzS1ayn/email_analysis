> As per my action point, here is a brief description of how I propose  
> to use
> bugzilla to manage issues within the WG.
>
> W3C's Bugzilla can be reached at http://www.w3.org/Bugs
>
> 1. As issues are raised they are recorded into bugzilla by either the  
> chairs
> or the issues editor.
> 2. The issue gets categorized, called a component in bugzilla. It is  
> up to
> the issues editor to ensure
>    each issue is placed into a category.  If one does not seem to be
> appropriate, the chairs will create a new component.
> 3. The issues editor performs an initial screen, completes those that  
> are
> not worth pursuing (see step 5) and seeks owners for
>    each remaining issue.
> 4. Owners will be actioned by the chairs to come up with proposals to
> resolve the issue.
> 5. The work group considers each proposal and agrees/disagrees. If  
> there is
> disagreement, the owner must work on a new resolution.
> 4. Upon an agreed completion of an Issue, the Owner marks the status as
> closed, and provides one of the following resolutions:
> FIXED: Issue accepted and resolution agreed/implemented.
> INVALID: Not a well formed issue or not appropriate
> DUPLICATE: Same as an existing issue.
>
> Bugzilla should not be used for discussing the issue. The normal email  
> lists
> should be used for that purpose, and when appropriate
> links to the mail archive should be made from the issue in bugzilla. In
> dealing with issues from external sources, for which the W3C
> has a defined process [1], the issue in bugzilla should reference all
> communication with the external party.
>
> I'm sure there are some holes in this, so I look forward to your  
> comments.
