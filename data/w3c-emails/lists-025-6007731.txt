Dear Steve and Abbie,
 
I am available today if you need more doing on the figures - do you like the
colour, prefer line diagrams, etc or would like to commission some new ones.
I have removed the figure identification from the attached files.
 
I would also be happy to do an editorial review (mis-spellings, etc) if that
would be helpful.  If it is then how is the best way of doing that in a
helpful manner (I have Word, XMLSpy (2004) and Sonic Stylus Studio.  Give me
a call if needs be.
 
Best Regards     Tony
