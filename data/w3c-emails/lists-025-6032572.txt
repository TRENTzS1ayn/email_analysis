I know this is a little late, but simply from the informative point of view I 
thought members of this group might find this report interesting. It's work 
being conducted as part of the European ADAPT research project.

I think that at least one of the authors is on this public mailing list, if 
people want to send comments/questions.

All the best,

Mark.
