Dear Colleagues,

I have tried to send this message to the list twice without success.  Yves
has just helped me and the document referred to is at
http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/chor/3/12/reqcomments.doc



 Dear Steve and Abbie,

 I have pasted the current requirements document into word and marked up
some editorials and some comments.

 I note that currently there is a mixture of English and American  spellings
- most noticeably with regard to the word 'behaviour'.  I  have not wish to
start a bun fight in the college (especially a ladies one), but we probably
should agree a usage and stick with it.

 I have already sent you the two figure with the captions removed from the
graphic, but they have yet to be included I see.

 A final nit - we were on 1.02 - we now seem to have gone back to version
1.01.

 Horrible thought - Lucy Cavendish is n't St Trinians renamed is it?

 Best Regards     Tony
