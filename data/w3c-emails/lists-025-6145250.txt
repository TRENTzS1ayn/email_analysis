Hello

My name is Mayilraj Krishnan and (once my AC rep confirms in reply to this 
message),
I will be representing Cisco Systems in this working group.

I have been software developer since 1992. I worked in various workflow 
product
evaluations and technology selections related to workflow. In Cisco I have 
been
developing various commerce applications using Java, XML and Web Services.

I view many emerging "standards" in this space as positive and it merely
states that the Choreography space is complex, same time addressable.
I firmly believe this working group will bring the best open and neutral 
standard.

I agree to participate per the charter
http://www.w3.org/2003/01/wscwg-charter

I do not have personal knowledge of any IPR claims held by Cisco Systems 
regarding
web services choreography.
