The first draft will be available next week.

This is clearly a work in progress. It will answer many questions, but
obviously some questions will remain open in this draft. We are committed to
continueous work on this document, so we can answer all questions without
asking the reader to have a strong theoretical background in formal process
models.

We are motivated to advance the state of the industry and will release that
information without any IPR claims.
