Hi all,

My name is Paul Lipton and (once my AC rep confirms in reply to this
message) I will be representing CA in this working group. 

I've been an architect and developer of enterprise systems for over 20
years, and have worked closely with key CA customers to create
distributed solutions using J2EE, .NET, wireless, and Web Services
technology.

I'm the Web Services Technology Leader in the CA field services
organization, and am also a Technology Strategist in the Office of the
CTO. I've represented CA in some standards organizations in the past,
and I've also spoken at a number of conferences like JavaOne. I've also
published magazine articles on Web Services, Java, object persistence,
and distributed systems. 

I've been looking into technologies like BPML, BPEL, and WSCI, and find
them interesting. My hope is that this group can work together to move
our industry closer to consensus, and that my experience with real-world
enterprise challenges will be of some use in this effort.

I agree to participate per the charter
http://www.w3.org/2003/01/wscwg-charter last revised 2003/01/14.

I do not have personal knowledge of any IPR claims held by CA regarding
the subject.

Regards,
Paul
