Greetings,

      By way of introduction, I am Daniel Austin, and am the alternate
member to this WG from W. W. Grainger, Inc. Len Greski will be our primary
member. This is my 11th W3C working group since 1996. I am currently a
member of the HTML WG  and the WS Architecture WG. I'm also the AC
representative for Grainger. In the past I've been involved with  XSLT, XML
Core, RDF, XForms, SMIL, and several other Working Groups.

      My background is in physics and mathematics, and I am currently the
Sr. Architect for Grainger's eBusiness unit. My interests are in the
application of linear analysis to choreography problems, and the
relationship between choreography and WS architecture.

      I agree to participate in the working group according to the terms of
the charter, and to the best of my knowledge Grainger has no IPR claims in
this area.

Regards,

D-
