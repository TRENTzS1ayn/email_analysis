Hello, 

My name is Ravi Byakod  (pronounced b-ya-code ) and I will be representing
Intalio Inc., in this working group - once my AC rep confirms in reply to this message.


I have been in the enterprise applications industry for about 13 years now and have primarily 
been involved in all aspects of workflow and Enterprise Applications (server, protocols, UI and architecture).

I started work helping port the TCP/IP stack to the Tandem mainframes and subsequently did a lot
of work in SNMP. I was involved in extending the SNMP to use sub-agent and implemented the first
SNMP stack along with sub-agent technology (SMUX) for Tandem platforms. I later extended HP/OpenView 
and IBM/NetView to perform software system auto-discovery and fault management using secure SNMP.

Then I moved onto developing workflow systems. I was involved developing distributed workflow engines using the WFMC  standards (and petri-net) and was the lead developer of CRM Suite of applications for Remedy corporation. I helped move the applications and the server to web based technologies. At the same time I was involved in setting up CRM infrastructure and implementations for major customers such as BearSterns, NASDAQ, AT&T, McCaw Cellular.

I am currently managing  and developing the front end applications for Intalio Inc. where I am involved in the development of process modeling tools and user interaction applications.

In the past and more so now, I am heavily involved in technologies and solutions that help in integrate disparate systems and hope to use my knowledge of workflow, web technologies and enterprise applications to contribute to the area of web services choreography. In particular, I hope to contribute to the aspect of modeling and IDE methodologies and interaction perspectives on the subject. 

I will look forward to not only contributing in the area of inter-process communication standards and methodologies but also hope to help drive the modeling and implementation methodologies in the web services area and its usage.

I do not have any personal knowledge of any IPR claims held by Intalio Inc., regarding web services choreography.

Thank you
