It is not a question of if you can *accomplish it* but, if it is 
naturally supportive of the model. If you have to think in terms of how 
you map it to Web services portTypes, operations and WSDL messages and 
schema types rather than in terms of the collaborative aspects of the 
process as the centric model, it is not directly designed for such 
purpose IMO.  To quote JJ "these standards forces you to think 
single-side bottom-up as you always have to design the "internal 
process" view of the collaboration."

Perhaps an example representation of a simple collaborative business 
process that proves this to be wrong would convince me.

Agree that in general there would be cases where existing Web services 
need to be pulled into a choreography and the model needs to accommodate 
it. However, I am not convinced that a model that centers on that 
approach and makes it also *possible* to model a collaborative process 
is adequate.
