Greetings,

      I, for one, would certainly like to see this information posted, as
well as the information regarding the teleconferences, as soon as possible.
We are already skirting the W3C process on this [1] and if we expect
members to attend the face-to-face meeting, these arrangements need to be
detailed immediately in order to reduce the travel costs.

Regards,

D-

The only thing I know is:
