Hello everyone,
I have already privately agreed to participate, but since everyone else
is doing public introductions....

My name is Dave Chappell, and I will be representing Sonic Software in
this working group.  I head up the Technology Advancement Group at
Sonic, and am responsible for the industry advancement and evangelizing
of technologies that match Sonic's core competencies of XML integration,
enterprise messaging, and Web services.

Either directly or through members of my team, we have been involved in
a number of standards initiatives across W3C (XMLP, WS-Arch), OASIS
(ebXML, WS-Security), WS-I, and JCP (JMS, JCA, JAXM, OSS/J, JSR109 -
Enterprise Web Services).  I am also a co-author of the WS-Reliability
specification.  

Sonic Software brings to the table years of experience working with real
customers building supply chain integration and partner collaboration
solutions.  With our recent acquisition of eXcelon Corp, we also have a
BPM implementation that supports BPSS, along with the engineering
expertise that built it.

In addition to helping to create the output of this WG, I have the means
to help evangelize this WG's efforts in the industry, which will help to
accelerate its adoption.  I am a co-author of O'Reilly and Wrox books on
JMS, Web Services, and ebXML, a frequent article contributor to many
technical publications, technical editor for Web Services Journal, and a
regular public speaker at many industry events.

I look forward to seeing everyone at the f2f.
Dave
