Greetings, everyone.

My name is Leonard Greski, and I am the primary representative on the
Choreography working group for W.W. Grainger. I look forward to bringing an
"end user" perspective to the working group, as I have been involved in the
design and development of numerous B2B and EAI applications over the past
six years.  I currently serve as Director of the eBusiness Architecture and
Development groups within W.W. Grainger, where we are currently integrating
web services standards and technologies into our service offerings.

My academic background is in sociology, and I am particularly interested in
applying models in social theory to collaborations among application
components.

I look forward to meeting all of you at the face to face next month.

I agree to participate on the working group in compliance with the terms of
the charter, and to the best of my knowledge, Grainger has no IPR claims in
this area.

regards,
