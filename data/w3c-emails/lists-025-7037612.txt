Steve,

Excellent reading list.

There are two sources that I found interesting for those with less
experience with formal methods.

One is called join-calculus. Join-calculus is a higher-level process
calculus that extends pi-calculus with the join pattern.
Join-calculus is interesting since it describes a language rather than
symbolic notation and also includes some interesting examples for handling
states (variables, objects, buffers). It's a good way to learn process
calculus tricks which are not apparent when reading pi-calculus and mind
bending to figure out any other way.

The other one discusses extensions to Petri net to support mobile and
dynamic (reconfigurable) Petri nets. It addes mobility, replication and
abstraction to Petri net, making it equal in expressive power to process
calculus.
