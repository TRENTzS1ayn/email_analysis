Hello All, 

My name is Rich Bonneau.  I am the primary representative for IONA Technologies to this working group (once my AC rep confirms in reply to this message).  Our alternate representative is Sanjay Patil. 

I am a Distinguished Engineer at IONA Technologies and work in the Office of the CTO but I am on loan currently to the engineering department, as technical director for our  Web services product offereings in general and our orchestration related products in particular. In the past, I have worked on various integration products both within IONA and previously at Compaq, Digital Equipment Corporation and Raytheon.  I have actively participated in the Xmethods- sponsored WSID (Web Services Integration Demonstration) efforts as well as the WS-I (Web Services Interoperability group).

We are very interested in the Web services choreography work area and I agree to participate in this working group as per the charter.

I do not have personal knowledge of any IPR claims held by IONA Technologies regarding Web Services choreography. 

thanks, 
Rich Bonneau
