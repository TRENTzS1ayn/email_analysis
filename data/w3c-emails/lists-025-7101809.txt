I'm a bit puzzled by the fact that only WSCI and WSCL are the only W3C Notes
so far, yet there is so much experience and many different backgrounds on
this list. According to the schedule in the WS-Chor charter, the first
requirements document for WSs Choreography is supposed to come out in April.

I hope to get some input from all "standards" out there (WSCI, WSCL, BPEL
[WSFL, XLANG], BPSS, XPDL, ...). What are the pros and cons? What makes each
a good/bad candidate to base the W3C WS-Chor spec on?

Thanks,
Kenneth
