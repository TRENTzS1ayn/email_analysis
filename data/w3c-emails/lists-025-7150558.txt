I understand, but think there are a number of interesting issues
arising from this difference.

I agree with that formulation to some extent.
But one could also describe the party-specific models
as focusing on one party's internal procedural workflow
and expecting the other party to conform.

between collaborating parties?

Yet another way to think about it is the difference between
procedural and conversational workflow models -
where procedural = command-and-control and
conversational = collaboration.
