The goal  of the group is to define a choreography language for 
web services. Whether this is done from scratch (for whatever 
technical or political reasons) or is based on something that 
exists (of which there are many to choose) is up to the 
members of the group to decide. 

In the short term, the group needs to work on requirements 
and use cases as a way to guide the group into taking the 
correct approach.

Cheers,
    Martin.
