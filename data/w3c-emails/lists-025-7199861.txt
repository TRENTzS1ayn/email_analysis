Indeed. We have elected to base these languages on formal models for
defining processes as communicating agents, in which the overall process is
expressed in terms of the roles communicating and recursively divided into
the interaction between participants, forcing each participant to bind to
that interface which is particular to its service.

This is both consistent with the notion of Web services as described by the
WSA in general and WSDL specifically, and formal models, and naturally the
way in which the Web works.

Absolutely true!
