It's the chicken and egg problem and neither spec is free of that.

In BPML you would describe the internal procedural workflow. But we are not
positioning BPML as a choreography language, we are positioning it as a
language to describe - in loose terms - the internal procedural workflow.

Then it's up to you to decide whether to begin with a choreography (in BPSS
or WSCI) and build a workflow, or whether to decide that the choreography
should support your existing workflow. You can make that decision then write
a BPSS to support your workflow, can't you?

It's really a matter of best practice, and I've heard at least once the
claim that since some system has an implementation the interface could be
expressed using BPSS in order to communicate with it, in effect binding the
choreography to the workflow.

Let's not confuse best practices with models.

No. But where do you read about 'internal activities'?
