Assaf:

>>It's the chicken and egg problem and neither spec is free of that.
[JJ] I think that we had already concluded that this is not really such
a problem. Clearly what ever is the outcome, the specification need to
allow for starting from either point of view: collaboration or
executable business process and derive the other one. I don't think it
is an issue anyways: how could we design a technology that does not
allow for that?

You don't seem to speak about the third level (long-running behavior of
system components). Any thoughts on that level?
