Conversational workflow models:  Winograd, Action Workflow, Dooley
Graphs.
Documentary Petri Nets (somewhat of a combination).
Consensus protocols.
I think there are others.

For that problem I prefer speech acts and REST.

There are very different forces operating on state alignment
between different administrative domains, and procedural
workflow operating under one administrative domain and
especially one workflow engine.  Combine the technical
forces in the infamous Waldo paper with the trust forces
between two businesses.

If we separate the problems, we can have better + simpler
solutions for both.
