Not in every case, but certainly for the interesting 
business cases, which are conversations about
economic exchanges.

In response to what somebody else wrote,
I agree that a dialog has two sides,
and each side has its own point of view.

But if it's a conversation, eventually 
the two sides need to communicate.

That could be accomplished in several ways:
* predefined script for the whole conversation
* one side publishes its procedure, the other side conforms
* both sides negotiate a script
* formal rules of engagement, but no script
* loose improvisation
* probably some others I haven't considered.

As always, the correct approach will depend
on the situation.
