Howard:

What is really useful in a SOA is to provide the ability to express some
rules which based on the process or collaboration instance context will
fire a given implementation of a service. This is a necessary decoupling
between the logical "activity" of a process definitions and the
"service" which implements this particular activity. There is a many to
many relationship between the service and activity. For instance a
global insurance company could decide to have a unified claim processing
process, but based on the context of the claim could fire localized
services.

The WfMC specification though dating back to the mid 90s offers a
particular instance of this concept with the notion of user/group/role
whereby a user can be chosen dynamically based on a business rule such
as "this activity has to be performed by a manager".

Passing dynamic locators is rather trivial and overly limited as it
requires that the business rule that fills out the locator is outside
the reach of the process definition. In this insurance example it means
that I will need a service that can generate the locators to select the
appropriate localized services. Does not sound good to me.

I am wondering why pi-calculus does not take into account such a simple
concept?

As an "experimentalist" (a non theorical physicist) by training I am
suspicious of "theories" as we often forget the context in which they
were developed. Physics offers countless examples of theories that
cannot be applied outside of their context of course, but also many
people that applied theories beyond their limits without any sanity
checks. 

All we hear is Assaf's interpretation of Pi-calculus theory in the
context of B2B/EAI/Workflow, you name it. I am sorry but I am not
impressed so far except by the amount of literature that Assaf has gone
through.
