I definitely agree and would like to add to further requirements:

* A conversation may involve more than one participant
* Conversation rules usually allow participants to join and leave
* A conversation may range over multiple participants but involve only a
subset at any sub-conversation
* A participation in one conversation could be identical to a participation
in another conversation
* Negotiating a script is also a conversation, so a conversation that leads
to a conversation needs to be described
