I am curious why you'd regard these as requirements. The use case of, 
for example, bargaining over the terms of a transaction before 
completing it, has been contemplated and there is standardization work 
going on in that area in the context of ebXML. However, this is probably 
beyond what most people now deploying B2B are doing. Real B2B in my 
experience currently tends to involve parties that have pre-existing 
relationships (established non-electronically) and pre-negotiated terms. 
If we want to enable people to move beyond that model and make the 
process more dynamic, that may be desirable, but let's be sure that 
there is a real business use case for it. Also I think the problem set 
that something like the ebXML CPA addresses may be a different problem 
than what this group is chartered to do.
