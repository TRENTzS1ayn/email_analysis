I'm all for generality if it doesn't have an unacceptably high cost in 
terms of complexity. But I'm afraid it will have a high cost, if we set 
out to build a framework in which to model every possible form of 
interaction. So I am concerned about scope creep. I also don't want to 
duplicate what ws-arch is doing, namely, defining what constitutes a SOA 
at a very high level of abstraction.
