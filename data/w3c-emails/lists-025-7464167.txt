A better analogy would be to talk about a service oriented architecture
(SOA) as being something like the notion of an Object/Class in Java, and
interfaces (aka service type) are defined and services are objects
implementing these interfaces.

Choreography then becomes a language to express the relation, so the
language like Java is very simple and has a small set of keywords, and it
can use any number of service types (interfaces/classes) and any number of
services (objects).
