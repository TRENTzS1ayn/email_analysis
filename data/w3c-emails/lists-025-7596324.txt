Hello, I'm Jim Hendler,  and since I am the AC rep for my 
organization (the Maryland Information and Network Dynamics Lab at 
the University of Maryland) I guess I will also be in this working 
group.
  My own background arises primarily through involvement in the 
Semantic Web, I coauthored the Scientific American article of that 
name with Tim Berners-Lee and Ora Lassila, and have been doing Sem 
Web research since the mid-90s.  In the web services arena, I've been 
interested in the interaction of Semantics and Web services for a 
long time.  From about 1999-2001 I worked at the US Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) where I was chief scientist for 
information systems and ran some prograns in "agent-based computing" 
- these were generally related to service-based computing, including 
the CoABS project whcih did service-based middleware, and the DARPA 
Agent Markup Language (DAML) program, which gave rise to the DAML-S 
work mentioned in our charter.  Currently I am cochair of the W3C Web 
Ontology Working Group, which hopes to bring our language (OWL) to 
Last Call in the next couple of weeks, and I also serve on the 
Semantic Web Coordination Group.  In between telecons, I also manage 
to run a research group [1], which is working in the dynamic 
composition of services using semantics.
   I agree to participate per the charter
    http://www.w3.org/2003/01/wscwg-charter
    last revised 2003/01/14
I do not have personal knowledge of any IPR claims held by the MIND Lab
regarding Web services choreography.
