Hello, my name is Greg Ritzinger and (once my AC rep confirms in reply
to this message) I will be representing my organization (Novell, Inc).
in this working group.
 
I have been a software developer for over 15 years, the past 3 with the
Novell web services group. I was recently involved in the design and
implementation of a WSFL process engine that is now part of the Novell
exteNd Composer product. Prior to Novell, I was employed by an
international transportation company, and worked on two of their (semi)
automated b2b applications. Through participation in this working group,
I hope to enhance my knowledge of business process automation and apply
it to future Novell web services products.
 
I agree to participate per the charter
        http://www.w3.org/2003/01/wscwg-charter 
        last revised 2003/01/14
 
I do not have personal knowledge of any IPR claims held by Novell, Inc.
regarding Web Services Choreography.
 
Greg Ritzinger
