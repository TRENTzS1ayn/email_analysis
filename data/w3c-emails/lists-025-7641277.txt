OMG issued an RFP earlier this month for development of a specification 
for a business process definition metamodel.

See: http://cgi.omg.org/docs/bei/03-01-03.pdf

The specification developed in response to this RFP is expected to 
achieve the following:

   1. A common metamodel to unify the diverse business process
      definition notations that exist in the industry
   2. A metamodel that complements existing UML metamodels so that
      business processes specifications can be part of complete system
      specifications to assure consistency and completeness
   3. The ability to integrate process models for workflow management
      processes, automated business processes, and collaborations
      between business units.
   4. Support for the specification of  web services choreography,
      describing the collaboration between participating entities and
      the ability to reconcile the choreography with supporting internal
      business processes.
   5. The ability to exchange business process specifications between
      modeling tools, and between tools and execution environments using
      XMI.

Items in 1 and 4 above should be of considerable interest to this group. 
Seems there is a significant functional overlap with what this team is 
embarking on.

Comments?
