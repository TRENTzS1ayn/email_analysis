Hi,

there is another question altogether. 'Plain' web services distinguish the interface (WSDL) from implementation (your favorite programming language).

Complex web services have the same issue: distinguishing the external behavior from the implementation that enforces the external behavior.

The question is if you need a 'full' workflow/process/etc. language for the external behavior definition if this distinction is made. So I suggest this discussion, too, at least concurrently, if not upfront.

Thanks,

Christoph
