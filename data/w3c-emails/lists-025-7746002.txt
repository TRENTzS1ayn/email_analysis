I agree, a distinction needs to be made for external
service coordination. This is important when long-running
(web) services - each encapsulating one or more workflows -
interact in B2B style applications.

I can think of at least three sources that have considered
the issue of external service coorination:

  - Biographical reactive systems proposed by Robin Milner in:
    "Bigraphs as a model for Mobile Interaction", First International
    Conference, ICGT 2002

  - In OMG's specification of an enterprise component
    framework, UML Profile for EDOC, there is a modelling
    provision (Component Collaboration Architecture) which is
    devoted to capturing external interactions regardless of
    internal implementations (workflows, EJBs etc). The CCA model
    is at the FTF stage -
    http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/2002-02-05

  - Inter-workflow messaging and workflow service models
    proposed by Arthur ter Hofstede and myself. A discussion
    was provided in "Retrofitting workflows for B2B component
    assembly", 25th International Conference, COMPSAC 2001.
    (I can provide a copy for anyone interested).

Cheers, Alistair.

Subject: RE: Yet Another Choreography Specification



Hi,

there is another question altogether. 'Plain' web services distinguish the
interface (WSDL) from implementation (your favorite programming language).

Complex web services have the same issue: distinguishing the external
behavior from the implementation that enforces the external behavior.

The question is if you need a 'full' workflow/process/etc. language for the
external behavior definition if this distinction is made. So I suggest this
discussion, too, at least concurrently, if not upfront.

Thanks,

Christoph
