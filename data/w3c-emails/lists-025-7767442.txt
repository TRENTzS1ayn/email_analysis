I'd like to point out that while this paper includes the OMG's EDOC
specification in the list of standards in the introduction, the paper
does not examine it at all.  More importantly, it should be noted that 
the set of patterns are strictly control-flow only patterns.

The EDOC specification (of which the both the CCA and Business Process 
components are particularly relevant), addresses both control flow, and 
data flow and deals with both synchronous and asynchronous interactions
and communications between activities.

The final adopted spec is here:
