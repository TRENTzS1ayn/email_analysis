I have also tracked the use of PetriNets and process algebras.  
PetriNets tends to be understood on a more intuitive level whereas  
process algebras are a little more tricky to get a handle on. I think  
it is pretty important that we level the playing field on formalisms so  
that people are more comfortable around them (particularly process  
algebras).

I know Assaf has some experience of both pi and join calculus. I could  
probably get Prof Robin Milner involved so that we can understand more  
fully the relationship between the requirements that we write down and  
the expressive power of pi-calculus. I am sure that we would also be  
able to handle the blend of pi and PetriNets and possibly show that one  
subsumes the other.
