I would recommend starting with a previos article by Milner's called
"Calculi for Interaction". It describes Action Calculi which is required
reading in order to understand bigraphs:

ftp://ftp.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rm135/ac9.ps

In there you will find a model that unifies PetriNet with process calculi by
describing the system as a set of concurrent processes, and also covering
controls. More information about push outs is available here:

http://pauillac.inria.fr/~leifer/articles/leifer-synlt1.pdf

Bigraphs then introduce a graphical model that can describe both the
interaction between the processes (the monograph) and the interactions
within each process (the topograph) using actions, controls and pushouts:

http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rm135/bigraphs.ps.gz

Of course, I am biased when I stress the importance of these models for the
development of concurrent distributed systems ;-)
