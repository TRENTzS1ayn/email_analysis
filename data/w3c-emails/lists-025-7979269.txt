It is not a simple issue. However, wrt RM, I think it is useful to focus 
on its WSDL definition. At an abstract level, what you are modeling 
there is QOS. How this is realized in terms of message flow is dependent 
on the binding.

MEPs are a little different IMO because their whole purpose is to model 
message flow, although in a simpler form than choreography would.
