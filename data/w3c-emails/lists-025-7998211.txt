Having some understanding of the achitecture of this thing that we are 
doing
would help us stay on the same page.

If we have a global model then where does it sit with respect to any N 
participants.
Is it in the middle of all of them?
Is it at each one's site?
Is it a proxy sort of thing?
Is it a web service itself?

What happens when we have two of them and we wish to compose?
What happens to the originals?
Where does the new one reside?

I could go on. It would just be nice to get a common understanding. I 
have mine
but I'm not sure it's the same as other peoples.

Cheers

Steve T
