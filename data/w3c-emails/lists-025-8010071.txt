Hi Yaron,


      I understand what you are getting at - however, at this point in
time, I don't think that anyone knows the scope of this aspect of our work.
I don't think it's important to know ahead of time. The Big-Design-Up-Front
methodology is broken; we need to do this iteratively, and leave the
mission statement with some "creative ambiguity" that leaves us room to
maneuver in response to the unknown.
When faced with an unknown problem domain, iterate, iterate, iterate - and
don't paint yourself into a corner. I have no idea just yet as to *how*
choreographies may be composed. But I do know that this is a necessary
problem to solve. I included it in the revised MS I sent out today.

Regards,

D-

The key issue for me is what does it mean to compose a web service? Does
this mean a new WSDL with some computer behind it that then forwards
requests to existing web services? Does this mean that a client is expected
to send messages to different WS who all have some kind of relationship
with
each other? It's so vague that I'm not sure what scope we would be signing
up for.
