I thought by our discussion at the F2F that the "in the middle of all of
them" is not what we are after, and in effect equates to the O word. So I
would be interested in a better understanding of what composition means,
given that this approach would not really support a wrapper wsdl. I'm not
arguing against composition here, just asking for some clarity.

Martin.
