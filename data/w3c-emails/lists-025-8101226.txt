Several statements have been made about the kind of model we don't want. 
But IMO it is not really clear enough what we do want.

If I understand things correctly (a fairly big "if"), one requirement is 
that there be basically one model for both client & server (or peer and 
its peer, if you want to be more egalitarian). This means that I don't 
need to model the messages one party sends and have a parallel model of 
what the other party is receiving. The choreography description I expose 
to my partners should be sufficient for them to interact with me. This 
doesn't imply that there's one big model of all participants' message 
flows - in fact I think you don't want this. But it does imply that as 
party A directly interacting with party B, both parties have a model 
they can both view and base their interactions on (could include > 2 
participants also). It is a global model only in the sense that it 
encompasses directly interacting partipants, not the whole closure of 
participants with which those in turn interact (those are in separate, 
but related choreographies).
