During the Chicago F2F, the W3C Choreography Group agreed and later presented to the BPEL TC chairs its mission statement.
This statement was presented by the BPEL TC chairs to the BPEL TC members, in last week's BPEL TC conf-call.

I think we may want to revisit it only when we have a better understanding on the use cases and requirements, and have made some progress on the harvesting fronts. Then questions like 'what semantics of web services really means' will become more easier for us to answer.
