Given the heated discussion last night I must concur fully with Nick. 
Furthermore I think the correct approach is to take the work done at 
the F2F as the mission statement for this group and revisit it as and 
when we need to. We can add additional paragraphs clarifying the terms 
used (like semantics) and we can clarify the approach we are taking 
(i.e. being fairly practical and being delivery focussed on behalf of 
users of this technology and vendors who will build products based on 
this technology).

I humbly suggest that the mission statement  from the F2F is *only* 
tidied up and then put into the requirements document.

Cheers

Steve T
