Nickolas,
 
It may be a neutral view model, but it does not describe "common" behavior.
It describes the complementary behavior(s) of the participants, and it
defines the "steps" by which a "business transaction" may be achieved (the
preferred or mainstream path).  Consequently, the message sends and receives
of the individual participants represent the complementary behavior(s).  The
"wiring" between them defines the paths over which messages travel, and this
the behavior observable by each.
 
Also note that the model could include exchanges with other participants
that are not part of the primary exchange, e.g., my example of the buyer,
seller and carrier.  The notice of the seller to the buyer that the product
has been shipped, creates an expectation in the buyer that he can query the
carrier regarding the transportation status.
 
Fred

Well said Jon. 
  

To re-iterate a global model describes the common behaviour of a set of
interacting participants, so we may also call it a common or neutral 
view model. 


The message sends + receives of the individual participants and the wiring
between them are NOT modeled in the global model. 


What is modeled is the common, observable message interactions between
participants.

Several statements have been made about the kind of model we don't want. 
But IMO it is not really clear enough what we do want. 

If I understand things correctly (a fairly big "if"), one requirement is 
that there be basically one model for both client & server (or peer and 
its peer, if you want to be more egalitarian). This means that I don't 
need to model the messages one party sends and have a parallel model of 
what the other party is receiving. The choreography description I expose 
to my partners should be sufficient for them to interact with me. This 
doesn't imply that there's one big model of all participants' message 
flows - in fact I think you don't want this. But it does imply that as 
party A directly interacting with party B, both parties have a model 
they can both view and base their interactions on (could include > 2 
participants also). It is a global model only in the sense that it 
encompasses directly interacting partipants, not the whole closure of 
participants with which those in turn interact (those are in separate, 
but related choreographies).
