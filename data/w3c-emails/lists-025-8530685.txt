mm1: +1, considering we have multiple types of composition, and have not 
addressed which we will include within our scope (note previous message 
on some definitions we have discussed and have been included in the 
glossary).

Has everyone considered the proposed overall definition I provided?

**A service composition is a composition of services that results in a new service. The new service can be the combination of distinct parts to form a whole of the same generic type. The web services could be combined to achieve a specific goal.**

This integrates parts of the definitions of recursive, web service and choreography composition and doesn't specify the mechanism used for composition (how).
