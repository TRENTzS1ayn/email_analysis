Can't come up with any concrete issues with this. But I do have a 
question for the community at large.

I'm in the process of doing the requirements document with Daniel, Ed 
and Abbie. On my metaphorical travels I have yet to see a use case in 
support of composition that results in a web service. If a choroegraphy 
is created from some number of web services, then what would it's WSDL 
interface be? Is it some subset of the WSDL operation that are 
advertised by the web services that were directly used to construct it? 
Is it the same as this set of WSDL operations? Is it a subset of the 
operations of all the web services (direct and indirect) that were used 
to construct it?

My own thoughts are that there must be a scoping function that renames 
or hides operations that are offered by a choreography. It may be the 
case that it is a function of the events/messages that start a 
choreography. Any suggestions as to how to clear this up and make it 
fairly tight and yet expressive enough for the job?

Cheers
