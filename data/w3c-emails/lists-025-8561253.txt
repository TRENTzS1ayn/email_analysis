Steve - in the compositions we've been playing with (some of which I 
demoed at the first f2f, and anyone outside a firewall can play with 
themselves from http://www.mindswap.org/~evren/composer/, we do allow 
the creation of new web services by the composition of existing ones 
- and these services themselves can be composed with others -- the 
WSDL is accomplished by grounding the service calls in WSDL (using 
the DAML-S groundings) and the "choreography" we use is the DAML-S 
process model.  (I'm hoping the chor langauge we come up with will 
replace the latter eventually)
  that said, I agree with you that it probably is not "definitional" 
that the composition results in a new "service" per se.  I think I'd 
like the idea of using "scope" in there, but don't have specific 
words either -- I'll think on this
