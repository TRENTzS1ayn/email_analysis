JJ,

I'm having difficulty netting out your discussion.  I see only one
form of composition relevant to choreography.  That is the form
described by Martin, below.

Composition of web services I see as fundamentally composition of
a web service where a web service may incorporate and thus encapsulate
other web services in the performance of its offering.  In this case, 
there is choreography between the web service provider (not the role
of the service offered) and each of the incorporated services.  There
will then be a choreography between the service offered role and
a user of the service.

It is possible that we could see a situation where both of these 
apply.  For example, if we have a buyer and a seller, and the seller
is a service composed of a warehouse, as carrier and a bill collector.
The warehouse may be fully encapsulated, but the carrier and bill
collector may interact with the buyer.  Thus there are several
choreographies:

buyer-seller
seller-warehouse
seller-carrier
seller bill collector
carrier-buyer
bill collector-buyer

and potentially two composite choreographies: 

1) buyer-seller, carrier-buyer and bill collector-buyer
2) buyer-warehouse, buyer-carrier, buyer-bill collector

I don't see a choreography composition that combines
these two composites since that would break the
encapsulation of the buyer service.  From a buyer
perspective, the seller, the carrier and the bill collector
could all be the same entity in different roles without
any choreography defining the internal business processes.
