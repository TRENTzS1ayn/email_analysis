[JJ] Yes and this is why I thought it was valid to ask the question if
it is in scope or not. Is Web Service Composition some semantic sugar on
top of ws-chor or is it more? The composite web service is just a
"pass-through" (if you keep aside the message transformation problem),
and expressing that a message coming out of a back-end service is
propagated to the end-user of the composite service should not be that
hard to express once you have the ws-chor definition between the
back-end service and the composite service.

The "composite service" is a very special service that is just
forwarding messages back and forth based maybe on some internal
(routing) rules. Ultimately having a transformation handy would also be
helpful.
