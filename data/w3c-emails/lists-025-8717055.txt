Frank,
In looking at this privacy draft, I have a few comments and/or questions:

    * Does this not define a potential dependency for choreography - for
      privacy and identity (such as federated network identity, and work
      in other sections like Liberty)?
    * If so, is it within our scope to expand on this and/or provide
      input to WSA?
    * This may also involve quality of service. Has this been considered?
    * Other mechanisms exist beside WS-Policy such as WS-PolicyLanguage
      which is already within a standards body (OASIS, XACML I believe).

Perhaps as we continue these discussions, we can early on identify what 
is within our scope or findings we need to pass to other groups/entities.

Thanks.
