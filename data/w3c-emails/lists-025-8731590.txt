My initial take was that it was out of scope.

Maintainence of privacy policies and preferences is especially important 
when interacting with a service or a choreography that forwards requests 
to other services, which may not be visible (a facade or composition 
pattern).

There are proposals that address this. For example, the combination of 
SAML + XACML can convey security and access information across multiple 
web service interactions. IBM & Microsoft have also outlined a proposed 
WS-Privacy spec, which I don't think has been published yet.

IMO the mechanisms for this are below the choreography level but we may 
want to include a note indicating that such technologies exist, or are 
emerging, and that there are cases where they are needed to meet privacy 
requirements.

I think the previous discussion of privacy in the list has more to do 
with hiding information about interactions themselves (not necessarily 
the data content of interactions), which is a different set of issues.
