A couple of points here.

1) Yes, Privacy use cases and requirements have been addressed 
   as part of WSA Requirements. If there are special privacy
   requirements that need to be addressed for choreographed
   message exchanges then we should coordinate that with WSA.
   Francis discussion w.r.t. privacy context is interesting
   and extends the privacy discussions currently captured
   in WSA.

2) Federated identity management certainly intersects with
   Liberty as well other WS Security specifications. E.g., 
   OASIS WSS, recently made public WS-Federation spec from 
   Microsoft and IBM.

3) Eventually, I see that WS-I will have to take up the work
   to develop interoperability profiles for securing 
   choreographed message exchanges although in the short-run
   the expectation is that they will produce some basic
   security profiles for transport and message level security
   using SSL/TLS and OASIS WSS.

Frank,
In looking at this privacy draft, I have a few comments and/or questions:

    * Does this not define a potential dependency for choreography - for
      privacy and identity (such as federated network identity, and work
      in other sections like Liberty)?
    * If so, is it within our scope to expand on this and/or provide
      input to WSA?
    * This may also involve quality of service. Has this been considered?
    * Other mechanisms exist beside WS-Policy such as WS-PolicyLanguage
      which is already within a standards body (OASIS, XACML I believe).

Perhaps as we continue these discussions, we can early on identify what 
is within our scope or findings we need to pass to other groups/entities.

Thanks.
