This example is interesting, but it seems like a lot of machinery to
describe what is essentially just connecting to something like a
GetStockQuote service.

What if you try to do something just a little harder, such as pulling
(or pushing) the results of a StockQuote service through a
CurrencyConverter service?

Does the amount of pi-calculus machinery then become so cumbersome, in
that case, that it starts to loose its intuitive appeal?
