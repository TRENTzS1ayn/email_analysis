Reading each of the e-mails exchanged so far, I have to say they all 
make sense. But the thread doesn't make sense at all. And following the 
conf call discussion was downright impossible.

The problem is, someone starts discussing compositions of choreographies 
for the purpose of reuse, in response we branch into a discussion about 
composition of services to form a new service, then half-way switch to 
discussing composition of interfaces to form a choreography, then into 
discussion of the choreography behind a service. Lots of context 
switching going on, with not a single participant ever saying "BTW I've 
just switched context form discussing X to discussing Y".

Perhaps we should start by identifying the different types of 
compositions, and even if there is overlap (and I bet there is), discuss 
each type of composition in detail as if no other type of composition 
ever existed. Once we have some better understanding of each type of 
composition on its own, we can throw them all in a big bowl and make 
soup out of it ;-)
