Jeff,

I agree with your comments. The reason for the use case and the reason 
for using the pi-calculus is that it is such a simple use case with no 
real business interest to it. The aim was to flush out fairly basic 
requirements by using an example that was easy to specify in an 
unambiguous way (hence the use of the pi-calculus). I don't think that 
anyone who is familiar with the pi-calculus would suggest using it as a 
one-to-one mapping to a language for choreography. Rather it has 
interesting properties that one can exploit. In the same way lambda 
calculus, upon which most imperative programming languages are based, 
is not evident. Syntactic sugar can be used to hide the formalism and 
help the intuitive appear and at the same time enable us to ask 
questions of a language with a formal base (even if not proven) that we 
perhaps could or would not otherwise be able to ask.
