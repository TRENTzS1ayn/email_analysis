mm1: That's why I provided the original working definitions that had 
been identified in our work to try to hone in on what were our 
priorities.  See attached.

[ws-chor] 6/24/2003: Definitions for Composition and Semantics

As we discussed today, here are the current working draft definitions for various types of composition. We don't have one for service semantics, although we have a reference that a failure may happen at the business level due to semantics.  Let's start the conversation.....

*Choreography Composition*: Creation of a choreography from parts that may be used to create a variety of choreographies (or a choreography of choreographies).  A choreography definition is composable if it is possible to reuse portion in the choreography definition or another one.

Note:  A choreography itself is a composition but it may not be recursive, it may be the composition of elements of other types (e.g. interfaces, services, message types, etc). A choreography may be a series of parts or more primitive.

Creation of a unit or product from components or parts.  These components or parts may be used to compose a variety of units or products (services).  Composition can imply the ability to construct complex artifacts from simpler parts.
*General Composition*: Creation of a unit or product from components or parts.  These components or parts may be used to compose a variety of units or products (services).  Composition can imply the ability to construct complex artifacts from simpler parts.

Note: A process definition can be a hierarchical composition or a process can include many processes or a recursive composition. Implies the ability to incorporate definitions by reference rather than by copy.

Clarify: Determine if service composition is associated with tasks on the client side and relate this potentially to choreography and, if accepted, orchestration.

*Interface Composition*: Is a composition of interfaces/service types that are linked to each other. These interfaces/service types can be decomposed and then recompose them into other choreographies (reuse).

*Recursive Composition*: Creation of a composition that includes more than one business process.  A recursive service composition is a composition of services that results in a new service. Can be the combination of distinct parts to form a whole of the same generic type.  A recursive choreography composition is the ability to take multiple choreographies and compose them into a larger choreography.

*Web Services Composition*: Is the combination of distinct Web service (type) to form new Web service (type).  Web services can be composed to achieve a specific goal.
