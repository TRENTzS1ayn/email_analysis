+1 This is the differentiator between "the O-word" and Choreography, IMHO.

Or as David Burdett put it, "The common thread in all these choreographies
is the idea of exchanging
information which results in a changes of state of the roles involved."
Only those  parties who communicate directly in a manner that could cause
state changes are engaged in a "choreography" IMHO.
