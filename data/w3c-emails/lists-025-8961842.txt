That wasn't my intent, FWIW.  All sorts of compositions and decompositions
can occur within a "choreography," but IMHO only those that involve the
globally visible shared state are in scope for the choreography description
language we are developing.  The discussion yesterday got me re-thinking all
sorts of things ... if the fundamental unit of a "choreography" is a Web
service invocation / MEP, then all sorts of implementation details of the
service that involved "orchestrated" interactions behind the scenes are
abstracted away, but if the fundamental unit is a message, then all those
messages behind the scenes have to be accounted for somehow.  I'm as
confused as anyone at this point.  

By all means let's make sure that we don't box ourselves into a corner based
on some preliminary guesses about what terms mean!
