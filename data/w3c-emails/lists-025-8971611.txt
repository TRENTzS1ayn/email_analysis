One of the issues that has come up for me in the past is that of 
business contracts.  Business-to-business interaction tends to be 
governed by legally-binding, written or unwritten contracts that 
specify the required roles and behaviour of all participants.  Is a 
choreography an electronic representation of a business contract for 
the interaction?   If so, then perhaps model visibility/scope should be 
defined by the contract boundaries.
