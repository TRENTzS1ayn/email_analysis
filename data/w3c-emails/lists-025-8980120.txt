I'd urge caution whenever you use the terms "global" and "state" in the 
same phrase.  If you're talking about modelling then it's probably OK, 
but run-time state shared between participants connected via the 
Internet is a recipe for software that will never perform or scale.  
Consider for example that Sun recommends not using Jini outside a LAN 
environment because the synchronisation requirements of the tuple space 
(shared state) kill performance and reliability.

There are co-ordination approaches that can operate on a local, partial 
view of the process state.  HP have done this in their labs with some 
of their workflow tools.  My PhD thesis provides another solution.
