It is feasible to *align* (not *share*) state among 
participants in Internet business transactions.
Several standardized protocols exist including
OASIS-Business Transaction Protocol (BTP), 
ebXML BPSS, UNCEFACT-BCP, and RosettaNet.

At the end of a business transaction, one can say
with a high degree of reliability that the participants
will agree on a common state of (for example) an order.

One feature all of the above protocols have in common
is relaxation of ACID rules, for example, no locking
required.
