Agreed and understood.  The reason for caution is that a choreography 
language could be used to describe interaction in a generic form rather 
than using a pre-defined protocol with known predicates (e.g. "end of 
transaction") that can be implied from the completed interactions in 
those examples.  If the underlying model for the language relies on 
global state, you still have a serious problem because there is 
potential for requiring all-party synchronisation at every step in the 
execution of a program expressed in that langauge.
