Dear Fred and others,

OK, I think we are probably agreed then actually.

I agree that this group should not be concerned with the internal
implementation of a 'node'.  I also agree that there will be many
occasions were one just wants to focus on an A - B relationship and any
other relationships that A and B might have are not of concern.  The
WS-Chor language should be applicable in that case.  But I also wanted
to make sure we were not limiting ourselves to that case and that the
language we produce will be able to express relationships between (sub-)
choreographies that can be viewed as an overall choreography.

Maybe somewhat heretically for this group, I am not sure that
concentration on Web Service is actually that helpful for us at present.
We will get to that when we come to answer the question 'How does this
message / interaction get sent?'  For the moment I think we should focus
on the sequencing of interactions between roles / parties (nodes) and
the triggering of one (sub-)choreography by another.

Best Regards     Tony

Tony,

My assertion is based on a concern that the scope of 
choreograpy not creep into the specification of implementation of
services but stop at the interfaces.  In the example, as I indicated,
incorporating the detail of B's use of C within the choreography between
B and A restricts the design options 
of B, i.e., breaks encapsulation.

However, I can conceive of a situation where it might be necessary to
impose this restriction as where there is a requirement that B use C,
and that there be a specific ordering of messages so that C does not
receive a request that is misleading about the state of A.  This might
be a contractual obligation.  In such a circumstance, the choreography
might express the relationships between the A-B choreograpy and the B-C
choreograpy.  

This does further restrict the behavior of B, but does not define its
implementation, per se.  It reflects a 
relationship between A and C that is not expressed in
the choreography in terms of an exchange of messages.  I 
suppose such a restriction might also be used within the B 
enterprise to define a business constraint on the 
relationship between B's interactions with A and C.

Fred
