Daniel,

could you cross post this to the mailing list. Alas our mail server has 
a date/time problem and so this will hit you in the year 2000!

I would ask everyone concerned to please read through the descriptive 
text of the requirements. Where there is no URI or where further 
comment needs to be made I would ask the contributor of that 
requirement to post to me, Daniel Austin, Ed Peters and Abbie B the URI 
and/or comments.

Alas as much as we have tried we cannot easily find the URI's to many 
of these. So it would be very much appreciated, and considerably 
easier, if you folks pick this up as an ACTION and help us out here.

What I DO NOT want you to do is send me back an edited version of the 
spreadsheet. What I do need is the refid in the first column.

Cheers

Steve T
