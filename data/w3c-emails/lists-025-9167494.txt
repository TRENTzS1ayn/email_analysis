We really are talking about different views of the same thing. if your view
is the single point (e.g. a bpel process) then you are conecrned about
composing other WSDL/bpel processes - all you desribe are the other web
servuces that fan in and fan out from the single point. if your view is the
global model, then you are concerned about the message flows between all
parties in the system, not a single fan-in/fan out perspective. We need to
concern oursleves with composing the defintions of global model elements,
and that all depends on the grounding discussiion we are having.
