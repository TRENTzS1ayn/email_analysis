Tony,

I agree with you generally that contracts will be between two
parties, but such contracts may also define obligations that
affect relationships (e.g., contracts) with entities not party
to the contract.  Thus a seller may require that a buyer have
an established line of credit with a financial institution
and this might be confirmed by an exchange with the designated
institution.

There will also be exchanges where there is no contract to
start with and the exchange will develop an agreement, i.e.,
contract.  Exchanges may also be governed by commercial standards
or laws to which parties of an exchange subscribe or are
subject to.

The more difficult choreographies may be where there is no
contract and parties want to establish a relationship in which
the risk to each is minimized, e.g., I don't ship anything until
I'm sure I know who your are and am assured that I will get paid.

Fred
