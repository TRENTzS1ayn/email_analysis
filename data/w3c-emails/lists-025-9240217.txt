Martin,

While I agree that it should be possible to define a MEP with
the choreography langauge, I would not like a reliable messaging
choreography to be merged with a purchasing choreography.  
I want the purchasing choreography to be expressed with the
reliable messaging protocol implied, i.e., abstracted out.

The MEP will have implications to the design of the business
choreography.  Consequently, it may be necessary to incorporate
a reference so that the assumptions are clear, but I don't
see a single choreography incorporating both levels of 
abstraction in any more complex way.

Fred
