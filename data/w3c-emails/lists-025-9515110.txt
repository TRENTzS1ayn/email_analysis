Dear Martin and others,

It is entirely possible that those who attended the F2F agreed that we
should work only on the technical contract aspects (although I doubt
that Bob Haugen bought into that view as such!), but unfortunately I was
not privileged to attend this F2F.  I have not seen any such decision
broadcast on this list (or any other decision for that matter), nor
announced on a Telecon.  I have searched through the F2F notes produced
so far and although some discussion around the topic of contracts is
evident, an actual decision / resolution is not.

Perhaps you would therefore like to clarify what you mean by a technical
contract (as opposed to a business contract) and announce this decision
/ resolution.

My personal view is that the work will do on a language for describing
choreographies (interactions and their sequencing) will contribute to
the technical aspects of a contract, but we should have a general
awareness of the encompassing business contract 'framework' within which
such technical aspects sit.

Best Regards     Tony

I had though that at the chicago f2f we agreed that we would only be
working on technical conracts and not on business ones. Cleary there is
an intersection, but the group should focus on the technical foundations
first.

Cheers,
  Martin.
