Dear Colleagues,

Clearly this is one approach,. But perhaps not the most useful one.

Another approach is to allow hierarchal (or layered) composition within
the language as David (Burdett) has been suggesting, such that we can
build an MEP from a set of messages and then a (higher level) MEP from
MEPs and so on.  And I agree we could use the term an 'interaction' to
mean a single message or a single MEP.  So I think that the distinction
that Steve mentioned in another email between a business message and a
protocol message is not helpful - it is just a question of the 'layer'
you are focused on (consider which is the real business message in SOAP
embedded in HTTP embedded in TCP embedded in IP until eventually you do
ground in photons or electrons!!)

Best Regards     Tony
