I think there is a fundamental terminology issue here that needs to be
cleared up. An entity (avoiding any overloaded word) that sends a
message to a web service (and may expect a response depending on the
wsdl) doesn not iteslf have to be a web service. This is the most
fundamental building block. Furthermore this interaction supports an MEP
(in soap teminology) and pattern (in wsd teminology). Perosnllay if we
can not describe these meps in a choreography language we have failed,
and hence I do not think that mep choreogaprhy is any different from web
service choreography.

Martin.
