Then how should we use the term agent as suggested by the WSA?

Also, how do we deal with the trivial case of a choreography that 
involves only one message (got to start somewhere). There's a Web 
service requester (agent 1) sending a message to Web service provider 
(agent 2). The later is a Web service, but the former is not. What are 
we choreographing in this case?
