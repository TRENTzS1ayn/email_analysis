Dear Colleagues,

I take no credit for raising this question - I think I remember Paul Lipton
asking it on one of the early Telecons six months or so ago.  But it is
raised again in the mail below so I will surface it again explicitly.

What is the use case for having a Choreography language of the type that
this group is trying to develop?  Who will use it or what will use it.  At
what stage(s) of designing and running business processes will it be used?
What will we be able to achieve when we have the language available that we
can not achieve now?  (And what are the advantages of expressing the
language in XML syntax (I can list some disadvantages already!) rather than
just building the language ourselves (as Java, C#, Perl, etc., etc.)?

The use cases we have all describe various business 'situations' or
scenarios that the language could / should be able to describe but do not
describe how such a description would be used or what the benefits of having
one available would be.  (By the way if any of the authors of the use cases
have included this then apologies, thank you, and please point me to chapter
and verse (OK a URI will do!) and I will go and read properly.)

I do have my own views on the answers to these questions but I am hoping
that others will respond with some sound reasons.  If people do I really
feel that it will focus and re-invigorate the group. 

Best Regards     Tony

Maybe we could agree that ...

-- The underlying formalism we use or devise must be rich enough to describe
all known MEPs, and RM protocols, etc.

-- The actual WS-Choreography language must be rich enough to describe the
interaction at the "logical" level, with RM, Security interactions, etc.
abstracted away.

-- Our objective is that business choreography *languages* can be built as a
layer on top of WS-Choreography, not that it should be directly useable by
non-technical business analysts  .
