My take is that strictly speaking, a choreography is "A definition of the
sequence and conditions in which a set of interactions occur between two
roles".

Where *interactions* include both individual (e.g. HTTP) messages as well as
higher level concepts such as a single "reliably delivered message" which
actually requires several HTTP message to implement, or at a even higher
level, concepts such as a "Request for Quote". 

Also roles can include, at a low level, general concepts such as a "sender"
and "receiver" which could be appropriate when defining the choreography
associated with a RM protocol, or such business level concepts such as
"buyer" and "seller" when defining a business level protocol/choreography.

In both cases roles defined in the choreography are abstract and need to be
mapped to the physical instances which will often, but needn't be - as
Martin mentioned, web services. If we say that Choreographies *always* have
to be *between* web services then it precludes the choreography being used
by something that is not a web service, which I don't think we want to do.

My $0.02c.

Choreography composition suggestion



Then how should we use the term agent as suggested by the WSA?

Also, how do we deal with the trivial case of a choreography that 
involves only one message (got to start somewhere). There's a Web 
service requester (agent 1) sending a message to Web service provider 
(agent 2). The later is a Web service, but the former is not. What are 
we choreographing in this case?
