No intent whatsoever to extend the scope, only look for the correct 
terminology.

Going back to the trivial example when service requestor sends message 
to service provider. The interface that defines both is given in WSDL, 
so we're using WSDL, we're using relevant Web services technology, and 
still in scope. It would be fair to say that the language "used WSDL" or 
"uses Web services".

But, the statement "between Web services" is incorrect since the trivial 
case is "between a Web service requestor and a Web service provider". 
According to current WS terminology there is only one Web service 
involved (but two distinct roles).

The term "choreography of Web services" may still be correct, even 
though there's only one Web service involved (again, two roles).

How do we resolve that?
