What if I just look at the supplier, invoice, scheduling and shipping web services exchanging messages among them. How do I know that the supplier is in charge (assuming I don't know it's actually implemented as a BPEL process)?

Your distinction seems to be based on knowing the internal implementation of the web services involved, which I thought was outside of choreography's scope.
