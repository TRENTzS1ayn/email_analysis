So if we depict the exchange of messages between agents as defined by 
their Web service interfaces, would that constitute as a choreography?

I am not suggesting that we are controlling what the agents do, and I 
understand your argument that this indeed would be more like 
orchestration (or other things we don't deal with). But we are 
expressing the observable message exchange between them. So would the 
concept of an agent be equivalent to a role?
