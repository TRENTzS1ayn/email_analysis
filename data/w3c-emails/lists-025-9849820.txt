My guess is that the supplier, and only the supplier, decides when to invoke
the invoice, scheduling and shipping web services. If this is the case then
the supplier is in control and the supplier, who is implementing the service
will know it.

The real question is does the purchaser need to know anything about the
invoice, scheduling and shipping services directly (i.e. not via the
supplier), if they do, then they are one choreography, if only the supplier
has the whole picture then the supplier is in control.

Not sure this is answering your question, but really I am saying that you
understand the implementation of the services that you implement, i.e. the
supplier knows about the services the supplier implements.

What if I just look at the supplier, invoice, scheduling and shipping web
services exchanging messages among them. How do I know that the supplier is
in charge (assuming I don't know it's actually implemented as a BPEL
process)?

Your distinction seems to be based on knowing the internal implementation of
the web services involved, which I thought was outside of choreography's
scope.
