That's exactly my point ;-)

I hope that they would consider not just RM, but how other protocols can 
be integrated into the stack. The original reliance on SOAP was a bit 
disappointing, since it resulted in a simple protocol but less usable 
stack. WS-RM, WS-Tx and WS-SC all take that model into consideration, so 
you can use a mixture of all three (and of course other protocols) 
without severely complicating your WSDL definitions.
