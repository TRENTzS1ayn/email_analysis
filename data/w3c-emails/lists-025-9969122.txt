I agree, although I don't think that the RM specs are going to cover MEPs
that cover "signals" that indicate such things as "message processing
started". So I don't think that the RM teams will solve all the problems we
need to solve.

Choreograph y composition suggestion


The OASIS Web Services Reliable Messaging TC has recently started to discuss
the issue of describing RM interfaces in WSDL (see the long "WSDL for WSRM"
thread in the June and July archives at
http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/wsrm/ - you might remember that the
original WS-Reliability submission only dealt with SOAP, not WSDL).

It might be a good idea to rely on what the RM groups come up with, instead
of replicating their work here.
