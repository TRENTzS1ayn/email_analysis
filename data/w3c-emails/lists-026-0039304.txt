Not necessary.  The "public state" can change after a timeout-period.  E.g. 
If you don't accept my offer in 2 hours, my offer is automatically invalid.

I think there will be different levels of choreography.  We can have high 
level business choreography (e.g. sending a PO) or low level one (e.g. RM 
handshaking etc.)  This one you describe can be sitting at the middle level 
(e.g. MEP).  I think choreography should be capable to describe TCP 
handshaking, but lets focus at business level choreography.

It really depends on whether the decision criteria is a private one or a 
contractual binding.
Yes !  The private decision shouldn't be defined in the choreography.
But the public, "mutually agree-upon" decision should be defined in the 
choreography.  E.g. The order will be rejected if the amount is over 500K 
and doesn't have a valid signature.

I agree !  But the level of message exchange details depends on the level 
of choreography you want to express.  E.g. If I'm expressing a business 
level choreography about order processing, I probably won't specify the 
underlying RM ACK, RM retry message exchange.

I'm not sure about the last statement.  Because public state represents a 
"consensus" between collaborating parties, I don't think the internal 
process of one party can unilaterally control the public state 
transition.  I think public state transition is a co-ordination 
handshaking.  Lets look at the following scenarios, assuming the current 
public state is S1

1) PartyA propose moving to S2.  The contract says PartyB don't have any 
choice.  So PartyA move to S2 after sending the proposal message.
2) The contract say PartyB doesn't have to agree.  When she disagree, the 
contract say the public state will be staying at the original state (ie: S1).
3) Alternatively, when PartyB disagree, the contract say the the public 
state will be move to another state S3
