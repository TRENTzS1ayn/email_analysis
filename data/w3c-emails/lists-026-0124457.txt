As far as requirements are concerned, is the general agreement that - we need to support "Multiparty Collaborations". 

Whether the method of decomposing a collaboration into "Binary Collaborations" is the appropriate and complete solution or not can be deferred to the specification phase (it's a "how" question in Daniel's words, I guess).

Note that it is not exactly all or nothing here. BPSS for example 
supports "MultiParty Collaborations", but does so by composing them out 
of "Binary Collaborations".
