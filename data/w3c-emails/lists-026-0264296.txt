I think the "monitor" doesn't restricted to binary collaboration.  It 
applies to multi-party as well.

Decomposing multi-party into bi-party may lost some information about 
dependencies (see the doctor/patient use case) and is not always possible.
I'm not sure I understand "unilateral behavior", sounds like it is a 
private implementation.

I guess a multi-party choreography is only useful when all defined roles 
agree to conform to.  So this is a multi-party agreement.

I think it is possible to monitoring all traffic pattern of a single party 
conforms to a multi-party choreography.  (you still need to have 
multi-party definition to do that).  If every party agrees to put a 
monitor, then you certainly can get the whole picture.  But even monitor 
one party can provide high value.

Does multi-party covers the case when N = 2 ?  Is so, then bi-party is a 
special case of multi-party.  But I agree that bi-party may have some extra 
properties (such as a simpler role binding model) that we should take a 
serious look at.

If choreography is only meaningful to specify a contract between multiple 
"domain of control", then it should only focus in the message exchange 
across the boundary, which means external services ?  Right ?
