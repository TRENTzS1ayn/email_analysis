I tend to disagree with the central infrastructure argument. It is
expected that each role that would be involved in the choreography
(whether belonging to the same domain of control or not) would have to
maintain do level state (i.e. choreography instance state). The
corresponding layer can communicate with other corresponding layers
implemented by other role. Overall, the system would be completely
distributed. I agree that it may not be the most efficient but if you
have nothing in the middle as it is often the case in b2b scenario,
there is little else you can do.

I don't mean to launch a big discussion at this point, I am more looking
for whether this is/is not a requirement. I don't have a strong opinion
either with respect to whether or not this is in scope. I tend to think
that this can be helpful for avoid dead-locks.
