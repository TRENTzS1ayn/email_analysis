MICROSOFT: W3C 'NOT THE ONLY VEHICLE' FOR CHOREOGRAPHY | CNET

Microsoft elaborated yesterday on its decision to abruptly end its
participation in the W3C's Web services choreography working group. A
company representative said it determined that the scope of the group
did not align well with the work of two Microsoft researchers who
attended the initial meeting, adding that the W3C "is not the only
vehicle in which to impact and evaluate a set of technologies."
