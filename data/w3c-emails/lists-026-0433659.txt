David, thanks for your feedback.  My feedback embedded.

Agree !  I think the same way as you.


>1) PartyA (who wants to play RoleA) propose a conversation by sending a
>message to PartyB (who PartyA want her to play RoleB).  The message

Agree !  When PartyA send the first message (with a particular type) to 
PartyB, the role binding is implicit.  Since this discussion is focus in 
role binding, I want to highlight when does the role binding happen.


>2) After receive this message, PartyB can agree or disagree to bind to

><DB>Isn't this just "business as usual" as anyone who receives can reject it

>(e.g. I don't want to get into a choreography with you)</DB>

Agree !


>3) If PartyB agrees to play RoleB, then the conversation starts

><DB>Alternatively, Party A could look up information about Party B, in a

The lookup is outside the scope of this choreography (of course, you can 
define another choreography between PartyA and the UDDI service 
provider).  Here I want to highlight that at least 2 roles need to be 
binded successfully in order to start the conversation.



>When does the bindings of other roles happen ?
>===================================
>The choreography defines who (RoleA or RoleB) can propose bindings of these
>other roles.  Basically the message exchange sequence between RoleA and
>RoleB defines when these other bindings can happen.
>The binding to other parties has an extra step.  For example, it is
>possible that PartyA propose binding of RoleC by PartyC and even

>PartyC.
>At some later point, PartyA or PartyB will actually send a message to
>PartyC which at that time, will confirm the binding of PartyC.  On the
>other hand, PartyA or PartyB can send an ont-of-band message to
>PartyC.  PartyC will then send a message to PartyA or B and confirm the
>binding.
><DB> How would PartyA communicate this binding information. Wouldn't it be

Lets separate the "communicating binding info" from the "binding" itself.

>I think I would call this dynamic message addressing rather than binding.
>"Binding" suggests some type of permanent connection whereas this
>description is totally dynamic. For example is this the type of choreography
>you are thinking of where:
>1. A Buyer sends an order to a Seller
>2. The Seller uses a URL in the order to send the Order Response to the
>Buyer
>3. The Buyer uses a URL in the Order Response to do shipment status query
>with the Shipper

Your following example describe the a specific scenario where ...
1) The SELLER can unilaterally determine the binding to the "SHIPPER" role
2) The SELLER communicate his binding decision to the BUYER within the 
exchanged messages.  Basically it pass an URL for the buyer to query 
shipment status.

There are other variation that your example hasn't described
3) The SHIPPER may send a "arrival notice" message to the BUYER.  How does 
the BUYER know this is the correctly binded SHIPPER ?

><DB>I can't think how you would put the dynamic binding information anywhere

Agree !  I think the choreography need to have a "role binding" concept and 
an XPATH expression to extract that from the message.  Something similar to 
the correlation set in BPEL4WS.

>If you put it in the header, then you

I think putting it in the header is another possibility, but probably more 
intrusive at this moment.

Rgds, Ricky
