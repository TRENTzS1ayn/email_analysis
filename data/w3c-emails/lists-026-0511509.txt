In the mobile process model you express a multi-party choreography but 
clearly define the processes that constrain each party's involvement in 
that choreography. That information can (and in our case is) used to 
monitor the choreography along the firewall concept. By knowing what 
messages are possible at any given state you can enforce policies on 
both send and received messages.

A two-party choreography is simply a case where there are only two such 
processes (one per party). The processes are not identical: when one 
party monitors the sending of a message (e.g. so it can resend/batch it 
or determine latency or actualy QoS), the other process monitors the 
receiving of the same message (e.g. to apply a security policy, QoS 
policy, queuing, etc).

Interestingly, for the two-party case, this model works the same whether 
you start with a language like WSCI/BPEL, or with a language like BPSS.

Is it possible to establish a multi-party agreement?

In some cases the answer is a no, or yes with very low probability. And 
I'm sure we're all aware of these cases and would consider the viability 
of a two-party choreography for addressing these cases.

In other cases the answer is a yes. There are very valid cases for B2B 
where the parties can negotiate such choreographies with ease. These B2B 
scenarios are not common in consortia based specifications, but we see a 
lot of companies that have relations with their customers/suppliers that 
allow them to explore such scenarios And of course it becomes much 
easier if the services are all bound to some organication but cross 
organization boundaries or systems, where a choreography language is 
required but achieving agreement is a non-issue.

In fact, what is interesting about these cases is that one doesn't even 
bother to try and achieve agreement. There is a certain way in which the 
business works and has probably been operating like that for years - all 
that one has to do is describe how things actually work in real life. So 
the need to agree in many cases is a non-issue. We also have to look at 
this perspsective.

Does the patient need to monitor the interaction between the 
receptionist and the doctor, or only the interaction between the patient 
and the receptionist? Does the receptionist need to monito the 
interaction between the patient and the doctor?

But does the receptionist need to understand the relation between its 
interaction with the patient and with the doctor and perform them in the 
right order, passing the doctor's reference to the patient (and vice 
versa)? This is where I see the value in expressing the multi-party 
choreography.

It's not about monitoring everything that goes around the world, only 
monitoring what interactions you are engaged in, but monitoring 
interactions with different participants that have a causal relationship 
to each other.

I agree. I haven't seen any difference between n-party and n-party where 
n=2 in terms of language or model, but I concur that we need to sit down 
and consider that such a difference may exist before reaching a conclusion.

External or internal is a matter of observer, that much is obvious. You 
can't just say something is external or internal. However, you may want 
to express what an observer is and what is in scope for that observer. I 
don't know if this is interesting to do right now, or maybe it's just as 
simple as using namespaces, or maybe namespaces bring more issues. My 
personal opinion is that we should leave this open for right now, but we 
should consider that such a layer should exist and the choreography 
should support such a layer when it is introduced.
