When two participants talk to each other they engage in a conversation. 
All other participants are not necessarily aware of that conversation, 
when it does not involve them. So a multi-party choreography can express 
multiple conversations that are going on and overlapping with each 
other, by allowing a conversation to be scoped to a subset of the parties.

In fact, what a multi-party tries to do is express how multiple 
conversations are brought together in a larger context. It can express 
the causal dependency between these conversations and put a larger 
context in which such relationships can be depicted.

For example, the patient-receptionist-doctor (PRD) scenario involves 
three conversations and expresses the relationship between these 
conversations:

1. Patient-receptionist
2. Receptionist-doctor
3. Doctor-patient

These conversations do not follow each other: they are interleaved. The 
choreography starts and actuall ends in the scope of the 
patient-receptionist conversation (from hi to bye). The 
receptionist-doctor conversation starts before the doctor-patient but 
concludes after the doctor-patient (doctor notifies recipient it is now 
able to accept patients).

There are much easier means to express sequences of conversations, but 
the only one that can express interleaved conversations with dependency 
between these conversations, is the multi-party choreography,
