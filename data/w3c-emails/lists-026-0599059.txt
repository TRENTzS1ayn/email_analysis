Small variations such as VAT or no VAT can be dealt with in a single 
order processing system, and commonly are.

OTOH, if the message content varies widely, is the choreography likely 
to be the same? Would I just deploy a single abstract choreography to 
change what industry I am serving? A semiconductor manufacturer, for 
example, is likely to have different order processing rules than a shoe 
manufacturer. More than just the message content differs.
