I'm assuming you agree that this is a multi-party choreography which cannot 
be broken down into multiple bi-party scenario.
Under this assumption, these are 2 different multi-party choreographies 
because the reception/doctor interaction has been changed.  It just happens 
that from a particular party's view (ie: patient), the interaction sequence 
is the same.

What if the doctor want to make sure he is being asked for availability 
before the patient shows up ?
