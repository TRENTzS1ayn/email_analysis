Yes.  This is equivalent to having the shipper sending 2 messages to the buyer
1) I'm binded to the SHIPPER role of conversation 123 (the proof is in my 
knowledge of the order number)
2) Here is the arrival notice

Completely agree !
The abstract choreography may mention that there will be a "property" in 
the message that communicating the binding decision.
The concrete choreography will then associate an XPATH expression to the 
"property".
