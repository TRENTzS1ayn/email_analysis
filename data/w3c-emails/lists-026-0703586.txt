Absolutely true, which is why I sent a use case that shows how it 
actually gets done. The PDF document is received by some medium (TCP, 
FedEx, curier piegeon), information is entered at some terminal, it 
becomes an XML message that the participant can process subject to the 
choreography.

But there's also a use case for not looking into an attachment like a 
PDF but just routing it around, which is more common. In this case you 
don't care what the attachment contains bit by bit (in the choreography 
context), you don't express anything about its contents (XPath or 
otherwise), so there's no need to convert it to XML.

I understand why XPath would be problematic if we just say: everything 
should be expressed as XML. But I think what we're trying to capture is: 
here's the important information that affects the choreography flow as 
expressed by the choreography. Use XML to deal with it. The rest is 
opaque, even if it's XML.
