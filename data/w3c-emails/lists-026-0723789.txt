Assaf,

Just to make sure that I understand your point of view. Why isn't the
definition of the interactions between the patient and the receptionist
also called a choreography? 

It seems to me that you are introducing the term choreography and
conversation to address the problem of recursive composition (or lack of
it). Let's imagine that we need to expand the use case and add support
of hospital ticket validation (which is described as another
choreography). Can you compose the PRD choreography with the Hospital
Ticket Validation choreography, if so how and what would you call the
result.

And 
* there is another choreography that defines how those
  sub choreographies are composed
