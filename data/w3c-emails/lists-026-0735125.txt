I think that the responsibility/commitment is expressed in the
PrescriptionReceipt document. Based on the use cases we have seen
enterprises care much more about the semantic of documents that the
state of a virtual conversation. This also allows for more natural
composition I think.

The conclusion here again is that one single universal choreography
approach and language might not work in for all use cases and n=2/n>2
might be a boundary case.
