There is no reason not to call it a choreography. I wanted to illustrate 
a choreography that has n conversations. It may well be that n=1. 
Regardless of how n is there is exactly one choreography instance, so 
the point is to distinct between the two since a choreography instance 
may range over n>=1 conversations.

At this level I'm only discussing composition. There's nothing recursive 
about it.

If you describe X as sending, Y as receiving, and X+Y as choreography 
that's a composition. If you describe conversation X, conversation Y, 
and interleaving of X, Y as choreography that's also a composition. At 
this level there is no recursion.

This is where you introduce recursion. You begin with a PRD 
choreography, then describe a larger choreography that includes Ticket 
Validation. When you include one choreography within another you get 
recursive composition, since you can do it over and over at different 
levels.

You can also have overlapping not-nested choreographies.

1. PRD is one choreography.
2. Ticket validation another choreography.
3. Patient record handling (usually at end of day) another choreography.
4. PRD + Ticket validation is a choreography and a recursive composition
5. Ticket validation + patient record handling is a choreography and a 
recursive composition

#4 and #5 overlap but are not nested within each other. But #1-#3 can be 
reused to define #4 and separately #5, which is the benefit of reuse, 
but also explains the interest behind the pi-calculus model.
