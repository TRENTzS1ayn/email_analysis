On the conference call there was some discussion of how to do asynchronous
callbacks. BEA has posted a specification [1] on its website for a protocol
called WS-CallBack describing how to do this. It includes all the gory
details of making this work with WSDL 1.1. I promised on the call to post a
link to it. There are several other specifications [2] [3] posted there you
might also find interesting.
