Assaf

I think you have two main questions:
1. You can express things like VAT info as an optional element using
minOccurs="0", and
2. You don't see much value in creating templates that can be used by any
industry.

I disagree on both counts ...

USING OPTIONAL ELEMENTS
If you want to *totally* rely on optional elements then you would need to
define an order document that contained all the information required no
matter what country, what industry, what business process, etc it was being
used in.

This approach is clearly impractical as the time required to do all the
analysis would be excessive. Even if you did, then it would only require
some legislator to require some additional element in an order document to
mean that your generic order definition was inadequate.

Therefore you *have* to allow new documents to be formed by extending
existing ones. This means you will get multiple different document
definitions with multiple different namespaces. Following this approach also
means that you don't have to get order definition perfect first time. The
article I mention below explains why this is, IMO, the only way that works.

CREATING TEMPLATES THAT CAN BE USED BY ANY INDUSTRY
Let's not forget the SMEs (small and medium enterprises). They have the
problem that they have few resources and a small budget for their IT. This
means that they cannot afford to implement the multiple different
choreographies that would result if everyone developed their own way of
doing business. The *only* way, IMO, to get SMEs involved in eCommerce, is
if there are some generally accpeted choreographies that can be used for
doing business as then the SMEs will be able to buy off-the-shelf software
that allows them to pariticpate.

This is also important to big business. EDI often only worked its way down
the top two tiers (levels) of the supply chain because the lower levels of
the supply chain could not afford to participate in the myriad different
protocols that the "big guys" wanted them to use. As a result, the speed of
the whole supply chain was (and is) slowed down pushing up costs due to
additional inventory that must be held to compensate.

There will however still be a need for industry specific profiles and I
anticipate that the vertical industry groups will want to create them (e.g.
RosettaNet, AIAG, etc). I think that one of our objectives should be to
provide these types of groups with the technology and specifications that
make it easy for them to do.

Thoughts?

I have two questions:

1. I understand that the VAT info will be missing in a US PO which has 
different regulations. In an XML Schema I would express that using an 
element with minOccurs="0". In abstract terms this clearly says: 
information may not be there. When you build the choreography you can 
easily determine what information will always be there (I assume billing 
address is available in both US and Europe) and what information is not 
there. So you can build the choreography accordingly.

Remember, this is not an attempt to form all US POs to include VAT 
information. It's an attempt to describe a choreography that can be 
affected by information that is available in all messages.

2.Sending a purchase order is different from ordering a ticket. So does 
the choreography. I don't see much value in trying to create templates 
that are so generic that could be used in any possible industry.

Let's say you can define a template once and use it in every possible 
B2B scenario. Question? Do you need a language for that if the number of 
scenarios you intend to define is very constrained to begin with?

Let's say you decide to define a templace once and use it in every 
possible B2B scenario. But the interaction for ordering some product is 
different from the interaction for purchasing an airline ticket. So will 
we force the airline industry and shoe selling industry to reach a least 
common denominator so we can have one definition for both?

In my opinion the complexity and variety already exists. I don't want to 
ask companies to start doing business in different ways because it makes 
it easier to express these as XML. I am looking for a solution that 
makes it easier to do business the way you already do business.

My motto: Not to avoid the complexity that already exists, but to 
support the complexity that already exists without adding any additional 
level of complexity.

So everytime we discuss this issue I ask myself the following question:

1. Does this level of complexity already exist and is justified by 
business requirements? If so, I don't mean to change it, it's the 
business needs that drives the requirement.

2. Does the model introduces more complexity? That's a problem we should 
work to eliminate.

3. Does the model capture that complexity? That's a solution in my opinion.
