Not necessary. I just wanted to indicate that it's possible for a 
document to contain information that will not necessarily be available 
in all messages and to express that fact. There are many possible ways 
to do that in XML, see below.

Absolutely right. I agree with you on the principles, I just don't see 
where the problem is, see below.

This is where I disagree. I can define a template document that contains 
all the information I know will always be there, and define a 
choreography that references that information. That's important if I 
want to express that an advance shipping notice will go to the shipping 
address, but an invoice will go to the billing address. And obviously, I 
know both bits of information will be contained in every PO.

But you raise a good point: do I need to know all information that will 
ever possibly be contained in a message in order to make that work? If 
that's the case, this approach is flawed. Or can I define some of that 
information but allow other information to be included for a given 
business context. For example, in Europe the PO will contain VAT 
information, in the US the billing address would contain the state name, 
and if the PO is based on a quote it will also have to reference that 
quote. All that information is either optional, or additional.

XML Schema gives me two ways to deal with optional information (#1 and 
#2 below) and three ways to deal with additional information (#3-#5 
below) while still being able to express that part of the information 
that is mandatory without having to switch namespaces:

1. Elements with minOccurs=0 (may or may not occur)
2. <choice> (one or the other)
3. <any> and <anyAttibute> (put anything you like)
4. derivation by extension (add anything you like)
4. substitution elements (similar but for elements instead of types)

So I can define a purchase order that will always have a billing 
address, and I can include the VAT information as an element where <any> 
appears and add the state code by having a USAddress that 
extends/substitutes Address.

I want to say that I've only looked at a few UBL examples out of the 
many, but I can't see anything that cannot be expressed in that 
extensible manner using XML Schema.

I agree. But the question is: do you define one choreography for all PO 
in the automative industry, or do you define a template that all 
possible B2B scenarios would use?

In the first case you benefit from uniformity, that's very important. 
But you build a choreography that is rooted in some known information 
that is communicated (see above how to express it regardless of country, 
or even to extend it whether you're dealing with passenger cars, trucks 
or motorcycles). In the second case you have templates that ignore the 
information, are even more reusable, but are constrained to the least 
common denominator between the auto industry, airline industry, retail 
industry, etc.

Let's look at EDI for example. EDI defines a number of business 
transactions with flows = choreography. And for each business 
transaction you know what the messages look like. So you can express 
that transaction in terms of the messages exchanged, you can say that 
advance shipping notice goes to the shipping address but invoce goes to 
the billing address. The same for RosettaNet (I'm actually more faimilar 
with PIPs than EDI).

I'm trying hard to think of a case where in B2B you would describe a 
transaction on the one hand, but not be able to capture the basic 
information that is contained in its messages. I'm not saying you know 
everything that is part of the message, but in all the cases I've seen 
you know enough to write some basic rules based on message contents.

What would be a counter example?
