I was having trouble following the use case as a text description, so I made up a couple of diagrams to help me follow the example. There is a diagram with a 3-party choreography (3Part_Pat-Recp-Doc.jpg) and three separate diagrams of the individual 2-party choreographies (within 3_2Part_Pat-Recp-Doc.jpg). I am sending in the diagrams to help those like me who need to see pictures. 

A note about the diagrams: The activities of the three parties are separated by swimlanes. The solid lines between activities indicate the sequence of activities for each party. The dashed lines show the flow of messages between the parties. I numbered the messages as was presented in the example. The activities within the swimlanes represent only the interface for that party. Presumably, there are activities that go on behind the scenes, but are not modeled in the choreography.

No.  The patient doesn't care but the doctor may care.
In a multi-party choreography, this is NOT just the patient's concern, but
also the receptionist as well as the doctor's concern.

Yes, but how do you express that responsibility in the choreography
definition ?

I agree.  I certainly think the majority use cases are bi-party contract.
