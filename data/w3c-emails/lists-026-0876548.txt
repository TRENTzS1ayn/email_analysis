I agree that a composite service is not the same as a choreography.

However my statement was not about a composite service, but used the 
term composition in a generic sense. So I want to clarify how I use 
composition and related terms.

Composition - To combine parts to create a whole. Does not apply to 
specific parts or whole.

Putting two operations in a sequence is a composition. Combining two 
conversations to form a larger choreography is also a composition.

Some example:

part(1): operation X
part(2): operation Y
composition:
  sequence
    action perform X
    action perform Y

Recursive composition - A form of composition which where the parts and 
whole are of the same generic type.

For example, composing two choreographies to form another choreography, 
or composing two services to form a new service.

Some example:

part(1): process X
part(2): process Y
composition:
  process Z
    call X
    call Y

Service composition - A form of recursive composition where the parts 
and whole are services (or service types).

Some example:

part(1): service type X
part(2): service type Y
composition:
  service type Z
    uses X
    uses Y
