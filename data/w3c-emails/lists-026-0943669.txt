There is a diagram with a 3-party choreography (3Part_Pat-Recp-Doc.jpg) and three separate diagrams of the individual 2-party choreographies (within 3_2Part_Pat-Recp-Doc.jpg). I am sending in the diagrams to help those like me who need to see pictures.

The dashed lines show the flow of messages between the parties. I numbered the messages as was presented in the example. The activities within the swimlanes represent only the interface for that party. Presumably, there are activities that go on behind the scenes, but are not modeled in the choreography.
