One issue behind diagrams like these is that (a) they presuppose an 
ordering relationship between messages between the receptionist and the 
patient that is dependent on message between the doctor and the 
receptionist. This is not accurate. And (b) that there is one 
receptionist/patient interaction with every receptionist/doctor 
interaction, again not sustainable; at least, the interleaving is not 
so straightforward.
