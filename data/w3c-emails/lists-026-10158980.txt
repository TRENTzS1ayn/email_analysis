Nick:

Actually, I am not really back, just trying to understand your work
informally.

Hum...is that an invitation? Sounds like you have a lot of brain power
already. I don't know if I am capable of adding anything to your work.

Actually, I was expecting a more substantive response, I guess we did
not have an agreed upon choreography in place and it sounds like you
took an unforeseen exception path in somewhat basic unit of work. I
would hate to have this choreography park.

It would be really great if you have some time and could compensate with
an answer to these questions, as I really did not mean to raise any
issue. At least I cannot see where I raised an issue or did I?
