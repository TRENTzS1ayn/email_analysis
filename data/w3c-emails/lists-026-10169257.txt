It seems to me that a BPEL abstract process might be a better model for
what you are trying to do in this case.

<TITI>

Hi,
I think, and please correct me if I am wrong, my simple example fits in the
"Goals and Scope of the Web Services Choreography Working Group" as it is
stated in your charter. What you suggested is to use BPEL (and combine it
with WS-CDL) for my example, but I think this contradicts the fact that you
intend to develop a choreography specification in a vendor-neutral forum.
In this context, which exactly in the relation between WS-CDL and BPEL
(abstract processes)?
(I understood form the Steve's last email that WS-CDL starts where BPEL
cannot go, and BPEL stops where WS-CDL choose to start - does this mean that
WS-CDL will use BPEL(abstract processes) if needed (for examples like the
one I gave, as Ugo sugessted)?)
Still my question: why WS-CDL isn't meant to solve also the type of example
I gave?

Thanks,
Titi
