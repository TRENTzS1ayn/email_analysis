The doctor/patient scenario can be viewed as an example of two 
fundamental scenarios:

1. The multiple server/single queue scenario (this is how I introduced 
the use case at the F2F)
2. The composite business scenario (to build a patient visit service 
you need to combine a receptionist with a doctor)

If the latter is the intent, then the diagrams are fine. If the former 
is the intent, then my issues stand.
