Go back to the archives from the beginning of the working group, you'll 
find a lot of discussions about various proposals for what a 
choreography language should be. By proposal I mean any idea put on the 
table, including ideas for specifications to be written and ideas for 
revising existing specifications. There was a lot of discussions and a 
lot of great ideas thrown around.

One of the points of contention, aside from who's view is it, was the 
proper level of abstraction, with different proposals arguing for 
different levels of abstractions. Generally speaking, a proposal that 
advocates independence from WSDL would tend to view a proposal like WSCI 
as being too operational and not abstract enough. WSCI however deals 
with interfaces and behavior types, and would consider an execution 
language like BPEL to be too operational and not abstract enough.

No effort to take it to the next step and no vendor product support that 
I know of.

It's a linkage between two interfaces, not two services. So it's not static in the respect that a global model only links service A and service B. And the linkage is there to allow composition, so you can reuse the same interface in any number of compositions (global models) that fits.
