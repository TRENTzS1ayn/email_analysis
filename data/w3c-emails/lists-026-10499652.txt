Dear colleagues,

Following on from an earlier email response to Dr. Dragoni Nicola I 
would like to raise some thoughts and ideas with respect to the work of 
the W3C Web Services Choreography working group.

Having spent the best part of one year scoping what the group is all 
about and, latterly, the last three months getting to grips with 
fundamental requirements and a base specification we are now far enough 
along the track to raise some thoughts and ideas with the IG.

The Choreography working group is specifying a language that describes 
the external observable interaction between peer-to-peer Web Services 
that act in concert to deliver some business goal. Central to this is 
the notion of a peer-to-peer global model in which no one party has 
overall control. A choreography description is just a description. It 
is not executable. However it plays a number of roles from the 
generation of code skeletons for prospective participants (that are Web 
Services) to being a potential input to tools that may execute at 
participant Web Service locations to enforce or monitor adherence to 
the choreography. In the latter sense a choreography description is a 
behavioral contract that is agreed to by the various participant 
organisations.

The first thought in all of this participants may change in 
choreography. That is a choreography is not bound to specific Web 
Service instances and can be reused against many candidate Web 
Services. One area of common interest is what properties should a 
choreography provide to help in the selection of Web Services that 
would like to participate in a choreography. We may, for example be 
able to offer properties such a lock freedom of any services 
participating in a choreography relative to each other. There could 
well be other properties too. In which case what role does a 
choreography play in Web Service selection - it too could be a property 
in and of it's own right.

As  early stabs in the dark the selection of a Web Service based on 
which choreographies it might be able to join (conformance to the 
contract) is perhaps a good place to start together with choreography 
location (since it may predicate service selection). Although the 
Choreography WG would be happy to entertain wider discussion.

Please ensure that any responses go to this list and 
public-ws-chor@w3.org.
