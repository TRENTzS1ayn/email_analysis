I think that the diagrams will only reflect the intent of our approach. The discussions leading up to this was which of the two fundamental scenarios our working group should choose. That is, would we specify multi-party choreographies or restrict it to only bi-party choreographies. The diagrams were presented to show an example of each approach and then visualize the potential issues surrounding each approach-such as the relationship between the ordering of the messages between the 3 parties. If we decide that only bi-party choreographies will be specified, then the multi-party diagram would not be employed in the use cases, and there would be no issue in reading the diagram.

The doctor/patient scenario can be viewed as an example of two
fundamental scenarios:

1. The multiple server/single queue scenario (this is how I introduced
the use case at the F2F)
2. The composite business scenario (to build a patient visit service
you need to combine a receptionist with a doctor)

If the latter is the intent, then the diagrams are fine. If the former
is the intent, then my issues stand.
