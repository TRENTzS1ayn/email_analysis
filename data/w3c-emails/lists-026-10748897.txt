I think so. I submitted an Auction Use case where registered users could
subscribe to a particular auction so that they were notified of bids. See
the attachment on ...

Do any of the existing use cases require pub/sub?  While I agree with 
David's suggestion that we should be able to describe a pub/sub 
interaction in the CDL, I really think it should be driven from the use 
cases.  For example, the new auction use case that David proposed could 
use pub/sub but isn't strictly dependent on it.  To me, this suggests 
pub/sub is a transport mechanism rather than a choreography issue.  A 
feature of pub/sub that might be worth pushing up into CDL, however, is 
the potential for anonymous receipt of documents (i.e. sender cannot 
identify the set of receivers).

Ciao,
