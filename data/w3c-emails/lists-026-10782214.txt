mm1: Steve, these requirements should be generic as Reg/Rep also handles 
web services and had a Semantic Content Management subgroup. Suggest we 
distribute to both groups. Kathryn Breininger is the OASIS co-chair 
(kathryn.r.breininger@boeing.com) and Farrukh Najmi, the technical lead 
(farrukh.najmi@sun.com).

Thanks.
