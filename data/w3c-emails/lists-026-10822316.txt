mm1: Tony, your comments regarding the association between transactions, 
recovery and exceptions are good ones. Transaction = recovery boundary 
was a basic question of mine when I read Section 3.7.  Until we decide 
about exceptions, it may be difficult to establish that boundary.

In addition, role types were discussed in the F2F in December 2003 in 
London.

Good comments, look forward to the discussion. Thanks.
