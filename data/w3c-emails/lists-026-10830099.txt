This is correct.

ebXML Registry version 2.5 has Content-based (as opposed to topic-based) 
event notification where selection of events are done by focused ad hoc 
queries using SQL or XML Filter query syntax. Notification may be 
delivered to a SOAP Service or via email. Please let me know if I can 
answer any specific questions.

Thanks.
