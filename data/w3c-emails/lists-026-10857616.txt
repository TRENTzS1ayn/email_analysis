It would also be highly unlikely that the ebXML Registry adopt
WS-Eventing or WS-Notification from the standpoint of their main
mission. The event notification feature of the registry is based on
registry contents (subscriptions to RegistryObjects, etc.) rather than
subscriptions to Web Services themselves.
