Yes, something like that. WS-Notification has more sophisticated
functionality than WS-Eventing, like brokered notification, topic spaces
and subscription managers, but probably ebXML Registry does not need
those and WS-Eventing would be sufficient.

As Monica mentioned, the fact that these specs are not currently open
presents problems, but that might change soon if the authors make good
their promise to submit to standard organizations.
