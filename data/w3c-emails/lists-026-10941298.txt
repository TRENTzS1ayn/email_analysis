Taking this one step further, and emphasizing that I am simply musing
about this topic and not in any way representing the official position
of the ebXML Registry TC:

The only catch to this approach would be that - in the current ebXML
Registry specs (and I don't represent this as a shortcoming in any way)
- the subscription is represented using the native registry query
mechanisms, while WS-Eventing wants an XPath expression as a filter.
Here's an example from the ebXML Registry Services spec v2.5, in which a
SQL Query expression is defined for a subscription:

SELECT * FROM Service s, AuditableEvent e, AffectectedObject ao, 
              Classification c1, Classification c2 
              ClassificationNode cn1, ClassificationNode cn2 WHERE 
         e.eventType = 'Created' AND ao.id = s.id AND ao.parent=e.id AND 
         c1.classifiedObject = s.id AND c1.classificationNode =
cn1.id           AND 
         cn1.path LIKE '%Plumbing' AND 
         c2.classifiedObject = s.id AND c2.classificationNode =
cn2.id           AND 
         cn2.path LIKE '%A Little Town%'
