We (ebXML Registry TC) would certainly align future versions of our 
specs with open and approved standards in this area as they emerge.

We would also need to make sure that our content-based eventing 
requirements are addressed
by participating and contributing to the development of open standards 
in this space.

Please correct me if I am mistaken but my impression is that at this 
stage neither of the specs you mention
have been donated to an standards body.

Thanks.
