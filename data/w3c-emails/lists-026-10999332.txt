Yes I meant ebXML Registry TC. Sorry for the confusion.

The requirements are existing requirements that already being met by 
ebXML Registry 2.5 specs.

As I said in my last message on this thread, it is unlikely that ebXML 
Registry requirements will be relaxed in future.

What is more likely is that *open* standards will evolve to better 
support the requirements. Once they (*open* standards)  do support ebXML 
Registry requirements, the ebXML Registry TC would have compelling 
reason to adopt them.
