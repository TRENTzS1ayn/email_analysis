David,

Funny you should mention an auction scenario and ebXML Registry. See a 
recent exchange below where I used the same scenario in the context of 
ebXML Registry event notification.

I feel that ebXML Registry event notification could be used to support 
multi-party collaboration scenarios as the next logical step from binary 
collaborations exemplified by ebXML Messaging and SOAP.

As it currently stands, registry events are only triggered when a 
CREATE/UPADTE/DELETE operation occurs
in the registry. For example a BiddableObject must be written to 
registry to represent that something is open for bids. Bidders would be 
subscribed to BiddableObjects and will be notified. They can then write 
Bid objects to the registry. The auctioneer would be subscribed to Bids 
for "their" BiddableObjects and will be notified when a Bid is placed. 
They would have to write a BidResult object to registry when bidding 
closes and all Bidders would be notified of the BidResult.

So yes several objects would have to be written to the registry in order 
to support this scenario.

The second approach allows for multi-party colaboration instead of 
binary collaboration.
It would rely on Registry Event notification. An example would be a 
bidding or auction scenario.
