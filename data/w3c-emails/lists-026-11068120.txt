Thanks, Farrukh,

I was hoping you could bring better clarity to there issues, which 
you have. I apologize for covering ground that has already been 
through the process of discovering where boundaries appear to be in 
reality as opposed to theory. My own concerns are that we may end up 
with conflicting overlaps of eventing models and specs, which has 
already occurred in principle if not in actual fact with the 
ws-eventing and ws-notification proposals. What we see are similar 
terms used in similar but not identical ways. Since these trial 
balloons have not yet been cast in concrete, we can, hopefully, head 
off conflicts.

However, since we are at a stage in the development of web services 
where we have just seen recent updates to SOAP and RDF/OWL, it seems 
like a good time to reassess what needs to be done vis a vis looking 
for better coordination among W3C, ISO, OASIS--which we are also 
seeing, so this is helpful to understand. I have a lot of reading to 
do. The brochure now joins the list.

My main concern is duplicated and possibly conflicting efforts and 
scalability. As long as we avoid those pitfalls I will be happy with 
whatever solutions prove out.

Ciao,
Rex
