I agree that this is begining to sound like an Auction application that 
use ebXML Registry in its
implementation. Even so, the ebXML Registry can provided much more than 
one might think. For example it can do the following:

-Serve as a User Registration service based upon strong DSIG based 
authentication and custom  Role Based Access Control using XACML 1.0 
standard.

-Allow app specific content validation to be applied before accepting a 
content (e.g. Bid lower than highest bid wont be accepted, Users must be 
registered before they can bid.)

I believe you can. It can provide some basic features that the 
application can be built upon.

Just to clarify. I stated early in this thread that:

"I too occasionally wonder about whether registries *SHOULD* play a role 
in multi-party collaboration but have no doubt about their need to 
support a content based event notification feature."

But I have no doubts that it *COULD* be used for this use case .

If one views the registry like a database for web services as I do then 
I do not see this use case as an abuse of ebXML Registry. Many people 
are using ebXML Registry as a general purpose database/CMS for web services.

I defer to you and other ws-choreography folks on whether such uses of 
ebXML Registry make sense for this use case.
