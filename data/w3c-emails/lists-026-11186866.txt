Here are some high points from the WS-Discovery spec - I'm speaking on
Web Services Standards (the up-to-the-minute landscape, including
Choreography) at the Washington D.C. XML Users Group this evening, and
had these high points already prepared as part of my presentation:

- WS-Discovery (Web Services Dynamic Discovery) defines a "multicast
discovery protocol" to locate services;

- To find a target service by the type of the target service, a scope in
which the target service resides, or both, a client sends a "probe
message" to a multicast group; target services that match the probe send
a response directly to the client.

- To locate a target service by name, a client sends a resolution
request message to the same multicast group, and again, the target
service that matches sends a response directly to the client;

- To minimize the need for polling, when a target service joins the
network, it sends an announcement message to the same multicast group.
By listening to this multicast group, clients can detect newly-available
target services without repeated probing.

Kind Regards,
