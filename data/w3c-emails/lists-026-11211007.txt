Diane and John,

I sent an email to both of you some time ago (20th January 2004) asking 
if it would be possible to enter into a reciprocal arrangement 
regarding the mutual reporting of the status of our respective groups 
(Oasis's WS-BPEL TC and of course W3C Web Services Choreography WG). 
Our face to face meeting is scheduled for next week (Mon 1st and Tue 
2nd March) and as yet I have received no reply at all.

Our working group as well as the W3C Web Services Coordination Group 
were wondering if it would be possible to get a report (perhaps no more 
than 2-3 power-point slides with some notes) so that we can give the 
report at our face to face meeting next week.

Could you let me know if it would possible for next week and also if a 
reciprocal arrangement is something that would interest your group as 
much as it does W3C in general.


Best Regards

Enclosed is the original email:

From:   steve@enigmatec.net
Subject: To WS-BPEL

Dear Diane and John,

We have been asked as chairs of the W3C Web Services Choreography 
Working Group to formally request a status report from the Oasis 
WS-BPEL TC so that we can ensure that the two groups work harmoniously. 
Such a report is nothing other than a reciprocation of those reports 
that we have provided to your TC.

Our next scheduled face to face is on the 1st and 2nd March in Cannes, 
France. We would very much appreciate it if you could facilitate the 
request so that we can present a report at this face to face.

Best regards

Martin Chapman and Steve Ross-Talbot
