Hi Folks,

Please excuse the cross post, but I'm looking for two kinds of 
questions that you want answered when you are evaluating a new 
specification to decide if you think it is worth exploring further to 
determine if you think it is ready for adoption.

First, what is most immediately important, or else you wont look further.

Second, what do you look for in ease of implementation.

I am asking because I'm helping with a FAQ for a spec that is moving 
toward approval, and we need to build a FAQ to help evaluators make 
these kinds of decisions.

Thanks,
Rex
