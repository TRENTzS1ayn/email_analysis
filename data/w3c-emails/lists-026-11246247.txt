Rex,

Check out our brochure on CAM

http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/5485/CAM%20brochure%20draft1%2015Feb04.doc

- you need to answer the why, what, how, etc.
Also - since an FAQ is exactly that - we have a format for that out on our
swiki - http://cam.swiki.net

DW.

further.

> > Second, what do you look for in ease of implementation.
