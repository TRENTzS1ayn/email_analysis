Rex,

That's easy

#1 - the vision and the motivation (why is this happening?)
#2 - the appropriateness and the need (value / fit to existing work)
#3 - technical approach / innovation / chair / feasibility
#4 - applicability to work I am contributing to / part of / using
#5 - social benefit(s) / delivery schedule / sponsors

Thanks, DW.
