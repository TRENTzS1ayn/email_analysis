Dear Monica,

Martin and I spent quite a while on the requirements document in Dublin 
a week ago. One thing we did after our meeting was go back to your 
usecase which was included in the last version of the reqdoc.

Our take on the use case is documented below. We believe there to be 
one fairly important requirement that is not covered in the document at 
all. As such we have suggested a variation on usecase 2 to incorporate 
this requirement.

We would welcome you thoughts on this at the F2F.

Cheers

Steve T
