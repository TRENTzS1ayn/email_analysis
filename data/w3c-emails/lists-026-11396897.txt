Hi,

The WS-I Board of Directors recently voted to make drafts of the Basic 
Profile Attachments work publicly available for review and comment.

The new drafts consist of a
    Basic Profile 1.1,
    Simple SOAP Binding Profile 1.0
           (the 2 combined are intended to be roughly equivalent to BP 1.0)
    Attachments Profile 1.0

There is also a draft of the Profile Conformance Framework.

The documents are available on the public ws-i.org site by looking in the 
"more documents link" under the Recent Publications link.

Please send comments to wsbasic_comments@ws-i.org.

Here are the links to the pdf and html versions:
