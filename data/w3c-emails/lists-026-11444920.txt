What about defining a Web service that acts as a proxy for the interaction with a user? The request/response message would be, for example, some text prompted to the user followed by an appropriately encoded user response. In the case an HTML form is used, it's probably even possible to represent the browser interaction directly using the WSDL HTTP Get & Post Binding.

The way this is formulated seems to imply that mom is incompatible with web services. In effect a mom could be used as the web service transport corresponding to a particular WSDL binding.
