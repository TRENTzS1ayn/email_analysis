I've uploaded a PDF version of the Visio. It's available at:

The diagrams in the WS Chor Model Overview document were created by cutting
and pasting the diagrams from the Visio. There is *nothing* extra in the
Visio.

However I should be able to generate a PDF verison of the Visio and will
send one to the list shortly.

PDF would be a great help to me too (being a poor Apple user).
