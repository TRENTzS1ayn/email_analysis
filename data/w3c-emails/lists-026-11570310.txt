Dear Steve, before of anything, thank-you very much for your help. 
I will try to be clearer in my questions or in the things I didnt understand very well.

I?ve been reading a lot of different documents about choreographies and I think I have rmore or less the most important ideas, but there are still some things that are hidden for me

Why did you say that WSCI is just history? I mean, I know it?s a Sun... proposal for choreographies, and I think it?s being studying by the W3C WS Choreography Group. The goal is to get an standard similar to W3C or is there any better/newer proposal.
I think too, please help me to clarify, that BPEL4WS is more for orchestation thna choreographies and that there is not interest in the W3C for studying it to be an standard.

About the access point I?ll try to ask my question with an example. Suppose the tipical example with the traveler agent web service, the airline company web service and the rent car company web service. You want to make a choreography with them.
  * you have the wsdl from the three parties and the wsci (or other interfaz for choreographies)  from the three parties. ?OR IS THE WSDL EMBEBED IN THE WSCI?
* If you have any of that posibilities, it?s suposed that you have too an WSCI of the global model (?are the other embebed in this one?)
* Now, what I mean about the access point, If I want to invoquee any operation of the choregraphy, do I invoque it in the global model or do I have to search the WSDL from the parti to invoque it?

Just one question more. If  now want to create a ws choreography, I do know, supossly, how to specify it in XML (according one standard candidate as WSCI). I specify it and then? How do I try it? Is there any software or any idea? Should I translate it to a programing language?

Thank very much for all your help, I?m really greatfull
