Given that interoperability is pretty key to Web Services in general 
and given that Grid is becoming very Web Service focussed and given 
that Management of Web Services and Grids is a hot topic at the moment 
it strikes me that perhaps the interopeability that we might achieve 
through the adoption of a CDL can also be applied to management and 
therefore Grid and Web Service Management.

Any comments on how we might construct a value-proposition (if I am 
indeed correct)?

Cheers

Steve T
