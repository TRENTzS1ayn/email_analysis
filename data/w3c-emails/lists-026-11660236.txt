With apologies to those who may have already seen this news released
today:

"Grid and Web Services Standards to Converge" [1]

Excerpt:

<Excerpt>
Akamai, The Globus Alliance, HP, IBM, Sonic Software and TIBCO today
proposed new Web services specifications that will integrate Grid and
Web services standards. The new WS-Notification and WS-Resource
Framework represent the first time a common, standards-based
infrastructure will be available for business applications, Grid
resources and systems management. These new specifications will help
customers lower costs, speed deployment and enable integration across
and outside of the enterprise.

The WS-Notification specification and the WS-Resource Framework will
provide a scalable pub/sub messaging model and the ability to model
stateful resources using Web services.

WS-Notification can automatically trigger an action in the IT
infrastructure once certain criteria have been met.
</Excerpt>

The following page also provides background on the WS-Resource Framework
announced today:
