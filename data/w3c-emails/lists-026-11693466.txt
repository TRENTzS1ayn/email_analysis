During the last con call we briefly discussed the WSDL 2.0 concept of Attributes, and whether we could use Attributes in a choreography.

I just noticed that the Grid folks (the ones who originally asked for introducing attributes in WSDL 2.0) are giving up their original WSDL requirement and prefer instead to use the approach taken in the new WS-Resource specs just published - see the note at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-desc/2004Jan/0086.html . 

The relevant concepts in WSRF (see for example http://www.globus.org/wsrf/ModelingState.pdf ) are very similar to the WSDL Attributes idea, so we might continue our attributes discussions using as a reference the WS-Resource specs instead (with the caveat, of course, that they have not been submitted to any standards organization yet).
