Where would the WSRF fit relative to us or us of course relative to it? 
One thought is that management across domains of control is an area ion 
which a CDL would provide huge interop benefit and possibly fit into 
how one might use a CDL in the monitoring of web services relative to a 
CDL - i.e. sending the non-conformance messages as part of a meta CDL 
that describes the cross domain management.

Be interested in exploring this further.

Cheers
