As promised in the conference call on Tuesday, here's the draft of the WS
Choreography Deliverables document that describes what the editors think
should be the deliverables of the group. It identifies two main documents:

*A "WS Choreography Primer", which would be non-normative
*A "WS Choreography Description Language", which would be normative

It also identifies one possible additional document that would describe how
to generate process language definitions (e.g. BPEL) for a role from a
Choreography Definition.
 
Comments are welcome.
