Monika,

The simple answer is that orchestration implies a centralised control 
mechanism (i.e. the conductor in an orchestra), whereas choreography 
does not (dancers on a stage). In the former the players have a score 
that they adhere to (in BPEL this might be the abstract BPEL defs for 
the individual components) and the conductor ensures they all work 
togther harmoniously (the rest of BPEL). In the latter all the dancers 
have a choreography and understand their role in the overall dance 
because it has been agreed or imposed for them.

Orchestration is typically used in a domain of control. Choreography 
would be used across domain of control to ensure harmony 
(interoperability etc).

Choreography is sometimes viewed as a peer2peer global model of the 
external observable behaviour of the interacting components. We can 
think of this as a global behavioural contract that might be used to 
generate component stubs (i.e. Skeletal code) and/or with a tool by one 
or more components that is used to monitor the contract or even 
statically as input to a tool to reason about the behaviour (are there 
any deadlock or livelocks in this contract?).

Hope this helps.
