It would be normative in that it is the definitive authority. So if there
were was (which we hope not) an inconsistency between the "Primer" and the
"Descrption Language" specs then the Description Language spec should be
relied on.

... or are you asking about the generating process language definitions from
CDL ... in that case, I (and I also think the other editors) have not formed
any clear view although we all thought that the potential value meant that
we should discuss the idea on the list.

Would that be normative or more in the nature of an informative appendix or 
note?
