Not sure what you mean by "this". JSR-207, Process Definition for Java,
"will define metadata, interfaces, and a runtime model that enable
business processes to be easily and rapidly implemented using the Java
language and deployed in J2EE containers". But, of course, you don't
need this JSR to implement the equivalent of a BPEL process and offer it
as Web services that participates in a choreography.
