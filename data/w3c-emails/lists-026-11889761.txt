Yes. That's about it. I actually think that Steve's recent explanation of
the difference between choreography and orchestration summed it up nicely.

Would the primer talk about where BPEL fits in relation to WS-CDL.

Maybe this gets into methodology, but it sounds like business partners 
would get together and capture their discussion in WS-CDL.  Then each 
partner goes back and generates BPEL (skeleton) for their side of the 
interactions.   Then adds more meat to the BPEL such that they can feed it 
into a BPEL workflow engine.

Is that the gist of it?
