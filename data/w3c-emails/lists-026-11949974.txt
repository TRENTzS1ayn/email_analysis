Some questions for the great and good. Probably means Greg/Nick/Dave.

My use case, which is in part enclosed below, includes choreographies 
for the interaction that occurs between the
Buyer and the Trading Service, which plays the role of 
SellerConsolidator; called PricesRequest,
Buyer and Seller, in which the Trading Service plays the role of a 
Buyer; called PriceRequest,
CreditRequestor and CreditResponder in which the Sellers and Trading 
Service play the CreditRequestor role; called CreditCheck.

My question is that I want to reuse the CreditCheck with the other two 
roles since there is a dependency on doing a CreditCheck to the other 
two.
How do I do this?

Perhaps we can discuss this in the Examples section of the call tonight?

Cheers

Steve T
