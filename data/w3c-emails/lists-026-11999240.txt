Steve,

Is this a case of an additional participant 'SellerParticipant' playing
more than one role? I'm still not clear on how participants are
referenced in the choreography though (on the issues list).

Some questions for the great and good. Probably means Greg/Nick/Dave.

My use case, which is in part enclosed below, includes choreographies 
for the interaction that occurs between the
Buyer and the Trading Service, which plays the role of 
SellerConsolidator; called PricesRequest,
Buyer and Seller, in which the Trading Service plays the role of
a 
Buyer; called PriceRequest,
CreditRequestor and CreditResponder in which the Sellers and
Trading 
Service play the CreditRequestor role; called CreditCheck.

My question is that I want to reuse the CreditCheck with the other two

roles since there is a dependency on doing a CreditCheck to the other 
two.
How do I do this?

Perhaps we can discuss this in the Examples section of the call
tonight?

Cheers

Steve T
