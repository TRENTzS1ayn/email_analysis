In the PERFORM it is mandatory to have "this" and "free" variables. 
What if I have no variables to exchange? In my TWIST example I do not 
see a need to have such variables at this stage. Of course as the 
example gets more complex I *MAY* need to add such a facility.

So what is reason behind making these variable mandatory?

Cheers
