Hi There,

 

My name is Adam Fisher,

 

I have just created a Computer Related Message Board at my site just a few months ago. For now, it includes many Computer Related Categories but as needed, I'll be adding more to it. I noticed at that you seem to have computer questions from time to time as I saw on www.w3.org. Therefore, I just wanted to email you and let you know, I'm here to help if needed. Hey, I'm not a total expert. I think no body is if the truth is known.

 

The whole point to my site is to help people out for free with their tech problems as much as I can. That means all people without any bias! So if you or anyone you know have any computer problem, programming problem, internet bug or whatever; just come to my site and post a question in the message board and either myself or one of my friends will try to get back to help you out as soon as possible.

 

Also, you're already well versed in computers and would like to join me in helping others you can do so by writing an information article and email away. And I'll be sure to post it on my site with your name and website link.

 

These are just quick thoughts, hope I'm not rambling on and on.

 

Oh, before I forget; I can also put a link of your site (computer sites only) on my own. But you'll need to fill out your site info here: http://www.techiwarehouse.com/Ads/linkexchange.html.

 

I know it's not much, but I get a pretty decent traffic on my site. And good deeds are rewards in themselves if done for others. Again, I'm not asking for any money or any hand out for myself personally.

 

Let me know what you think.

 

Sincerely, 
Name: Adam Fisher
