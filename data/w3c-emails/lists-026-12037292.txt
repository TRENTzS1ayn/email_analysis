Hi Nick

In your presentation, you show the order request, completed/cancel scenario
(p27). Do you have the CDL for this example?

If not, could you provide a pseudo code sketch of the choreography part
(i.e. don't worry about definitions), with the relevant workunits, guards,
choices and interactions.

One other point - wouldn't the scenario have a 'CancelledPO' to ack the
cancel request?

Regards
Gary
