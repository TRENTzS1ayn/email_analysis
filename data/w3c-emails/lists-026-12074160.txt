As requested, here are the categories that I would suggest take priority 
(in order of preference):

    * Interacts
    * Variables
    * Import
    * Concrete information/bindings/QoS

If you need more granularity, please let me know. I chose categories 
because combined fixes may be easier to accommodate and preclude 
specific issue conflicts. Thanks.
