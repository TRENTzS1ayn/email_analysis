Dear Colleagues,
 
As promised on the call this Tuesday (8 June 04) please find attached an
editorially improved version of Steve's go at the TWIST example that now
opens in i.e. and I think is OK in XMLSpy 2004.  I say think as I have
extracted the current schema from the draft spec and loaded it into the same
sub-directory as the example xml but I can not get XML Spy to like the
schemaLocation value.  Any hints on what the reference should look like
appreciated.  The schema itself is passed by Spy as well formed and valid
against the referenced W3C Schema schema.
 
Best Regards     Tony
