Dear Davanum,
 
Thank you for your intervention - really helpful - that bit is working now.
So to summarise for others the schemaLocation parameter actually is a list
of at least two parameters separated by white space.  The first is the
namespace URI and the second is the location where the schema for that
namespace can be found - if more one namespace then just add another pair to
the list so for example;
 
schemaLocation="namspace1URI location1 namspace2URI location2 namspace3URI
location3"
 
Thanks and please do contribute to advancing the WS-CDL specification in
other ways too.
 
Best Regards     Tony

Dear Colleagues,

As promised on the call this Tuesday (8 June 04) please find attached an
editorially improved version of Steve's go at the TWIST example that now
opens in i.e. and I think is OK in XMLSpy 2004.  I say think as I have
extracted the current schema from the draft spec and loaded it into the same
sub-directory as the example xml but I can not get XML Spy to like the
schemaLocation value.  Any hints on what the reference should look like
appreciated.  The schema itself is passed by Spy as well formed and valid
against the referenced W3C Schema schema.

Best Regards     Tony
