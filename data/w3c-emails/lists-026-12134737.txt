Dear Colleagues,
 
I have now been able to edit Steve's version of the TWIST Example so that it
passes schema validation in both XMLSpy 2004 and also the slightly older
version of Sonic Stylus Studio that was made available to us last year.
This does not, of course mean that it is now complete or semantically
correct - only that it is syntactically correct for the moment!!
 
My intent has only been to do the minimum necessary changes to make it
schema valid at the moment and not to actually improve the description in
terms of covering more of the example.
 
Please find attached the revised XML for the TWIST example I have generated
and also the schema I have validated it against (extracted straight from the
HTML version of the spec and not changed at all I hope).
 
I am not sure that I can remember all the changes I have made but here are
the ones I can remember (doing a diff between these files and Steve's
original will reveal all!)
 
<role> was out of sequence - fixed by moving <participant> to its proper
place.  The package element contains a sequence - and you have to stick to
the sequence the schema lays down to be schema valid (I think we could move
to using <all> rather than <sequence> if we thought the freedom to put the
child elements in any order was useful, but I am not convinced we need to do
that and am not raising as an issue).
 
Some name attributes need to be qualified names
 
Some type attributes in Steve's original should have been name attributes
 
The name attribute on interaction is mandatory.
 
A choreography element must have a relationship element and at least one
activity, so on the last two choreographies that have yet to be done I added
a relationship with its name attribute (but not necessarily correct values!)
and <noaction> element as a temporary measure to get to schema valid.
 
Last thing that seems to be tool dependent:  XMLSpy was fine with name=""
(that is provide the attribute but with a null value).  Stylus Studio did
not like that and demanded a proper Qname or NCName - so I have added fairly
arbitrary names in places - I am sure someone else will soon do better.
 
Best Regards     Tony
