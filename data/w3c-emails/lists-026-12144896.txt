Steve/Tony
I have few questions.. I understand this is not completed example.
(1) What is the motivation to declare the "dummy" behavior  CreditReqDummy, 
CreditRespDummy in
CreditReqCreditResp relationship?
(2) Why do we have to define interactions (priceRequest) for multiple 
sellers in CDL?
Thought CDL provides some "repeat" construct for the activities.
This has been captured in the requirements document as well.
(Refer section 3.1.2.2)

Thanks
Mayilraj
