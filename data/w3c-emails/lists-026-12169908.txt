Dear Steve,
 
In you TWIST XML example I wonder if there is a reason for the following (or
is it just a mistake?):
In the normal PriceRequest choreography the interaction with seller A is
marked as initiateChoreography="false"
whereas the interaction with seller B is marked as
initiateChoreography="true"
 
Best Regards     Tony
