Dear Steve,

 
In your  TWIST XML example I wonder if there is a reason for the following
(or is it just a mistake?):
 
In the PricesRequest choreography there are interactions for "priceRequest",
"priceResponses", "priceAcceptance" and "priceAcceptanceAck"
 
In contrast the normal PriceRequest choreography only has an interaction for
"priceRequest".
 
It seems to me that we either need to add a priceResponse interaction to the
normal PriceRequest choreography  or define a different operation in this
case which is a request and a response.
 
 Best Regards     Tony
