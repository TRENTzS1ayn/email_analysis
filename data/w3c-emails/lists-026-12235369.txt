mm1: I just spoke with Abbie Barbir re: above. Here is my response:

    * We'll continue to discuss broadcast related requirements. I don't
      believe we need to capture it any more fully with my case.
    * Role changes or reversal (in original list of requirements 10 Feb
      2004) are related to business semantics and do not need to be
      included here.
    * Abbie has captured one requirement that has to do with dynamic
      changes during the entire choreography lifecycle.
    * /RE: "See above since this is simply a case of tagging
      sub-choreographies with descriptive names which may have no value
      other than at the business  level. Although it might be nice to
      think of them as having unique names (aka a URI)."
      /
          o I agree that the naming requirement may only be relevant at
            the business semantic level and could be provided by the
            choreography.

Thanks.
