Hi Nick, Hi all,

I finally got a chance to read the draft again. Attached please find my comments.

I am certainly grateful to the great work Nick has put into this draft. As a deliverable of the working group, I feel we still need a lot of editing work to make the spec more precise. In general, the draft reads more like a technical journal paper than a standard specification.  Choreography defines interfaces among different participants, precision and un-ambiguity of the specification is ultimately important. I feel it's really necessary to follow the WSDL2.0 model and rewrite the spec using XML infoset.

Best Regards,
Kevin
