What happens if a community designs a choreography put it into 
productions having generated all the necessary Web Services skeletons 
and then later on someone changes their Web Service (maybe changing a 
timeout from 2 to 3 minutes) and their CDL file?

The community as a whole are not updated nor are they updateable 
automatically. Is this a community process issue? Could we use any form 
of bi-simulation between the newly updated choreography and the master 
choreography to determine that they are now different and flag it as an 
error through a vendor specific bi-simulation tool?

Cheers
