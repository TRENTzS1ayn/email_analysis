Just catching up on the emails on this thread which I generally agree with.

I would actually go for option 3 that you describe as I think you will find
that within one choreography, you want to use different types of binding
some of which are not even web services.

... but I do think we are getting close.

I've discussed this internally with my colleague Bill Eidson, and we 
think it is ok to have the choreography depend on abstract WSDL. The 
implication is that you need to have a WSDL binding to whatever message 
format and/or protocol you are using. I realize others may have 
different opinions.
