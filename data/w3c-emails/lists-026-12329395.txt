Paul,

The answer to that is OASIS BPSS - where the pattern
behaviours for valid agreed interchanges are laid out
between two parties.

They then agree to follow those patterns.  BPSS is
adding some WSDL support - and essentially an
ASAP interaction within that BPSS is then just a
point node - where BPSS controls and manages
the pattern around that interaction.

You will find extensive work on UML and patterns
within the BPSS specifications and the CEFACT work
on business collaborations.

Thanks, DW.
