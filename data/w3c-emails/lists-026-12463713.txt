Martin,

It answers it in part, but the question remains, that under
asynchronous request-response, do you want to constrain at the
choreography level, the number of *parallel* instances that
a given interaction can have (one/some)? For while I cited
a case where it is appropriate to have more than one, there
are other cases where more than one will create a problem,
eg. double requests or double responses.

To stretch the question further, is such a constraint a matter
for the lower level web service to resolve, with chor. allowing
an arbitrary number of parallel instances of interactions of
the same type?

Or should a global model choreography expose this constraint?

Cheers, Alistair.

Alistair,

I believe the following covers your concerns:

"C-CR-5205   
A CDL MUST enable the determination of which collaboration group a
message belongs to. "
   
This requirement implies some correlation mechanism is needed, and is
consciously broad enough to cover synchronous request response, one
ways, and other asynchronous styles.

Cheers,
   Martin.
