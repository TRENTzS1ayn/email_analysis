Here's another choreography use case from UBL version 1.0 [1] which has just reached the committee draft stage which means that it is now open for public review.
 
In this use case there is a three participant choreography defined at ... http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/cd-UBL-1.0/art/UBL-1.0-ProcurementActivity-096dpi.jpg which I think is a good example of a simple supply chain choreography.
