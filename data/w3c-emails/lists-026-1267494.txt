Yes, and I do not want to stop that. On the other hand if we are putting
forward a proposal of the pros and cons, then it might be easier to do that
off-line and cause less "noise" on the list, and the work was done by the
more active participants. We could then:
1. Produce a proposed summary
2. Review the summary
3. Carry out a straw poll.

Chairs? Any comments?

I would be willing to do that, but isn't W3C generally that technical 
discussion is public?
