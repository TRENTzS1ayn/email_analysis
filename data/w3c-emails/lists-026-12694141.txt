This diagram illustrates some of the issues that I discussed with Nick
Kavantzas, Goran Olsson and Tony Fletcher in the early days of WS-CDL.

How do you align states of business agreement in a choreography?  And
then refer to those states of agreement as conditions for subsequent
actions?

For example, from the face of that diagram, the Seller will despatch
order items even if the order is rejected or canceled.

Similarly, if the order is changed, which version of the order does the
Seller despatch and the invoice reconcile against?
