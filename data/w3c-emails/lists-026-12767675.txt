Mmmmm ... interesting email ...

Monica you said ...

You're right, I do see WS-CDL as being usable, probably via some graphical tool, by the business analyst who then hands the design over to developers to implement. I think there is a real need for this type of formal language, and if it's not WS-CDL, then there is a big gap in the WS-xx space, IMHO that I don't think is filled elsewhere - is this correct?

I also agree that we need to resolve this issue, as we are obviously approaching this problem from fundamentally different perspectives which would lead to different outcomes.

mm1: David, you continue to discuss abstract choreography definition, 
references to business analysts, and an approach that infers your 
audience are business people. I would purport that WS-CDL is focused on 
the developer, pi-calculus and WSDL, and placement as a mechanism to 
help manage BPEL processes.  Regardless of tooling, I do not see the 
business analysts having any notion about what this language means. I 
will be providing a response to your comments to my concerns about the 
abstract definition. My concern is primarily based on two important 
premises:

    * The fully abstract definition is not well-suited for a WSDL-based
      paradigm.
    * Trying to further abstract WS-CDL may dilute the language [1].

Martin and Steve, I would suggest we resolve this issue quickly. I had 
thought we reached agreement and clarity in Cannes. We are limited in 
moving forward unless we can bound this issue and the continuous swirl 
could impact our capability to deliver. Thanks.

[1] I have seen several specifications that try to do too many things, 
rendering it either unusable or diluted.
