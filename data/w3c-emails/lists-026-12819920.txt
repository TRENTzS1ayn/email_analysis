I totally agree with David. CDL, as I understand it is about describing
peer-to-peer service interactions. It is expected that owners of
services engaging their services in a choreography will decide whether
their service is compatible with the choreography or not. I don't think
that there is any mechanism that can guaranty that a WSDL will be
compatible with a choreography since WSDL does not express what is
happening behind the WSDL. However, you can quickly and easily that a
given WSDL is incompatible with a choreography from an I/O perspective. 

Choreography is to a peer-to-peer interaction what API is to
client/server.

Ugo

This is odd. I see a small problem with a simple solution where I think
that others see a complex one.

Firstly, I am **not** suggesting that WS-CDL defines how you can
automatically determine that two WSDL definitions are semantically
equivalent as I agree it is fraught with problems.

What I am suggesting instead is that people determine that WSDL
definitions are semantically eqiuvalent. Here's an example ...

I see a world where:
a) People agree, for want of a better word, a pattern for exchanging
messages, where the messages are identified at an abstract level, i.e.
without reference to any WSDL definitions
b) Later, people map end points in those patterns to their own
previously existing WSDL definitions, or use the WS-CDL definition to
define skeleton WSDL definitions from which they can then create the
necessary code.
c) Once the systems are built and connected, the same people use the
WS-CDL definitions to automatically check that messages are being
exchanged in the correct sequence.

Is there anything wrong with this scenario?

David

Yes, the issue of semantic equivalence of Web services and their WSDL
interfaces has been raised a few times in the last couple of years in
various committees (WS-I Basic Profile, W3C WS Architecture and, I
think, WSDL WG). All the times the conclusion has been that such a
subject is out of scope and should be best left alone for now.

Right now we don't have any precise way of defining the semantics of a
Web service, let alone establishing that two Web services are
semantically equivalent.
