For me WSCI is the client/server view of a CDL (i.e. I can look at a
self-standing interface)
CDL is the peer-to-peer view (when the number of peers is much greater
than 2 it becomes harder and harder to look at it from a combination of
contracts, this is when you need to express the contract in a ChorDef
(the interfaces are implied in a chordef)).

I actually think that WS-CDL goes beyond conformance aspects and
addresses compatibility too.

WSDL by itself only describes individual operations and their associated
MEPs. (So if WSDL describes a one-way operation where WS-CDL expects a
request-response, I can promptly say that the WSDL is no conformant).

But WSDL does not say anything about the sequencing of operations
defined in the interface, and the sequencing comes from the
implementation (e.g. the BPEL behind the WSDL). So WS-CDL is also
concerned with compatibility.
