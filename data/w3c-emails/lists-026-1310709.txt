I enclose my use case that I tried to explain on the board at the 
face2face.

The problem is how do we express the external process behaviour of the 
client and server over their respective publicly observable states and 
how do we express the composition of the combines client and server.

I look fwd to robust debate.

Cheers

Steve T
