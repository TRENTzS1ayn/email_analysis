Steve,
Thank you for letting me know abouth the new requirement document.
Sorry for responding with such delay, I wish this was part of my job but
it isn't, so a brief morning session was all I could dedicate to it.
On the other hand, it was a job-related need that first got me thinking
to a Classifier-Instance choreography. Here I shortly describe such
common business situation.
I have read the new requirement document: my Use Case might contain
some additional requirements. Unfortunately I am unable to formally
express such reqs. All I have is a gut feeling that something might
still be missing, but I am unable to point my finger to it.
Thank you for taking the time of examining my not-so-clear Use Cases(!)

USE CASE - LEVERAGING ON EXISTING INVESTMENT ON OO COMPONENTS

A Company wants to make it easier to expose the functionality of
existing OO components as XML web service.
The goal is to minimise the need of writing component specific code,
whilst still exposing fully functional and truly standard web services.
Those components have been developed using different technologies,
purchased from different vendors.
Some OO components offer a very coarse grained functionality and are
relevant to business processes carried out both internally and
externally to the Company.
Vendors provide tools capable of creating a WSDL remote interface from
OO components written following certain rules. (e.g. a properly written

stateless session bean in J2EE or 
System.Web.Services.WebService class in .Net)

The problem is that a generic (vendor-neutral) web service client is
unable to get complete information on how to use those components merely
by reading such WSDL document.Furthermore, too many components can't be
exposed as web services or need a lot of custom coding to do so.
Components are not web services: they typically need to be instantiated
before they can be used, instances need to be addressable via a form of
remote reference, instances have lifetime.
It is impossible to express such needs using WSDL, hence generic web
service clients can't know how to correctly use those
OO-component-powered Web Services.

The solution is writing vendor-specific tools that can "process"
a generic OO component, creating 2 WSDL and a WS-CDL.
Those act as a "more intelligent" remote interface.
An instance of a WS-CDL described choreography provides the context
in which a transient ComponentInstance can begin, do stuff and end.

Typically:
- a ComponentParent WSDL for creating, finding and lifetime-related
  operations.
- a ComponentInstance WSDL with the business logic.
- a WS-CDL specifying in which sequence the two should be used by one
  or more Users.

The basic steps of the interaction are listed below:
1- User requests ComponentParent a channel to a new ComponentInstance.
(This is marked as Choreography Initiator in the WS-CDL)

2- User interacts with ComponentInstance via the channel.

3- Other Users might join in, obtaining the channel of the existing
ComponentInstance via lookup services provided by ComponentParent,
and then interacting with such ComponentInstance.

4-Users stop interacting with the ComponentInstance. Such specific
ComponentInstance is no longer useful. (The complete condition of
the WS-CDL evaluates to true. The Choreography ends.)
