Issue 563:
 From a technical standpoint, if the variables can be defined and/or
assigned dynamically during the choreography, a business level process
definition may restrict (constraints and business-level conditionality):
a. If values are defined at all.
b. Those values can be shared.
c. Those values can be changed/assigned during the choreography.
d. When those values can be assigned during the choreography.

Issue 565:
Address in banana calculus. Still maintain exceptions are propagated up
and down the chain. Exceptions can occur at work units not just at
choreography level.

Issue 566:
Even though WS-CDL can define an Acknowledgement message, specific
semantics apply to a business signal in an understood business
transaction patterns. For example, a Receipt Acknowledgement provides
verification that the message has been received and passed a grammar,
syntactic and schema validation. The use of acknowledgement evidences
legal and economic requirements. It is not necessary that CDL understand
these as it only understands 'a message'.  Possible that a constraint or
conditions could be available to WS-CDL.

Issue 610:
The relationship may be constrained by other than what exists in WS-CDL.

Issue 612:
Handled by banana calculus and related to Issue 565 on propagation. May
wish to close as duplicate.

Issue 614:
Clarify that the finalizer block applies to a choreography not a work
unit or set of activities. Could a finalizer block apply to a work
unit(s) or only a choreography?
If not, just close this issue.

Issue 615:
Example was deleted so delete this one.
