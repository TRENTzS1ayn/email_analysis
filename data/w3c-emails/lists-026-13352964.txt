Quick question for you members that are up to speed on the TWIST use 
case. In the example we did at the F2F we decided to have a 
SellerConsolidatorRole as opposed to just a SellerRole which the 
Trading System plays. Is the key relationship then a 
BuyerSellerConsolidator that links Buyer with the Trading System 
playing the SellerConsolidatorRole? If so we omitted it from the 
example. Could you let me know what you folks think and I shall code it 
up.

Cheers

Steve T
