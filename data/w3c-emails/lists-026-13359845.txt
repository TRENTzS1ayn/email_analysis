Dear Steve,

This may be of at tangent to the thrust of your query, but my only quibble
with what you say is the word 'the'.  Yes if we called it
SellerConsolidatorRole, then it makes some (naming) sense to call the
relationship of this role with the BuyerRole the BuyerSellerConsolidator
relationship (this form of language would work well in German!)- but whether
it is *the* key role depends on whose viewpoint you take, does n't it?

In short, yes do it!

Best Regards     Tony

Quick question for you members that are up to speed on the TWIST use 
case. In the example we did at the F2F we decided to have a 
SellerConsolidatorRole as opposed to just a SellerRole which the 
Trading System plays. Is the key relationship then a 
BuyerSellerConsolidator that links Buyer with the Trading System 
playing the SellerConsolidatorRole? If so we omitted it from the 
example. Could you let me know what you folks think and I shall code it 
up.

Cheers

Steve T
