I heartedly welcome this draft, and look forward to it leading to a useful
specification.

Hopefully the faults obvious in similar specifications [1,2] will be
avoided.

I for one would like to see a lot more informative content, even
(especially?) at this stage, because for example :

EndPoint (AKA Port)
...

Service
[Definition: A collection of EndPoints is called Service.]

so a collection of Ports is Service? I'm Clueless.

Cheers,
Danny.
