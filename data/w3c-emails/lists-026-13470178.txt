Danny, thanks for your encouragement and feedback!

The definitions in a requirements document have to walk a fine line:
enough detail to remove ambiguity in requirements and discussion, but
not too much detail to imply a solution.

My view on your specific question is that a service contains >= 1 port
and some other, service-specific information. When we publish a draft of
the new spec, this (and many other) questions should be answered. In the
meantime, the definitions contained in / implied by the WSDL 1.1 draft
are probably the most reasonable.

--Jeff

I heartedly welcome this draft, and look forward to it leading to a
useful
specification.

Hopefully the faults obvious in similar specifications [1,2] will be
avoided.

I for one would like to see a lot more informative content, even
(especially?) at this stage, because for example :

EndPoint (AKA Port)
...

Service
[Definition: A collection of EndPoints is called Service.]

so a collection of Ports is Service? I'm Clueless.

Cheers,
Danny.
