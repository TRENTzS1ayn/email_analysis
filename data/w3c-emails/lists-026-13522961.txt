Comments on 
Web Services Description Language (WSDL) Version 1.2: Bindings

Section 2.5 talks about soap:binding, the first sentence is:

The soap:body element specifies how the message parts appear inside the SOAP Fault element.

I don't think this statement is true and it is at least certainly misleading because the soap:body appear inside input, output and soap:fault is patterned after soap:body.  All of section 2.5 seems to suffer from the confusion with soap:fault.
