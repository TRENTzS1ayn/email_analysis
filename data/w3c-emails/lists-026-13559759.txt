Dear WSD'ers,

The definition of Web services in our requirements document is 
out of synch with that of "Web Services Architecture W3C Working 
Draft 14 November 2002" 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-ws-arch-20021114/ .

The new definition reads:

"[Definition: A Web service is a software system
identified by a URI, whose public interfaces and bindings
are defined and described using XML. Its definition can be
discovered by other software systems. These systems may
then interact with the Web service in a manner prescribed
by its definition, using XML based messages conveyed by
internet protocols.]"

Jean-Jacques.
