Hi Jean-Jacques,

I looked at the front of the spec and we don't actually define a Web
service ... we just indicate how we model it. Are you suggesting replacing
that with the definition? I'm not sure that helps .. but it is probably a
good idea to refer to the WSA draft for the normative def tho.

Sanjiva.

Dear WSD'ers,

The definition of Web services in our requirements document is
out of synch with that of "Web Services Architecture W3C Working
Draft 14 November 2002"
http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-ws-arch-20021114/ .

The new definition reads:

"[Definition: A Web service is a software system
identified by a URI, whose public interfaces and bindings
are defined and described using XML. Its definition can be
discovered by other software systems. These systems may
then interact with the Web service in a manner prescribed
by its definition, using XML based messages conveyed by
internet protocols.]"

Jean-Jacques.
