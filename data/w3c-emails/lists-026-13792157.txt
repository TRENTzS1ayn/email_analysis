Ed,

You asked two questions in your e-mail below.

1. Can the Value element ( when appearing as a child of SubCode ) be a
'faultCodeEnum' from an application specific namespace?

2. How do you specify in WSDL what the valid values are?

The answer to the first question is Yes, given that the type of the
Value element is xs:QName, the values can be from any namespace. You
could ( in WSDL via XML Schema ) restrict the type of soap:Fault and
specify what enumerated values are allowed.

The answer to the second question is really in the purview of the Web
Services Description Working Group, whose comments list I have cc'ed on
this e-mail.

Martin Gudgin
