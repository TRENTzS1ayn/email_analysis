WSDL 1.2 message patterns currently make fewer commitments than a SOAP
1.2 message >exchange< pattern. For instance, you may wish to compare
the following discussion of message >exchange< patterns

<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-arch/2003Jun/0223.html>

with the introductory text of WSDL 1.2 Part 2

<http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl12-patterns/#intro>

If you find this issue subtle, you're in good company. A task force
within the Web Service Description working group has been working to
clarify the issues.

We chose a different name because there were differences.

There is no intention to do so currently, but that may change pending
the investigation by the task force mentioned above.
