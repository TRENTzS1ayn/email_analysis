It seems to me that in that particular section, it is not the "Fault"
element layout that is under discussion, but the
SOAP-Body element layout.

It is also somewhat unclear what the element name for parts, referenced via
their type attribute, shall be. Maybe some
clarification would be useful for true interoperability?
