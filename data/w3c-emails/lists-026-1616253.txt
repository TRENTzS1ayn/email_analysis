I just noticed that the WSA glossary defines interface in terms of a 
service type. So for now they still retain the notion that there is such 
a thing as a service type (or a type of service), and the interface is 
what you would want to talk about when talking about the service type.

The reason I'm suggesting bringing back service type is simply because 
it makes the definition easier. For example, and don't kill me if this 
is not precise:

1. WS Choreography: Defines of how different service types interact with 
each other by exchanging messages. The definition is given in terms of 
interfaces (specifically WSDL 1.2) and other information relating to the 
service type is provided by other languages.

2. WS Choreography: Defines of how different interfaces interact with 
each other by exchanging messages.
