It seems that the next concept comes into the scene. It is "purpose". 
From the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) point of view, 
it may be called "goal of service provider", or "client's task". 
 
In my opinion service composition (orchestration, choreography) technology is 
for realizing clients' tasks, and goals of service providers. 
The task should be realized by using available services, 
and the services should be used if they are attractive enough. 
 
Perhaps the concept of task should be taken as the starting point. 

Please note that once the task is specified explicitly, it is the first step 
towards declarative approach. 

Best regards,
Stanislaw
