<graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" 
xlink:type="simple" id="serviceresfig1" source="Service-Resource.png"
xlink:show="embed" xlink:actuate="onLoad" 
alt="Model describing services and their relationship with resources">
  <caption>A resource offering a single Web Service.</caption>
</graphic>

What is the difference between the alt attribute and the caption? Can't
you use the alt attribute as a caption instead (other xmlspec.dtd-like
are doing so...)?

Not sure about the meaning of this kw element... What does it bring that
is not in the xmlspec.dtd already:
b     ednote  footnote     loc    quote sup
constraint   emph  i       phrase    sub
