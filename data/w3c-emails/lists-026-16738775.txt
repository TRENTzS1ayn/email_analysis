revision 1.5
date: 2003/06/05 18:50:08;  author: plehegar;  state: Exp;  lines: +16 -0
Removed graphic/caption (now using @alt). Removed kw. Added b|u|i as DTD extension. Changed figure number and table format/caption to follow O'Reilly. specref now works for table as well (yes Jean-Jacques, you can now reference a figure ;-). Removed id code in the XSL to reuse the 'anchor' template. Added ids in the spec to prevent them from changing at each publication.
