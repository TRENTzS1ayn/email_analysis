This of course raises the question what is ment by exposed?

Let's say you want to rent an apartment and you go to some rental agency 
service. Some renters insist on obtaining a credit report from a credit 
agency. The fact that they do so has legal implications. First, they 
need to alert you that they will obtain that information and in essence 
ask for your permission. They cannot do so unless you have completed a 
state clearly indicating that the next step would involve them obtaining 
a credit report. Second, a record of the query is made in your report 
and there are some implications to having too many queries within a 
given time frame. And third, if the request is rejected based on lack of 
credit you are entitled to receive a free credit report from that agency.

So the fact that a credit report is being obtained is of interest to 
you. How the credit report is being obtained is definitely not 
interesting and not something a rental agency would be happy to tell 
you. It may be a person calling up the credit report company on the 
phone and asking for details, they definitely don't want to tell who 
that person is. The messages exchanges are absolutely not of interest to 
you. You should never receive a credit report from the rental agency, if 
you need it you should contact the credit agency.

So now you have three things that could potentialy be exposed:

1. The fact that something happens that has a direct/indirect effect on 
you described as one of the steps that will take place
2. How that thing will happen, i.e. who will actually be contacted, how, 
when, etc
3. What actually happens, i.e. the actual information that is being 
exchanged

I am hard pressed to think of any use case where you would want to 
expose #3 i.e. magically making the message exchange between X and Y 
available to Z (snooping?), other than by sending Z all the relevant 
information. Sometimes the information in #2 is interesting, i.e. which 
credit report has been contacted (the one you should call to get your 
free copy), but that should be communicated to you explicitly, other 
information like who contacted them and when is not interesting. In 
fact, if I remember correctly it's the credit report that gets your 
contact information and sends you a notice. But #1 is interesting and 
there are other cases along these lines, usually involving the fact that 
your information is presented to some 3rd party or the fact that 
interaction with a 3rd party is made on your behalf.

The rule I stand by is "what you don't need to expose should not be 
exposed. period". I would not be interested in supporting a language 
that forces me to expose to any party how I happen to do things when I 
service their requests. Except in those case where I do need to expose 
that information for the benefit of these parties as agreed upon by all 
parties involves (in this case customer, rental agency, credit agency). 
My question is therefore how do I deal with those cases that do require 
some specific steps to be exposed in a controlled manner as dictated by 
the business scenario?
