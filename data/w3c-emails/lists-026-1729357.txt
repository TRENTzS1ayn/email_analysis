I don't know if this has been mentioned, but I was under the impression
that in certain industries, specifying your internal steps (e.g. as a
supplier to Boeing) was very part of the contract for regulatory
reasons.

I also think that there is a very important set of scenarios that can be
modeled and managed by ws-chor which involve "firewall transparency". In
other words, I want to be able to describe choreographies where
sometimes, I require the services of a partner, and sometimes, I can do
it myself (sounds very common during design activities where sometimes
you contract the design to suppliers), as a matter of fact both cases
can happen in the same unit of work (e.g. designing a car) at run-time.
So the border line between what is external or internal can only be
resolved at run-time. 

IMHO, being able to define both public, and semi-private choreographies
is a requirement. Semi-private would at least match the two use cases I
have given above.
