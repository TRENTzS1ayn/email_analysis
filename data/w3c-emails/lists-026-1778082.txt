I agree w/Martin in the above.

that said, is exposure of the details really the internal v/external 
distinction?  During the f2f I scribed the list of questions at [1], 
which included a lot of other aspects of choreographies w/respect to 
what these terms might mean and how they might be applied.  Despite 
trying my best to keep up w/the WG mailing archive, I still don't see 
that we've answered most of them (although they start from having use 
cases, which is what we are grappling with, so I mean this to be a 
constructive comment to the effect that we might be getting closer to 
answering these as we move forward)
