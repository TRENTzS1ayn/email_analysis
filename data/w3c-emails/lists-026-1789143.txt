BPEL 1.1 has a core language plus "Extensions for Executable Processes" 
and "Extensions for Business Protocols". So they actually have some 
overlap (the core stuff) but there is stuff that only applies to the 
descriptive (external) view and stuff that only applies to the 
executable (internal) view. It appears that the overlap area is the bulk 
of the spec, however.
