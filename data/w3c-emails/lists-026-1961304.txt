Our organization has been looking at acquiring a web-services management
platform but need clarification on several thoughts.

Should the management platform provide orchestration capability so that the
endpoint breaks apart a request and sends it to downstream services or
should be management platform simply route it to an orchestration service
that then calls the management platform to find other services.

If you have thoughts on this, please do not hesitate to reply back. Since I
am the author of a web services book: Java Web Services Architecture
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/1558609008/chiltownworldwid I can
send a complimentary copy to whomever provides the best answer.

Thanks in advance.
