Sorry, I had on my business hat for a second. Request was refering to a
client posting a SOAP message to a services management platform endpoint.
The incoming SOAP message needs to be broken into 1..n parts and routed
separately to different services. Likewise each service will return a
message that needs to be merged back into a single outgoing SOAP message.

Would you please explain what do you mean by  "request" and how do you
express 
it?

Best regards,
