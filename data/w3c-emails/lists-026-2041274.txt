Management platforms provide a level of indirection which is useful for
adding into an architecture the concept of metering, monitoring, billing,
routing, security, and so on. Check out Talking Blocks and Amberpoint for
vendors who provide implementations.

Up to my knowledge, a SOAP message is sent directly to its destination,
i.e., to 
a single service. The format of the message contents is precisely specified
in 
the WSDL interface of this service.
