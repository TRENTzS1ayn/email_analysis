Are we building a new language for pi-calculus or a language for WS 
Choreography?

If we're building a new language for pi-calculus we don't care if it has 
request/response. If we're building a language for WS Choreography we 
should be using WSDL 1.2. Then the problem becomes, does the model still 
work? Judging by all the existing WSDL 1.2 MEPs it works quite nicely. 
Each MEP is expressable as pi-calculus process, and the choreography is 
expressable as MEP, and you simply use macro expanstion to get a 
pi-calculus (or CCS) definition from the WSDL-based choreography (if you 
haven't used languages with macros think C++ pre-processor or templates).

I think we discussed the P = Q | R before. Every other process is not 
reducible, so it actually forces you to look at the larger view, the 
global model if you will, though it lets you build it by composing 
smaller particles which can be reused in other contexts. That's the 
value for me.

My view as well.
