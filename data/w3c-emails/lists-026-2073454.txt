I'm not sure if the term meta-model is used here consistently.

There's an abstract model of the language that is not married to any 
particular syntax. So the abstract model may have some component like an 
action and a component like a sequence which is a collection of 
activities. That E-R diagram is in my opinion part of the abstract 
model, but it only says how you build the information, not what it 
means. So it would say that a sequence may contain one or more 
activities, but that says nothing about what a sequence does. From the 
E-R I may conclude that these are "evil activities" that should never be 
executed. The abstract model also includes additional rules, some of 
which are not expressible in XML schema (the syntax). For example, the 
fact that the collection of activities in a sequence must be ordeded, 
but the one for a branch or parallel flow does not require ordering. So 
there needs to be more information in the abstract model than can be 
easily captured in an E-R diagram.

The question I would like to be answered is, what is the meta-model? Is 
it the E-R diagram of the abstract model components? It is just another 
name for the abstract model? Is it something more inclusive then the 
abstract model, e.g?

Pi-c does not have the notion of functions as part of the core fundemental constructs but it has being shown how one can code functions using the core pi-c very easily. So, function abstraction and function application should be part of our language in addition to the core fundamental constructs.
