I do not consider it as an answer to my question: What do you mean by "request"?

However, generally you are right that a complex client's request (task) may be 
broken into a number of sub-requests and routed separately to different 
services. Some of these services (if they are composite) may again decompose 
the sub-request into sub-sub-requests and send separately to different services, 
and so on recursively. 
Note that these different services may come from different providers / vendors. 
Hence, there MUST be *platform independent* uniform standard way/language to 
express requests. 

There is an attempt in this direction, 
see M. Papazoglou, M. Aiello, M. Pistore, and J. Yang. 
XSRL: A Request Language for Web Services. Published at 
http://www.webservices.org/index.php/article/articleview/990/1/24/
However, specs of XSRL are not available. 

IMO the concept of request is crucial for web services technology. 
Perhaps this very issue should be addressed by W3C and the "great" IT vendors 
instead of trying to recover dying or already dead technologies.
