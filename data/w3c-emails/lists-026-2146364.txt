I have tried here to collect some recent discussion from the www-ws-arch 
list that is relevant to choreography. I have omitted discussion already 
copied to the public-ws-chor list. I have done some editing to pick out 
interesting bits and exercised some editorial judgement re what is 
interesting. (N.b. I probably missed some stuff that should be 
included). As more than one thread is represented here, I'd suggest that 
if you respond, you identify which topic you're responding to.

I would suggest that a possible agenda item for the F2F would be an 
update on WSA from someone more directly involved than I am.

On the definition of choreography:

Francis McCabe:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-arch/2003May/thread.html
> Since we are currently editing the WSA spec, we need a placeholder for  
> the notions of Choreography and probably orchestration.
> 
> I propose the following:
> 
> Choreography:
> 
> The pattern of interactions, expressed as a pattern of types of  
> messages, between a set of service requestors and providers. A  
> description of a choreography may include a description of the  
> necessary states that give rise to the particular message patterns.
> 
> In contract, Orchestration would be:
> 
> A mechanism for ensuring that a set of service providers and requestors  
> exchange messages in accordance to a choreography.

On MEPS and their relation to choreography:

Arkin
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-arch/2003May/0054.html
> In WS choreography we don't want to describe these MEPs, rather we want 
> to refer to WSDL operations that already describe these MEPs, and we 
> want to let the messaging layer handle the protocol specific MEPs as it 
> sees applicable. So on the one hand we don't want to describe every 
> interaction down to the level of actual messages that have to be 
> sent/received including those that are of no interest to the 
> choreography (like ack/nack, commit/abort, challange/response, etc).

Also on this topic see e.g.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-arch/2003Feb/0285.html.

Interesting comment by Ugo Corda (SeeBeyond) re intermediaries
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-arch/2003May/0009.html
> In fact, my impression is that so far the area of intermediaries has been investigated very little beyond what the SOAP processing model 
says. As far as I know, most of the new specs currently being worked on 
(security, reliability, choreography, transaction, etc.) say very little 
or nothing at all about intermediaries so far.

Mike Champion re "Interoperability and Fragmentation"
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-arch/2003Apr/0115.html

Some discussion of how Choreography might fit into the WSA stack diagram
George Blanck
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-arch/2003Apr/0046.html
> I believe that you are correct in concluding the multiple purposes behind

> WSA stack may not be "runtime" but "definitional" relationships.   There

> Label for Box 2. "Services" (rather than description) Content: WSDL Service
> Descriptions
> Label for Box 3. "Messages"  include two boxes within Box 3a "SOAP
> Extensions" Box 3b: "SOAP"
> label for Box 4. "Transport" Content:  "HTTP, SMTP, JMS..."
> Pillar A: "Security"
> Pillar B: "Management"


Assaf comment re WS-Policy
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-ws-arch/2003Feb/0116.html

Mike Champion, thread on Layering in ebXML and WSA.
includes some high-level discussion of how choreography fits in (and 
what it needs to fit in with).
