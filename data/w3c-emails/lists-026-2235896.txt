This is good. 

Some nitpicking:
- Can we say "global view" instead of "common view". There is a difference, isn't it.
- Aren't role and responsibility the same? Can we instead say  "roles and their interactions are clearly defined ..."
- The auomatable, machine-readable attributes are important.  But we need to identify what exactly needs to be machine readable (the definition of global view?) and what needs to be automatable (the process of deriving each participants obligations from the global view?)

However this definition gives me a feeling that we are getting there.

I think that the concept of Common View is the central concept for our work.

Here is a mission statement encapsulating this concept:


Our Goal is to define a Common View of Long Lived business process
Interactions, where roles and responsibilities are clearly defined in a way
that is automatable for each participant, machine-readable, and
in a manner whereby each participant's involvement can be validated.
