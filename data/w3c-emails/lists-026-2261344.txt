I am not quite sure who authored this snippet .. but in any case: this 
was discussed on this list at some length earlier. I don't want to 
prematurely close the issue if it is indeed still open. I am aware that 
WSA is still groping towards a workable definition of "Web service", and 
at least some definitions encompass services w/o WSDL descriptions.

However, IMHO constraining choreography to involve services having WSDL 
descriptions is not a severe constraint. Choreography is envisioned -- 
however vaguely -- as another level in the WS stack, building on 
existing levels. WSDL exists in that stack as the language for 
service-level metadata. And IMO we likely need such metadata to build a 
workable expression of choreography.
