Hi,

      Thanks for all the feedback! Just a clarification; in this instance,
the word "external" means "any system external to a single Web Service"
i.e. anything outside the application boundary. I was not trying to get
involved with the "external v. internal" debate as we've discussed it in
this group. External just means that we don't deal with the internal
messaging, but any message sent by a Web Service to any system other than
itself. I'd love to have suggestions on a better choice of words.

      I don't necessarily buy the argument that we are only talking about
the interactions between one WSDL-ized object and another. WSDL is just one
way of doing things. Web Services should not be explicitly limited to WSDL
interface, IMHO.

Regards,

D-

Daniel:

We should be careful in using or not using the word "external". To be
this is an arbitrary distinction and the spec could remain neutral with
respect to that attribute.

There seem to be an important concept missing: "Long Running
Interactions"

There also seem to miss some goals such as: being able to enforce
message sequences and detect exceptions, ...

My two centimes (of Euro that is).
