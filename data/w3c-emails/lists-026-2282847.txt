Sorry, I could not understand "remain open to other bindings".
Does it mean that the specs should abstract from service interface.
I do not regard WSDL as a "great" technology, however how to realize
a choreography (composition) of services without reference to their
specific interfaces, i.e. to what the do perform.

Best regards,
