Just one stupid question: Suppose I have exposed my applicaton as a web
service. Of course, I am interested in using it by clients to have some
profits, etc., Do I have to implement choreography interfaces or should
someone else do so?
Suppose that the interfaces were chanaged or new one were published.
Do I have to care about it and implement the new ones?

Best regards,
Stanislaw
