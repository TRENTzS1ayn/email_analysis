Dear Diane and John, Congratulations on the formation of the WS BPEL TC in OASIS. As co-chairs of the W3C Web Services Choreography working group we understand the efforts that will be involved, and wish you the best of luck. We firmly believe that the orchestration/choreography is a big space. Furthermore we believe that there is room for non-overlapping specs in this area, that can lead to a family of complimentary languages. This will benefit the community and more importantly customers. It is our intention to liaise closely with groups in this space in a manner that is constructive and non-intrusive, in order to ensure we can provide maximum benefit to the community and customers. With the formation of your group, the WS BPEL TC, and the focus of your groups work we would very much like to pursue a liaison with you. In addition the two groups will no doubt have common requirements on other groups such as, for example, the need for end-point references in WSDL 1.2. We feel it makes sense to explore theserequirements together and submit them to the appropriate group as one voice, albeit from two groups. To further explore possible liaisons and to ensure that we understand how we can be of mutual benefit we cordially invite you to our next face to face meeting on 18-20 June in Chicago. We would like you to meet the group, of which we share a considerable overlap in membership, and talk about ways in which we can work together for mutual benefit. For the purpose of clarity, we are not requiring you to join the working group to pursue this, merely to attend the face to face meeting as invited guests. Please let us know if you are interested and we can forward on registration and logistics information when they become available. Best regards, Martin Chapman (Oracle) & Steve Ross-Talbot (Enigmatec) Co-chairs W3C Choreography Working Group
