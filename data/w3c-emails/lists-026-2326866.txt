I think it should be possible for someone else to implement the client-side choreography interfaces. It should also be possible to some one else to implement the provider-side interfaces and readily interoperate with the clients. IMO, these possibilities mainly define what interoperability means for our working group.

I have put together a picture to show the high level steps an application provider would take to define and publish the application choreography to its clients. See attached. The step 2 in the picture (binding processes) should allow binding the choreography interfaces to existing applications or developing new applications from scratch, on both provider and client side.

Obviously the ideas in the picture are based upon my understanding of the problem we are trying to solve and I could be wrong. Any criticism/feedback is welcome.

Subject: Implementation of choreography interface 



Just one stupid question: Suppose I have exposed my applicaton as a web
service. Of course, I am interested in using it by clients to have some
profits, etc., Do I have to implement choreography interfaces or should
someone else do so?
Suppose that the interfaces were chanaged or new one were published.
Do I have to care about it and implement the new ones?

Best regards,
Stanislaw
