Dear Colleagues,

Just a small nitpick on the nitpick.

I think that it has been pointed out to me (and so I pass this on) that
role and responsibility are not the same, and may need to be separately
addressed in a choreography as one 'entity' may have responsibility for
a role but 'delegate' that role to some other entity (or the other way
around - the official role owner may delegate responsibility for
execution to another 'entity')

Best Regards     Tony

This is good. 

Some nitpicking:
- Can we say "global view" instead of "common view". There is a
difference, isn't it.
- Aren't role and responsibility the same? Can we instead say  "roles
and their interactions are clearly defined ..."
- The auomatable, machine-readable attributes are important.  But we
need to identify what exactly needs to be machine readable (the
definition of global view?) and what needs to be automatable (the
process of deriving each participants obligations from the global view?)

However this definition gives me a feeling that we are getting there.

I think that the concept of Common View is the central concept for our
work.

Here is a mission statement encapsulating this concept:


Our Goal is to define a Common View of Long Lived business process
Interactions, where roles and responsibilities are clearly defined in a
way that is automatable for each participant, machine-readable, and in a
manner whereby each participant's involvement can be validated.
