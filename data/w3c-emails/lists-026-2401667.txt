Indeed it was sent to the individuals but in their capacity as newly
appointed co-chairs. I suspect this is why they responded in the way
that they did, namely to ceck with the TC members that it is okay for
them to attend. We tried to make the invitation as open as possible
simply because we seek to encourage cooperation in an open manner rather
than have any pre-conceived ideas about how it might work.

We have yet to hear from them because the conference call is not until
the 16th and the f2f (theirs) in late May. So we shall just have to
wait. 

But I am full of hope that common sense will prevail and we shall all
(W3C and Oasis) get the result that is required. It won't be for lack of
openess and for lack trying.

Cheers

Steve T

FWIW, I note that this invitation went to the Chairs, as individuals.
