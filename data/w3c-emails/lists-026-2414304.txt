This looks very promising. If I understood this and the picture correctly, 
it is possible that the implementation of 
client-side and provider-side choreography interfaces 
may serve as a middleware between client and provider. 

Provider registers its application as a service to the 
middleware, actually, to the component that implements 
the provider-side choreography interface. 
In this case the component may serve for other applications 
providing service of the same type. 
This may be of particular interest because of 
failure of a single application. 

Client sends requests (tasks) to the middleware, actually, to 
the component implementing client-side choreography interface. 
It is clear that this component may serve for other clients as well. 

It looks nice at least IMO. However, IMHO there is a problem with 
interoperability if there is no uniform way (language) 
to express service types and clients' requests. 

I could be wrong.
Any criticism is welcome.
