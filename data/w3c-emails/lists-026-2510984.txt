I find myself agreeing with JJ again when he says ...

[JJ] yes, one of the value of the spec could be to offer a binding to
WSDL but remain open to other bindings.

I think this is an important principle if only because, as bindings evolve,
which they surely will to support security, reliability etc, then only our
binding will need to change, the main spec, hopefull, should not need to
change.
