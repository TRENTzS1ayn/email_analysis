My take on this:

In reviewing other specifications in this space including security (the 
WS-Security stack, SAML, etc), coordination (WS-TX and BTP), reliable 
messaging (WS-RM(1) and WS-RM(2)) and even not yet discussed 
specifications such as WS-Policy, WS-Addressing, management specs, etc, 
they all seem to be recommend that we write choreographies using WSDL 
operations.

These specification will either add additional dimensions by referencing 
the same WSDL operation we reference, or by being part of the protocol 
binding used by that WSDL operation (in effect also referencing them) 
when it comes time to actually exchange messages.

So clearly the way to go is to write a choroegraphy definition by 
referencing WSDL operations. Then you get everything else that works 
with WSDL for free, including stuff that's available now and specs we 
anticipate will be standardized in the near future.

Of course this only works with that list of specifications and relates 
specifications that are part of the WS stack. The question then becomes, 
are there other specifications we want to support that work in different 
ways indicating that we need to keep our options open?
