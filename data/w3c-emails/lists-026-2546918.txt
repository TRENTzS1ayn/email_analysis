with due respect, there's some sort of problem in the above from a 
parsing viewpoint - there seems to be something dangling clause-wise, 
other than that, I like it, except I'm a bit puzzled on the 
"validated" part - what does it mean that an involvement can be 
validated -- if I buy a book from WebServ1 does that mean I can check 
to see if the book arrived?
