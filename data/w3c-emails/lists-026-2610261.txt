Jim,

you make a good point and I admit to being deliberately vague about 
what "validated" might mean. I think I would prefer to change that part 
to the following:

... whereby each participants involvement can be validated where 
validated means checked for compatibility and verified for conformance 
to the defined observable behaviour where possible ....

Or something like that. I'm concerned at one level not to promise 
things that are totally academic and not practicable and on the other 
hand set a bar high enough that we have to stretch to get there. It's a 
case of what could we do today vs what could we reasonably be expected 
to do tomorrow and ensuring that success can be measured in either 
dimension.

So in a nutshell I want a mission statement that is achievable at one 
end of the spectrum and visionary (but not out of reach) at the other 
end and so would require a stretch. If we meet the minimum then we can 
tick the initiative as being successfull and if we manage to stretch we 
can look back and say wow!

Cheers

Steve T
