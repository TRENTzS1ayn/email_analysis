Asaf,

A very good point as to which part of wsdl (abstract, concrete).

We need to also consider which version of wsdl. Should we tie ourselves to
the yet to be completed wsdl 1.2 or use 1.1.
The disadvantage of 1.2 is that it is not stable at the present. This could
also be an advantage, as it provides a possibility for this group to input
requirements, and give opinions on proposed directions.

Martin.
