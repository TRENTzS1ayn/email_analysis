I think this is a helpful change - what I was really getting at was 
that we need some way to make it clear we are talking about "online" 
behavior, rather than off.  What I mean is that when I order a part 
from Daniel's company, I would want the choreography to have a 
validatible part where they promise to get me an "acknowledgement" - 
I'm not sure whether in the choreography it should say that that part 
will arrive at my lab three days later, but I would definitely not 
expect the choreography to contain some sort of statement that the 
"choreography inspector" will come to my lab three days later to 
validate the physical arrival of the book...  I suspect no one here 
things of "validate" as referring to these "side effects" of the 
transaction, but I thought the mission/vision statements need to make 
that clear...

absolutely +1 to that goal!
