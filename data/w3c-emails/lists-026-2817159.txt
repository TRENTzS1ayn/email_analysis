DAML-S provides a grounding that works directly in WSDL (as I demoed 
at the kickoff f2f), but which provides an intermediate layer so it 
can ground in other services (we use device services in UPnP as well).

My personal vote would be for us to do something like this - making 
WSDL our primary target, and one for which we develop a direct 
mapping, but allowing the possibility of relocatability of 
choreographies.
