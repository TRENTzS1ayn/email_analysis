Several years ago I used to work for a company that shipped bulk liquids
(chemicals, edible liquids) on large parcel tankers. Attached is a use
case that includes most of the parties involved in shipping a bulk
liquid cargo from point to point (to the best of my recollection). I
thought it might be worthy of consideration since it demonstrates role
players changing during the life of the choreography, and that the
choregraphy itself could span several months in time.

Regards,
Greg
