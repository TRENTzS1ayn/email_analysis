Daniel:

I get a sense from the discussion we had yesterday that we would need to
collect requirements along with priorities (I typically use: must have,
strong desire, nice to have, future release, out of scope). That would
allow us to say things like:

This is just an example...
Requirement 123: Need to provide a binding to WSDL 1.x  -> MH
Requirement 124: Need to provide an extensible binding mechanism such
that choreographies could be bound to other technologies -> SD
Requirement 125: Need to provide a level of abstraction for the document
formats -> MH
...

Jean-Jacques
