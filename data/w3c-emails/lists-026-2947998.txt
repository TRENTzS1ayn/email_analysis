   The crucial point is to start the process from the very roots, i.e., 
   from the really primitive concepts and to specify explicitly 
   the abstraction rules.  

   I did some practical (however, still initial) work towards this direction; 
   see the documentation at http://www.ipipan.waw.pl/mas/enTish 

I'll check it out.

   As to DAML-S, one still missing point (IMO, the crucial one) 
   is the definition of well formed formulae to express precondition 
   and effect of service invocation. 

We do provide a proposal (in an appendix) for how to add these.  The
reason the proposal is tentative is that we wanted to stay within RDF,
and you simply can't do that without stretching the framework at some
point.  Our proposal is to indulge in a little reification, which
means that an ordinary RDF processor will miss the formulas.  (And
that the encoding of the formulas is rather obese.)

   IMO, precondition and effect formula together may (should!) 
   serve for expressing the complete type of a service, i.e., also 
   service interface. 

I agree.
