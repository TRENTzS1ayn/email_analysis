Lets say there are 3 roles A, B, C in a choreography.  A and B need to know 
the detail of every other role but C only need to know about B.

Do we need to define 2 choreographies (one for A/B/C, and the other for 
C/B) and verify their conformance ?
If the answer is "yes", then I agree that this is a question of good design 
practice.  Otherwise ...

Or do we define 1 choreography (for A/B/C) and then apply a filter to 
extract another choreography for C/B ?
If the answer is "yes", then we need to support the "segmentation" concept 
in our choreography model.  Then Jon's concern is very valid.

Rgds, Ricky
