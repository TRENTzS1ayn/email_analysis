 am no choreography specialist but have a simple question:
Is there any relationship of WS-CHOR to meta-modelling languages like 
for instance MOF?

My question is in relation to a scenario where one wants to model the 
web services flow itself. We want to visualize the choreography design. 
For now we stick to generating an SVG ourselves, but it would be great 
when there was a relationship to a meta-modelling language to use.
