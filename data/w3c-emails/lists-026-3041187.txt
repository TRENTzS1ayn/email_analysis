You said ...

>>>Or do we define 1 choreography (for A/B/C) and then apply a filter to
extract another choreography for C/B ?<<<

Although you could do this, I am wondering what the benefit would be?

For example there might be several different ways in which C&B could
exchange messages to realize the same end goal. "A" should not know about
this unless there is a real need - i.e. it affects, in some way, A's
behavior.

If A's behavior is not affected, then it means that any change to the B/C
choreography should result in A being informed since he has the complete
A/B/C choreography.

If on the other hand A does need to know, then you can might want to think
of the A/B/C choreography as an *extension* of the B/C choreography. I
always think that extension is better than subsetting or filtering as it
promotes reuse and is, I think, actually easier to do.

Lets say there are 3 roles A, B, C in a choreography.  A and B need to know 
the detail of every other role but C only need to know about B.

Do we need to define 2 choreographies (one for A/B/C, and the other for 
C/B) and verify their conformance ?
If the answer is "yes", then I agree that this is a question of good design 
practice.  Otherwise ...

Or do we define 1 choreography (for A/B/C) and then apply a filter to 
extract another choreography for C/B ?
If the answer is "yes", then we need to support the "segmentation" concept 
in our choreography model.  Then Jon's concern is very valid.

Rgds, Ricky
