Francis:

It is very clear to me that choreography specifications will be used in
environment that involved hundreds, thousands, ... maybe in a few cases
millions of users. If we create a model by which a "choreography
definition" cannot be used as is and maintained by this type of size of
business communities, we will definitely create a huge mess (e.g. a bid
A&D company has almost 30000 suppliers, Ricky, how many CISCO has?, the
number of car dealers in north America is roughly 22000).

If we spend a $1000 per node to update a choreography definition, we
spend $1 million per thousand node. How fast can you spend $1000 in an
IT shop?

IMHO, it is not whether or not we need some abstraction, but it is
rather how much of abstraction do we need to keep these kind of cost
(deployment/maintenance) at a reasonable level. It is one thing to
orchestrate a few services and compose them into a higher level service
that could be used by a lot of people, it is a very different thing to
establish loosely coupled large trading peer-to-peer (e.g. trading)
communities doing all kinds of activities (not just one activity like
swapping files).
