"It is very clear to me that choreography specifications will be used in
environment that involved hundreds, thousands, ... maybe in a few cases
millions of users. If we create a model by which a "choreography
definition" cannot be used as is and maintained by this type of size of
business communities, we will definitely create a huge mess (e.g. a bid
A&D company has almost 30000 suppliers, Ricky, how many CISCO has?, the
number of car dealers in north America is roughly 22000)."

Is it a similar problem to the one posed in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-ws-chor/2003May/0077.html

i.e., Is it necessary for the service provider (client) to implement the
interface of a choreography it participates?
