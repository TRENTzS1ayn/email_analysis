One consequence of a global view of a choreography
is that the states on the global view are shared states.
Shared states require synchronization or agreement,
which requires transactions, a la BTP or WS-Tx or BPSS 
or UNCEFACT BCP or RosettaNet PIPs.

I'm not raising this as an objection to a global view.
I think it's a fact anyway, when a process crosses
trust domains.
