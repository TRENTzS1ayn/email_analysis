I like Steve's proposed mission statement but I would like to suggest some
wordsmithing:

"The mission of the W3C Web Services Choreography working group is to define
a language complementary to WSDL 1.2
   * that enables the description of the global view of a business process's
message choreography
   * such that it is possible to automatically validate a participant's
compliance with the message choreography required of their roles and
responsibilities in the business process via automated observation of their
messaging behavior."

In editing the mission statement I am only aware of having made three
substantive changes from the original:

I specified WSDL 1.2 rather than just WSDL
I tried to clarify what the terms automate and validate meant
I removed the reference to long/short live processes

The term 'compose' in the focus statement is causing me some discomfort. In
the BPEL sense 'composing a web service' means creating a new web service by
gluing together existing web services. The new web service will have its own
WSDL and so far as anyone interacting with it need be concerned it's a web
service like any other. I don't believe that use case should be in scope for
WS-Chor. While I could readily imagine WS-Chor providing a definition of the
message choreography used to enable the composed web service this is a far
cry from defining the actual logic needed to make the composed webservice
operate. That is a job for a programming language like BPEL. I would be
comfortable seeing the focus section removed entirely.


Just my 2 euros,

Yaron
