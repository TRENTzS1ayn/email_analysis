+1 on tying to WSDL and +1 on Asaf's point that there is a cost to
abstraction. The only way to 'abstract' away dependency on something is to
completely re-invent the thing being depended on and then define how your
re-invention maps to the original. This is an extremely expensive process
that causes significant harm to interoperability and should only be
undertaken when there is no other choice. The 'abstractions' introduced
between WSDL and SOAP have caused so much interoperability pain that two
different organizations had to be formed to sort out the resulting mess.
What we need is a little less abstraction and a lot more interoperability.
