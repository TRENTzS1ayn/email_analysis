I agree with the separation of the choreography from its binding, however
there are two ways to do it:
1. Reference the transport, message formats, security, etc from within the
the CDL, which I think Yaron is suggesting, ... OR ...
2. Define a separate "Choreography Binding" that references the
"Choreography Definition" as well as referencing the transport, message
formats, security, etc

I prefer the second as it allows multiple Choreography Bindings for a single
Choreography Definition. Doing it the first way will *prohibit* reuse of the
choreography.
