Last week I was asked to provide an 'independent' opinion of the
abstraction/template solutions:

Abstraction - A abstraction layer hides the binding details to capture
commonality between different binding types. Of course some sort of
abstraction layer is required given the diversity of binding types.
Delegating it to the web service description removes complexity from
ws-chor  (i.e. WSDL is the binding abstraction).

Template - A template is an incomplete document with a predefined
format, details of which are filled in to create an instance. Templates
facilitate reuse. It seems that with 'Language Extensibility', WSDL
1.2 already seems  to provide support for binding templates for other
binding types. 

It seems to me that both are necessary.
