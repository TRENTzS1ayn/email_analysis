What about the alternative of binding the BPSS to WSDL, like:

<wsdl:binding ...>
  <wsdl:operation ...>
    <bpss:transaction name="..." role="..." .../>
  </wsdl:operation>
</wsdl:binding>

You already have the binding framework which is used with a variety of 
protocols including SOAP, HTTP, IIOP, etc, with a variety of componet 
access (see WSIF), and so forth. So instead of reinventing all these 
bindings in WS Choreo, how about we just add another binding to WSDL to 
address BPSS transactions?
