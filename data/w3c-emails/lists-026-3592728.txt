Actually that's not strictly true. WS-Tx doesn't mention how contexts are
propagated at all at the application level (which is a bad thing for
interoperability and I'm certain will be changed in a new revision). So, you
an implementation is allowed to propagate a context back on replies in the
same way traditional TP systems do (e.g., the OTS).

Mark.
