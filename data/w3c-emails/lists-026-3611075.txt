Dear Colleagues,
 
For me this almost a non-issue, but not quite.  If we could document the
language elements for the WS-Chor language such that there was a
separate 'chapter' for the use of WSDL and you can 'see the join' then I
think that would satisfy those who are asking for alternatives to WSDL
not to be excluded.  If the use of WSDL is sprinkled all around the
specification so that it can not readily be disentangled then we will
have gone the WSDL only route.
 
Best Regards     Tony
