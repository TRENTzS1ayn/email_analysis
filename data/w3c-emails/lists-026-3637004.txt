That assumes the participant side implementation treats atomic
transactions by delegating all resource operations to transaction-aware
RMs. That's certainly possible, but doesn't seem to be essential.

It's a major bug in the current WS-T that it exposes, in the inter-party
protocol, how the participant handles its resources and delivers on its
"promise" to obey a subsequent cancel. That seems inappropriate to this
world of "loosely coupled" systems. Obviously, in some cases, the
contract between the systems may cover the degree of exposure of the
intermediate results, and in what circumstances faults might occur (WS-T
BA cannot communicate a failure of committed, closed transaction because
it is locked to a perform, compensate approach). But that's detail on
the fundamental, common to any coordination pattern, that all the
players have to make their final state dependent on a single decision
(strictly, all but one, since the decider can be a resource-holder).
