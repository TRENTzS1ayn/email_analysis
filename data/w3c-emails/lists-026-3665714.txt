That latter looks remarkably like the Participant framework we have (in
java) in Choreology Cohesions - proof perhaps that BPEL is just a
programming language :-). Some piece of behaviour in reaction to an
application message is defined (do there need to be immediate forward
operations in the <receive> element ?), and the reactions to the
potential future stimuli are also defined and associated with it.
