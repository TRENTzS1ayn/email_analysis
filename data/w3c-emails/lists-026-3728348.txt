ok - if the point was the separate coordinator. But the "separate
coordinator" may be just a separate object in the same process. That's
quite orthogonal to the message exchange between the client-side as a
whole and the service-side as a whole, which you also showed as
different.

Sorry - you identified the first explicitly as two-phase, and I thought
that was part of the distinction.

Not exclusively BTP, but every coordination case we've come across seems
to end up with the contingent, then yes/no phases. Using that as the
defining characteristic of two-phaes, are there really others ? Or is it
a question of terminology, that a more restrictive (and no doubt useful)
definition of two-phase would give a different classification.
