of course.

The discussion as a whole (not particularly your contribution) seemed to
be based on the assumptions of WS-T, and its particular patterns. That
was getting into the discussion about how to handle coordination issues
in the choreography (or rather in the process language).

Obviously a partisan slanging match is not useful, but there is a
general issue. The availability of a general registration protocol could
lead to "splitter" philosophy, where every minor difference in
implementation pattern used a different coordination protocol.  That's
not to say that there aren't really different coordination patterns.
They never seem to come out into the world though.

Not sure if we're still on topic for this list.
