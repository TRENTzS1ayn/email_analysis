Although this is not written in the spec my assumption is that you do 
always propagate the context back in replies. But all you propagate in 
the context is the context identifir and the registration service.

In order to send back any other information about the participant (i.e. 
it's state) you need to use a separate header, which based solely on 
WSDL you can. But I'm afraid that unless an example is given in the spec 
on how to do it, most systems will simply not do it, which would create 
an interoperability problem. This can be fixed simply by adding another 
paragraph and one short example where the reply contains some state 
headed, like completed or failed.
