+1. I totally agree.
 
However note that WSDL 1.2 has one spec for WSDL and separate specs for the
bindings to SOAP 1.2, MIME etc. Could (should) we do the same?

Dear Colleagues,
 
For me this almost a non-issue, but not quite.  If we could document the
language elements for the WS-Chor language such that there was a separate
'chapter' for the use of WSDL and you can 'see the join' then I think that
would satisfy those who are asking for alternatives to WSDL not to be
excluded.  If the use of WSDL is sprinkled all around the specification so
that it can not readily be disentangled then we will have gone the WSDL only
route.
 
Best Regards     Tony
