Yowza!! I just received my own email back in my inbox and it's full of
embedded images and formatted terribly! My apologies to everyone for
sending n+1 useless images. The only two images of interest in the message
are the two attached files "ohare_airport_to_hotel.gif" and
"hotel_to_meeting_place.gif". The others are spurious artifacts of my mail
client.

I will repost this tomorrow, sans garbage.


Regards,
