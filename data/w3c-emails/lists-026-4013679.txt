A BA "complete/completed" exchange concerns a provisional state because
there is still the possibility of the compensate, until either
compensate or close is sent. (There is nothing that says the undo is
only triggered in case of error - like BTP cohesions, the client side
can just choose to cancel some participants.)

A consequence is that the service shouldn't count the "completed" things
as final until the close has removed the possibility of a reversal. (Of
course, in practice, that depends on what these things are, how many
statistically get reversed, how difficult it is to apply the
compensation, how urgent to get started on any consequential
processing).
