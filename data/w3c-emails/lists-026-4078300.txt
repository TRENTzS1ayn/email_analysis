The way I read some of the e-mails in this discussion they seemed to 
assume that the cDl may do other things by being even more abstract. 
That's why I asked for the clarification.

The term prose is also confusing. Let's say I have a choreography which 
defines that I send you some message X, get some business activity to 
occur at your end, and receive a response Y (let's say it's a single 
operation). That definition is not executable in the sense that it's 
insufficient to get the activity to occur on your side. Without the 
business logic nothing will happen. I prefer to think of it as simply 
being "not an implementation". You will still need an implementation of 
that operation on your side, which is the subject of other 
specifications (BPEL, Java, etc).

On the other hand, if I want the activity to be executed all I need to 
do is perform that operation by sending you message X. So as far as I am 
concerned the operation definition is "executable". If I know your 
end-point I can get it to execute. But this is a different part of 
execution than an implementation, I still need an implementation on my 
side to invoke it and one on your side to perform it. The term prose 
implies that even this kind of execution is not possible.

(And I know the term execution is controversial, for some people 
execution=implementation and for others implementation is an expansion 
of execution)

In that case, what is the issue with languages like WSCI and BPEL?

I know you can define implementations using BPEL which is out of scope, 
but can't you just use abstracts in this case to get a definition of the 
message choreography? What is missing? Similarly with WSCI. Perhaps it 
treads into the possible use as an implementation language (the cPl), 
but can't we just ignore these capabilities for now and simply exclude 
them from any resulting specification? So far the only thing I 
understood needs to be changed is removing XPaths.
