This is why this discussion is actually interesting to this group. The 
state we are talking about is completed/exited/failed and relates to the 
coordination protocol. From the perspective of the choreography it is 
considered out-of-band. It does not indicate that an order has been 
fulfilled, or that the order has been rejected, but rather tells the 
coordinator how to proceed.

Of course it can be abused. For example, I can decide to send a WS-TX 
failed message instead of communicating an error. This tells the 
coordinator interesting information but doesn't explain anything to the 
business process (what is the nature of the error? can I do something 
about it and do some other operation?) I can decide to send a WS-TX 
completed message instead of communicating that I will fulfill the 
order. This also is of no use to the business process which can't really 
determine what has been completed, doesn't have a clue if/when products 
will be delivered, or even how to track fulfillment.

So one of our responsibilities would be to write clear guidelines 
specifying what the choreography should define as explicit messages, 
regardless of which coordination protocol it ends up using, if at all. 
At the same time we should allow it to use a coordination protocol which 
gives the non-business part of the infrastructure some way to determine 
what is going on.
