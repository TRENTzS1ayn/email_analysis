We are trying to do advanced planning for a F2F in September.
Because of the membership overlap with the OASIS BPEL TC, we would like to
try and
co-locate with their meetings. This is not a joint meeting, and is being
proposed
purely to ease travel logistics and members' costs.

The OASIS TC is proposing to meet 17 (afternoon), 18, and 19 September,
either in
Seattle or Germany. Thus it makes sense to try and meet on 15, 16, and 17
(Morning) September.
Can people check their diaries for these dates and inform the chairs asap.

SAP have offered to host the meeting in Germany (thanks Kevin), but should
the BPEL TC decide to meet in Seattle, we would need to find a host.
Offers gratefully accepted.

Cheers,
   Martin.
