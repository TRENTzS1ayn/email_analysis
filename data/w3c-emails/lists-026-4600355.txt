David,

You are citing a lot of good cases for when saying anything about the 
decision is useless. Factoring that capability into the language for 
these usescases is, to put it mildy, pointless.

But what about other use cases?

In the case which I cited you can tell up front that the message is 
rejected. I do not care if my message is sent, is accepted and an order 
delivered internationally even though the supplier said it would not do 
so. But I expect that in most cases if the supplier said it would be 
rejected it would, and being able to avoid such suppliers up-front seems 
beneficial.

I definitely cannot force my bank to do anything, but my bank advertises 
a lot of its rules up-front. When I open an account or sign for a 
service I get a booklet explaining a lot of rules. You can't withdraw 
unless withdrawAmount<=balance is one of them. You will be charged $X 
for returned check another one. Are we saying that the choreography 
language should not in anyway reference such rules, even though they are 
known and well defined?
