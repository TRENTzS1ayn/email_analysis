Let's call it a policy then. I really don't care what the supplier 
software does at run-time or how it evaluates the policy. The actual 
ruleset will account for more details and would probably contain the 
policy but include additional rules. Not interesting to me.

But the policy is. So if I can agree on the policy, can I at least 
determine where the policy takes effect? Obviously just knowing the 
policy is not very interesting, afterall the policy does not apply to 
invoicing or account withdrawals. It applies to a specific set of 
choreographies and even there in specific places.

<DB>I think it more likely that the policies will most often apply to
services rather than choreographies. For example the "no international
orders" policy could apply to *all* orders. The actual choreography used to
place the order is irrelevant.</DB>

If I know what the possible outcome is, which I should know in any case, 
then I'm down to option #2 - send an order and discover what happens, 
which you say is not a good idea. If I know the policy that applies then 
I can determine that one outcome is eventual before sending the message. 
So is there a benefit to knowing the policy or not?
<DB>Yes there is. But it is only really relevant to your internal business
process (or orchestration) rather than to the choreography because
ultimately only the sender of the order and nobody but the sender of the
order can decide whether or not to send the order - it's a private
process.</DB>
