That's precisely my point. I want to find specific services based on the 
policy. For example, if the policy says "no international order" and 
some service says "I use this policy" and "My country != US", then I 
would not bother using that service.

Let's say that I find a service. I find a policy. There is no 
association between the policy and the choreography. Finding the policy 
is as useful as knowing that the service definition was created on a 
Sunday afternoon.

But if there is some way for me to determine that the service would 
apply the policy as part of the chorography, then MY implementation can 
do a lot of interesting things, like favoring or avoiding that 
particular service. Of course it's only relevant to my internal 
implementation, and if my internal implementation never evaluates the 
policy it would still be acting based on the choreography. Which is 
something I don't belive we've refuted so far.

But if the policy cannot reference the choreography then it becomes a 
useless policy. In case of doubt, I am not saying that the choreography 
should reference the policy, but that the policy should reference the 
choreography.
