To answer your questiuon, here's my $0.02c on what I think our objectives
should be:
1. Choreographies are NOT directly executable - you can't load a
choreography into some software and run it
2. Choreographies CAN be used to automatically validate that a process is
following a choreography.
3. Choreographies are NOT bound to any specific data or message content
4. An executlable process definition can be created from a choreography by:
  a) Extracting from a choreography definition, the interactions, states,
etc, associated with SINGLE role, then 
  b) Expanding that data into an executablke process by including the
"private" processing and decision logic required.

I agree Assaf's use case doesn't really lead to a *requirement* that 
(some) decision points be expressed via executable expressions.

The question may come down to, is this facility the preferred way to 
solve a certain class of problems?

Some of the past arguments against executability include:

1. It makes the public side of the choroegraphy more complex to parse 
and understand.

2. (Related to 1). It makes automated tools that run against the public 
choroegraphy more difficult (impossible?) to implement.

3. It doesn't provide a good separation between interface and 
implementation. (But maybe this is good, if you think the separation is 
arbitrary anyway).

N.b. I'm not actually putting forward these objections .. I'm just 
re-stating them.

One of the problems I'm having evaluating the various proposals for 
solving this problem is that relatively few people are actually doing 
this kind of automated interaction at present. It is easy to find use 
cases that involve complex interaction of business partners. It is a 
little harder IMO to turn those into plausible scenarios involving 
automation of the interaction.
