Why human and not machine-processable? Let's assume we have the 
technology to evaluate some of these policies automatically. Why not use it?
<DB2>Having the technology is easy. The hard part is the standardization and
implemenation required before the technology can work. For example, for this
simple problem to work you need generally agreed definitions how "I do not
accept international orders" is described as well as have a registry
containing this information that is trusted - UDDI completely fails on the
trust issue.</DB2>

We are mixing two things here.

The choreography should be concerned with the what which affects the 
message flow and I don't believe any of the examples I gave so far seems 
to contradict this rule.

The decision criteria should be separate from the choreography so it 
could apply to specific services and not others. And I don't believe any 
of the examples I gave contradict this rule either.

The decision criteria should be related to the choreography otherwise I 
have no clue where to apply it. The question then becomes how useful it 
is and how much we have to work to implement it. If it's not very useful 
and we have to do a lot of work to implement it, let's forget about it. 
But if it has some use and the requirements it places on the 
choreography incur no toll on the choreography per se, what's the problem?
<DB2>I think we are agreeing on this.</DB2>
