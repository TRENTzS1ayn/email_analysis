It's an "order of" problem. Whether you're trying to standardize one 
message, a sequence of messages always used together, or a sequence of 
message + generic policies, the proble you are talking about if I 
understand correctly is related to the number of interested parties 
involved and not so much to how many elements you have in the resulting 
definition.

I interpret what you are saying as evidence that WS doesn't work, let's 
all just wrap up and go home.

Those are my use cases. My uses cases may have a lot of problems 
agreeing on things. They spend a lot of money agreeing on things. Now, 
they can spend a lot of money agreeing on X, or they can spend the same 
amount of money agreeing on X+Y. I want to give them Y, because that way 
they get more bang for their money. So if they can agree on a 
combination of messages, sequences, rules, policies, etc in one sitting, 
all the power to them. And if they can't, well - nothing in the 
specification says they have to do more than what they consider the bare 
minimum.

I am not trying to solve world hunger, but I recognize that a lot of 
people have the luxury of take-away food and in a way I'm offering them 
convenience of a value meal.
