I understand what you say, I don't understand how it relates to what I 
have said.

Here's a case in point. On-line banking. All messages digitially signed, 
sent over RM, for all message formats ever used. Mandated by banks, 
FDIC, the Global Domination ATM Network, or whoever. Doesn't matter. 
There is no complexity in reach agreement it's a done deal.

The bank also have policies that apply to specific accounts which may be 
FDIC, bank-specific, IRS, BBB whatever. I don't care how expensive it is 
to define these rules because the rules would be defined regardless of 
which technology we use. In fact, they are already defined. And I don't 
care how expensive it is to reach agreement with a million customers 
because the bank simply publishes it's rules - take it or leave it - and 
does not try to reach agreement. And I don't care if UDDI is trusted or 
not, because the bank already has mechanisms to make it available 
securely from a trusted source.

But, I know that some rules are different from bank to bank (e.g. the 
cost of a returned check) and some rules are different from account to 
account within the same bank (e.g. the cost of an overdraft withdrawl). 
And given that the rules are already there, I can select which account 
to use when/where, if I only know which rules apply to which operation I 
am about to perform.

So yes, there is complexity in the world and we haven't solved it. And 
it applies in a lot of cases that like it or not will not be able to use 
the capbilities we are discussing right now because they already have 
too many problems reaching agreement. And any solution to that problem 
is outside of this working group.

But there are too many use cases where it's simply not-a-problem. It's 
not a problem to reach agreement, and it's not a problem to have an 
unreadable 32-page booklet listing all these rules and policies. So now 
the question is - since as you said the technology is already there - 
can we capitalize on that? If my bank already has a 32-page booklet with 
rules and regulations, can I just expose some of them as part of it's 
Web service definition?
