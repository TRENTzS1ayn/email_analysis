Dear member/interested party,

we are reviewing and editing our requirements document which was 
published on the W3C website last August. The enclosed spreadsheet (pdf 
and excel) summarises the results from the last face to face meeting of 
the working group when reviewing the requirements document. Many of the 
action items require further clarification. If you submitted a use case 
or indeed a requirement that is in the enclosed list and clarification 
is required please can you take the time to clarify so that we may add 
the clarification to the requirements document as soon as possible.

If you need to ask the editors for further guidance on this matter we 
are meeting this week on the 4th and 5th November to embark on the 
editing process and re-issue a new revised version of the requirements 
document in accordance with the directions in the list.

Many thanks for your time and effort and we look forward to hearing 
from you as soon as possible.

Best regards

Steve Ross-Talbot
