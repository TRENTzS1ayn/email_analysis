>> Steve Ross-Talbot: Dear member/interested party,
>> we are reviewing and editing our requirements document which was 
>> published on the W3C website last August. The enclosed spreadsheet 
>> (pdf and excel) summarises the results from the last face to face 
>> meeting of the working group when reviewing the requirements 
>> document. Many of the action items require further clarification. If 
>> you submitted a use case or indeed a requirement that is in the 
>> enclosed list and clarification is required please can you take the 
>> time to clarify so that we may add the clarification to the 
>> requirements document as soon as possible.

>> SRT: If you need to ask the editors for further guidance on this 
>> matter we are meeting this week on the 4th and 5th November to embark 
>> on the editing process and re-issue a new revised version of the 
>> requirements document in accordance with the directions in the list.

>> Many thanks for your time and effort and we look forward to hearing 
>> from you as soon as possible.

mm2: Steve, as requested, here are comments on requirements sent 
particularly those that may related to my two use cases. I would suggest 
if we do delete requirements that we document what other requirement 
handles them (or if they are deleted because they are either not 
accepted, determined to be out of scope, or other reason).

Thanks.
