All:

We had a pretty productive two days in sunny (but very cold) Brighton. 
We did two main things:

1. We went through the 11 use cases and consolidated them into two 
usecases.
2. We went through all of the requirements and the editors directions 
from the last F2F and re-did the editors spreadsheet
including clarifying and wordsmithing as best we could.

Firstly thanks to my colleagues Abbie, Martin, Ed and Daniel as well as 
Tony who all contributed to the use cases below as well
as the spreadsheet (which Daniel will send out in due course).

We hope to get the usecases and requirements as well as , mission 
statement, CSF and preamble (to include uses of a CDL) before then
end of this week. In order to get our proverbial skates on and get this 
out we wanted to run the use cases (and requirements from Daniel)
past the group at the next conf call. We have the rationale with us and 
would be happy to talk through it on the call. We believe that we have
represented all of the requirements and CSF that can be derived from 
the original 11 use cases into the two that are enclosed.

Enjoy the fruit of our labours. We look forward to your constructive 
direction and comments and would like to get these agreed at the next 
conf call.

Cheers

Steve T
