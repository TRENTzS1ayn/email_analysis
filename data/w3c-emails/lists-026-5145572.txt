mm1: OK.  Doesn't a CSF in map to a use case and subsequent requirements 
(even if optional)?  See http://www.w3.org/TR/wsa-reqs, Section 2.

mm1: OK that is fine. Just checking on receipt.

mm1: Careful balance between what is addressed and what is open for 
address.  I specifically provided comment in response to questions about 
member participation. Would we not discuss the use cases thoroughly 
within the group where several of these questions or requirements 
clarification/expansion/change would occur. Did you wish the questions 
or suggestions to come into the meeting and not via the list? :-D
