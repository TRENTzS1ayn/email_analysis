Choreography pioneers,

Following a short conversation with Steve R-T, he agreed for me to send you this paper.
It is intended as a draft for discussion. 

The paper is new information. It shows how, based on BPML, it is possible to model all
of the advanced workflow patterns identified by workflow theorists, whereas most workflow
engines only support approx 50% of patterns directly and very few of the advanced patterns. 
In addition, it gives insights into the BPML implementation inherent to a BPMS, and how a 
BPMS is able to support many process models not supported by workflow technology. 
Screenshots from Intalio|n3 BPMS are given as examples. Further, the workflow engine itself can 
be modelled in BPML, as reusable processes for use in end-to-end processes. The paper was 
written to more fully explain the work of BPMI.org and its direction in creating BPMS foundation 
technologies. 

Peter Fingar and I have taken great care with this paper, and do hope it adds to the 
understanding of BPML/BPMI/BPMS direction. While the paper cannot present proof of 
these claims, you can consider it a report on the work so far.
