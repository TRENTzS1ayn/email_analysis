Tony,

Compensation: A transaction may declare a set of compensating 
Activities that are to be executed when a successfully completed 
transaction needs to be undone. Compensation describes only the 
externally observable Activities required to undo the transaction; it 
does not describe how the transaction is undone by the implementation. 
It also may specify a strategy for a failed invoked web service.

Tony F, if you were using your words how would you describe this? Why 
would it be different (if indeed it is).

Cheers

Steve T
