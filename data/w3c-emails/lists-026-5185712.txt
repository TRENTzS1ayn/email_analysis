As an aside from all of the stuff going on in requirements I would be 
interested on peoples take on what Frank postulated as a distinction 
between the O word and the C word. As a guiding principle in how we may 
view a CDL is this helpful?

Suppose we changed it slightly to read:

A written choreography description documents how a set of Web Services 
should be "used".

This minor change could then incorporate design-time use as well as 
run-time use (for conformance and compliance to a choreography).

On the other hand WS-BPEL executable processes falls into the latter 
(the O-word) and abstract processes  are a modified lesser form of 
contract such as:

A written business protocol (i.e. abstract WS-BPEL) description 
describes how a single Web Service should be "used".

Just a thought ....

Cheers
