Not putting it in technical terms, it seems to me that:

Choreography can be considered to be what happens when things are orchestrated. 
A choregraphy interface is whatever is needed to allow orchestration to occur, and cause choregraphy to be observed.
The conductor of an orchestra is clearly managing the production of music between the participants. 
The choreography is what happens as a result ... the music. But for this to happen, players need some form of
interface to those around them, and to the conductor. 

I apologise if I've not been following the subtlty of the technical debate around this [I promise I will catch up].
