mm1: I would be inclined to agree with Ugo. On Steve's point (and thanks 
Steve for the impetus), I would add that the choreography definition 
describes how a set of web services conforms to the definition when the 
services are used.

>Ross-Talbot: As an aside from all of the stuff going on in requirements I would be interested on peoples take on what Frank postulated as a distinction between the O word and the C word. As a guiding principle in how we may view a CDL is this helpful?
