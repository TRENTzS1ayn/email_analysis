I see the usecases 1&2 captured most of the core requirements that we discussed
in the last F2F.
Comments:
(1) Shall we change the title for usecase1 to "Travel Agent" rather than 
"Quote Request"?
(2) In usecase1, puzzled by the word "Reference passing". I don't remember 
discussing
this term in the requirements/usecases. What do we mean by "Reference 
passing"?(vs Message Exchange)
(3) Usecase2 requirements section needs more editing (Section 1.1.1.2)
(point 2)variable timeout is applicable to usecase1 rather than usecase2.
(point 3) quotes send back to "buyer or supplier" rather than "travel agent"
(4) One core requirement that is missing in the usecases is security or 
privacy issue (Yaron's usecase
referred that one as  "Segmentation"). In last F2F we categorized that one 
as "information hiding"
in the interfaces section.
