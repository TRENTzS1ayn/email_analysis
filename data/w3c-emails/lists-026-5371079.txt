Howard,

You have a fundamental problem with the choice of Pi Calculus: there is 
no concept of locality or partial state. In choreography and web 
services in general, you can guarantee that participants (processes) 
are physically distributed and need to make choices based on a partial 
view of state.  To successfully model, program and reason about these 
processes, you need to be able to identify and reason about partial 
states.

Consider your deferred choice semantics.  If the processes identified 
as choices are physically distributed, you *cannot* make a choice 
without synchronisation of processes because distinct choices can be 
made in a truly concurrent fashion.  Pi Calculus has no way of 
identifying this issue, let alone reasoning about it.  Explicit 
synchronisation processes, while solving the problem for a given 
process, require that the programmer reason about distribution and 
locality outside the bounds of the Pi Calculus semantics.  I would 
therefore argue that a worflow and in particular a choreography is not 
a Pi Process.

Ciao,

AndyB
