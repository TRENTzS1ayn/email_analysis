Dear all,

These two communities may find the "Scientific workflow services"
workshop interesting. It is going to take place in Edinburgh (3-5 Dec)
and it is open to everyone (no registration fee). More information can
be found at http://www.nesc.ac.uk/esi/events/303/index.html.

If you would like to attend, you will have to register in advance (an
online application is available at the above page).

We are currently working on rearranging the published agenda in order to
accommodate few more talks.

Best regards,
