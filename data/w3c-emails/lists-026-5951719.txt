Dear Nick, Goran and others,

Reading through your Choreography language proposal, I realised that you
had used roles with different behaviours.  I was wondering if there was
a a reason for this as it did not seem quite what I have been lead to
believe is the usual terminology.

What I am suggesting is that you rename roleType to partnerType (or
whatever we decide to call it) and then behaviorType can be renamed to
roleType.  (You may have to look at where else the term role is used and
see if that is consistent with this renaming or whether it needs to be
changed to partner.)

Advantage: removes an American spelling!

More seriously it allows us to talk about the roles that partners can
play and directly align with the tag names used in the CDL.

 

Best Regards,

Tony
