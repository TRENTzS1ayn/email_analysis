Tony,
 
The WSDL security policies I was referring to are also at the declarative level (in the WSDL abstract interface). It's only when a specific binding is defined that those abstract declarations are mapped to specific information (e.g. SOAP headers) on the wire.

Dear Ugo,
 
The idea is not to replicate.  I was hoping I had made that clear at the beginning by saying that I saw the CDL as being declarative - saying that things should happen here or there, but not how they happen.  I was suggesting that one could say that company policy xyz applies at this point or you could state that this particular message must be made confidential when sent (for instance).  For this to actually happen when the message was sent of course the WSDL would have to support that form of security and something 'under' WSDL (the SOAP engines??) would have to apply - by encrypting in this case possibly.
 
I hope the intent is clear now.
 

Best Regards,

Tony

Hi Tony,
 
Assuming that our final CDL will be based on WSDL (which might be an incorrect assumption, given the fact that we currently have no stable spec), it's very likely that WSDL 2.0 will contain policy assertions including security-related ones.
 
Would it still make sense, under that scenario, to replicate those security policies at the CDL level?
 
Ugo

Dear Colleagues,
 
On the teleconference last night I kind of agreed to kick the ball into play on drafting some security requirements.  So here goes.
 
It seems to me that the CDL can be declarative with regard to security.  In other words it should support notation for flagging that certain security requirements have to be met at this point but can then rely on the 'stack' below the Choreography language layer to 'make it so'.
 
It should be possible to flag that a certain policy applies from this point in the choreography until the choreography ends or another flag is encountered.
 
Should be able to refer out to standard policy sets or state specific requirements explicitly.  These should include ability to require:
 
authentication of the partner and or the message content source
 
that a secure audit log is made
 
that a message is protected from change (integrity)
 
that the contents of a message are hidden (confidentiality)
 
that the sending of a message is non-repudiable
 
that the receipt of a message is non-repudiable
 
that the message or message exchange is protected against replay
 
that the time of sending of a message is recorded
 

that the time of receiving of a message is recorded
 
that a time (/date) stamp is attached to a message when sent.
 
I am sure I have missed various things, but I hope that will encourage others to add / correct / rephrase.
 

Best Regards,

Tony
