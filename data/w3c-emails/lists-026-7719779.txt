Monica,

I wanted to run this past you to see if the rewrite (clarification of 
contract) was acceptable? If not what do I need to do to make it so.

The Transaction thing I am still mulling over and hope to do something 
later today with a view to sending it this evening (mytime).

Cheers

Steve T
