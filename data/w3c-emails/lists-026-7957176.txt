I understand your concerns about scope creep. However I suggest that if we
review scope changes carefully then we should be OK. Specifically I think we
should only extend scope if all the following are true:
1. The extended scope must be capable of being very clearly defined
2. The benefit of extending the scope must be significant
3. The work required to handle the extended scope must be reasonable.

I think that the "level 0" type of abstract definition meets all of these.

David

mm1: First is a semantic definition within the scope of WS-Choreography, 
particularly those described by David in Level 0? These seem to fall 
into the business category.  If we continue to expand the scope where 
does our boundary stop?
