Just to let you know that Nick Kavantzas, Yaron and I are planning to meet
on October 15-16th in the Bay Area at BEA's - details to follow.
 
In outline the objective of the meeting is to take the specifications
developed by Oracle and Commerce One and start the process of working out
how best to use them together with the WS Chor "Requirements" spec and other
known issues to create a draft WS Chor "Language" spec the whole group can
consider.
