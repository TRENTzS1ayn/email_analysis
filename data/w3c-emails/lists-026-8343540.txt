Monica asked ... "Is this meeting open to interested members of the working
group?"

Not really. I sent the message primarily as a courtesy so that the group
knows what is going on. We thought it would be better to tell everyone
rather than the three of us meeting privately, producing a spec and only
then telling the group about it! This way we can update the group on our
progress in the weekly conference calls.

So really this meeting is being held outside of the W3C rules where we want
to make **very** rapid progress in developing the ideas for the "language"
spec so that, as far as at least the three of us are concerned, we can come
to a consensus.

Note, however, that any spec that we come up with is only a draft and will
be subject to usual close scrutiny of the WG. It's just that writing, at
least the initial draft, of a spec by committee just doesn't work.

Regards

David
