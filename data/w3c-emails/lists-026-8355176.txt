mm1: Respectfully, I understand the need to make progress, although I 
also would input that there are other interested, experienced parties who:

    * Did not create or were not given the opportunity to participate in
      the creation of BurdettML or WS-CDL
    * Wish to be a part of this process
    * Wish to make this an inclusive rather than exclusive process

I think these mutual goals can be reasonably accommodated.

Thanks.
