Check out
   http://irchelp.org/irchelp/mac/
the mac OS X page on the IRC help site -- pointers to a several cheap 
shareware ircs.  Mozilla also includes chatzilla, a good bare bones 
irc with a few nice features (create irc channels as bookmarks for 
your browser) and many people who use X11 for their Macs use Xchat 
aqua, esp. to get through firewalls (has good proxying).  There's 
also the open source beta of mchat 
http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/email_chat/mchat.html
I haven't used it myself, but have heard it recommended as a simple 
way to get started  (also several others on the macosx download site)
  so no excuse not to get irc'ed...
