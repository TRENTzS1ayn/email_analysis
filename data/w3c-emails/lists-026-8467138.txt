I'm a hard pressed CIO of an Investment Bank.

I'm investing in Web Services as I attempt to bring my IT resources 
under some semblance of control.

What might keep me awake at night is:

1. Will the trading reports get done in time and get sent to the right 
clients at the right time? Will the IT resources continue to meet the 
SLA's of those clients.

2.  Will the regulatory reports get sent to the regulators in time or 
will we get fined again?

3. How can I get my IT resources created faster and more accurately?

4. How can I protect myself from externally forced changes to gateways 
and the like?

What doesn't keep the CIO awake is using a Web Services Choreography 
Language.

So what might we say to such a person?

1. Maybe we could use a choreography definition of the services inside 
the firewall as the basis for simulation and ongoing monitoring against 
SLA requirements.

2. As above.

3. Maybe we can use a choreography definition as input to Web Services 
tools that can generate the appropriate Web Services so that 
interoperablity as a collection of services. We might even be able to 
show deadlocks and livelocks between those services that participate in 
a choreography which would lead to more robust and more strongly 
(behaviourally) types systems.

4. Perhaps a choreography definition could be used to ensure that 
unwanted changed are spotted by a choreography definition based 
monitoring tool and alert the necessary parties of what is wrong.

Of course if I was doing the pitch I would remove the "Maybe" and 
"Perhaps" and use stronger language.

Any other thoughts?

Cheers

Steve T
