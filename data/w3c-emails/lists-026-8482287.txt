Dear Colleagues,
 
As I posted previously the UN/CEFACT have generated a new site for BCF
information at www.unbcf.org 
The shape of this site has now been established, and each document that
it is proposed to generate now has a scope description - pull down the
'document' heading along the top navigation bar, select a docent and
click and you move to the description.
 
One new proposed document that may relate to the work of this group is
the  Business Collaboration Schema Specification (BCSS).   Business
Collaboration Models (BCMs) in UML cannot be directly interpreted by all
of today's software. Using the Business Collaboration Schema
Specification (BCSS) the model is transformed into a technology- and
implementation-neutral format, to which technology-specific production
rules can be applied. Business Collaboration Schemas (BCSs) possibly in
ASN.1, as well as the BCSS, comprise the BCF abstract layer, in that
they are represented in a technology- and implementation-neutral format,
such that they can be bound to any technology-specific implementation.
It is envisioned that the Business Collaboration Framework (BCF) would
have many technology specific implementations, such as Web Services and
other distributed object computing solutions in the near and distant
future.   The BCF, being technology-neutral, binding to a large number
of other different syntax notations must be ensured.
Primary audience:
Developers of BCF Tools and Applications
Implementers of BCM trading partners
 
Status: Project Proposal is currently being defined. Call for
Participation expected early November. Work to start 4Q03 (interim TMG
Meeting). 
 
The next interim TMG meeting is currently scheduled for 8 - 12 December
2003 in Waidhofen (near Vienna in Austria), so if the next F2F meeting
dates can avoid these dates it will be appreciated

Best Regards,

Tony
