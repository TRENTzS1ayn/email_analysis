12. Assert when Web Service participants are capable of managing their 
collaborations in a transactional way, to precisely define the 
transaction boundaries and the common observable compensation behavior. 
Coordinate the outcome of the long-lived collaborations, which include 
multiple, often recursive collaboration units, each with its own 
business rules and goals.

Question: Does item 12 above match your requirements?

Cheers
