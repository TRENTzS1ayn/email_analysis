Nick, all of these are for you.

Question (to Nick): Could you spend a little time explaining Figure 1 
to us. It looks very similar to Solos but many will not know anything 
about Solos. If you could walk through the diagram I would be most 
grateful.

Question (to Nick): What is meant by "the semantics of the Web 
Services" it req13?

Question (to Nick): Would I be correct in assuming that for two to 
proceed they would have to be inside different choreographies? Why is 
only one Reaction allowed to proceed inside a specific choreography?
  See: When two or more Reactions are matched inside the same 
Choreography then only one Reaction is allowed to make progress by 
enabling its own actions. The selection of which Reaction is allowed to 
proceed is implementation specific.

Question (to Nick): What does it mean to "Recover" a choreography? In 
particular how might it change the state of the web service 
participants and how might it change the state within the choreography  
itself?

Question (for Nick): Could you spend a little time explaining Figure 1 
to us. It looks very similar to Solos but many will not know anything 
about Solos. If you could walk through the diagram I would be most 
grateful.

Cheers

Steve T
