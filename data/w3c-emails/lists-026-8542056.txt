Dear Steve, Nick and all others,
 
Yes, this requirement is (in my opinion) a higher level re-statement of
my four requirements, with the proviso that the mechanism used is not
always a compensation one and we should not be specifying the mechanism
anyway.
 
So:
 
1)  I would like to see the word 'compensation' replaced with 'outcome'
(most general but applicable term that I can currently think of,
stepping down a fraction of a level my next choice would be '
confirmation or cancellation') so the requirement would read:
 
12. Assert when Web Service participants are capable of managing their
collaborations in a transactional way, to precisely define the
transaction boundaries and the common observable outcome behaviour.
Coordinate the outcome of the long-lived collaborations, which include
multiple, often recursive collaboration units, each with its own
business rules and goals
 
 
2)  I see the way I formulated the requirements as expanding on this one
in a helpful way to guide those developing the language constructs from
the requirements (top down view) and consistent with the currently
available mechanisms / protocols we know will need to underlie the
language constructs (bottom up view).

Best Regards,

Tony

Question: Does item 12 above match your requirements?
