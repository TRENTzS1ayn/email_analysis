The comment,recommendation you make is a very relevant one. Its is 
better to use a generic term in this case than a specific one.

It is possible though to reintroduce compensation by adding a 
classification schema for outcomes or an outcome ontology. There one can 
add "valuation" (within specific context) of outcomes or the different 
business path taken. Are they positive (happy path,success), negative 
(compensation, cancelation) or neutral (choice) or ...

Some of the ourcomes are legally relevant and some are not and the use 
of terms must reflect this relevance (somewhere). Cancellation of a 
document exchange may not be same as cancelling an offer.
