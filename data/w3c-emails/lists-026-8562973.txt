I apologize, I typically refrain to send pointer to articles on the list,
but I could not resist that one. I think that I possibly found the best way
to express what orchestration is: 
http://www.crn.com/sections/BreakingNews/dailyarchives.asp?ArticleID=44275
<http://www.crn.com/sections/BreakingNews/dailyarchives.asp?ArticleID=44275>

 
"[Orchestration] is an emerging [concept] that would give programmers a way
to formally describe processes underlying business applications so that they
can be exposed and linked to processes in other applications."
 
Choreography can then be defined (I am sure someone can come with a better
sentence), as:
Choreography would give programmers a way to formally describe how processes
from individual business applications are linked together regardless of
specific boundaries (technical, organizational or legal).

Subject: CDL questions for Nick@oracle



Nick, all of these are for you. 


Question (to Nick): Could you spend a little time explaining Figure 1 to us.
It looks very similar to Solos but many will not know anything about Solos.
If you could walk through the diagram I would be most grateful. 


Question (to Nick): What is meant by "the semantics of the Web Services" it
req13? 


Question (to Nick): Would I be correct in assuming that for two to proceed
they would have to be inside different choreographies? Why is only one
Reaction allowed to proceed inside a specific choreography? 

See: When two or more Reactions are matched inside the same Choreography
then only one Reaction is allowed to make progress by enabling its own
actions. The selection of which Reaction is allowed to proceed is
implementation specific. 


Question (to Nick): What does it mean to "Recover" a choreography? In
particular how might it change the state of the web service participants and
how might it change the state within the choreography itself? 


Question (for Nick): Could you spend a little time explaining Figure 1 to
us. It looks very similar to Solos but many will not know anything about
Solos. If you could walk through the diagram I would be most grateful. 


Cheers
