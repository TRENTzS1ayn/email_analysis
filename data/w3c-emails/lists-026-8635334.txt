NK:
The language is abstract enough to be used without WSDL (and in this case there are no MEPs defined)
but additionally it includes a concrete binding (WSDL). In this case a WS-CDL interaction builds atop
of a one-way/request-response MEP pattern as defined by WSDL.

NK:
In WS-CDL, interactions are enabled immediately when a reaction guard is not defined.

When a reaction guard is defined, an interaction is enabled when the state referenced
on the guard is/becomes available. Since state resides at a role, an interaction can fire
even when a reaction guard references a state that is not synchronized between participants.
This is necessary in order to support the use-case of a buyer-seller-shipper engaging in a common
business transaction. State within a shipper will not necessarily be synchronized with the state within the seller initialy but
still a guard may need to be defined before an interaction from the seller to the shipper is enabled.

Additionally, WS-CDL allows a reaction to define a guard that requires state to be synchronized
between two participants before enabling the reaction's enclosed activities.

The state information that is visible outside of a participant (Web Service, ...) is declared
in WS-CDL as observable state and it does actually capture the information exchanged between participants.

Additionally, internal state information of a participant (that does not really capture information that is exchanged
between participants) can be also declared and used in WS-CDL.

I completely agree.

Requiring a central controller for managing the choreography progress
is definitely not very practical in a distributed, peer-to-peer environment.
