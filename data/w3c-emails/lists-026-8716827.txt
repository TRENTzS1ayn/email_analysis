Hi Steve,

Re: agenda item 4c

     While I'm quite excited about the Interest Group being formed for Web
Services and the Semantic Web, I must say that I am unwilling to leave
anything as important as semantics solely to them. It's nice to say that we
will refer our issues to the IG once it's formed; however, it does little
to address the fundamental problem. Our group must, of necessity, continue
to be responsible for dealing with the semantic issues that affect
choreography.

Regards,

D-

Gentlepeople,

Enclosed is the draft agenda. I picked up some other items that I have
not included but am willing to take as AOB.

Cheers
