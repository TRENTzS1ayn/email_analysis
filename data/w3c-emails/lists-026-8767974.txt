I believe that specification of correlation in the 
choreography does not matter as long as the exchange is 
between two participants--the choreography describes
a single thread of exchanges.  I think it may matter when 
the choreography is a composite of concurrent 
exchanges between multiple participants and there
must be a definition of correlation between the binary
exchanges.  This correlation, however, may only be
required to link the specifications and might be
independent of the correlation mechanism in the
run-time messages.

ecorrelation).

If they're using something else, then they likely need a corresponding 
standard.

However, the issue then is, do we need to specify what that is? Or in 
fact, as Yaron was saying, do we actively not want to specify the 
correlation mechanism, to avoid precluding use of existing/emerging 
standards?

I understand the concern about interop but if we are not going to the 
level of laying out the full semantics of the implemenation (as BPEL 
does) then interop isn't really an issue, it seems to me.

Btw. I am not sure punting this issue to WSA is going to really help. 
The WSA doc says right at the start that "The architecture does not 
attempt to specify how Web services are implemented, and imposes no 
restriction on how services might be combined". Which is not to say they 
can't discuss the issue, but specifying an implementation is not in 
scope for them (IMO).
