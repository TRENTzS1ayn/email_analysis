I agree that not all existing servics will be "choreography aware" and that
we should still be able to use them.

However I think this really comes down to what is the basic difference
between a (business) process and a choreography.

If you are invoking an existing web service as part of a business process
(e.g. defined using BPEL) then identifying the choreography is not needed as
the business process is in complete control and knows what messages can come
back and take the appropriate action.

On the other hand, if there is no single process in control, then you need
to have some agreed definition - the CDL - which both processes agree to
follow.

So in the latter case you either:
1. Need to always use the same choreography - in which identifying it
becomes unnecessary, or
2. Recognize that there are multiple choreographies that can be used
therefore identifying which one becomes essential.

I reckon that existing services will either be invoked by a single process,
or are always used in the same way in which case working with them is not, I
think, a problem.

Hope this helps.

David

This message may be moot, but please bear with me:)

RE: Requirement 1

I think that there may well be cases where a service agent is 
participating in a choreography without it knowing! Consider legacy 
systems (and yes, even tomorrow's fully choreographed systems will 
legacy the day after) that are built today without the benefit of a 
CDL. We will want to be able to hook in such a service in with other 
services that *do* support our CDL; but a requirement that every 
message be decorated with a means of identifying the choreography 
instance will *not* be possible for a service that does not know about 
choreographies (it is just doing its thing)
