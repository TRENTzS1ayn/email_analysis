 From the outside, but with my SOAP 1.2 hat on, I'd say go for a 
feature, i.e. SOAP header block, if this is at all possible. There is 
potential that your correlation header gets reused by other 
applications/specifications, and the only real way to achieve this is to 
use a SOAP header. This would also give you two extra advantages:

1) Ability to later delegate correlation processing to a separate 
intermediary (if that makes sense).

2) Ability to easily upgrade the correlation header in the future (new 
namespace, mustUnderstand).
