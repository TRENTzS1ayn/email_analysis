David,

I would cc the bepl list just yet. They are not the only ones looking 
at correlation. I think we need to get a bit further down the track and 
then decide how best to handle the issue.

We might decide we can do it all.
We might decide to be more abstract and pass requirements down to 
another W3C group.
We might find that W3C has no group looking at the problem in the way 
that we require it to
be looked at.

It's too much in the air just yet. I think a concise requirement of set 
of them on this topic, with use cases in support, would do much to help 
focus us on the issues at hand and from there to the solutions.

I think what you have written is a good start on the solutions space 
and I can certainly imagine some use cases in support of the various 
options.

Just my hasty (on the train comments) ;-)

Cheers
