I believe that the final reality will be something like 95% of services 
are *not* choreography aware.

I don't see this.

This is a dangerous precedent. You are ceding the choreography to BPEL, 
losing before you have started.

Sorry, this misses the point. I think *you* seem to be perilously close 
to the business flow POV.

A given service will have its *way* of doing things. That may, or may 
not be, fully described in a choreography document. There may even be a 
set of services that you want to coordinate in a particular fashion to 
achieve a particular goal (e.g., the warehouse, credit card, delivery 
services combine to deliver a book.) Each of these (say) does its thing 
in a rich way, and *I* want to document how to use them to achieve the 
book delivery service - I should be able to do that in a CDL without 
impacting any of the existing services. A corollary of that is that 
there may be no way of determining what choreography a given message is 
part of (by looking at the messages), it is simply an interpretation of 
the CDL.

(I.e., in logic-speak, the potential message sequences represents an 
interpretation of the CDL formula, and that the CDL formula is 
satisfied by a given message sequence.)
