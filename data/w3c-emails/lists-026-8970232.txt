+1.

The description of particular service requirements and capabilities is 
generally in WSDL, or in WS-Policy, which can be viewed as a supplement 
to WSDL, not at the choreography layer. The set of such requirements and 
capabilities is expanding all the time.

BPEL hasn't placed correlation-related requirements on services, either, 
but has provided a mechanism through which business processes can 
specify what the correlation mechanism is, in a flexible way that is 
conformable with multiple emerging specs in this area.

There may even be a set of services that you want to coordinate in a particular fashion to achieve a particular goal (e.g., the warehouse, credit card, delivery services combine to deliver a book.) Each of these (say) does its thing in a rich way, and *I* want to document how to use them to achieve the book delivery service - I should be able to do that in a CDL without impacting any of the existing services. A corollary of that is that there may be no way of determining what choreography a given message is part of (by looking at the messages), it is simply an interpretation of the CDL.
