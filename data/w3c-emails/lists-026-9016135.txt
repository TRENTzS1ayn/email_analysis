I think it?s a bit na?ve to think that an existing web service can somehow
be plugged into a 
choreography and magically conform to the choreography rules. However I
believe that
it should be possible to use standard wsdl with no special choreo extensions
or 
interfaces. Is this what you mean Frank?
