mm1: Dave, the CDL may be needed particularly if the warehouse 
interfaces to many logical endpoints that function as a logical 
enterprise and the domain of control crosses boundaries. Wouldn't that 
be based on business requirements?

insert from previous message:

McCabe: I believe that the final reality will be something like 95% of services 

are *not* choreography aware.

Maybe, but my guess is that if the service is part of a commerce-related
co-operation between businesses, then 95% of those services *will* have to
be choreography aware. For example we have identified 14 different ways (ie
choreographies) which are used by businesses today to just place an order.
If you don't know the choreography being followed then the parties involved
won't know what they are (or are not) allowed to do.

mm1: Dave, as Frank recognizes we have to accommodate more than B2B.
