Kind of.

Just as I fully expect most `end-point' Web services to be fairly 
simple, I expect most Web services will not themselves be choreography 
aware. It would be a failure on our part if we required a Web service 
to be choreography aware before it could participate. Remember, a key 
axiom in the WSA is that 'thou shalt not require knowledge of the 
implementation of the agent' in order to be able to use the service. 
The corollary of that is that the service may not be CDL-aware.

Similarly, I can see a role for CDLs as essentially documenting how to 
*use* services as much as *building* them. (As per your earlier 
comment, perhaps it is true that 'User agents' are more likely to be 
active consumers of a CDL than an end-point service.)
