I fully and enthusiastically agree.  

"Correlation" has always seemed like a hack to make up for a lack of
semantics.
(I know, it's a useful hack, but still...)

Semantics of pre- and post-conditions are related.

So are in fluents in event calculus.

Assertions in the domain of discourse (e.g. business) make the states of
a choreography more meaningful to both technicians and end users, as
well as providing the benefits Andrew cites above.
