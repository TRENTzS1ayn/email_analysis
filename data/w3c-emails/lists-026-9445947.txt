Dear Colleagues,
 
I have mailed my document and presentation on Business Transaction
Management requirements to the archives now and you can find them in a
single zip file.  Go to:
 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2003Sep/0057.html
 
and then go down to the bottom (the archive files seem to be in text
having stripped the HTML layout!)
 

Best Regards,

Tony
