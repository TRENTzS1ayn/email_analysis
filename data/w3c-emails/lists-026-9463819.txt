I do not see how you can ensure that a service is reachable (I take it you
mean that reachable during execution means that the service is running).

Subject: A question of Composite Web Service Verification

 

Dear Colleagues,

 

    I am a new comer of the area of Web Service. In recent study, I met with
a problem of how to verify that the structure of web service compostion is
well-formed. Can I say a structure is well-formed if the structure satisfies
the following properties: reachability and deadlock-freedom? (Reachability
means that all the services included in the Composition can be reached while
excuting the composition)  And if it is, how to verify the structure used to
composite web services is well-formed?

 

Thanks
