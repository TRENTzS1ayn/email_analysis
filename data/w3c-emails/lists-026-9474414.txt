hi,

>Can I say a structure is well-formed if the structure satisfies the
following properties: reachability and deadlock-freedom

in the context of web service composition, McIlraith and Narayanan [1][2]
mention
* reachability,
* liveness and
* existence/absence of deadlocks.
as most important _verficication_ problems. However, i can't tell you if
this equals the criteria of _well-formedness_ as required by your study.

>how to verify the structure used to composite web services is well-formed

in [1][2], Petri net based algorithms are used to carry out this kind of
reasoning.


kind regards,
Joachim Peer
