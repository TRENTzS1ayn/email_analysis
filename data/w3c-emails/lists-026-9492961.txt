Hi Katia,
    In my opinion, the statement "reachable" means that a particular service can be reached in the process, or have the possibility that will be reached in the long run.

  I do not see how you can ensure that a service is reachable (I take it you mean that reachable during execution means that the service is running).

  Subject: A question of Composite Web Service Verification



  Dear Colleagues,



      I am a new comer of the area of Web Service. In recent study, I met with a problem of how to verify that the structure of web service compostion is well-formed. Can I say a structure is well-formed if the structure satisfies the following properties: reachability and deadlock-freedom? (Reachability means that all the services included in the Composition can be reached while excuting the composition)  And if it is, how to verify the structure used to composite web services is well-formed?



  Thanks
