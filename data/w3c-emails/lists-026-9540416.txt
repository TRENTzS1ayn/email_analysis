Dear Colleagues,
 
At the recent F2F I was asked to 'clarify' the requirements we submitted
on the need to be able to show the demarcation of transactions in a
choreograph description (though I do not think lack of clarity on the
intent was at all the issue!).
 
I have had a go at clarifying the requirements as requested.  Please
find attached.  You may also like to take a look at the complete (short)
slide set I had with me at the F2F, of which I presented only the last 2
- 3 slides so we could move along quickly
(http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2003Sep/0057.html).
 
If any of you are able to come up with what clearer text for these
requirements suitable for direct insertion into the Requirements
document then our assistance will be appreciated - please mail me
directly or via the list.  Thank you.
 

Best Regards,

Tony
