Dear Colleagues,

At the recent F2F I was asked to 'clarify' the requirements we submitted on
the need to be able to show the demarcation of transactions in a
choreograph description (though I do not think lack of clarity on the
intent was at all the issue!).

I have had a go at clarifying the requirements as requested.  Please find
attached.  You may also like to take a look at the complete (short) slide
set I had with me at the F2F, of which I presented only the last 2 - 3
slides so we could move along quickly (
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2003Sep/0057.html).

If any of you are able to come up with what clearer text for these
requirements suitable for direct insertion into the Requirements document
then our assistance will be appreciated - please mail me directly or via
the list.  Thank you.

Best Regards,<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns
