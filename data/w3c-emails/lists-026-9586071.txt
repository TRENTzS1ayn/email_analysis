Dear Monica and Daniel,

Yes of course all the requirements are still under discussion.  Just to
note, however, that we all ready have a long standing section in the
Requirements document entitled 'Transaction (currently section 4.10),
and that the idea of a 'transaction', one definition of which is 'a unit
of work', is a pretty fundamental notion in any concept of choreography,
whether it be B2B, B2C, internal integration or whatever.  So no
expansion of scope over what it needs to be.

Best Regards     Tony

mm1: Thanks, Tony. Given that this may extend our scope of choreography,

would we discuss these requirements prior to their inclusion (may apply 
to several sets of functions, of which your submission is only one).
Comments everyone?
