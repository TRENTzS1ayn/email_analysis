Just to let everone know that the HTML version of the latest draft has been posted to the W3C archive at ...

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2004Apr/0005.html

Note that this version says it is a "working draft" which it is not, it's an editors draft - this still needs to be tidied up.

The XML equivalent has bee sent to Yves for posting on the WS Chor web site which should occur soon.

To avoid confusion, once the HTML version is available on the WS Chor website it should be treated as the master.

Great work. Thanks to the editors for this bit. I shall start reviewing 
next week. And I look fwd to the html version of the previous CDL 
document
being on the website within a matter of days ;-)

Any items that you specification editors wish to be on the call for 
next week?
Any items that you issues custodians wish to be on the call for next 
week too?
Any issues from anyone else?

Remember that the sort of items that Martin and I are looking for 
should relate to CDL and should have been raised as an issue against 
CDL.

Cheers

Steve T
