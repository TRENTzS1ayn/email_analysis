Hi,
I would like to ask you which is the relation between the WS-CDL and WSCI 1.0 (I even see a reference ([15]) in WS-CDL editor's draft(http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/chor/edcopies/cdl/cdl.html) which is never used)? 
What was wrong with the WSCI such that a new choreography language (WS-CDL) was needed?
Thank you,
Titi Roman
