Titi,

The relationship is described in our charter (). WSCI will not progress 
further. WS-CDL will progress further. WSCI was the basis of a W3C 
working note that preceeded the formation of the W3C Web Services 
Choreography Working Group. It forms an input into the work of the 
working group but does not define it nor restrict it. WSCL was also a 
working note and BPML, DAML/S and BPEL4WS were all listed as inputs. 
The only difference is that WSCI and WSCL are W3C working notes and the 
others are not (maybe not true in the case of DAML/S).

I hope that explains it. It would be better for the community at large 
to forget about WSCL and WSCI. Unless you are doing a history 
assignment they have very little of any relevance anymore.

Cheers

Steve T
