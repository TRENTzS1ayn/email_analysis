Hi,
Thanks for your answer.
I still have a question. When you say that it would be better for the
community at large to forget about WSCL and WSCI, I suppose that they had
many technical shortcomings. Could you explain in a few words these
shortcomings or point some documents where I can find these shortcomings
briefly explained?
Why W3C Choreography group chose to build another choreography language
instead of extending WSCI (or other initiatives you pointed in your email)?
Could you also give me a pointer to the charter you were talking about in
you email (where the relation between WS-CDL and WSCI is described)?
Thanks a lot,
Titi Roman
