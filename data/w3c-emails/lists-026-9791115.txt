Fair question Titi.

Okay where do I start....
First of all WSCI was an executable language. Secondly WSCI has no 
formal basis at all.
When we started Web Services Choreography we started from requirements 
and spent a long time thinking about what was needed as opposed to what 
was there. We came up with a list of requirements and a list of 
objectives. All these are listed in the requirements document on the 
Choreography WG website. WSCI and WSCL and others did not meet these 
requirements at all. So to be able to meet the requirements we really 
had no option but to start from scratch.

One thing did cross the boundary into, namely the concept of the 
"global model". This remains a principle focus of the approach we have 
taken. We tightened up by basing things around some formalism (the 
pi-calculus). We recruited some academic experts in the field (Robin 
Milner, Nobuku Yoshida and Kohei Honda) to help make this real. And we 
issued WS-CDL (editors draft and overview document).

We did embark on a formal look at shortcomings, which you can see from 
previous minutes, but this work never amounted to anything.

I hope this helps put some context around things. Of course when the 
group was set up a lot of politics was flying around regarding WSCI and 
BPEL4WS. What we did was expose an area that no one was really looking 
at and have since found a lot of commercial traction with the global 
model and the idea of a global model led contract based design.

Interestingly enough if you look at financial services trading systems, 
they all work based on an informal global model which described the 
external observable behaviour of a multi-party protocol. This is 
exactly what WS-CDL does but in a formal setting that can make 
guarantees about certain liveness properties and conformance. It turns 
out this is exactly what these folks need. I suspect that this is not 
the only area that needs such a mechanism. It would appear that this is 
how these vertical standards really do work. They all use some form of 
informal global model or multiparty contract couples with data formats. 
Methinks this applies outside this area into telco, SCM and so on.

Cheers

Steve T
