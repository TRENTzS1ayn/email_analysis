Is there anything as a WG that we need to press on this particular  
submission in Oasis?

http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/5999/WS-Reliability- 
CD-0992.zip

I'm trying to consolidate responses to give a clear message back to the  
TC on this topic. Pls let me and/or Martin know asap.

Cheers

Steve T
