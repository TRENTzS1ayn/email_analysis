WSCI was definitely not intended to be executable, but describe the 
observable message exchange between the participants. It did focus on a 
level of abstraction that some other proposals would consider 
"operational", but any language can be viewed as operational compared to 
a more abstract language.

The model for describing the behavior of any one participant/process and 
the composition of that behavior into larger processes is based on 
mobile process calculus.

Formalism allows you to make a lot of proofs about the language itself, 
but more interesting, about the specifications you produce using that 
language. In the case of WSCI, formalism becomes more important as a way 
to derive conclusions about compositions, and it allows you to leverage 
the extensive work done in the field of process calculus.
