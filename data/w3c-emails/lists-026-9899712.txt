In section 1.4, it is stated that the specification depends on XML 1.0. Is
there any reason to be that specific?
The reference is also on the SOAP 1.1 Note instead of the SOAP 1.2
recommendation, but I couldn't find any.

In 2.4.8.2, it reads
When a Choreography encounters an exceptional condition it MAY need to
revert the actions it had already completed' by providing finalization
actions that semantically rollback the effects of the completed actions.
then
A Finalizer WorkUnit is enabled only after its enclosing Choreography
completes successfully.

This seems to be in contradiction, rollback sounds more like the purpose
of the exception block, then the finalizer block is called (after all
processing of either the enclosed choreography or the exception block).
Can this be clarified?
Thanks,
