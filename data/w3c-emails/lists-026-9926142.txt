Hi Assaf,
Thanks a lot for clarifying some things...still some questions in-line.

Which are these other proposals(I am just trying to understand what you
meant by "any language can be viewed as operational compared to a more
abstract language")?

Does these mean that WSCI is really dead (as Steve Ross-Talbot pointed out
in one of his emails)?

As far as I understood and please correct me if I am wrong, WS-CDL supports
only "global model"(i.e. the multi-participant view of the overall message
exchange) - this sounds to me as a static linking between web services. What
about the dynamic linking between ws from the point of view if
coneversation? What about the view of the overall message exchange as seen
from one participant? Isn't WS-CDL supposed to support also this view?

In this context still my previuos questions:

Where exactly is pi-calculus used in WS-CDL and what scenarios by using
pi-calculus in this context do you predict?

When you choosd pi-calculus as the underlying fromalizm for WS-CDL, I
suppose you had some reasons for choosing it and not other
formalisms...could you point out shortly these reasons?

Thanks a lot!
