Titi,

WSCI is dead. It is not used commercially but it was an input and a 
valid input to the W3C Web Services WG.

WS-CDL describes the external observable behaviour of 
multi-participants from a global model perspective.
WS-CDL is based around pi-calculus. I cannot give you proofs but if it 
is any comfort this is why Robin Milner,
Kohei Honda and Nobuko Yoshida joined our WG as invited experts. Such a 
proof is complex and takes time.
I think you will find that few if any commercial standards or products 
that claim heritage from pi can prove their
heritage in any formal way. WSCI cannot and neither can BPML and many 
other standards and associated
products.

WS-CDL does not describe the static behaviour only. One only has to 
think of use cases that require channel
passing and so exhibit mobility in the pi-calculus sense, and we have 
dynamic behaviour. What WS-CDL is not
about is on the fly connection of services with not commonly agreed 
global model. Thus services can join and
leave a choreography as and when they need to do so. But they must all 
conform to the external observable
behaviour so defined. This is nothing other than a high level abstract 
contract that binds the participants based
on external observable behaviour. What it does is guarantee 
conformance, it increases interoperability, it can
provide liveness guarantees of so desired all of which are rather 
useful in the real world and reflect the desires
of many vertical standards bodies.

We will at some point provide a clearer association to process 
algebraic formalisms and indeed Nobuko Yoshida
has already submitted a type system proposal completely based on some 
of this work to the WG for inclusion
in WS-CDL. WS-CDL has been constructed with all of this in mind and we 
are in the process of doing the
necessary work to meet our objectives, some of which does require some 
formalism to be shown to be correct
and true.

Yes WSCI is also a language that describes. Indeed I was wrong. However 
WSCI, whilst being a good starting point,
challenged other parts of the standards world in that it (I think) 
provided some mechanism for end-point behaviour. This
was in direct competition with Abstract BPEL. So WS-CDL does not 
provide an "intermediate" end-point language. Rather
it relies on other work out there and generative techniques to model 
such behaviour. In short we start where BPEL cannot
go. And BPEL stops where we choose to start. Of course in choosing our 
start point it would be naive to think that BPEL
did not influence us in our thinking. It did as did the work on WSCI, 
the work of Milner, Honda, Yoshida and Kobayshi as
well Meredith et al.

What we have today is a WS-CDL working draft that meets a set of 
requirements and goals as described in our requirements
document. Further more we have market tested the applicability to what 
we are doing and our approach an found this to
be more than just acceptable. And we look forward to some successes in 
the not too distant future. I would suggest that you
take a good look at the requirements document and this should enable 
you to see what it is a CDL must be able to do, what
it should be able to do and what we might like it to do.

Cheers


Steve T
