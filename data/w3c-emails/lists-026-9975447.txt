Why does the global model implies static linking? I am not sure I understand this.

And what is the dynamic linking between ws from the point of view of the
coneversation? Can you elaborate on this more?

I have filled an issue for this in the Cambridge F2F and myself and Steve have
an action item to present our proposal to the group.

Maybe you have some insights that can help the group one way or another?

Please take a look at the latest e-mail sent to the list by Nobuko (one of our
2 invited experts) on this.

I would advise you to look into our archieves, since we had very strong
debates in the last 1 year about the usefuleness of a formal
model - being pi-calculus/or a flavour of pi-calculus, event calculus, a
less constrained computational model like CCS, etc. - as the
basis of the CDL language.
