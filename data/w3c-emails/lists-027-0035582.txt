Only nobody@w3.org (the CVS notifier) used to be able to post on this
mailing list in the past. Given that the discussion regarding
XSL/xmlspec details are probably not of a high interest for our
colleagues, it is better to move them out of the w3c-ws-desc for the
sake of saving their mailbox. To avoid creating one more WS mailing list
where WSDL discussion may happen, only editors can post to it and I ask
them to use with it only when the topic is only relevant to the editors.
use w3c-ws-desc otherwise.

I remove the SVG automatic handling. I should have tested it on several
XSL engine before committing it, sorry. I guess that the error handling
of the document() XPath function is not clearly defined in the XPath 1.0
specification. I'll see if there is an other way to test if a file
exists or not.

It would be good to always have id attributes for all sections (divN),
otherwise the resulting ids are implementation/document version
dependent and change at each publication. I should probably add a
warning xsl:message everytime generate-id() is invoked in the XSL.
