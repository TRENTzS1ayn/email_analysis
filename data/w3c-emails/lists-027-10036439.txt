(sorry for the late reply)

My little nit with this is that I don't think the <feature> elements are needed in the bindings (at least the SOAP/HTTP one) - don't the bindings themselves already indicate that those features are supplied?  My take on the <feature required="true"> usage is that it's for placement in the "abstract" section of the WSDL, to indicate that some concrete implementation (either a binding or a SOAP module) must exist for that feature.  What do you think?
