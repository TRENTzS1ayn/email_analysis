Greetings PFTF'ers:

We'll be having our weekly telcon again tomorrow (Tuesday) at 11AM EST, 8AM PST, 4PM UTC (etc) on Zakim as per [1].

The agenda is as follows:

* Sanjiva will be giving us a presentation on the IBM Context proposal [2].
  We'll get the scoop from Sanjiva and discuss ways in which we might blend
  this fruitfully with the Properties pattern.

* Update on where we'd like to go with the TF, and what's pending in terms
  of writeups and decisions.

See you there!

--Glen
