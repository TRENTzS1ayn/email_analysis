Simon/Philippe:  

Will you please add Amy Lewis [alewis@tibco.com] to the list?

Also, what is the read/write access policy for this list?  Public read /
restricted write?

If so, it might be helpful to post a list of the currrent subscribers to the
list so we make sure everyone who has expressed interest in being on the the
features/properties task force is included.

Don
