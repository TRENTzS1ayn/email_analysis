Not as well for me .. that's midnight. Silly time depends on where
you are Dave ;-).

Anyway, in order to find a slot I am happy to accept 1pm eastern 
for an hour. However, I suggest that we consider rotating the times
to distribute the inconvenience. This is standard practice in IBM
where we have regular calls with folks in Japan, China, Europe,
US and everywhere in between.

Sanjiva.
