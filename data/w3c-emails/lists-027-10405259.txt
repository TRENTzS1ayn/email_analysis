Agreed.  If everyone on the list who will be participating on the calls
sends me a private email with the following information:

o Your Timezone
o Availability -- in blocks of time (your timezone)
  listed in order of preference (most preferred to least)

I will put together a matrix and proposed weekly meeting time (or times).
Sending individual messages to the list isn't very productive.

**Please send by end of day today -- Tuesday**  That way, I can post
tomorrow morning.

And not with the xmlp call, which is wednesdays at 11am pst.

But I hardly think this is ridiculous.  We each have many different
responsibilities, and each time a group starts, it's crazy finding the best
time.
