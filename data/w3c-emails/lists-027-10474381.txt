+1 to Dave for ruling out silly times. On the same basis, I'd 
gently suggest that we also rule out 19:00+ (CET). Such times 
have had the infortunate effect of causing a bit of an 
indigestion over the last three years. Besides, they would really 
be unfair on Sanjiva.

Dave, you shouldn't assume everyone works from 10:00 to 23:59. 
Different people have different arrangments; some wakeup earlier 
than others, apparently.  ;-)

Glen, Fridays don't work well on the other side of the Atlantic. 
Imagine you were to spend the week-end in Rome; would you still 
fancy a Friday 19:00 EST telcon?  ;-)

Don, I was unable to meet your deadline, unfortunately. Can I 
suggest you post messages earlier in the day so that Europeans 
are indeed able to respond the same day?

Timezones are a sensative issue. I'd expect reasonnable people to 
meet at reasonnable times.

Jean-Jacques.
