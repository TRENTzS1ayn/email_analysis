Regrets for this upcoming meeting :-( - I am skiing in Park City, Utah with
my children :-).

> 2. Discuss the document Jean-Jacques posted [1]  (50min)

Looks like a good start.  I am somewhat concerned about how much we can have
ready to present at the next F2F - two weeks out.  Perhaps a portion of
tomorrow's meeting could be spent discussing what kind of deliverable we can
have for that meeting.  I know Jonathan would like to see a resolution on
features/properties by the end of the F2F, so it seems some kind of
presentation to the group will be in order.  I think the focus should be on
the presentation, which means drilling in on the specifics of a couple of
the more compelling use-cases -- and resisting spending too much time on the
details of the rest.  

As a WSD WG member, I would want to know:

o what are the use cases (we've started this discussion)

o why can't this be solved with the general extension mechanism in WSDL?

o what else might this affect other than WSD?

I would like to volunteer to put time into putting together a presentation
for the F2F.

> 3. Decide on date/time for next call (5min)

The Tuesday 11am EST is designated as our time slot going forward --
correct?

Don
