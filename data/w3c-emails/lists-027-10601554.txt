I propose adding the following scenario to [1].

[1] 
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2002/ws/desc/wsdl12/wsdl12-pftf-usage-cenarios.xml


<div2 id="S9">
<head>S9 Absence Feature</head>
<div3>
<head>Scenario Definition</head>
<p>A feature implemented in an intermediary to forward or not based on 
the presence or absence of another feature (e.g., SOAP header block).  For 
example, assuming a policy that certain SOAP requests must include a dsig 
to be forwarded, this feature would generate a fault if the dsig header is 
missing (or perhaps invalid).  The feature may be able to redirect the 
sender to another intermediary that knows how to add the required dsig.</p>
</div3>
</div2>
