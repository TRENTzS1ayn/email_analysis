Hi folks:

As mentioned on the WG call last week, I am wondering how many of the PFTF folks will be coming into Boston in time for dinner on Sunday night before the F2F?  If we can get a quorum (maybe 5 or 6?) I'd like to arrange for some of us to go out for a nice dinner and high-bandwidth face-to-face discussion of the task force's work.  If you'll be around and this sounds interesting to you, please send me mail and let me know.

Thanks,
--Glen
