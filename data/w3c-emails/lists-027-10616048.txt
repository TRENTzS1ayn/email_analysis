To:"Properties and Features Task Force (E-mail)"<public-ws-pnf-tf@w3.org>



As per usual, call-in info at [1].

The call is at 11AM EST (8AM PST, etc.), duration one hour (I've asked Philippe if it might be possible to stretch this to 90 minutes, but that will depend on availability of the bridge and willingness of the bridged :))

Tomorrow we will continue discussing the scenarios outlined in [2], and attempt to create a "side-by-side" comparison of a few syntactic proposals (WSDL native extensibility, explicit <feature>/<property> elements, etc) if possible.

Please read Amy's write up on S7 at [3].

We haven't had very many meetings of this TF, but this is the last one before the F2F, so let's make it count!  Everyone bring your thinking caps, your listening skills, and an open mind.
