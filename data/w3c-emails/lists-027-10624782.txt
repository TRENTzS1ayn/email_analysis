I did not immediately started to scribe by IRC. Here are the 
earlier notes.

Jean-Jacques.

Glen: extra 30 minutes?
Glen: here's what I think we need to do:
1) Indicate a particular feature is provided
2) Indicate a particular feature is required
3) Indicate a particular property constraint
Considering that each of these things may be scoped in various 
ways (service/portType/operation/binding)
Glen: anything else missing? the list should enable us to quickly 
evaluate solutions.
Don: sounds good; but the group will also be interested in 
knowing why the standard extension is not enough.
Glen: agree.
Don: pick one feature, do it side by side
