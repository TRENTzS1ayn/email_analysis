Glen,

This looks pretty good.  I like the description of how a feature as a whole is required.  I do have some questions, though.

1) Suppose that a feature contains a number of properties, and the WSDL author wants to express the fact that a certain property is required?  There is no coordination showing here between the feature element and the propertyValue element.  That's fine, but isn't it possible to require a property?

2) Is it possible to show propertyConstraint as well as propertyValue?

3) In general, I'd really like to see the whole proposed syntax, and then the examples of use.

Amy!

As an example, if the SOAP underlying transport binding in use is HTTPS, the binding specification may specify that it natively provides the "secure-channel" feature.  The software would know this (since one would assume they implemented the binding from the spec), and realize the requirement was met.  Alternately, the service may indicate that a SOAP module is available via something like this:

Along those same lines, expressing it as a property in a standard "bag" of URI-tagged values allows any other feature/extension to refer to the value in a standard way, without needing to know the specific WSDL binding (i.e. <soap:webMethod>).  As feature specs proliferate, it is better to have one way to refer to the properties (which incidentally matches the way they are defined in the specs, by URI) than a separate WSDL extensibility element for each new spec.
