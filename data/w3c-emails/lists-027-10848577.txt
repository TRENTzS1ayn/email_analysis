To:"Properties and Features Task Force (E-mail)"<public-ws-pnf-tf@w3.org>



PFTF'ers:

Well, after much discussion, we managed to get features and properties into WSDL 1.2 with an overwhelmingly positive vote.  See the F2F summary [1] for a description of what we ended up with.

At this point, the most immediate job of the task force is complete.  However, I think there is definite value in continuing forward with the cross-group TF to flesh out the scenarios we've been discussing and research the potential value of the Features/Properties approach to extension design.

This needs to be discussed with Jonathan and Mike/Dave, so I propose today we have a short telcon simply to discuss future directions, since I know everyone's been busy (including myself) and we haven't had an explicit mandated agenda after the WSDL change.  Sorry for the short notice, which is another reason I'm figuring today's call can be very casual.

11AM EST, you know the number, you know the passcode [2].  Talk to you then!
