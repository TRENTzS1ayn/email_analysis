Back in my office after trying to get my laptop fixed.
I did not schedule a time for this week, not knowing if people were
willing to have a teleconference after the technical plenary week.

Let's synchronize during the WSD/WSA calls and I'll make sure we have
Zakim for next week. In any case, I won't be able to make the call next
week since I'll be travelling (with my laptop if it manages to survive
:( )
