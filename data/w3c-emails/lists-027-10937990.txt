Hi folks!

At last week's WS-Desc telcon, we briefly discussed the future of the PFTF.  It was decided that although the WSD group has already accepted syntax and structure for integrating features and properties into WSDL 1.2, there is still a call for more work to be done in this area.  Specifically:

For WSDL 1.2, we need to write the "specese" which describes features and properties in a comprehensible way, hopefully with an illustrative example or two.  Deeper examples of how to utilize this stuff need to go into a primer.

For both WSDL 1.2 and WSA, we need to continue to flesh out the usage scenarios and designs we were discussing previous to the tech plenary.  It is hoped that the WSA spec will be the eventual home of a description of the features and properties "zen", and that this task force can help both groups to understand how to utilize these patterns from design through WSDL through tie-ins with SOAP/protocol-layer extensibility.

As such, we decided to recharter the group in order to move forward with these goals.  Our first task will be to continue to flesh out the scenarios document which we started last month.  Toward this end, we will continue our weekly Tuesday 11AM EST / 8AM PST telcons, including one tomorrow, March 18th.

I apologize for not getting this note out sooner, I'm travelling in San Francisco this week and have been extremely busy with company stuff.  :( I hope it arrives in time for many of you to make the telcon in the morning.

Thanks, and talk to you tomorrow!
