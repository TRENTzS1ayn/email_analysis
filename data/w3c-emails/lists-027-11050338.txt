Here is a proposal for the features and properties associated with the
http binding and soap http binding, based on discussion with Arthur.

abstract level:

 The goal of defining them at the abstract level as well would be to
 provide a hint to the implementation. Their use is not
 required. Mapping XML Schema complexType into an HTTP GET won't be
 done. Of course, you can serialize the Infoset in the URI but who would
 like to use those uris? Based on the abstract feature, one can
 determine if a result is cachable for example, even if an HTTP POST is
 used underneath.

 feature
  name http://www.example.org/CRUD
  
 property
  name: http://www.example.org/method
  value space: create | retrieve | update | delete

HTTP binding:
 feature
   http://www.example.org/2003/03/http/web-method
   property
    name: http://www.example.org/2003/03/http/web-method/method
    value space: PUT | GET | POST | DELETE

SOAP HTTP binding:
 feature 
  http://www.w3.org/2002/12/soap/features/web-method/
   property 
    name: http://www.w3.org/2002/12/soap/features/web-method/Method
    value space: PUT | GET | POST | DELETE

Do we need to invent a new feature for the HTTP binding? Well, not
really, but it would be good if people don't associate systematically
the SOAP Web Method Feature with SOAP itself. It's more a feature that
needs to be attached to HTTP imho but the URI used does not reflect
that.
