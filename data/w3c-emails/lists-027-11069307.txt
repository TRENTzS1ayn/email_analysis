Sounds good. What about adding the following feature, to cover setting 
HTTP header fields, which we've postponed[1] until features were available?

HTTP binding:
  feature
     http://www.example.org/2003/03/http/header-field
     property
      name: http://www.example.org/2003/03/http/header-field/name
      type: xsd:string
     property
      name: http://www.example.org/2003/03/http/header-field/value
      type: xsd:string

We could also generalize this features for any protocol, not just HTTP, 
i.e. define it at the abstract level.
