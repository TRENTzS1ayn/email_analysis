How useful would it be? The accept, accept-ranges, content-type,
authorization, cache-control, connection and content-length are already
fixed by other means. accept-language has nothing to do in the WSDL. Do
you have an example of an header that needs to be fixed and should not
be represented in a more abstract way?

How do you set two headers with the approach?

imho, we should focus on the needs themselves, not the way they are
represented in the protocol. Authorization is a good example of such
case.
