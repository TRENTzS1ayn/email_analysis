We're supposed to have a call tomorrow.
Glen, did you manage to contact Paco regarding the WS-Policy
presentation?

I didn't any strong objection against the HTTP features and properties
proposal? Should I assume that it's good for review by the WG now and
the PnF TF thinks it's the way to go?

ACTION: Glen to write why it should a property instead of an XML element
(pros and cons)
ACTION: Philippe to write his HTTP features/properties proposal
 -> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-ws-pnf-tf/2003Mar/0025.html
ACTION: Glen to contact Paco
