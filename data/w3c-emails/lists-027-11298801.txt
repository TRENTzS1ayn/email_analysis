While performing a few pending edits in the glossary, I realized /
remembered that the glossary is fairly out of sync with the new
architecture document and that it should probably be fixed before we
publish everything.

I don't envision to have the two documents completely in sync before
republication, but at least to have the glossary hold the definitions
found in the architecture document, i.e. step 1 below.

What I had in mind was to do the following:
1. Add new terms defined in section 4 to the glossary.
2. Report descrepencies between existing definitions.
3. Consider the fate of terms that are in the glossary and not in the
   architecture document, and that are somewhat equivalent or redundant,
   e.g. client. The different options are:
   - add to the architecture document.
   - keep in the glossary only.
   - delete the term from the glossary.

First, does that sound like a good way forward?

Second, in order to avoid doing the work twice, when do you think that
section 4 will be stable enough for me to do this?

Step 1 is fairly mechanical and is the one I'd like to do before
publication. Step 2 and 3 will require more work and will take quite a
while to accomplish.

Regards,

Hugo
