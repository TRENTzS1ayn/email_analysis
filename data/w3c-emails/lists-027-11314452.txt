Hugo,

A couple of points to consider going forward.

I think we should be fairly deliberate in proceeding to synchronize the 
two documents.
We might consider that the architecture document be the normative source 
for definitions
that could be slurped out into the glossary using some form of stylesheet. 
 That way, we
don't have to worry about future synchronization issues.

Secondly, where we have a discrepancy, I think that we should be carefully 
considering
which of the two we like best rather than just picking one document's 
definition over the other
for all cases.

My $0.02.

Cheers,
