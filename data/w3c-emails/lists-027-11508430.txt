Hi,

For the list of issues:

-- Check definitions (are the right ones in the list)
-- Resolve agent/resource/service/element overlaps and relationships (i.e. if an agent is manageable do we really need an element)
-- If we have a discovery service, what other services do we have?  (Security and transactions come to mind.)
-- Are resources by definition manageable or do we need separate concepts?

Eric

There are still issues with the presentation.

I was not able to incorporate Katia's image because I couldn't separate 
it.
