Hi Geoff and Frank.

I am using the glossary mailing list to work on this to avoid a big
controversy on www-ws-arch when I want to discuss purely editorial
issues. I want to figure out how to include Geoff's work in the
current glossary.

Is this text only intended for the glossary or will it be integrated
in the architecture document?

It seems to me that it should go in the architecture document and that
a light version should go in the glossary. This seems more detailed
than any other definition in the glossary. See below.

I would stop the definition of MEP here.

Based on this, we would define in the glossary (taking into account
Mike's friendly amendment):

- synchronous MEP: an MEP which describe closely coupled in time, or
  lock-step interactions.

- asynchronous MEP: an MEP which doesn't describe closely coupled in
  time, or lock-step interactions.

> The terms "synchronous" and "asynchronous" are descriptive, and do
> not correspond precisely to properties of MEPs. Occasionally the
> terms may be associated with particular message transport features,
> such as the re-use of a session. While specific implementations may
> support such notions, a dependency on such a feature would violate
> protocol independence, and therefore be problematic.
> 
> Many (most?) web services do not use published MEP's, but instead rely
> on more or less informal patterns and techniques. In such cases, the
> terms "synchronous" and "asynchronous" may be used to indicate the
> type of informal pattern being used. They may also indicate whether
> or not coordination and synchronization techniques such as correlation
> data and particular transport bindings are to be used.

We could add the first sentence of the first paragraph, along with a
pointer to the relevant section of the architecture document where
this detailed explanation lives.

Does this make sense?

Regards,

Hugo
