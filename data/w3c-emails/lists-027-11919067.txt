Well, perhaps I can suggest something that might make sense from the MTF
document side.  It struck me when I looked at the MTF document that it
was using terminology somewhat different from the refactored document.
Possibly it is more consistent with the earlier Arch incarnation or
perhaps with the WSDL spec, which has their own world-view built in.
One particular instance to illustrate the concept -- not particularly to
draw attention to this point, in which I may indeed be incorrect -- it
seemed to me that the MTF document uses the term "endpoint" quite a bit
but that the refactored Arch document does not, preferring some other
terms for similar concepts.  Or perhaps lining up the concepts a bit
differently.

So I guess I'm suggesting that the terminology used in the MTF document
be revisited in light of the terms defined (in stunning detail) in the
existing refactored Arch doc.

I have to disappear to my day job the rest of this week, so I won't be
able to dig in on this till next week sometime.

But its a good question, how do we begin to integrate this into the
existing document? Should we wait for another pass from the editors so
that we understand the context we are inserting into better?

Subject: Incorporation of the managament text into the architecture
document



Today, during the face-to-face meeting, we agreed to incorporate the MTF
output (including the one presented today up to section 3.2) into the
architecture document. Several people volunteered to participate in this
effort.

As a concrete way to do this, I have proposed that people work on the
MTF mailing list, public-wsawg-mtf@w3.org.

For information about subscribing, archives, etc, please see my
announcement email:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ws-arch/2003Feb/0068.html

Interested parties should therefore subscribe to this list and start
work there.

Regards,

Hugo
