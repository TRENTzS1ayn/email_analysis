Hi all.

I have added the definitions proposed by the MTF to the glossary:

  http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2002/ws/arch/glossary/wsa-glossary.html?rev=1.36

Some of them redefine existing terms (e.g. metric), and they need to
be made consistent with the rest of the document (e.g. property vs.
attribute).

My main comment would be that management is not defined. Well, there
is a definition of management, but it uses management capabilities
and management system, which themselves use the term management, etc.

I will work on integrating them to the document better and will send
another email when this is done with a list of outstanding problems.

I will also send an email with comments about the document that the
MTF came up with that currently are on my hard copy.

Regards,

Hugo
