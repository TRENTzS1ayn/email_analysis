It's not a bad idea to wait a bit, our first chore will be to convert the doc into XML and fix some of the organizational/formatting "bugs" that remain.

I have to disappear to my day job the rest of this week, so I won't be able
to dig in on this till next week sometime.

But its a good question, how do we begin to integrate this into the
existing document? Should we wait for another
pass from the editors so that we understand the context we are inserting
into better?

Subject: Incorporation of the managament text into the architecture
document



Today, during the face-to-face meeting, we agreed to incorporate the
MTF output (including the one presented today up to section 3.2) into
the architecture document. Several people volunteered to participate
in this effort.

As a concrete way to do this, I have proposed that people work on the
MTF mailing list, public-wsawg-mtf@w3.org.

For information about subscribing, archives, etc, please see my
announcement email:

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ws-arch/2003Feb/0068.html

Interested parties should therefore subscribe to this list and start
work there.

Regards,

Hugo
