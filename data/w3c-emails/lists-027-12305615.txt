All,

First point, not everyone has Word, we should be using the document 
formats that 
we have been using all along for our work. IN our case, we have been using 
XML
and xml-spec DTD. Alternately, we should be using HTML.

I have attached an edited version with some editorial suggestions and some 

comments.



Cheers,
