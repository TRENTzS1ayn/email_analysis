Chris,
 
I will use XML soon ( I had to do a short cut due to lack of time).
 
PS: For sure I will send HTML
 
Thanks for the input, I will incorporate. (actually many many thanks, very
good feedback)
 
Abbie

All, 

First point, not everyone has Word, we should be using the document formats
that 
we have been using all along for our work. IN our case, we have been using
XML 
and xml-spec DTD. Alternately, we should be using HTML. 

I have attached an edited version with some editorial suggestions and some 
comments. 



Cheers,
