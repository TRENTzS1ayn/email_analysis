I made a suggestion for the paragraph 
Note: Add a paragraph to state:
 
The WSA work view security as a feature that could be used across the whole web services stack. The
WSA architecture does not conflict with other work that is done in OASIS and W3C WG regarding
security. Some of the work is being standardized and the rest may or may not be standardized.
 
<Gerald Edgar>
 
The WSA group views security as a feature that needs to be available across the whole web services stack
regardless of the implementation details. The WSA work is intended to work with the results of other
standards groups in the W3C or under OASIS. Some aspects of security are being standardized, and other
portions may not be. In any case to maximize the benefit of web services using security there needs to be a
consistent basis of it's implementation so that applications can be integrated using web services without
people negotiating the technical details of security, but to use what is seen as a consistent and robust
capability in the context of standards.
