There are, I think, several thing to point out in here:
- the meaning of signing a message.
- the dangers on relying on external processing (e.g. schema
  validation when the schema isn't attached to the message).
- maybe other things that I have missed.

It seems that the first point could go in the section about signature, and
the second one about a good practice or threats section.

Comments?

Regards,

Hugo
