Hi Abbie:
   I think that you are still over estimating the effort involved.

   If you think of the WSA as a framework architecture rather than a 
specific implementation arch, then all that is really required is to 
establish the key `entry points' that are necessary; and potentially 
point to the more specific specs.

   E.g., I doubt v. much that we need to investigate the presence or 
lack of support for security in WSDL.

Really, the question that needs to be answered is:

How does the WSA account for security

The answer is going to be a combination of two things:

the key concepts needed for security and a pointer to a more detailed 
spec.

This is both easier and harder than dumping a list of specifics; easier 
because there should be less typing, harder because getting the right 
key is difficult.
