Hi all,

I am finally back on-line.

Can u please provide feedback on the plan.
we should divide the work on reviewing the avilable documents to ensure that
we can comply with them from an architecture point of view.
It would help if we can start having volunteers.

I have sent before on the main list pointers to avilable tech in OASIS and
w3c.
my presentation slides from F2F should also have some references.

ps: Sorry I am still on the road, so my i may respond slowly

Abbie
