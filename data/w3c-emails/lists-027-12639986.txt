Appendix C of the XKMS Vesion 2 Candidate Recommendation, entitled Sample 
Protocol Exchanges, contains examples of key derivations, some of which 
appear not to be accurate.  I enclose my suggested corrections below.

Section 8.1 (Use of Limited-Use Shared Secret Data) says that "All space and 
control characters are removed." Given sections C.1.2 and C.1.3, this 
suggests that a hyphen is a control character. For
the sake of clarity I propose using "punctuation characters" instead of or 
in addition to "control characters".

Also, it might be more appropriate to call the derived quantities "Secret 
Keys" as opposed to "Private Keys".

C.2.1 Alice Pass Phrase Computation

The values are correct, but the lines
Pass Phrase Pass 1 HMAC-SHA1 (Converted Authentication Data, 0x1)
Pass Phrase Pass 2 = HMAC-SHA1 (Pass Phrase Pass 1 , 0x2

should read
Pass Phrase Pass 1 HMAC-SHA1 (Converted Authentication Data, 0x2)
Pass Phrase Pass 2 = HMAC-SHA1 (Pass Phrase Pass 1 , 0x3)


C.2.2 Bob Pass Phrase Computation

The values are correct, but the lines
Pass Phrase Pass 1 HMAC-SHA1 (Converted Authentication Data, 0x1)
Pass Phrase Pass 2 = HMAC-SHA1 (Pass Phrase Pass 1 , 0x2

should read
Pass Phrase Pass 1 HMAC-SHA1 (Converted Authentication Data, 0x2)
Pass Phrase Pass 2 = HMAC-SHA1 (Pass Phrase Pass 1 , 0x3)
