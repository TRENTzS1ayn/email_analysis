I fear I won't get much support for this, but I think this would be a good
time to lift an old restriction on ID values. I think numeric values of
xml:id should be allowed.

<products>
  <product xml:id="23432" ... />
  ...
</products>

This would make the meaning of ID in XML more like the meaning of ID in
databases.
