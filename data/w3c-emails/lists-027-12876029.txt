Requirement 9, "The solution should enable IDness to be exposed 
through the [XPath] id() function (possibly with the help of errata 
to the XPath specification)." makes me uncomfortable. I do not 
approve of using errata to make substantive changes to a 
specification. I would prefer instead something like, "The solution 
should enable IDness to be exposed through the [XPath] id() function 
in future versions of XPath."
