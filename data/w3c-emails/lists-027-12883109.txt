has nothing about the scope or uniqueness of an ID value,
matching the single document scope of an ID value in a DTD.

Using XSLT it is often a case that  a 'unique to n document'
ID is needed. E.g. for a document split out into one file per chapter
toc. The ID values need to be unique within the scope of the collated
document.

1. Could the single document uniqueness be added please.
2. Could a document unique prefix be considered for integration
   to facilitate the above use case.
