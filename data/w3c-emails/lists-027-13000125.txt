It's not a 100% clear from the spec what should happen when a DTD or 
schema fails to declare xml:id as having type ID.  On careful reading 
between the lines, I think it true that in that case xml:id is not 
recognized as an ID attribute because the  [attribute type] property 
or [type definition] property would not be ID.

However, I think the draft needs an explicit statement that processes 
should recognize IDs solely by these properties, and *not* by the 
name of the attribute (assuming my exegesis is correct).
