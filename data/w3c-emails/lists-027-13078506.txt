  I don't see any conflict between the spec as written and the behaviour
you suggest. Sure those are "like" validity errors, they don't destroy the
Infoset passed, in the worse case you get an error message from the
xml:id layer and no addition to the Infoset.

  I think "should" carry the flexibility potential you ask for. Maybe
that can be changed as
   'should at the user option report the error to the application.'
though I prefer the idea that by default such error be reported.

  I think I understood your point. You're saying "xml:id can't be applied"
to such document and I'm answering ""xml:id is not defined" for it. That
doesn't mean it can't be applied. Trying to define xml:id without an Infoset
sounds a far more difficult than useful exercise since the semantic of xml:id
for such document can be derived from the semantic in the case of document
with an Infoset.
  Similary XInclude is not formerly defined when such a document is included.
I don't think that prevent implementations from working with them.
