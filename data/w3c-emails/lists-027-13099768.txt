Section 4.3 states:

A processor that does neither DTD nor XML Schema validation must 
report xml:id attributes found in documents using [XML Information 
Set] properties, assuming the following condition:

     * The attribute value must be a valid NCName.
     * No other xml:id attribute with the same attribute value has 
been found earlier in the document.

If those conditions are not satisfied then the processor should 
report the error to the application.

This section then goes on to describe what happens when these 
conditions (unique NCName) are satisfied. However, it says nothing 
about what happens when the condition fail other than an error is 
reported. Suppose this is a non-fatal error (as indeed I think it 
should be). Then how does a processor that does neither DTD nor XML 
Schema validation report the xml:id attribute? Does it give it the ID 
type or not? The behavior on this branch needs to be spelled out.
