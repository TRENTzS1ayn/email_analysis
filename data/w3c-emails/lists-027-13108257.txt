  Yes, I think that is one point Eric van Der Vlist also asked for
clarification, my take on this is that the ID type is not set in
the XML Infoset.
  This also relate to the Issue (id-strictness), in the sense that
a non-validating XML processor would act differently with an ID
attribute declared in the parsed part of the DTD. So we are looking
for feedback on what the community think should happen if the
conditions are not satisfied. I'm in the camp of being strict since
those are new documents, so this should not break existing use, but
this is an open issue.
