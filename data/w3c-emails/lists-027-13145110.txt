Hi

Regarding

http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xml-id-20040407/#IDAQVQRB
:
"XPath 2.0: No change required. The id() function recognizes both DTD-
and Schema-declared identifiers, and as such would also recognize
xml:id attributes identified with a minimally conforming schema
processor."

Scenario:

I receive an XML document which includes xml:ids, and neither contains
any (DTD, WXS) internal subset nor does it reference a DTD or XSD or
any other schema instance which modifies it (I might validate it with
Relax NG).

I process the doc using a fully conforming Basic XSLT Processor [1]
which thusly is not schema-aware.

id() [2] should return element nodes with matching xml:id value.
AFAICS this requires a change/addition to XPath 2.0 [3] (currently in
last call), but I might miss something.
