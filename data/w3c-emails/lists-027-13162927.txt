The XPath 2 guys might answer that.

So in the scenario I describe, id('foo') would return the element with
xml:id="foo"? That would be great (especially since I think the main
advantage of xml:id will be to have IDs without relying on any schema
code (neither external nor internal) or any specific schema language).

I don't really know, in this specific case I'm merely a user
describing a scenario and an expectation.

If coordination is required then last call seems to be a good period
for you xml:id guys to work this out with the XPath/XSLT people.

I thought it's different (XPath 1 was diff IIRC), but can't remember;
and don't forget that at least one type of conforming XSLT 2 processor
is not schema-aware.

If that's the case then additional specification and clarification is
needed as well.

I think it's reasonable to expect id() to return elements with
matching xml:id values (as it does for attributes which are defined
(eg in an internal DTD subset) to be IDs), this should get specified
somewhere.
