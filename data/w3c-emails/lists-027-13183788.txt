A brief discussion of the new draft by the CSS working group led to
the following two comments:

1. It seems unclear what the processing of xml:id should be in the
presence of Schemas or DTDs that do not specify that xml:id is of type
ID. Is that an error? Or do you end up with a case where an element has
one id in a validating parser scenario and another in a non-validating
parser scenario?

2. We think the test suite for this specification should include tests
that check that CSS UAs support xml:id interoperably.

Hopefully these comments will be of help for the next version of the
draft.



For the CSS WG,
Bert
