For TS17, the problem statement is:

Character reference appear in the output file instead of a space

The input is:

<!DOCTYPE doc [
<!ELEMENT doc (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST doc a CDATA #IMPLIED>
]>
<doc a="x&#9;y"></doc>

And the output is:

<doc a="x&#9;y"></doc>

(Two other tests are the same expect for character refs to LF and
 CR instead of TAB)

I see no reason to accept the problem statement and believe that
the current test is correct.

Glenn
