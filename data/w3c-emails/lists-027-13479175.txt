All,

         We found the original version of these tests and they do are 
identical except for the line ends, therefore I propose putting this issue 
under countdown, until April 17,  for the  proposed resolution.

Cordially,

Sandra

Not sure what this is referring to, unless it is just another simple 
problem with EOL handling w.r.t. CVS. If there is a "historical" version of 
these files, say from an earlier release of the suite, that was identical 
except for line ends, I would agree that we should not be arbrarily 
changing such files. Regards, Glenn
