Hi Steve,

First, let me point you to the latest version of the test
suite.  We have recently released, through the W3C
XML Core WG, the latest version.  It is available
from

    http://www.w3.org/XML/Test/

There is also a public discussion list that I encourage
you to join, and participate in discussions of the test
suite.  You are correct in pointing out that there are
some holes in the test suite.  It was developed through
contributions from a variety of sources.  We have
been focused on resolving issues in the current test
suite, rather than trying to ensure adequate coverage
in all areas of the Recommendation.  If you have some
tests to contribute, or would like to write some tests
in this area, please, by all means, do so.  All pertinent
information on participating in this process is available
from the web page.

Thanks,

Mary
