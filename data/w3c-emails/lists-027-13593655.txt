I have long thought the SAX API is broken in this regard.

Unless we want to change the Infoset spec and break the
ability to do proper catalog resolution, I think we should
leave things as is and have a note that says that people who 
use a tool that uses the broken SAX API will get different
results.  And we should tell the Xerces folks that their
parser is broken.  After all, that is what a test suite
is for, isn't it?
