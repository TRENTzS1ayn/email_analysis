It seems the following test-cases are not mentioned
in the documentation (didn't check for more):

xmltest/not-wf/not-sa/010.xml,
xmltest/not-wf/not-sa/011.xml and 
sun/not-wf/not-sa03.xml.

Question:
xmltest/not-wf/not-sa/010.xml and xmltest/not-wf/not-sa/011.xml
seem to check "Validity Constraint: Proper Declaration/PE Nesting" (P29).
So, why are they found in the directory for test cases that
check violation of *wellformedness* constraints?

An analog question also applies to xmltest/not-wf/not-sa/005.xml,
where the docs actually state explicitly that it checks for
violation of validity constraint "Entity Declared VC".
