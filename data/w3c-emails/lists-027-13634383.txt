I recently downloaded the latest conformance test suite to test the ElCel
XML parser, and it disagrees with the conformance tests for the following
cases:-

sun/not-wf/not-sa03.xml
ibm/not-wf/P32/ibm32n09.xml
ibm/not-wf/P68/ibm68n06.xml

In each case, the xml document is declared standalone, but it references an
external DTD subset which contains a referenced entity declaration.  The
latest conformance suite categorizes these as "not-wf" errors, which is
puzzling.  The last time I downloaded these tests, they were categorized
differently.

Since when has a standalone="yes" declaration meant that external entities
*must* not be read?
