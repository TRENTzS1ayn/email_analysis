I have been experimenting with this a little further, and I think I've
devised a test case that pinpoints the VC: Standalone Document:

<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>
<!DOCTYPE test [
<!ELEMENT test EMPTY>
<!ENTITY % pe "
       <!ENTITY x 'x'>
       <!ATTLIST test foo CDATA '&x;'>
" >
%pe;
]>
<test foo='x'/>

Do you agree this test file is
a) well-formed
b) invalid, for the only reason that the default value for parameter foo
refers to &x; which is 'externally' declared.
