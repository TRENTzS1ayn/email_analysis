[I am sending this mail again because it has not appeared in the archives - sorry if its a duplicate]

The canonical output for test ibm/valid/P02/ibm02v01 contains an empty line after the PI name:

<?NAME_09- _0A-

_0D-

But the input contains only one <CRLF> between the "_0A-" and the "_0D-".
Is this an error in the test suite or am I missing something?
