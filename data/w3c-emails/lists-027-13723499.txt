[I am sending this mail again because it hasn't appeared in the archives -
sorry if its a duplicate]

The canonical output for test ibm/valid/P02/ibm02v01 contains an empty line
after the PI name:

<?NAME_09- _0A-

_0D-

But the input contains only one <CRLF> between the "_0A-" and the "_0D-".
Is this an error in the test suite or am I missing something?
