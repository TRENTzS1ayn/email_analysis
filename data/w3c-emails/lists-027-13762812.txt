The control file ibm_oasis_valid.xml does not list an output file for 
this test,
probably because of this issue.  The inclusion of the file in the test 
suite is
therefore a mistake.

I notice that the input file seems to have had its line ends normalized at
some point, which rather defeats its purpose.
