We were assuming (perhaps wrongly) that the ibm control file was simply
incomplete because the OUTPUT attribute is also missing for the following
tests which appear to have valid canonical output files:

ibm/valid/P03/ibm03v01.xml
ibm/valid/P54/ibm54v01.xml
ibm/valid/P79/ibm79v01.xml
ibm/valid/P85/ibm85v01.xml
ibm/valid/P86/ibm86v01.xml
ibm/valid/P87/ibm87v01.xml
ibm/valid/P88/ibm88v01.xml
ibm/valid/P89/ibm89v01.xml

Would it be possible to get the input file restored and the control file
entry re-instated?
