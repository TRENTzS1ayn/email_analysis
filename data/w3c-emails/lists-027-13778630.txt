You are right.

I cannot access this link - it requires a member login.

Without having read your link above, I would say that a non-validating
processor should not report VC violations as errors.
I am not sure what you mean with "unrecoverable entity reference
in attribute value", but there is no such reference in
xmltest/not-wf/not-sa/005.xml, and this test case does not violate
WFC: Entity Declared. So, for a non-validating processor,
how could it report an error there?

Could you make the link above public?

Thanks,
