All changes have been committed to the test files.  We 
are still working on the report, but would like to make the 
tests themselves available for comment from the WG.  
Last time, we created zip and tar archives and made 
them available in the cvs repository.  Should we do this 
again, or do you want to make them available from 
either the W3C or NIST web server?
