Well, it still seems to be not quite there...

1)  The sun/valid/out/optional.xml file needs to not end with
    a line break for the expected results comparison to work.
    This was either added by sending it as an attachment or
    introduced by a text editor, or perhaps even CVS, but the
    correct contents do not end with a line break.

2) The sun invalid test descriptions still reference the file
   sun/invalid/not-sa03.xml, which is now a not-wf test.  The
   reference needs to be moved/removed as appropriate.

3) The ibm-valid-P02-ibm02v01.xml file is still referenced
   as a not-wf test despite being well-formed.  As I mentioned
   in my previous note:

  "This file had been corrupted, see TS09 and TS13, but seems
  to have been fixed now.  The test description needs to be
  changed back.

diff -r xmlconf_orig/ibm/ibm_oasis_valid.xml
xmlconf/ibm/ibm_oasis_valid.xml
29,30c29,31
<   <TEST URI="valid/P02/ibm02v01.xml" TYPE="not-wf" ID

middle - for

Otherwise, things look okay.

Best Regards,
Glenn
