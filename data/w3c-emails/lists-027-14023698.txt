One thing that I should have mentioned is that SAX is certainly
inconsistant with the Infoset specification on this point given
this description from Notation information item:

  2. [system identifier] The system identifier of the notation,
     as it appears in the declaration of the notation, without
     any additional URI escaping applied by the processor. If
     no system identifier was specified, this property has no
     value.

However, if most people are testing conformance using the SAX
API and the SAX implementations are "correct" then we cannot
get the correct infoset to test expected results conformance.

One idea that came to me would be to add a new attribute to
the test suite descriptions similar to NAMESPACE that could
be used by a SAX based test harness to identify those tests
that cannot be compared with the expected output.

Best Regards,
Glenn
