The definition of the canonical forms (sun/cxml.html) specifies that
the shortest possible relative URI should be output.  This is
inconsistent with the infoset - which is the way it is to allow for
catalogues and redirection - but should be easily derivable from the
value SAX returns.

Why is this a problem now?  Surely the test harnesses must have made this
work in earlier releases?
