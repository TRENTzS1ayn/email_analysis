Sorry I didn't have time to look at this earlier.  I hope I'm looking
at the current version!

The tar file link on http://www.w3.org/XML/Test/ points to
http://www.w3.org/XML/Test/xmlts052102.tar, but there are only .zip
and .tgz versions.  When I downloaded the .tgz version, I got an
uncompressed tar file.

The name xmlts052102 contains a horrible US-style mixed up date.
Please change it to 20020521 or something.

Also, it would be better if the tar archive contained a single top-level
directory - i.e. if it was created from one level up.  Otherwise you
get 9 files and directories when you unpack it.

ibm-not-wf-P28a-ibm28an01.xml and ibm-not-wf-P32-ibm32n09.xml have
output tests even though they are not well-formed.

The output files for ibm-valid-P28-ibm28v02.xml,
ibm-valid-P29-ibm29v01.xml, and ibm-valid-P29-ibm29v02.xml
have PIs before the doctype, contrary to the canonical form definition.
