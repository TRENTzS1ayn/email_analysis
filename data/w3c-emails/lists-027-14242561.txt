I've fixed the following files in the test suite:



These files go into the 2001/XML-Test-Suite/xmlconf/ibm/xml-1.1
directory.  They fix the ID="..." attributes to be unique.

I've also added an xml:base Attlist decl for the TESTCASES
element to the top-level testcases.dtd file:



The only other validity failure in the testsuite descriptions
is that the eduni/errata-2e/errata2e.xml file contains
RECOMMENDATION="XML1.0-errata2e" attributes, which is not one
of the defined values.  I leave this to Richard to resolve.


Regards,
Glenn
