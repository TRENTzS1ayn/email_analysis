The attached zip contains our contribution of XML 1.1 test cases (W3C
Candidate Recommendation 15 October 2002) to the XML TS framework.
Note:  Test case coverage does not include tests for section 2.13 of the
specification, output test coverage is minimal (no output testing of
control characters) and the test cases, valid/P03/out/ibm03v08,
ibm03v09.xml contain control characters in their XMLDecl and TextDecl and
so are probably debatable.

Cheers!
Neil
