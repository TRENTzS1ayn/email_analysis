Sandra,

Here are some of the updates for the IBM 1.1 test contributions.  Can you 
update
these in CVS and I'll work on the remaining issues.

Appologies for the problems.  The tests were written a while back, things 
changed,
comments were not updated properly, etc.  Anyways here are some comments.

(1) ibm-valid-P02-ibm02v01.xml
The UTF-8 code for LSEP (2028) in this file seems to be wrong.
I believe it should be e2 80 a8, the file has e0 9f ac which is
a non-shortest UTF-8 sequence for something else.

[GM] Agree, a typo, the byte sequence corresponds to the character #x7EC 
and
should be changed to e2 80 a8, but its still a valid document. 


(2)ibm-valid-P02-ibm02v04.xml & 
(3)ibm-valid-P03-ibm03v08.xml
 
[GM] Tests that were originally added for clarifications (are NEL & LESP 
in S)
and are no longer valid.  Updated tests are attached above.


(4) ibm-valid-P04-ibm04v01.xml, ibm-valid-P05-ibm05v01.xml,
    ibm-valid-P05-ibm05v02.xml, ibm-valid-P05-ibm05v03.xml,
    ibm-valid-P05-ibm05v05.xml
These contain names that use colons in ways not allowed by namespaces,
so they need NAMESPACE="no" in the config file.
(5) ibm-valid-P05-ibm05v05.xml
...

[GM] Agree, the config file will have to be modified as suggested.
We treat these as namespaces="no" in our suite though.


(6) ibm-valid-P03-ibm03v*.xml
[GM] Agree.


(7) ibm-valid-P46-ibm46i01.xml, ibm-valid-P46-ibm46i02.xml
[GM] Similar to (2) (3), agree the comment now needs to be changed.


(8) ibm-not-wf-P02-ibm02n09.xml
[GM]Agree, updated test attached.




(9) ibm-not-wf-P02-ibm02n0??.xml
[GM] Agree, the file names mentioned above need to be fixed in the
configuration file.


(10) ibm-not-wf-P02-ibm02n10.xml
This file is supposed to contain "control character 0x100".  But 100 is
not a control character, and in fact the file contains a non-shortest 
UTF-8
sequence.

[GM] Attached a modified test case, the comment in the config file will
have to be updated.



(11) ibm-not-wf-P02-ibm02n13.xml
This file is supposed to contain "control character 0x0D" which would
be legal, but in fact contains control-A.  (Mabe all the tests
corresponding to legal control characters have been messed up?)

[GM] Attached a modified test case, the comment in the config file will
have to be updated.




(12) ibm-not-wf-P02-ibm02n38.xml
This file is supposed to contain "control character 0x86" but in fact
contains 82.  Probably this is because it's between 84 and a real 86,
and 85 is NEL.

[GM] This test contains a embeded control characters x82, x83 and x84.
The comment in the configuration file needs to be updated.


(13) ibm-not-wf-P02-ibm02n58.xml
This file is supposed to contain "control character 0x99" but in fact
contains a non-shortest UTF-8 sequence.

[GM] Attached updated test 


(15) ibm-not-wf-P04-ibm04n2[1-4].xml ibm-not-wf-P04a-ibm04an2[1-4].xml
These are supposed to have bogus surrogates, but instead have question
marks.
[GM] Agree, the characters somehow got messed up.  I have attached fixed
tests.






(16) ibm-not-wf-P04a-ibm04an0[1-3].xml, ibm-not-wf-P04a-ibm04an1[1-2].xml
These don't have the characters they are claimed to, probably a UTF-8
screwup.

[GM] Agree, Incorrect comments, they should have been 
ibm-not-wf-P04a-ibm04an0[1-3].xml - #xB8, #0xA1 and #0xAF
ibm-not-wf-P04a-ibm04an1[1-2].xml - #0x203D and #0x2041


(17) ibm-not-wf-P04a-ibm04an17.xml, ibm-not-wf-P04a-ibm04an18.xml
Test for 2edc and 2fed which are in fact legal.

[GM] Agree, Incorrect comments, they should have been #x2BDC and #x2A30


(18) ibm-not-wf-P05-ibm05n02.xml
Purports to test for illegal name char 300, but actually has 3000
which is also illegal.

[GM] Agree, test case with illegal name char x300 attached.




(19) ibm-not-wf-P77-ibm77n13.xml
This doesn't test what it claims to; it is not-wf because the document
entity is 1.0 and an external entity is 1.1.

[GM] Agree, the comment needs to be corrected.

That's all for now.

Thanks,
Glenn
