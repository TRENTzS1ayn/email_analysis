I am no expert on Unicode, but have sometimes the need to understand it.
According to table 3.1B of Unicode 3.2, the sequence e0 9f ac is not
a valid UTF-8 sequence. That much I understand. At this point I was assuming
that this table allows one to check valid/shortest sequences.

Now, this confuses me. The UTF-8 table allows this sequence, but it cannot
map to 7EC, but must map to somewhere in the range 1000 to CFFF.
So, is it now a sequence for 7EC, and if yes, where am I wrong?
