Hi,

I have found some problems with the test suite in CVS.

These problems fall into two categories.  First, some of the tests
that reference external parameter entities (or the external DTD
subset) do not indicate so in their description.  Second, there
are several tests that use either US-ASCII or ISO-8859-1 encodings
which are not required by minimally conforming processors.  In all
but one case this only required changing the encoding declaration
to UTF-8.  I have included a copy of the entire file for the one
case where the data had to be reencoded in UTF-8 from ISO-8859-1.

It would be great if you could pick these changes up so that I
can resume testing with an official unmodified version of the
test suite and no longer need maintain these changes locally.

Best Regards,
Glenn
