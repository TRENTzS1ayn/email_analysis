Regarding the test cases xmltest/valid/sa/049.xml, 050.xml and 051.xml:
(as in current CVS)

It appears that these files are encoded with a mix of UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE.
Expat, AElfred and MSXML all complain about invalid characters.
The byte order switch seems to take place between the DOCTYPE declaration
and the root element.

Regards,

Karl
