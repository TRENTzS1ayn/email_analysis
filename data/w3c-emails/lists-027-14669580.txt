1) Test case japanese\pr-xml-little-endian.xml:

AElfred, Expat and MSXML compain about this document.
Right after the XML declaration there is a sequence (hex): 0x0d 0x0a 0x00 0x0d 0x0a 0x00
Should that not be 0x0d 0x00 0x0a 0x00 0x0d 0x00 0x0a 0x00 ?
Expat and MSXML complain about line 1, column 22, but maybe only because
they assume it is UTF-8 since there is no encoding declaration.
A separate Unicode checker I am using complains about a low surrogate
0xdd30 without a high surrogate further down, when I tell it to check for UTF-16.

2) Test case japanese\pr-xml-utf-16.xml:

Very similar to the first case - document is in UTF-16, big endian.
Expat and MSXML complain about line2, column 0.
The sequence right after the XML declaration is: 0x00 0x0d 0x0a 0x00 0x0d 0x0a 0x00 0x3c
A separate Unicode checker I am using complains about a low surrogate
0xdd30 without a high surrogate further down, when I tell it to check for UTF-16.

3) Test case japanese\weekly-little-endian:
4) Test case japanese\weekly-utf-16.xml/dtd:

Basically the same as 1) and 2). Also fail the Unicode checker in similar ways.

Karl
