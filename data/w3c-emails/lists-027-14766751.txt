On this one -- I would proceed with Richard's recommendation of marking all 
the files in the XML TS CVS repository to binary, but I am not sure of the 
right command to do this, can someone provide it?
There is an option  (-kb) that is used with the add command when adding 
binary files to turn off both keyword expansion and line-ending conversion. 
We are not adding binary files, we want to mark the current text files as 
binary to turn off the line-ending conversion that is causing these problems.
