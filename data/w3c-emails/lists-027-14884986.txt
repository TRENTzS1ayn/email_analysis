Concerning test: xmlconf/xmltest/not-wf/sa/128.xml

The test document is:
[[
<!DOCTYPE doc [
<!ELEMENT doc CDATA>
]>
<doc></doc>
]]

The report [1] claims that this tests "Invalid CDATA syntax", at section 
2.7 rule [18], but as far as I can tell, the data has nothing to do with 
this test.  Rather, it appears to be a syntactic match including production 
rule [48] (section 3.2.1 of [2]).  The only problem I see with the test 
document is that the element CDATA is not declared in the content model 
description given, but I can't find a well-formedness constraint covering this.

Am I missing something here?
