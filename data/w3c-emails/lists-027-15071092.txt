I agree. However, the global pool of information must be communicated using
some technology. If we, as the people who have enough collective knowledge
to thrash out these issues, do not lay the correct foundations and isolate
the users from any complex mechanics, then we are going to loose the play.
They simply will not adopt our new technology.
