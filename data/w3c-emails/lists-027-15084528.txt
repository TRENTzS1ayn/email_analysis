The word mechanics reminds me of the interplay between "statistical
mechanics" and thermodynamics. The first describes phenomena on the
micro level and the second on the macro level. Small scale bits like
XML/RDF are the substrate of any scheme to build a semantic level.

In reality, I cannot see how an idea such as "user driven semantics"
would work in terms of how RDF evolves.

And Great store was put in LISP and Prolog to build AI systems.
