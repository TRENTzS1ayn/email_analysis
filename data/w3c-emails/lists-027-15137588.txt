Too late for that. The web is now a commercial playground, not a
research "sandbox". All website built for commercial organisations and
many others (such http://www.bbc.co.uk/) are governed by people who
are not interested in creating shared space. They just want to keep
you in their domain or in the case of portals click through to
controlled set of websites.
