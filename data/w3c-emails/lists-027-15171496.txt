Jakob Nielsen shows that both "page requests" (for a site such as
http://www.sun.com/) follow the Zipf law. He states (on the site you gave,
http://www.useit.com/alertbox/zipf.html)

"The figure shows incoming page-requests to a single site. Other
studies have found that Zipf curves characterize the outgoing page
requests from the employees of an organization (there are a few pages
that everybody look at and a large number of pages that are seen only
once)."

So the law applies for "page popularity" plotted against "hits per
month" (his terminology).

Yes, to convince them. But like HTML (the well know computer virus),
inertia rules.

Did PNG take off like a rocket? Answer - no. And that was a very
simple in comparison.

Gordo.
