Let me propose the glass-is-half-empty scenario, which I think to be much
more likely: network effects also prevent systems from being adopted.  If
ABCNews.com were to *not* support a semantic standard, then I now have
more of an excuse to *not* spend all that time supporting this standard on
my own site. I think the right way to view the PNG situation is that it
didn't take off like a rocket *despite* having no nework inertia to hold
it down.  This causes Luke's First Law :-), namely quality is inversely
proportional to popularity.

I imagine the only realistic way to get a semantic standard accepted is
through standards hegemony.  It's nice to see W3C behind it, but I don't
think it's a sufficient hegemon.  Microsoft probably is, assuming they
decide to actually go full-bore with RDF (or whatnot).  This is made even
tougher by the fact that I have yet to see a killer application for RDF
with regard to the average joe (or Joe Business) on the web.  Lots of
nifty applications.  But no *killer* application, without which it may be
difficult to justify the infrastructure expenditure.
