Dear Mr. Berners-Lee,
Recently there has been some discussion about the Semantic Web, amongst Web
developers. The problem is that although your initial ideas, for example in
"Weaving the Web" are well grounded and very interesting, there is still no
real outline of "The Semantic Web" on the WWW, other than your 'Design
Issues' series of notes.
I think it would greatly help us if you would issue a little more material
on this, or at least start discussions on semantic-web@w3.org (to which this
mail is CC'd).
Maybe then, some of the 'interested developers' could start publishing our
own material and thoughts on the subject, which is mainly about where the
WWW comes from, and where it's heading...

As I see it, we are talking about a fully machine processable Web
environment; but one that is self-describing, easily searchable, and
ultimately dynamic.
Hopefully I am somewhere close to the mark here with this outline, but a
more official word would be greatly appreciated.

Kindest Regards,
Sean B. Palmer
