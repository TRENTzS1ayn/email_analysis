Subject: Semantic Web Outline


> Dear Mr. Berners-Lee,
> Recently there has been some discussion about the Semantic Web, amongst
Web
> developers. The problem is that although your initial ideas, for example
in
> "Weaving the Web" are well grounded and very interesting, there is still
no
> real outline of "The Semantic Web" on the WWW, other than your 'Design
> Issues' series of notes.
> I think it would greatly help us if you would issue a little more material
> on this, or at least start discussions on semantic-web@w3.org (to which
this
> mail is CC'd).
> Maybe then, some of the 'interested developers' could start publishing our
> own material and thoughts on the subject, which is mainly about where the
> WWW comes from, and where it's heading...
>
> As I see it, we are talking about a fully machine processable Web
> environment; but one that is self-describing, easily searchable, and
> ultimately dynamic.
> Hopefully I am somewhere close to the mark here with this outline, but a
> more official word would be greatly appreciated.
