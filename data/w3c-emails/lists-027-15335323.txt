Benny,

Semantic Web certainly includes meta web.  However, I believe it
is more than the meta data in an important way:

The "meata data" needs to be associated with an ontology. 
    In another word, the meaning and the interpretation of the meta
    data depends on the context (i.e., the associated ontology) rather than
    being universal.

>I have seen a lot of prospect explanations on what the Semantic Web actually 
is, but none of them does answer the question in a way that I'm looking for. Of 
course, it is not an easy question to answer. But, as I'm only into theoretical 
datology, I'm looking for a simple answer to a difficult question that's right 
up my alley.

>I'm looking for an answer that is similar (in certain ways) to the answer of 
what the Web is. I answer the question of what the Web is with the answer: the 
URI-space. (Not if my dad ask, but in my head) The answer to the SW question I'm 
looking for is not to make it easier for a layperson to grasp the Semantic Web, 
it only to satisfy my own thoughts.

>Now to the "meta" part. If we attach metadata to a resource, it becomes in some 
sense easier for a machine to locate and use that resource (e.g. if the resource 
only contains natural language scribbling). Now, IMHO, the Semantic Web is a Web 
of metadata (+logic) that is intended to make it easier for machines (and us 
indirectly - but first and foremost) to locate and use resources on the Web. 
Thus, would it be wrong to call the Semantic Web a metaweb? The SW would then be 
a machine useable web (filled with machine understandable metadata pointing at 
web resources) about the web. Of course, the metaweb is also a web (just like 
metadata could be data), and they exist in the same space - though at different 
levels of abstractions.

Note, there is a few loopholes that I'm not getting into right now (to not take 
to much of your time), perhaps these will come up if this is further discussed.
