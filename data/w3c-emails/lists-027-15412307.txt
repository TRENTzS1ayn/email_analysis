Simile/metaphor/sarcasm/humor/irony/+ are basic problems for machines 
because they are deliberately inflicted with the "disability" of 
"semantic/pragmatic" or taking things literally. *How* it's "raining" 
(whether "cats & dogs" or "a cow pissing on a flat rock") is an example of 
the poor computer girding its defenses for animal attacks when flooding is 
the potential problem.
