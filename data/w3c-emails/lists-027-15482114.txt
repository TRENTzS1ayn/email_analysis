# This is a short test of an TimBL idea about using email Message-ID's 
# as a namespace. He said that the mail being sent should include RDF 
# (in either XML or N3 form) about the properties being declared. If 
# you haven't already guessed, this is in Notation3! c.f. 
# http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer.html It just reasserts some 
# FOAF stuff (for now).

# That's it. Oh, it also needs some information in N3 about

# Ta-da! I hope there aren't any mistakes... Now I can try to work 
# out what the Message-ID URI is, and use that as the namespace 
# for the classes/properties declared in this email...
