Dear All,
the CC/PP Structure and Vocabularies specification has been published as

a Last Call Working Draft at http://www.w3.org/TR/CCPP-struct-vocab/.
The working group feels that we have now progressed this specification
as far as we can, that it is stable, workable and implementable, and
that it is ready to be used.

We would apprieciate your review comments. Please send them to
www-mobile@w3.org before April 5, 2001, to be considered.

If the review comments are positive, we intend to proceed with the
process of making this a W3C Recommendation.

Note that as per our charter, this document only includes the data
structure. Further work to cover open items (such as protocol issues)
will require a rechartering of the group.

Thank you!

Johan Hjelm
