The Research Group WIM at FZI (Research Center of
Information Technologies at the University of Karlsruhe)
seeks applicants for a

         Ph.D. Position

available for the EU-IST funded project SWWS (Semantic
Web Enabled Web Services). Further information about the project is
available at http://wim.fzi.de/wim/new_projects/#swws.
Project start is September 2002.

The prospective student is expected to hold a master's
degree or equivalent degree (e.g. German diploma).
The salary amounts to German BAT IIa (which is roughly
35.000 Euro gross income per year depending on age and
marital status). Basic knowledge about the German language
is a prerequisite.

The project will address the development of a system 
that applies semantic web technology for web service 
discovery, configuration, comparison, and combination. 
In essence, the projects ultimate goal is the development
of methods and tools to establish intelligent services
on the Web via combining Web Service technology with 
Semantic Web technology (ontologies, metadata, etc.). 
The projects application domain is E-Business.
