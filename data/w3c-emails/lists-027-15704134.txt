"SHARING THE KNOWLEDGE"

International CIDOC CRM Symposium
March 26 2003 2:00 - 6:00
March 27 2003 9:00 - 5:00

The CIDOC CRM Special Interest Group  and the Smithsonian Institution invite you to a
two-day International Symposium designed to bring together researchers and practitioners
in information provision and exchange, be it within organizations or on the envisaged
Semantic Web, in the area of scientific and cultural heritage, with the goal to present
and discuss technical, organizational, and philosophical issues of effectively sharing
knowledge among museums, libraries, and archives and integrating information within
cultural institutions.

The program will comprise invited talks, submitted papers, and panel discussions.
Paper submissions are welcome on the following topics:
- scalable knowledge sharing architectures for intra-organizational data;
- scalable knowledge sharing architectures for the Internet;
- key components for knowledge sharing: ontologies, contextual information,
     identification, persistence;
- documentation practices enabling effective knowledge sharing;
- metadata schemes for cross-domain searching;
- success stories of knowledge sharing;
- social, organizational, and technical factors;
- the role of trust in knowledge sharing.

A panel discussion will identify key directions for research and advocacy for the
immediate future to bring us closer to shared and integrated knowledge in contemporary
society.

All contributions will be Web-published on the CIDOC CRM Web-site (http://cidoc.ics.forth.gr).
Presentations may be 15 minutes or 30 minutes.
The Program committee reserves the right to refuse submissions.
Proposals, accompanied by an abstract of 100-300 words, and short cv, should be sent to
Dr. Martin Doerr,
martin@ics.fort.gr

        by November 30, 2002.
