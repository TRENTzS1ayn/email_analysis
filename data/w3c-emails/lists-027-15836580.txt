              The First International Workshop on
 "Socio-cognitive Grids: The Net as a Universal Human Resource"
http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~kostas/sc-grids/cfp.html

Oscar de Bruijn and Kostas Stathis (co-chairs)

to be held at the 
   TALES of the Disappearing Computer
    Santorini, Greece, 1-4 June 2003

A socio-cognitive grid is a complex system offering an environment that
people can use for the successful and efficient execution of their everyday
activities. Much like an electrical grid that provides the power for
electrical devices to operate, a socio-cognitive grid provides cognitive and
social resources that people can access on electronic devices in support of
common activities such as shopping and socialising. Cognitive resources are
needed when people engage in complex cognitive activities such as
navigation, remembering and problem solving. Social resources are needed
when people are engaged in social activities such as interacting with other
members of a local community or finding recommendations for local
restaurants.

To develop technologies that support people's everyday activities, the
research strategy proposed is to build socio-cognitive grids, which will
transform the Net (existing internetworking and Web technologies) into a
human resource that is accessible by anyone at anytime and anywhere. For
this purpose socio-cognitive grids will need to offer ubiquitous mechanisms
for accessing, intelligent techniques for managing, and secure channels for
delivering cognitive and social resources.
