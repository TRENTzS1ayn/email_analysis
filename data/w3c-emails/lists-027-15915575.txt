Hi everyone,

"Big Fractal Tangle" is a new weblog containing "daily reflections on 
the ongoing evolution of the Semantic Web."

http://bigfractaltangle.com

Besides the usual blather, I'll be writing more formal reviews of 
real-world right-now examples of Semantic Web technology in the "Tangle 
Yarns" section, so if you'd like to be considered for a writeup, send 
me an email with a link to your project.

Also, as I'm trying to build a readership, please consider linking to 
my site.

Thanks,

Timothy Falconer
