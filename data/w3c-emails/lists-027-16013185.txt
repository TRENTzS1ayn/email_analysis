Announcing the newly issued U.S. patent 
concerning ethical artificial intelligence entitled: 
Inductive Inference Affective Language Analyzer 
Simulating Artificial Intelligence (patent No. 6,587,846)
by inventor/author John E. LaMuth M. S. - issued 7/1/2003. 
As implied in its title, this innovation is the 1st affect-
ive language analyzer incorporating ethical/motivational 
terms, serving in the role of interactive computer 
interface. It enables a computer to reason and speak in an 
ethical fashion, serving in roles specifying sound human 
judgement: such as public relations or security functions. 
This innovation is formally based on a multi-level 
hierarchy of the traditional groupings of virtues, values,
and ideals, collectively arranged as subsets within a 
hierarchy of metaperspectives - as partially depicted below.

Glory--Prudence          Honor--Justice 
Providence--Faith        Liberty--Hope
Grace--Beauty             Free-will--Truth
Tranquility--Ecstasy     Equality--Bliss

Dignity--Temperance     Integrity--Fortitude
Civility--Charity            Austerity--Decency 
Magnanim.--Goodness    Equanimity--Wisdom
Love--Joy                      Peace--Harmony

The systematic organization underlying this ethical 
hierarchy allows for extreme efficiency in programming, 
eliminating much of the associated redundancy, providing 
a precise determination of motivational parameters at 
issue during a given verbal interchange. 
This AI platform is organized as a tandem-nested expert 
system, composed of a primary affective-language analyzer 
overseen by a master control-unit (that coordinates the 
verbal interactions over real time). Through an elaborate 
matching procedure, the precise motivational parameters 
are accurately determined (defined as the passive-monitoring 
mode). This basic determination, in turn, serves as the 
basis for a response repertoire tailored to the computer
(the true AI simulation mode). This innovation is completely
novel in its ability to simulate emotionally charged language: 
an achievement that has previously eluded AI researchers due 
to the lack of an adequate model of motivation in general. 
As such, it represents a pure language simulation, effectively
bypassing many of the limitations plaguing current robotic 
research. Affiliated potential applications extend to the 
roles of switchboard/receptionist and personal 
assistant/companion (in a time-share mode).
