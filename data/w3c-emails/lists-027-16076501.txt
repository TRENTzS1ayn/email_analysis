    10th International Workshop on 
       KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION MEETS DATABASES
      (KRDB-2003)

               http://lat.inf.tu-dresden.de/KRDB-2003/

Hamburg (Germany), September 15-18, 2003

                            With a focus on:
                 Knowledge Representation and Databases 
                          for the Semantic Web

In conjunction with:
      KI 2003 (26th German Conference on Artificial Intelligence)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

----------- Call for papers

The 10th International KRDB Workshop continues the tradition of annual
international workshops devoted to facilitate cross-fertilization
between the fields of knowledge representation (KR) and databases (DB),
started in 1994. KRDB-2003 will be held in Hamburg (Germany), 
September 2003, as a workshop of the 26th German Conference on
Artificial Intelligence (KI-2003), see http://www.ki2003.de/.

KRDB is a forum for exchanging ideas between DB and KR researchers. 
Equally important is the KRDB tradition of stimulating the discussion
between researchers and practitioners. As every year, KRDB 2003 
focusses on a selected topic.

  
----------- Topic

Databases have always been a very important issue for the World Wide
Web, and, conversely, the WWW has stimulated interesting research on
databases, for example in the area of semi-structured data. Due to the
recent and immense interest in the semantic web initiative, knowledge
representation has also gained a considerable amount of attention by
the WWW community, and the pollinating impact of this fact on research
in knowledge representation is already clearly visible. For these
reasons, the focus of KRDB-2003 is on 

    Knowledge Representation and Databases for the World-Wide Web.

For the workshop, we thus solicit contributions that address the
interplay between knowledge representation and databases, particularly
in contexts related to the World-Wide Web. Specific issues we would
like to discuss are:

 * Languages and techniques required to support a semantic web
 * Construction and maintenance of large ontologies for use in the WWW
 * Web service modeling and declarative web service retrieval
 * Context adaption, user models, and adaptive web systems
 * Query languages for the Web and semi-structured data
 * Data modeling and typing for XML and semi-structured data

We also solicit submissions that concern the relationship of knowledge
representation and databases, but do not fall inside this year's
selected topic.
