               The First International Workshop on
  "Socio-cognitive Grids: The Net as a Universal Human Resource"
         http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~kostas/sc-grids/cfp.html

         Oscar de Bruijn and Kostas Stathis (co-chairs)

                   to be held at the
             TALES of the Disappearing Computer
              Santorini, Greece, 1-4 June 2003
          (http://ilios.cti.gr/DCTales/aims.asp)


A socio-cognitive grid is a complex system offering an environment
that people can use for the successful and efficient execution of
their everyday activities. Much like an electrical grid that
provides the power for electrical devices to operate, a
socio-cognitive grid provides cognitive and social resources that
people can access on electronic devices in support of common
activities such as shopping and socialising. Cognitive resources
are needed when people engage in complex cognitive activities such
as navigation, remembering and problem solving. Social resources
are needed when people are engaged in social activities such as
interacting with other members of a local community or finding
recommendations for local restaurants.

To develop technologies that support people's everyday activities,
the research strategy proposed is to build socio-cognitive grids,
which will transform the Net (existing internetworking and Web
technologies) into a human resource that is accessible by anyone
at anytime and anywhere. For this purpose socio-cognitive grids
will need to offer ubiquitous mechanisms for accessing,
intelligent techniques for managing, and secure channels for
delivering cognitive and social resources.
