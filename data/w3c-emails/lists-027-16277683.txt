  - Real-time, Pervasive, and Embedded Systems
  - Security and Trust in Distributed Systems
  - Self-Configurable, Self-repairing, and Self-Evolving Systems
  - Highly Available Distributed Systems
  - Web Services and Service-Oriented Architecture
  - Grid Computing
  - Peer-to-Peer Systems
  - Large-Scale Group Communication, Coordination and Cooperation
  - Wireless Communication and Networks
  - Performance Modeling Large-Scale Distributed Systems
  - Distributed Multimedia Systems
  - Novel Distributed Applications

Workshop Location:
  Suzhou, China

Workshop Date:
  May 26-28, 2004

PAPER SUBMISSION
  The workshop seeks submissions on any of the above topics with
  particular emphasis on revolutionary rather than incremental approaches.

  roughly 8 double-spaced pages excluding Tables and Figures.
  All submissions will be handled electronically and must be in PDF
  or PostScript format.   Details will be posted on the workshop web page
