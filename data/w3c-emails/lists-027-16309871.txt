The International Workshop on Future Trends of Distributed Computing Systems
(FTDCS 2004) will be held in Suzhou, China, May 26-28, 2004.
The workshop is sponsored by IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on
Distributed Processing.  The workshop will provide a forum for researchers and
practitioners in distributed computing systems around the world to present
their results, and exchange ideas and experience. In contrast to large
international conferences in this area, this workshop will place emphasis
on more in-depth discussions and project future trends.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
  - Real-time, Pervasive, and Embedded Systems
  - Security and Trust in Distributed Systems
  - Self-Configurable, Self-repairing, and Self-Evolving Systems
  - Highly Available Distributed Systems
  - Web Services and Service-Oriented Architecture
  - Grid Computing
  - Peer-to-Peer Systems
  - Large-Scale Group Communication, Coordination and Cooperation
  - Wireless Communication and Networks
  - Performance Modeling Large-Scale Distributed Systems
  - Distributed Multimedia Systems
  - Novel Distributed Applications

Workshop Location:
  Suzhou, China

Workshop Date:
  May 26-28, 2004

PAPER SUBMISSION
  The workshop seeks submissions on any of the above topics with
  particular emphasis on revolutionary rather than incremental approaches.

  roughly 8 double-spaced pages excluding Tables and Figures.
  All submissions will be handled electronically and must be in PDF
  or PostScript format.   Details will be posted on the workshop web page
  (http://www.cercs.gatech.edu/ftdcs2004).
  Submissions will be reviewed by the members of the program committee
  with additional help from selected peers.
