The 17th International FLAIRS Conference
Special Track on AI and the Web
http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~heflin/conf/flairs/

The Palms South Beach Hotel
Miami Beach, Florida
May 17-19, 2004

Call for Papers
---------------
The World Wide Web has made a wealth of digital information available
on demand, impacting AI in two ways. First, it allows traditional AI
techniques to be evaluated with large amounts of real-world data. This
introduces complexities not found in toy problems, while at the same
time avoiding many of the difficulties inherent in the physical world.
As such, the Web makes for a good testbed for AI researchers. Second,
the Web proposes new problems and challenges for AI. The sheer size and
distributed nature of the Web has fueled novel research in extracting
information from Web pages, efficiently integrating information from
distributed sources, and extending the Web with ontologies to enable
the Semantic Web.

The focus of this special track is on what the Web can do for AI
research and what AI research can do for the Web. Relevant topics
include, but are not limited to:

- Information extraction
- Information integration
- Intelligent Web search
- Intelligent Web services
- Machine learning for classifying Web documents
- NLP for understanding Web documents
- Question answering from Web documents
- Semantic Web
- User modeling and adaptation for the Web
- Web-based agents

Submission Instructions
-----------------------
Interested authors should format their papers according to AAAI
formatting guidelines. The papers should not exceed 6 pages and are
due by October 24, 2003. The papers should not identify the author(s)
in any manner. All submissions will be done electronically via the 
FLAIRS web submission system, which will be available through the
conference web site (see the link under General Conference, below).
Authors should indicate "AI and the Web" as the special track when
submitting their papers.
