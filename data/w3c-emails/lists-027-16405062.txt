Dear all,
 
I'm a computer science student at the Free University (VU) in Amsterdam. I'm
doing a research on the use of Semantic Web technologies for government
information on the Web. This, to improve the "find ability" of information
on a government portal. All information on the Dutch authorities on the Web
are accessible via this portal ( <http://overheid.nl/> ).
As this concerns a huge amount of data / WebPages, there is need for a more
intelligent way to get to the required information. What solution can the
Semantic Web technologies give on this subject?
 
I'm looking for any research, papers, case studies or other resources
related to my research and Master Thesis.
All relevant information and ideas are welcome. I would appreciate you help.
 
Kind regards,
 
Erhat Ilgar
