Hi folks,

Just finished "RDF Intro", my first "Tangle Yarn" at:

http://bigfractaltangle.com/yarns/

Tangle Yarns is a series of posts describing real-world right-now 
examples of working Semantic Web technology, written for an audience 
that's not currently in the field.

Also of interest is "Angela Talk", an imaginary conversation with an 
angel investor, looking to invest in Semantic Web technology:

Feedback is welcome.

Thanks,
Timothy Falconer
