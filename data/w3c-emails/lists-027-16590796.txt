 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
       Submission Deadline for Draft Papers is February 23, 2004
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------


TOPICS:

AUTONOMOUS COMPUTING and particularly AGENT technology can help us to
process heterogeneous information, knowledge, manufacturing data, and
business transactions in an automatic, flexible, intelligent, and
efficient way. The goals of this International Workshop are to gather
ACADEMIC and INDUSTRIAL researchers to exchange new ideas and experiences,
to initialize new contacts or to strengthen existing collaborations. We
hope to create a dynamic forum and effective connections among
RESEARCHERS, USERS, and DEVELOPERS in this field.

This year we plan to have the following tracks:
+ Track-A: " Agents for Autonomous Information and Knowledge Processing "
                  (at IKE) June 21 - 24, Las Vegas, USA.
+ Track-B: " Distributed & Parallel Computing Techniques for Agents "
                  (at PDPTA) June 21 - 24, Las Vegas, USA.
+ Track-C: " Intelligent Agents for Autonomous Processing "
                  (at IC-AI) June 21 - 24, Las Vegas, USA.
+ Track-D: " Internet Agents for Autonomous Processing "
                  (at IC) June 21 - 24, Las Vegas, USA.
+ Track-E: " Agents for Business and Engineering Systems"
                  (at KES) September 20-24, Wellington, New Zealand.
+ Track-G: " Agent-based Systems for Autonomous Processing"
                  (at IEEE SMC) October 10-13, The Hague, The Netherlands

We welcome papers on architectures, protocols, algorithms, design,
evaluation, implementation techniques, and applications of autonomous and
agent-based systems. Technical issues to be addressed include, but are not
limited to:

SUBMISSION:

You are invited to submit papers through the http://www.aba-rd.org/ site.
If the files are more than 10Mb even after zipping then please email
them to the contact address below. Please use the IEEE-format with less
than 7 pages for draft papers. After being reviewed, papers may be
accepted in the following categories:
 + RESEARCH Papers for presentations (7 pages) and for posters (4 pages);
 + REPORT Papers for System/Software/Product descriptions, analysis,
                                                and demos (7 or 4 pages);
 + POSITION Papers for stating problems and issues of Challenging
                                            business scenarios (2 pages).
accepted papers of all categories will be published in the conference
proceedings.


FORMAT & PUBLICATION:

This International Workshop consists of Technical Tracks held at several
International Conferences. Our workshop papers will be published in those
corresponding Conference Proceedings in hard copy (ISBN). In addition to
that, we also plan to publish the revised versions of papers of ALL tracks
in a book. In the past, selected papers from our previous workshops were
extended and published in two journal issues:

+ " ASPECTS of INTERNET AGENT-BASED E-BUSINESS SYSTEMS ", Journal of
  Electronic Commerce Research, Volume 3:3-4, July-October 2003,
  Kluwer Publisher;
      http://cs.newpaltz.edu/~pham/ABA/papers/J1/

+ " SOFTWARE AGENTS for BUSINESS AUTOMATION ", Journal of E-commerce
  Research and Applications, Vol.2, N.3, July-October 2003, Elsevier
  Publisher.
      http://cs.newpaltz.edu/~pham/ABA/papers/J2/


CONFERENCE EVENTS:

Our technical tracks are planned to be held at the following conferences:
  IKE: The 2004 International Conference on Information and Knowledge
       Engineering (*)
  IT: The 2004 International Conference on Internet Computing (*)
  PDPTA: The 2004 International Conference on Parallel and Distributed
         Processing Techniques and Applications (*)
  IC-AI: The 2004 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (*)
  KES: The 8th International Conference on Knowledge-Based & Intelligent
       Information & Engineering Systems, KES, September 20-24,

  International MultiConference IMCSCE, June 21 - 24, Las Vegas, USA)


PARTICIPATION:

For the authors who may not be able to present their papers at the
conference site, we plan to make post-conference on-line interactive
forums & presentations (all other authors will also be invited to
participate). This is for introduction, questions/answers about papers and
related projects, discussions about possible cooperation ... Minutes of
all discussions will be distributed to the participants.
