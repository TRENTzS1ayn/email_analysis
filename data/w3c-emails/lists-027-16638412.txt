******* EUSAI 2004 **********************************************
******* Second European Symposium on Ambient Intelligence *******

Call for Posters and Demonstrations


November 8-10, 2004
Eindhoven University of Technology
Eindhoven, The Netherlands
http://www.eusai.net



* CONFERENCE THEME *

Ambient Intelligence represents a vision of the future where we shall be surrounded by electronic environments, sensitive and responsive to people.  Ambient intelligence technologies are expected to combine concepts of ubiquitous computing and intelligent systems putting humans in the centre of technological developments.  Ambient Intelligence represents a long-term objective for European research bringing together researchers across multiple disciplines: computer science, electronics and mechanical engineering, design, architecture, social sciences, software engineering, to name a few.  

Following a successful first event last year, the Second European Symposium on Ambient Intelligence, will be held in Eindhoven in the Netherlands, on November 8-10, 2004.  It aims to provide a venue for an emerging multi-disciplinary community of researchers that work on Ambient Intelligence.


* KEYNOTES INCLUDE *

Ted Selker (MIT Media Lab, USA)
Tom Rodden (University of Nottingham, UK)


* TOPICS * 

The symposium addresses the following research areas in Ambient Intelligence systems: 

- Ubiquitous computing: wired, wireless and ad-hoc networking, discovery mechanisms, software architectures, system integration and prototyping, portable devices. 

- Context awareness: sensors, tracking and positioning, smart devices, wearable, models of context of use, software architectures for multi platform interfaces.

- Intelligence: learning algorithms, user profiling, personalisation and adaptivity, recommenders, autonomous intelligence, agent based user interfaces. 

- Natural user-system interaction: ambient interfaces, multimodal interaction, innovative interaction styles and concepts.
