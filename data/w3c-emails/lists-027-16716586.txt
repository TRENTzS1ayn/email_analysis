The International Workshop on Future Trends of Distributed Computing
Systems (FTDCS 2004) will be held in Suzhou, China, May 26-28, 2004. The
workshop is sponsored by IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on
Distributed Processing. The workshop will provide a forum for researchers
and practitioners in distributed computing systems around the world to
present their results, and exchange ideas and experience. In contrast to
large international conferences in this area, this workshop will place
emphasis on more in-depth discussions and project future trends.

The final program is below. The workshop web page is:
