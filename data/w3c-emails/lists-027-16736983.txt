Dear All,

If you know of people in Australia (more specifically Sydney) that are
willing and able to talk at one of the Australian Computer Society's SIG
meetings, could you forward this email to the people. 

The meetings are held on the first Wednesday of each month and approximately
1 hour is available for a presentation.

Members of the SIG are especially interested in hearing presentations about
Web Service implementations. However, given the speed at which Web Services
are moving, anything that helps computer professionals come to grips with
this technology would be welcome.

Hao
