Here is a proposed plan for our switch to WSDL 2.0:

1- Editors to the necessary changes within the files (s/WSDL 1.2/WSDL
2.0/) until the group decide to publish them.
2- Once the group decided to publish, I will copy the files in the
directory 2002/ws/desc/wsdl20 _in the CVS database itself_. Editors are
guaranteed to loose their changes on the old files in the meantime. I
will change the name of the files as well. Copying the files in the CVS
database will preserve the log history on them. The latest URIs of the
document will become:
http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20*
 As soon as I'm sure that I didn't mess up with the files, I will cvs
remove the files in wsdl12, except for the files that are not related
with the specifications (such as wsdl12/meps-vs-iops/*). It would be
good to put the files that are not related part of the specifications in
a separate directory. Feel free to create a new directory under
2002/ws/desc for other documents (task force documents, ...).
3- As soon as I am done, I will send an email.
