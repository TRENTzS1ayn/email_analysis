Minutes of Wednesday's MEP teleconference are attached.

I also updated 
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2002/ws/desc/wsdl12/meps-vs-iops/meps-vs-iops_clean.htm
to explicitly indicate the intended IOP/MEP in the pseudo-WSDL, instead of 
using "*" sometimes, which was too ambiguous.

REMINDER: Next MEP teleconference is 1:00pm EDT Monday April 14.
