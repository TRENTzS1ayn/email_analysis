Only Umit and I showed up at today's MEP teleconference.  Amy and Philippe 
gave regrets; others were AWOL.

Umit and I discussed the clarified assumptions in 
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2002/ws/desc/wsdl12/meps-vs-iops/meps-vs-iops_clean.htm

At this point we really need Gudge on the call to ferret out the remaining 
disagreements/misunderstandings, as others seem to be pretty much in agreement.
