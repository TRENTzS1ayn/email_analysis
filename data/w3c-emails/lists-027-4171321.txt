It seems obvious, to me at least, that there is quite a gulf between my
position and the position other people are taking. I think that
operations in WSDL should be abstract, defining ONLY the sequence,
direction and cardinality of messages. All other details that are needed
to 'make stuff actually work', like # of channels, sync vs async,
timing, are defined at the binding level ( possibly with multiple levels
of binding, if we end up supporting multi-level bindings ).

The thing I find quite bizarre with the current MEP/IOP document is that
given the WSDL below, both port types are exactly the same by the time
you get to the binding level, but they are not compatible. I think this
is very bad, because mep2b is essentially a subset of iop2, so it seems
very strange that they are modelled as being completely separate.

Cheers
