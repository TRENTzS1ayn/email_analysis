On Wednesday's call[1], we were discussing pattern p2d (request with 
response to third party), and I said that I had forgotten to put in a third 
parameter for the address of the third party to receive the response:

[[
<dbooth> p2d: 
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2002/ws/desc/wsdl12/meps-vs-iops/meps-vs-iops_clean.htm#p2d 


David: oops, i_p2d is missing a third parameter for the third party

Scribe: void sendMessage(ServiceAddress s, Message m);
... -> void sendMessage(ServiceAddress s, Message m, 
ResponseDestinationAddress rda);
]]

However, in thinking about this later, it isn't clear to me what mechanism 
would be used to communicate the ResponseDestinationAddress to the 
service.  The client and service would have to agree on some mechanism, but 
we have nothing in the WSDL 1.2 spec about this.  Would it be 
application-specific?  Or binding-specific?  Or what?

Comments?
