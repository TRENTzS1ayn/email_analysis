Agenda for today's MEP call, 12:00-1:00pm EDT Wednesday

A. Continue discussing the effects of patterns on client interfaces[1][2],
particularly for cases:
         1. Suppose a WSD specifies p2c
         2. Suppose a WSD specifies p2e
         3. Suppose one client wishes to invoke a service using a third-party
         to receive the response, while another client wishes to invoke that
         service using classic request/response style.  How could the service
         support both?

B. What to recommend?
