Agenda for Monday's MEP call, 1:00-2:30pm EDT Wednesday

A. Continue discussing the effects of patterns on clients and services[1][2],
particularly for cases:
          1. Suppose a WSD specifies p2c
          2. Suppose a WSD specifies p2e
          3. Suppose one client wishes to invoke a service using a third-party
          to receive the response, while another client wishes to invoke that
          service using classic request/response style.  How could the service
          support both?

B. What to recommend?
