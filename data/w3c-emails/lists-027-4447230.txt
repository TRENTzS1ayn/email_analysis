I will be on an airplane at the time of our scheduled MEP teleconference 
Wednesday July 16, so I will not be able to make the call.

However, if others are able to meet, please go ahead.  We have limited time 
remaining before our F2F meeting, so we need to make progress as we can.

I made note of the following remaining issues.  Are there others?


Remaining Issues in MEP TF
==========================

1. Address remaining questions on the p2 family (p2e versus p2c).  Should 
we adopt p2c1?   (See 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-ws-desc-meps/2003Jul/att-0015/030714-ws-desc-irc.htm 
for a definition of p2c1.)  What would be the impact?  Should we adopt both 
p2c1 and p2e?

2. Unicast versus multicast.  Are there additional issues we need to cover?

3. Modeling faults.  Are there additional recommendations we can make about 
faults?  For example, could the two fault rules be reduced to a single 
"message triggers fault" rule?  If so, what would be lost, and would it matter?

4. Which pattern variations should we recommend?

5. Correspondence to SOAP MEPs.
