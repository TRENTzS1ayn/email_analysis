I think that these two say the same thing; I think that three is a means
of defining the slogan expressed in 1.

I'm still not certain that I *agree*, but I do think that these belong
together.

Agreement.  I think that this is a good-enough way to state the rules of
participant identity.

I want to think about the patterns.  I'm not sure how comfortable I am
recommending removals.  Or, conversely, how comfortable I am leaving
some of the oddities in if we recommend removals of others.  Or, also,
whether we ought to recommend more-than-one pattern for particular
families.
