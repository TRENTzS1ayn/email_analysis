Agenda for today's call, 1:00-2:30pm EDT Monday 9 June.

A. meps-vs-iops document[1].   Walk through to see if we are in agreement.

- The latest update starts to model
the IOPs as using message transmission *without* conservation of
messages.  Is this helpful?  Are they worth including?  What about faults?

- Sections on "Modeling Objective" and
"Modeling Notation".  Are these acceptable?

- Consider focussing on one IOP (such as IOP#2), and do a depth-first 
analysis of the various corresponding MEPs
