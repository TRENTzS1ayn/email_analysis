Regrets for today.

I'm out of the office, recovering from a bout of 
[something-that-included-high-fever-and-assorted-aches-and-pains].

Speaking to specific points:

Haven't looked since last Wednesday, sorry.

I believe that this is useful (modeling without CoM).  Note that, as 
agreed last Thursday, specific reference to faults is to be removed 
from the current draft of WSDL part 2.  It would make sense to follow 
this, I believe.  I don't think that modeling faults helps us any.  So 
I would recommend that the models simply discard information about 
faults that they currently contain.  This should simplify both regexen 
and pictures.

I think that this is potentially a very fruitful way forward.

Sorry to be missing today.

Amy!
