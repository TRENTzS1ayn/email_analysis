In accordance with Monday's MEP call, I've made substantial edits to the 
meps-vs-iops document[1]:

- Removed the definitions of IOP and MEP, in order to focus on the patterns 
themselves.

- Added a generic definition of "message pattern".  NOTE: Instead of the 
wording I suggested (from memory) during the call, I used the wording from 
the WS Arch Glossary / SOAP 1.2, because I thought it would make sense to 
be consistent.  Is this okay?

- Enumerated characteristics that are specified in all patterns (i.e., 
sequence, direction, cardinality)

- Enumerated characteristics that vary between different styles of patterns 
(i.e., conservation of messages versus non-conservation; specified 
sender/receiver versus unspecified)

- Renumbered all patterns

- Defined "Pattern specialization", and indicated which patterns are a 
specialization of what other patterns

- Removed the regular expressions, because they were incorrect and redundant.
