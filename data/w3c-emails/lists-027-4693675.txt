Jonathan,

You were going to send out minutes from Monday's MEP call.  Wearing my team 
contact hat, :) I think it's important get something out, even if it is 
minimal.  Attached are (minimal) minutes that I made from memory and 
IRC.  If you have something better, please send it out.  Or if you think 
the attached is good enough, then you could just forward it to 
public-ws-desc-meps@w3.org .

Thanks!
