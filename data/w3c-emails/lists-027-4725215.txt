More patterns?? So are we really going to have > 10 patterns?
IMHO this is going entirely in the wrong direction if we keep
adding more patterns. I supported the MEP concept but never
expected we'd be having 10 MEPs in the document.

I'm sorry to say that I can't join this call tonite .. its a
bit late for me.
