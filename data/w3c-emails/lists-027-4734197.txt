No.

As part of the exploration of what needs to be defined, I took on the
task of mechanically producing a number of variants, by applying all
possible variables to all combinations of one- and two-message patterns.

Many of the patterns so produced are clearly not useful.  The result of
the study, though, sheds an interesting light on how patterns are
defined, and may help to elucidate which variables (apart from sequence,
cardinality, direction) may need to be included (if any).

Tsk.  We're not even certain whether we're talking about MEPs, or IOPs,
or some other form of pattern for messages.  There is certainly no
suggestion that more patterns will be added to the current part two
document, and if they were to be proposed, it would clearly have to go
through the WG gauntlet.

Personally, I think we have already included patterns that are poorly
motivated.
