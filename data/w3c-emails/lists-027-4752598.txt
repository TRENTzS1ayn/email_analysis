Sanjiva,

The patterns we are discussing are merely variations on the same basic 
patterns that we have discussed for months.  We are discussing these 
variations in order to explicitly nail down subtle differences in the ways 
these patterns could be defined.  For example:
         - whether or not a particular message transmission assumes 
conservation of messages

         - whether or not the sender/receiver of a message is specified (as 
a variable)
         - whether or not the message communication is restricted to being 
"on the same channel".

As the mpes-vs-iops[1] document states: "Inclusion in this list does not 
imply endorsement or recommendation by this task force or the working group."
