Out of curiosity- does the SOAP request-response MEP also
distinguish the cases as indicated below? If so I guess
we have to too. If not, if they can live with it why can't
we?

For example, to me a request-response MEP can be bound
to a same channel interaction or a multiple channel
interaction. Both are still the same MEP though.
