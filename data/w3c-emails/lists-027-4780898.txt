I don't believe that the requirements put forward by SOAP/XMLP are what
is driving the attempt to better define patterns.  I believe that the
primary drivers come from the folks who are creating tools that generate
client stubs.  The primary argument seems to be that, if an input/output
pattern is defined using only direction, cardinality, and sequence, then
the client cannot expect to get a response, to be the only person
getting a response, and may receive responses without sending requests.

I believe that choreography languages could probably also benefit from
better definition of where messages go ("out" from the service may not
be enough), or where they come from (if those languages use WSDL as a 
base, that is).
