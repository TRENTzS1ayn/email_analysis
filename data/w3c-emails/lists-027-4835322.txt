There are several different ways a "request-response" pattern could be 
defined.  Each variation has different meaning and carries different 
consequences.  We are looking at these variations in detail in order to 
make fully informed recommendations to the WG.  It would be pointless for 
the WG to adopt all of these variations, and no one expects it to do 
so.  The purpose of enumerating these variations is the enable precise, 
informed discussion of their pros and cons.

No, it isn't complexity being added.  It is merely detailed analysis of the 
choices.
