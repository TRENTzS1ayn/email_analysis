I just read the mep proposal. and first, both explanations and drawings 
are really nice and help understand quickly each pattern. One editorial 
comment might be to push all meps belonging to a category in a single 
section (for instance chage p3 in a new p2XXX).
It may have already be done within the task force but I would really 
like to have in the proposal some words of the similarities/differences 
between SOAP mep model and the proposed WSDL mep model and how they can 
be linked.

As of today,  one can create new meps specs within SOAP. To describe a 
service using a new SOAP mep, one may need to write a WSDL mep spec 
describing abstractly this new SOAP mep.
IMHO, we should avoid redundancy between these two soap mep spec and 
wsdl mep spec. One possibility is to write a soap mep spec in this way :
    1) refer to a wsdl mep for its abstract description (messages, 
cardinality...)
    2) add some more data like protocol-related  details to enable 
implementation of this mep to/for various soap bindings
Do you think that this way of writing specs is valid ?
Does the current meps state (soap mep model and proposed wsdl mep model) 
allow this ?
Bye,
