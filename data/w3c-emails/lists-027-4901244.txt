I'm not sure what we'll want to discuss on Wednesday's MEP call 
(12:00-1:00pm EDT), because I don't think people have had time to fill in 
the p2 survey[1].  Agenda suggestions, anyone?

If there are none by 11:30am, then let's cancel today's call and continue 
Monday discussing the p2 family and the survey results.
