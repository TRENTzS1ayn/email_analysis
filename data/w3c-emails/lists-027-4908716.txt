 From the minutes, I am not entirely sure what conclusion you reached. 
Would it be fair to summarize the TF's position as follows? (I apologize 
in advance if my summary misrepresent the TF's position.)

1) At the interface level, we will use WSDL patterns.

2) At the binding level, we will use SOAP MEPs.

3) We will not indicate the relationship between the two.

I'm fine with 1) and 2); I feel we will need to be a little more 
explicit about 3). For example, does the choice of a WSDL pattern 
restrict the set of possible SOAP MEPs?

Again, apologies if my characterization of the TF's position was not 
accurate.

Jean-Jacques.
