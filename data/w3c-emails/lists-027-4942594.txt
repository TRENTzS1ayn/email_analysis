I don't think that we reached a conclusion or a specific stand on (3). 
Personally, my gut feeling is that the SOAP MEPs will be specific 
instances of a particular WSDL pattern and that is how we can establish 
the relationships between the two. That is what I tried to convey during 
the concall (but perhaps failed :-)).
