Minutes from MEP call 30 June 2003

Present: DBooth Umit JMarsh
Chair: DBooth
Scribe: DBooth

David's was the only p2 survey returned so far[1], so we began by 
discussing that, but shifted to discussing Use Case UC1[2] when questions 
came up about how client code-writing would be affected if p2 adopted 
versus p2e.  David and Umit argued that the client-side code would be 
written differently if WSDL 1.2 only adopted p2 or p2c instead of p2e, as 
described in UC1.
