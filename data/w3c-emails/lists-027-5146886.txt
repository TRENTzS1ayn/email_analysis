POLL ON TELECONFERENCE MEETING TIMES

This poll is to help us find available times for the MEP task force to
meet by teleconference.   I've (somewhat arbitrarily) proposed several
candidate times below.  Feel free to suggest other times as well, by
following the same format below.


HOW TO VOTE

Erase everything above the top "-=-=-=-" line and erase everything
below the bottom "-=-=-=-" line.  Do not erase anything between these
lines.

In the brackets next to each proposed time, indicate your availability
as follows:
         Vote    Meaning
         +2      This time is best for me
         +1      I prefer this time
         0       (or blank) Neutral.  I can meet at this time.
         -1      I prefer NOT this time, but I can do it if necessary
         -2      I CANNOT meet at this time

Please indicate your availability for EVERY proposed time below.

Then mail the ballot to me: dbooth@w3.org .  I'll collate them and
post the results.  Don't worry about spacing of the columns or any
quote characters (">") that your reply inserts.
