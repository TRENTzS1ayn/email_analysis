I've been working on illustrating the correspondence between our 
Input/Output Patterns (IOPs) and Message Exchange Patterns (MEPs).  I've 
listed all of the 7 IOPs that we discussed, and converted them into various 
kinds of MEPs.  (Our previously discussed pattern #8, Request/Response, is 
an MEP already, so it didn't need to be converted.  It is MEP #2b.)  The 
document is at
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2002/ws/desc/wsdl12/meps-vs-iops/meps-vs-iops_clean.htm
and it contains the following sections (some empty):

         Introduction
         Patterns - IOPs and MEP
         Use Cases that Illustrate Differences Between IOPs and MEPs
         Advantages of IOPs Over MEPs
         Advantages of MEPs Over IOPs

The "Use Cases" section needs details and additional use cases.  (They 
don't have to have fancy diagrams either.  Text is fine.)  It is not 
intended to enumerate all use cases that are relevant to WSDL.  It is only 
intended to list a few use cases that may be helpful in understanding the 
difference between having the WSDL interface/portType model IOPs versus MEPs.

The "Advantages" sections are the main ones that I am hoping that this TF 
can fill produce.  Ideally I would like to nail down all the pros and cons 
that we see of both ways of doing things, and then bring it to the WG as a 
whole to make a decision.

Also, I'm not sure I got pattern 7 right.  (Amy, would you take a look?)
