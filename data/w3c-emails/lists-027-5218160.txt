I suggest we start off discussing:

1. The MEPs vs IOPs document I've been working on:
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2002/ws/desc/wsdl12/meps-vs-iops/meps-vs-iops_clean.htm
Are people comfortable with using this as the basis for our TF results?

2. Use cases that accentuate the trade-offs between using MEPs versus IOPs 
at the interface/portType level.

3. How MEPs would be indicated in bindings if they are not indicated at the 
interface/portType level.

4. Amy's suggested use cases:

or reformatted to 80-column lines:
