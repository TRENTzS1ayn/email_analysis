A status update for the F2F:

The MEP TF has been on hold while I've has been out for the birth of my 
twins, so we don't have any new progress to report.

The status at this point is that the TF has identified some of the 
conflicting assumptions that different people were making, and has 
clarified different people's viewpoints. We've made excellent progress on 
understanding the differences, but we have not yet reached the point of 
resolving them.

We plan to pick up the MEP TF work again after the F2F.
