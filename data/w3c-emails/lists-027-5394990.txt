Summary:

Present: David Booth, Amy Lewis, Jonathan Marsh, Umit Yalcinalp

Examined documented assumptions as
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2002/ws/desc/wsdl12/meps-vs-iops/mep
s-vs-iops_clean.htm.  Much discussion about the value of crisply worded,
minimal assumptions, and particulars of the assumptions recorded.

Reworded assumptions 1 and 2 to read:

1) A WSD is intended for use by a WS and its client or clients.
2) A primary purpose of the WSD is to establish a contract on the
syntax, datatypes, and protocols which the interacting parties will use
to interact.

No definitive rework of the remaining issues.

> <Scribe> 6)
> <Scribe> Jonathan: "complete"?
> <Scribe> David: includes endpoint uris, bindings, interfaces.

> <Scribe> "A full definition of the service, which can be defined by
> multiple WSDL documents and Schemas".
> <Scribe> Umit: Transitive closure of documents that define a service.
> <Scribe> Amy: WSDL can contain multiple services.
> <Scribe> Amy: Don't have a concept of a "service" (other than the one

> <Scribe> Amy: Need a term for the chain of WSDL constructs defining a

> <Scribe> David: My definition is a service that contains endpoints.

Web

> <Scribe> Amy: Multiple clients may make use of the same contract.

> <Scribe> Umit: Need an endpoint to interact.
> <Scribe> Amy: You can do interesting things with parts of WSDL (e.g.

> <Scribe> Amy: Depends who's looking at it.
> <Scribe> ... Registry use is different than client.
> <Scribe> ... Item 2 and item 4 amount to the same thing?
> <Scribe> Umit: 1) seems to cover multiple clients.
> <Scribe> Jonathan: ... "it's client or clients"
> <Scribe> Jonathan: 2) "primary" purpose (not all purposes are
mechanics

> <Scribe> Amy: Need to distill these assumptions down.
> <Scribe> Amy: 1) = from point of view of service, WSD is intended for

> <Scribe> ... 2) WSD represents a contract.
> <Scribe> ... 4) Is a complete (only?) contract.
> <Scribe> David: no

> <Scribe> David: Called these out because they were questioned

> <Scribe> Jonathan: Description can be used for many purposes.
