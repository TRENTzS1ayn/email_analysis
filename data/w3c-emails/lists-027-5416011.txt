I updated the MEPs vs. IOPs document per last week's discussion about the 
wording of the assumptions that are listed:
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2002/ws/desc/wsdl12/meps-vs-iops/meps-vs-iops_clean.htm

However, at this point I'm wondering if others find the "Assumptions" 
section worth the effort to include.  I had initially included it to help 
add clarity to our discussions about MEPs versus IOPs -- to ensure that 
we're all talking the same language, since I noticed that different people 
were making different assumptions.  However, it isn't clear to me that it's 
worth spending time doing careful wordsmithing of these 
assumptions.  Perhaps we would be better served if we simply removed them, 
and discussed the MEPs versus IOPs, and let different assumptions arise 
during the course of those discussions.

What do others think?
