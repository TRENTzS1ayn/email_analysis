In response to today's decisions, I've updated
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2002/ws/desc/wsdl12/meps-vs-iops/meps-vs-iops_clean.htm

However, I have not completed all the changes requested, only because I 
don't wish to do work unnecessarily that has a good chance of needing to be 
undone in the future.  I would like to have the group look at the changes 
made so far, to decide whether this is a desirable direction before I 
commit more time to it.

In particular, I have thus far:

- Removed the "explanations" from the list of assumptions, and placed them 
in a separate section.  Note that I also have not yet edited assumption 5 
to futher clarify what is meant by "complete", nor to avoid the work 
"interface".  Again, this is because it isn't clear to me that this 
assumption will remain.  However, I have marked it for future editing in 
the event that it does stay.

- Removed the assumption of "conservation of messages" from the modeling 
notation.

- Added sections on the "Modeling Objective" and "Modeling Notation".

- Renumbered the IOPs and MEPs to correspond to the numbers currently used 
in 
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2002/ws/desc/wsdl12/wsdl12-patterns.xml 
Please note that the section numbers currently used in that document are 
DIFFERENT from the pattern numbers that were previously used to identify 
them.  That document now uses pattern NAMES to identify their patterns.

- Added explicit references to the (hopefully) corresponding patterns in 
http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2002/ws/desc/wsdl12/wsdl12-patterns.xml

- Modified *some* of the IOPs to reflect the new notation.  [Note: I don't 
have an easy way of drawing a "wave front", so I used a branching, 
dotted-line arc instead.  I hope that is adequate for this purpose for the 
moment.]  Hopefully these will be enough to give a feel for this approach.

- Merged previous IOPs 8 and 9 into the new patterns, as discussed.
