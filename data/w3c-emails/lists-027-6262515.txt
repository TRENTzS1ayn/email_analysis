thanks for the clarification. Now i understand. pls see below for more 
comments.

I don't if this is relevant, but there IS a set of mandated operations on 
all CORBA objects, those that are inherited from the base CORBA::Object 
type. (Technically although the signatures are expressed in IDL, each 
language mapping defines how they are materialized in that language.)

interface Object {
      InterfaceDef get_interface ();
      boolean is_nil();
      Object duplicate ();
      void release ();
      boolean is_a ( in RepositoryId logical_type_id );
      boolean non_existent();
      boolean is_equivalent ( in Object other_object );
      unsigned long hash( in unsigned long maximum );
      void create_request ( .... [ parms snipped ] );
      Policy get_policy ( in PolicyType policy_type );
      DomainManagersList get_domain_managers ();
      Object set_policy_overrides(
          in PolicyList policies,
          in SetOverrideType set_add
          ) raises (InvalidPolicies);
      Policy get_client_policy( in PolicyType type );
      PolicyList get_policy_overrides( in PolicyTypeSeq types );
      boolean validate_connection( out PolicyList inconsistent_policies );
      Object get_component ();
     };
};

   So for example you can invoke a get_interface() operation which returns 
the metadata describing the inteface on all object references.
