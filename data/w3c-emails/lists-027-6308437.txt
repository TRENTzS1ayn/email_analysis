Not quite. I think you are summarizing Savas' point of view, not 
necessarily the rest of the task force's thinking or discussion up to 
this point for those points 2 and 3 above.

We have discussed exploring a verbal contract and/or a binding contract 
for the attributes in order for the client to be able to get/set those 
values so that there may be a way of not defining the functions (2) in 
the interface, but there is a clear way of
accessing the values using the binding. We have not explored how this 
can be done in detail yet, but our feeling, (this is my understanding) 
has been to explore this contract part of the WSDL regardless of whether 
functions are within the interface or not.
After all, the contract for the client must be well defined to access 
these values.
