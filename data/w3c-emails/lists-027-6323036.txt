We have discussed exploring a verbal contract and/or a binding contract
for the attributes in order for the client to be able to get/set those
values so that there may be a way of not defining the functions (2) in
the interface, but there is a clear way of 
accessing the values using the binding. We have not explored how this
can be done in detail yet, but our feeling, (this is my understanding)
has been to explore this contract part of the WSDL regardless of whether
functions are within the interface or not. 
After all, the contract for the client must be well defined to access
these values. 

 

 

Doesn't your above comment describe exactly what the "WSDL to SOAP" or
"WSDL to HTTP" or "WSDL to MIME" or "WSDL to whatever" binding
specification should do?

 

Unfortunately I can't join the teleconferences so I don't know what has
been discussed or the solutions you are exploring :-(
