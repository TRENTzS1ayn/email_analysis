WSDL -> {SOAP, HTTP, MIME} are part of the WSDL WG's work. That's 
what part 3 of our spec contains. Part 2 currently contains black
magic that I don't quite follow yet but which will hopefully get
refined soon.

Can your university join the W3C? Or alternatively your project
or the UK e-Science organization can .. then you guys can have 
reps on all W3C working groups.

The work of the working group does occur publicly as per our chater.
I wouldn't worry too much about the telecons, but the F2F meetings
are really what you miss most.
