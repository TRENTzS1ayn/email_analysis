I hope I did not give the wrong impression. I am aware that the bindings
are part of the WSDL specification. In earlier messages in this list and
in the private discussions with David Snelling last week, I did suggest
that the way get/set happens for attributes would have to be defined in
the bindings section of the WSDL specification. So, no argument there.

The above does not suggest, though, that specific WSDL operations should
be defined in the WSDL spec, as per the OGSI proposal. Just to be clear:
by "WSDL operations" I mean <wsdl:operation name="..."> elements. That's
what I am opposing.

Don't know whether this is a priority for the UK e-Science program given
the amount of money required. I wouldn't think so, although I'll ask.

It sounds like you are getting together to have fun :-) (just joking)
