The summary I wrote down did have a way for the clients to get the
values: I said the semantics are as per OMG IDL- which means
that there must be a getFoo() for every attribute Foo etc.. Language
bindings such as JAXRPC can select how to expose that to the user,
but the semantic must be via a method just like in IDL.

Without that I agree that its a vacuous specification. Savas, do 
you not agree?

The operation cannot be per binding. Otherwise no kind of binding
independent DII (ala WSIF) is possible to deal with attributes.
