This of 'static' SD values as class or interface constants. Their value
never changes and is the same for all instances (or all endpoints
implementing that service). It is just like a static field in a java
interface. I think the problem here is a language one. I didn't like the
choice of the word static for just this reason. I would describe it as a
WSDL_Constant. The other values for mutability are constant (set by the
instance on creation), extendable (I can add more but not remove them) and
mutable (no holds barred).
