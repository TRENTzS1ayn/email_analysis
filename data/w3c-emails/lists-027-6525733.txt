I have an entry in my calendar to present WebDAV to the working group 
today in order to explore how WebDAV properties could be use to exchange 
service metadata. Steve Graham asked me to do the presentation, but he 
seems to be out of the office this week. So I'd like to reschedule to 
sometime when he can participate as he and I have had previous discussions 
on the topic. Sorry for the inconvenience.
