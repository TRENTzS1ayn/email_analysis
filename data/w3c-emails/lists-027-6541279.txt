David:

I worry that including these kind of mechanisms will turn WSDL into the XML
equivalent of C++ header files, and that as a result developers make bad
decisions about the granularity of service interactions.

If we move away from the idea of WSDL as an IDL, and think about WSDL as a
protocol description language then I believe that things like this
constant/static mechanism are unnecessary (since we use WSDL to describe
message format and binding, and not the interface of an agent per se).

In fact if we look at things this way, the notion of a stateful service
becomes much less the domain of the protocol description and much more a
feature of a particular deployed architecture. All the protocol description
would have to ensure is that the right contexts are passed around to ensure
that state can be rehydrated in response to the receipt of messages.
