All,

Drawing from Sanjiva's very good suggestion in the WSDL mailing list for
the removal of <message>, please allow me to suggest another syntax for
attributes for all of us to consider:

<attribute name="ncname">
    <get [(body="qname") | (element="qname")]>
        [<xsd:complexType> ... </xsd:complexType>]
    </get>
    <set [(body="qname") | (element="qname")] 
        [<xsd:complexType> ... </xsd:complexType>]
    </set>
</attribute >

It's very similar to Sanjiva's syntax for the operation. Absence of a
get or a set will make the attribute write-only or read-only
respectively.

It is still the case that binding will be required.


Going back to David's comments on the requirement for having "static"
attributes in a WSDL document... I would argue that the only reason one
would want to put a static value in an interface document is because
they want to make available metadata information. I believe that the
current draft of WSDL already supports this through the <feature> and
<property> elements, if I haven't misunderstood the intention for their
introduction.

Regards,
.savas.
