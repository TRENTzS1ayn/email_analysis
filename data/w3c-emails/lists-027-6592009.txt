I think I like this too! Basically it says an attribute is a
different set of messages that are grouped together; one to
<get> the attribute and one to (optionally) <set> the attribute.
An <operation> OTOH is a set of messages that are sent and (optionally)
received.

Let's see what Steve thinks .. he's back from vacation but
is prolly buried in email.

Sanjiva.
