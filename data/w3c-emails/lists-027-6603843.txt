I find this elegant, but my main question is how this meets the requirements
we have listed. I can see many requirements that don't appear to be met by
this, such as ability to query over multiple attributes and ability to
attach metadata to attributes. Or am I missing something in this proposal?
Do the get and set operations allow more advanced syntax to meet these
requirements?

Regards,

William
