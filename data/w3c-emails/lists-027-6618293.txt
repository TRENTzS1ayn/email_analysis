I think the ability to query over all attributes is a specific
function that really does not belong in WSDL .. that's really in
the space of OGSi. Now that we have inheritance, they can mix that
in nicely without any problem.

Additional metadata (including static values if so desired) can be
embedded via our ever-powerful extensibility model. So if GGF for
example wants to add additional metadata then they can! If we have
readwrite vs. readonly metadata I think that's prolly sufficient
for WSDL. (That's supported by what Savas proposed.)
