Absolutely! It is great (indeed necessary) to get feedback from a group
which uses WS technology heavily, like the Grid community, but WS
technologies have to reach a wider audience than just the GGF. If the output
from the WG is sufficient for the Grid community to build their application
framework on, then both parties can declare victory.
