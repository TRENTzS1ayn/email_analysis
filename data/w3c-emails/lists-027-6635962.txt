It seems to me that we are defining a set of attributes and a well 
defined way to query/modify them without assuming the existence of 
operations in WSDL, right? As a result, our goal is then to specify 
well-defined messages that would instead express the same information as 
if the operation(s) were to exist in WSDL. Not specifying the message 
content would be unacceptable as it is an interoperability problem.

I had the same question as William with respect to this syntax. If I 
understood correctly, this approach favors defining get/setXX messages 
per attribute basis. Unless there is a well defined message where 
multiple attribute names can be referenced, it is not clear to me how a 
general query can be expressed. This favors using an operation unless we 
were to extend the attribute definitions to encapsulate both attributes 
and query messages that can be expressed, something along the lines of

<attributes>
    <attribute>...</attribute>
    <attribute>...</attribute>
     <attribute-query> to be defined </attribute-query>
</attribute>

I am also not clear about Savas' proposal and I have some questions:

-- How is the complexType in the body of get/set element used? For 
example, I would have expected the get message not to specify anything 
as it is obvious from the structure that there is an attribute that it 
is related to. Similarly, what are the body/element defns?
I would not expect anything in the body of a message that corresponds to 
this definition as it is clear from the defn which attribute that the 
get message is for.

-- The same question goes for the setter. Can a set message contain 
information other than the value of the attribute? Again the 
body/element defns appear to allow more than the traditional use of a 
setter would allow. I would like to understand better.

-- If the WSDL contains get/set operations, how would be distinguish 
them based on the message content alone?

Thanks.
