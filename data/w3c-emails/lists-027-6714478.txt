I guess with the new syntax, it's difficult to introduce headers because
there is no distinction between input and output messages. The proposed
syntax for attributes allows only for the body of the get/set message to
be specified.

Headers are used when you describe the message exchanges of a protocol.
I believe that in most cases this would happen through operations only.
I can't see an example where one would want to describe a protocol in
WSDL and use attributes but I may be wrong in this. What do people
think?
