sgg is  back from vacation and under a mountain of email.

I share William's assessment that the approach as proposed may be elegant,
but it is not clear that it addresses all of the requirements.
I will take a to do to review the requirements list and review the proposal
in light of the set of requirements that we have listed.

I will try to post something to the public mailing list by end of week.

I find this elegant, but my main question is how this meets the
requirements
we have listed. I can see many requirements that don't appear to be met by
this, such as ability to query over multiple attributes and ability to
attach metadata to attributes. Or am I missing something in this proposal?
Do the get and set operations allow more advanced syntax to meet these
requirements?

William
