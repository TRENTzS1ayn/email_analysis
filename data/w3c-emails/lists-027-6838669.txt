I do not concur that Objects imply tight coupling.  They are orthogonal
concepts.  I have built systems using Object TEchnology that are very
loosely coupled.

CORBA and DCOM did not fail.  They had certain successes, but they are not
mainstream.  COBOL, for example, is not currently top of mind, but I would
not say that COBOL failed.

Objects imply a tightly coupled system. It's ok to build distributed
applications using objects when you own the infrastructure, when you
remain within the boundaries of your organisation. You have tighter
control of what is going on.

Once you start talking about inter-organisation, loosely coupled
infrastructures, you have to live in an environment where you don't have
control. My organisation will not allow you to create objects
representing the resources I maintain. I am providing a service, an
interface to what I want you to see. I am telling you the messages that
you can exchange with me but not the resources that are hidden behind my
service interface. I am not going to give you control of what can be
created and/or destroyed behind my interface.

A service is coarse grained. It's the entry point to my organisation.
That's the way I chose for my communications with others. Through
message exchanges of well-defined documents and not through method calls
on a stateful entity, an object, that I allowed you to create on my
resources. If I wanted that, I would have chosen CORBA or DCOM.

CORBA failed! DCOM is dead! Let's not try to do the same mistakes.
