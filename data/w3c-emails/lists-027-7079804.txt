The members of the Attributes Task Force wish to present a preliminary
report from our task force.

We will discuss this report at the upcoming WSD face to face in Raleigh.
In particular, we wish to examine more closely the issue of modelling the
attribute access mechanism at the binding layer and resolving potential
operation name collisions that might result.
