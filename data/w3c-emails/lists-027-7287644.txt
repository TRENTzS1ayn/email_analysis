Steve,

             Two quick questions :

             a)          I couldn't view the file at all. The html looks
like an
office link.
             b)          Are we going to address security as an integral
part of
serviceData ? I am thinking of visibility and access control of the
elements. IMHO, it would be better if we address the security interfaces
as well leaving, of course, the implementations to choose whatever
mechanisms.

                         If we plan to address security, I would like to
explore
possibilities of participating in the sub group.

-k.
