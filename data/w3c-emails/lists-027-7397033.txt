I too agree that the discussion should be focused on how to introduce
attributes in WSDL. My last message was to that extent. However, the
experience on defining serviceData should not be ignored.

feel that this TF should stay clear from any attempt to talk about
security and/or policies. This is the job of the appropriate working
