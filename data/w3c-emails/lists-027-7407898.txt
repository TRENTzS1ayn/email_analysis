And also some comments on David's and Steve's messages regardign dynamic
attributes...

As it was suggested, in OGSI a particular interface is mandated, namely
the GridService portType, for Grid Service Instances. Amongst other
things, it includes operations to access serviceData, get type and
metadata information about them, and get a list of them (including any
dynamically added ones).

It is my view that this would not be possible in WSDL, since equivalent
operations cannot be madated. One could argue that a number of specific
attributes could be defined that MUST exist in order to provide access
to runtime information (like the list of dynamically created
attributes). Personally, I think that such a requirement should not be
imposed by WSDL.
