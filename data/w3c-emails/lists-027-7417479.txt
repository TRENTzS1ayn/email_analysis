What is the concern with defining an interface that contains those
operations?  If the service wishes to provide "standard" operations on the
attributes, then that service would include that interface in its set of
supported interfaces. If it chooses not to include that interface, then the
requestor is clear that the attributes are not accessible.

And also some comments on David's and Steve's messages regardign dynamic
attributes...

As it was suggested, in OGSI a particular interface is mandated, namely
the GridService portType, for Grid Service Instances. Amongst other
things, it includes operations to access serviceData, get type and
metadata information about them, and get a list of them (including any
dynamically added ones).

It is my view that this would not be possible in WSDL, since equivalent
operations cannot be madated. One could argue that a number of specific
attributes could be defined that MUST exist in order to provide access
to runtime information (like the list of dynamically created
attributes). Personally, I think that such a requirement should not be
imposed by WSDL.
