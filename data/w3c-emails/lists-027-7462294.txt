Why do you feel this is domain specific?  Use of attributes cuts across
many domains.  Is this any more domain specific than CORBA IDL Attributes?

I feel that this as an application domain specific requirement and not a
requirement for an interface/protocol description language. I see WSDL
as the enabling tool for describing interfaces or protocols. Defining a
set of particular operations/attributes as prerequisites (or even
optional) should not be the responsibility of the language but rather
the particular application domain (through an appropriate specification
that uses the language).
