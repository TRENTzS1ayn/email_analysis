If we left the operatoins to access attributes up to myriad application
domains, there would be no consistency and therefore poor interoperability.

Think of the analogy to SQL.  If SQL defined Data Definition Language but
left the Query language to be application specific, data access would be a
mess.

I am sorry. I didn't make myself clear. I didn't suggest that attributes
are domain specific but, rather, that the definition of an interface
with specific operations is, something that you suggested in your
previous message.

WSDL should not include an interface with operations that services can
choose to implement. That's not what WSDL does. WSDL is used to describe
interfaces and not to impose one.

I see attributes as a useful addition to WSDL but not all features found
in OGSI's SDE are easily transferable. I just can't see how operations
that provide access to attributes can be specified by the WSDL
specification.

A WS-Management or WS-Introspection specification, for example, could
specify operations for accessing, quering attributes. These are
application specific.
