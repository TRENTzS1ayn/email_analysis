Yes, but the SQL specification does not provide a set of queries that
must or could be supported for interoperability.

The same with WSDL. It's a language. The specification should say what
an attribute is, how to associate it with a message, what its attributes
are, and so on. The specification should not say that a number of
operations (like getAttribute(), setAttribute(), queryAttributes(),
etc.) must or should exist.

It's the same with IDL. The language provides you with the means to
specify methods and attributes. The language says nothing about the
methods that you must have in order to access those attributes.

If an interoperable way to providing some specific functionality that
relates to attributes is required, then another specification is
necessary. OGSI is such a specification for the Grid application domain.
If adoption of a set of common operations that operate on attributes
would be useful, then I can see another WS-* spec.
