Folks,

As per my action from June 16th call:

Attributes Requirements to Support OGSI Service Data
----------------------------------------------------

The perspective of this list of requirements can be described as an answer
to the following question,

   "What must facilities Attributes support in order to support
   (directly or indirectly) the abstract functions of OGSI Service Data?"


Handy if the access mechanisms can be reused in other than direct access
context, e.g. notification.

Do we need predefined attributes? Probably yes.

Do we need query across multiple attributes in one service? Yes.

Ability to restrict access on a per attribute basis.

Do we need the ability to restrict read vs. write access (by user)? Yes.

Do we need the ability to restrict read vs. write access (structural)? Yes.

Need some predefined attributes

Ability to know (partial?) list of attributes at design time - yes

Ability to know type of attributes ahead of time - yes (but may be out of
bands (xsi types).

Input/output messages that manipulate attributes can be validated against
WSDL

Support for static attributes - yes

Opaque or abstract type xsi type. - yes but I don't fully understand the
differences here.. 


Attributes can be inherited through WSDL 1.2 inheritance - yes

Support metadata on attributes (creation date, type, description...) - yes
we need the mechanism.


Allow bulk retrieval of several attributes in one operation - yes.


Attributes can be of any schema type (simple or complex) - yes
