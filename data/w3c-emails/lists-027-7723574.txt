What I hear Savas say is "the interface should only contain the list of
attributes, not how to get them". This is different from "the information on
how to get an attribute is not available in the WSDL document". Bindings and
ports are part of the WSDL doc. I don't have a problem with this information
being entirely in the binding.

We have one proposal from ServiceData in which information on how to get
hold of attributes is really split between the interface and the binding
(plus port for the endpoint URL). In order to "get" an attribute using the
ServiceData approach, I need to find the interface with the get operation
but I also need to find a binding for this interface. So really the
information on how to build my "get" message is half in the interface half
in the binding.

If we can come up with a way to keep this information entirely in the
binding I'd be ok with that as long as this technique also meets our other
requirements (like bulk access to attributes). At this point I don't really
see what this would look like, but I am interested in investigating this
approach as long as we keep our requirements in mind (which are not met by a
simple implicit get/set scenario).

But this would mean that whoever creates a new binding for WSDL 1.2 (the WG
in the case of the SOAP over HTTP binding, other people for other bindings)
need to provide in their bindings information on how to format not only an
operation request but also an attribute access request.

The important thing from my point of view is that when I get a complete WSDL
doc (including abstract and concrete parts) I know exactly what to do to
access the attributes.

Savas, do you agree that bindings should provide this information and that,
in the case of the SOAP over HTTP binding it means that the WSDL working
group would have to enrich the binding to tell people how to access
attributes defined in the interface? Or are you saying that this does not
belong in the "generic" bindings even but somewhere else altogether (but
then I ask why would binding be specific to operations and not attributes?).

Regards,

William
