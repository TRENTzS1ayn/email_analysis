Yes, theoratically they are equivalent.

Personally, I have a conceptual problem with saying something 
conceptually exists but not making it explicit in the abstract level. 
After all, when the clients of a web service need to get the values, 
they need to do this by adhering to a specific contract. Decoupling the 
contract from the abstract level, hinting it but deferring it at the 
binding level seems wrong to me.

In that case, the requirement may force us to expose a query operation  
(similar to finders in EJBs) which allows querying over multiple 
attributes. It is not clear to me in that case how we can get away by 
leaving access to the binding level only.
