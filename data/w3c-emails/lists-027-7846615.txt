Exactly!

The binding solution is not the panacea. It will allow us to do simple
things, like get/set (even for multiple attributes at a time) but not
find or partial lists. Hence, not all the requirements can be met, which
is fine by me. I like the idea of treating attributes and operations in
a similar way.
