You're right, of course.

However, how are attributes retrieved in the client stub? There must
be some method invocation I assume. If so, the skeleton must have
such a method isn't it? So is there a fixed binding for the server
skeleton then? Otherwise I'm not sure how the client's property or
field would get filled when the stub user requests the value.

BTW, if it gets bound to a property in C# I assume C# has a way
to associate code to be run when a property is read? If not how does
the property get filled?

Thanks!

Sanjiva.
