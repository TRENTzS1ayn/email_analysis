Marco:
While I resonate with many of your points (I was co-author on OGSI Spec), I
must agree with Savas on one point.  The discussion you raise is best dealt
with on another mailing list such as Savas suggested.

Marco,

Although I strongly disagree with most of your arguments, I feel that
such discussion should take place at a different mailing list (perhaps
www-ws@w3.org or www-ws-arch@w3.org). The WSDL specification talks about
_how_ to write WS interfaces and not about what those interfaces are.
Additionally, the WSDL specification says nothing about the behavioural
semantics of the components for which the interfaces are written.

Perhaps the others in this mailing list have a different view.
