To augment Jim's points, IMHO, SOA and OO are at different
"layers" of abstraction - while services manifest the business
interfaces, the objects manifest the underlying implementations. An
instance of a service could very well be a set of objects. 

One of the cardinal sins of SOA (especially Web Services) is to
expose an object graph as a set of (web) services directly. This creates
the illusion that OO == SOA. The "RPC" mode of SOAP doesn't help either
