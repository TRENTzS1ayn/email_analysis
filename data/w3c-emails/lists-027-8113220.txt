Folks,

On the call today we discussed how extending a portType containing
attributes. In OGSI we had discussions on this point. Here is a pointer to
the relevant sections.

The important section is 6.4 and section 6 is the service data framework.
The accessor operations (findServiceData and setServiceData) are defined in
section 9.2 of the GridService portType (Section 9).

The document URL is:

https://forge.gridforum.org/projects/ogsi-wg/document/Open_Grid_Services_Inf
rastructure_Version_1.0/en/1/Open_Grid_Services_Infrastructure_Version_1.0.p
df

Please ask questions of both Steve and I. We should make sure that we agree
on the answers. ;-)
