I think there is a misunderstanding here. In IDL, saying "attribute
string foo" DOES NOT mean "string getFoo()". The CORBA IDL binding to
JAVA says that.

In IDL, when you say "attribute string foo" all you have suggested is
that there is an attribute called foo as part of the interface. The IDL
specification gives you the means to write interfaces that contain
attributes. That is exactly what WSDL should do as well.

In WSDL, saying

<interface ...>
   <attribute ...>
...
</interface>

should only mean that there is an attribute as part of the interface.

How an implementation creates stubs from a WSDL interface should be
irrelevant to the WSDL specification.

Do you mean getx() and setx() WSDL operations? If that is the case, then
you don't need attributes. If you mean that there should be a way to
get/set the values of attributes, then yes... that's the responsibility
of the binding specification. In one of my previous messages I suggested
just that.

No, I have not changed my position. It's the same. I thought you agreed
with what I was saying. Sorry for the misunderstanding.
