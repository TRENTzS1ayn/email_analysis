Ok, we now have an official meeting time.

Monday 12:00 NOON EST.  This will allow us to use the usual W3C tele
conference and MIRC facilities.  Note that the Properties and Features TF
starts at 1:00.

We will start next monday (this monday is a holiday in the US and I
promised the family I wouldn't be on line too much today).  I will send out
reminders etc. and a draft agenda towards the end of this week.
