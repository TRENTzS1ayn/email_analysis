After consultation with the Web Services Coordination Group (WSCG), I've
put together some explicit ground rules (especially IP) for GGF
participation in the Attributes Task Force.  I propose we begin to
operate immediately in good faith under this draft charter while I
expose it to WSCG and W3C team review.  I apologize in advance if this
review results in changes after the fact, but it seems the expedient way
forward.

Purpose (as outlined in [1]):

In the context of "stateful Web services", there is a need to model, as
part of the WSDL definition of the service, the elements of the publicly
available state made available to the service requestor. OGSI [2] has
the notion of "serviceData". WebDAV has properties [3]. CORBA IDL has
attributes [4]. This task force is formed to explore how to model a Web
service's state in WSDL.  The Initial proposal from OGSI [5] should be
considered as input.

Participation:

Participation is open to members of the Web Services Description Working
Group and the OGSI Working Group.  Members from each WG are appointed to
the Task Force by the Chairs of the corresponding WG.

Deliverables:

A proposal to the WS Description WG at the July 31st FTF on whether
"attributes" should be standardized as core WSDL 1.2, and how best to
accomplish this.
 
Intellectual Property:

Upon completion of the Task Force, and WS Description WG approval of
adoption of the proposal into WSDL 1.2, the IP terms of the WS
Description WG will apply [6].  Members of the Task Force will make good
faith attempts to ensure that the proposal meets the requirements of
this policy.  Upon completion of the Task Force, and rejection of the
proposal by the WS Description WG, any IP developed by the Task Force in
efforts to refine the proposal will revert to the OGSI WG.
