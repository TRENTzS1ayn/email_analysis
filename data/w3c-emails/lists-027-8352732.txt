You know only too well that for the last few months Jim Webber and I
have been arguing against the perceived requirement that SDEs are
necessary in the Grid community, even more so about the view that they
must be introduced in WSDL in one form or the other (e.g., as
attributes). Service Data Declarations appear to be powerful only
because of the OGSI view of the world, where each resource is exposed as
a Grid Service Instance and where consumers are allowed to create or
request the destruction of a Grid Service Instance.

My limited understanding of WSA tells me that seeing each resource as a
Grid Service Instance, which is defined as a potentially transient,
stateful Web Service with lifetime management related characteristics,
is not consistent with the Service-Oriented model but, rather, with an
object-oriented model similar to CORBA and DCOM.

If the Grid community wishes to define separate specifications that add
additional characteristics like Service Data Elements, factories of
resources (it's my understanding that we are moving away from the term
Grid Service Instance in favour for "Resource"), they are free to do so.
However, I am worried that such an approach will further distance the
Grid from the world of Web Services without actually that being
necessary.

Best regards,
