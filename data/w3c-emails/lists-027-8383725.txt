Folks:
To make it more probable that one or more of the Part I editors can join
us, I would like to propose that we shift our calls to:

1:00 EST
10:00 PST

Please express concerns on email to the list  if this time change is not
acceptable.  If I have not heard loud enough screams by Saturday, I will
make the time change.
