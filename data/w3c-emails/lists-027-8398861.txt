ATFers:
Note the new time for our Monday calls, 10:00am PST, 1:00pm EST, 6:00pm UK
Time.

Usual call in details.

We have one major action item coming from the F2F [1]
    ACTION: ATF to describe for these style uri for attributes.

And we should put together a straw man proposal for "syntactic sugar" and
how it fits with the component model.
