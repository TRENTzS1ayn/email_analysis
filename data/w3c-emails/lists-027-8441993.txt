On the wire, none: operation styles are transparent to protocol
bindings. On the other hand, language bindings will likely do things
with them. Additionally, other interfaces, e.g. grid or management ones,
may take advantage of these styles to recover the list of attributes
declared by a service and use that information for their own purposes.

We discussed this during the call and Steve Graham is going to send out
a writeup with all the rules. They're going to be similar to the RPC
ones, e.g. if the operation is tagged with the "get-attribute" style
then it MUST satisfy the following conditions: the pattern MUST be
in-out, the input message MUST look like this and the output message
MUST look like that, any number of faults MAY appear, yadda yadda. Plus
some rules to constrain pairs of correlated get/set operations.

I'm glad to hear that.

Cheers,
