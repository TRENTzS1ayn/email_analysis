Here are my notes on the "rules" governing the getter setter pattern as
discussed on Oct 6, during the ATF telecon.
(See attached file: getter setter pattern.1.htm)

The language captures the spirit of the agreement (hopefully obvious). The
language itself needs quite a bit of work (clearly obvious).
Lets discuss commments/concerns by email and focus on this during the
telecon of Oct 13.
