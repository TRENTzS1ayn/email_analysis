+1, well said.  My only comment is that your point (c) isn't strictly true,
as you could always just attach such metadata to the operations or even the
schema.  But I completely agree with your conclusion.  I think that the
service state and management space is a very interesting one, and there are
some simple and powerful things that can be done there, things which seem
like perfect candidates for WSDL extensions.
