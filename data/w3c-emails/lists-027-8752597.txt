- we reviewed the latest version of the report posted by Steve [.1],
reflecting discussion from the July F2F meeting of the WSD WG.
- there were no major concerns brought up.
- David stated he would like to spend more time understanding how OGSI
serviceData could be based upon the work in this proposal.
- William wanted to spend more time reviewing in detail, but did not see
any major concerns with this work.

- We agreed to send a copy of the draft proposal to the authors of the WSDL
Spec Part II (bindings), ie Jean-Jacques and Jeffrey to get a preliminary
reaction from this team in preparation for the F2F. [.2]
