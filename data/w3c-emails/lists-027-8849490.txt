Re: fundamental concepts only.
This is a very slippery argument.  Do *all* web services need the
sophisticated MEPs suggested by the MEPs work? No.  Do *all* Web services
need properties and Features? No.  There are many things in WSDL that are
not needed by *all* Web services, but are added for reasons of common
interoperability.  Our claim is that attributes fit into this category.  I
understand that you and Savas do not concur.

But unlike message exchanges, it is not fundamental to _all_ Web services.
Therefore as a matter of good factorisation we would expect it to be in a
different spec. Sure, that spec might be referenced by OGSI, WSDM and
others, but it is not fundamental.

This is a chicken-and-egg situation. You have to send messages to "get"
your
attributes then you send messages. Either way you're dealing with message
exchanges, which is the important thign about Web services.

Many other things are not forbidden by WSA. However WSA will be the
document
that architects and developers will look to for guidance on building Web
Services based applications. It's going to surprise them if we add
technology that specifically isn't in WSA with the punchline that it's not
forbidden. We shouldn't put the cart before the horse: WSDL should be
driven
by WSA more than it should drive WSA.

I don't understand this. My understanding of BPEL properties is that they
expose parts of a message as a unique "key." As such adding attributes to
WSDL complicates BPEL because now BPEL people have to have a way of
associating variables with attributes as well as bits of messages.

As outlined above, our position is that such an addition is poor in terms
of
factorisation.

That may be a valid point, yet even if we concede it we maintain the poor
factorisation argument has priority.

That seems to be a hot topic in the WS community at the moment. We wrote an
article on it for Novermber's WSJ, and Wener Vogel's excellent take on this
is also doing the rounds:
http://weblogs.cs.cornell.edu/AllThingsDistributed/archives/000120.html

Essentially it says that SOA and OO are chalk and cheese. Our take on this
is that OO is an implementation strategy and SOA is an integration
strategy.
You disagree with our take, I know, but I think our view is beginning to be
widely shared. Thus when thinking about Web services architecture, we
should
think purely in terms of message-level contracts, not in terms of shared
type systems.

Certainly we don't disagree that the need exists in OGSI. Nonetheless it
remains our view that this is out-of-scope for core WSDL.
