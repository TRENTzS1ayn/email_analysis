Our argument is that attributes introduce another way to describe a
message exchange, and are therefore superfluous.

Certainly properties and features may not be required by all web
services, but they do not simply provide an alternative means of doing
something that is already achievable. In cases where a declarative
approach to defining requirement/support for WSA protocols,
properties/features is the WSDL-provided mechanism. The same with MEPs.
They address a specific requirement.

In the updated proposal, attributes describe a message exchange which is
already possible with existing mechanisms in WSDL. 

Furthermore, as we suggested earlier, since attributes is not a concept
defined by WSA, it's going to further confuse the community about what a
service is since we are mixing implementation and architectural
concepts. Is it an object with methods and attributes or an entity that
just sends/receives messages? We believe that the current mechanisms in
WSDL suffice for describing Web Services.

Finally, disagreement is good. If we all agreed on everything, there
wouldn't be much point in discussions. No? ;-)

Savas and Jim
