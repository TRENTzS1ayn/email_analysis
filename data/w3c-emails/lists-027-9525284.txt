Not quite! After sleeping on this ( for about a week ;-) ) I awoke this
morning with a solution; Fixed values! Here is an example schema.

<xs:schema xmlns:xs='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema' 
           targetNamespace='http://www.w3.org/2004/03/MediaTypes' 
     xmlns:tns='http://www.w3.org/2004/03/MediaTypes' >
 <xs:attribute name='MediaType' type='tns:MediaType' />
 <xs:simpleType name='MediaType' >
  <xs:restriction base='xs:string' >
   <xs:pattern value='{pattern for media types goes here}' />
  </xs:restriction>
 </xs:simpleType>
</xs:schema>


<xs:schema xmlns:xs='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema' 
           targetNamespace='http://example.org/myservice' 
           xmlns:tns='http://example.org/myservice' 
     xmlns:mt='http://www.w3.org/2004/03/MediaTypes' >

  <xs:import namespace='http://www.w3.org/2004/03/MediaTypes' />

  <xs:element name='Person' type='tns:Person' />
  <xs:complexType name='Person' >
   <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element name='Name' type='xs:string' />
    <xs:element name='Portrait' type='tns:Portrait' />
    <xs:element name='Signature' type='tns:Signature' />
   </xs:sequence>
  </xs:complexType>

  <xs:complexType name='Portrait' >
   <xs:simpleContent>
    <xs:extension base='xs:base64Binary' >
     <xs:attribute ref='mt:MediaType' fixed='image/jpeg' required='true'
/>
    </xs:extension>
   </xs:simpleContent>
  </xs:complexType>

  <xs:complexType name='Signature' >
   <xs:simpleContent>
    <xs:extension base='xs:base64Binary' >
     <xs:attribute ref='mt:MediaType'
fixed='application/pkcs7-signature' required='true' />
    </xs:extension>
   </xs:simpleContent>
  </xs:complexType>

</xs:schema>


The required='true' just mandates that the attribute has to appear in
the instance and does not affect the workings of the proposal.

The only problem I can see with this is that you can't say image/*.

Thoughts?
