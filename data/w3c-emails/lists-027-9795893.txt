Folks,

There has been some discussion on resolving the issues on the media-type 
document. I would like to have a concall on Friday morning or Monday 
morning to resolve the issues if most of you are available. Please send 
me your times.

I have converted the document to the w3c spec style. I will post it 
today after the f2f meeting I am attending. The current issues are 
listed in the document and I would like to separate them out before we 
commit to cvs. Those of you who dealt with w3c specs in cvs (Gudge?), I 
would appreciate if you could please send me private email indicating 
the document dtd/xslt style sheets to use for keeping track of issues.

Thanks.
