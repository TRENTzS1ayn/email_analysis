I realized that the slides I was plannig to mail have non-IBM authors whose
permission to post I don't have, so in my prez I will instead be just going

Hi folks!

Here's a brief agenda for tomorrow's call.

1) Discussion of HTTP proposal from Philippe/Arthur (~10-15m)
2) Paco's presentation on WS-Policy (~15-20m)
3) Begin discussion of WS-Policy/Features/Properties crossover (rest of
time)

See you there!

--Glen
