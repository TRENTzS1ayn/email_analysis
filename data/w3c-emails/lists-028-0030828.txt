Hi folks,

I'm at www2004 in New York City.  Hope to see many of you here.  Feel 
free to call my cell if you want to have a chat in the lobby sometime.  
It's 610-393-1889.  I may even have time for a Tidepool demo on my 
laptop.  We'll be releasing the preview version this Friday.  I'll also 
be posting to Big Fractal Tangle throughout....

See ya downstairs!
