Dear Colleagues,

  please, find below the Call for Papers for DIAL M-POMC 2004, the Joint
Workshop on Foundations of Mobile Computing to be held in conjunction
with ACM/SIGMOBILE MobiCom 2004.

  The paper submission deadline is June 24 2004.

  We *TRULY* apologize if you receive multiple copies of this Call for
Papers.

              PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT and CALL FOR PAPERS

                            DIAL M-POMC 2004
              http://www.ece.neu.edu/conf/dialm-pomc-04/

        The Joint Workshop on Foundations of Mobile Computing
              Co-located with ACM/SIGMOBILE MobiCom 2004

                October 1, 2004  Philadelphia, PA, USA

* SCOPE

Mobile computing and communications devices will have an enormous
impact on our lifestyle over the next several decades. The mobility of
distributed computing components raises a number of interesting, and
difficult, algorithmic issues. This workshop is devoted to discrete
algorithms and methods in the context of mobile and wireless computing
and communications. The workshop is intended to foster cooperation
among researchers in mobile computing and researchers in discrete and
distributed algorithms.

* TOPICS

Contributions are solicited in all areas related to mobile and
wireless computing and communications where discrete algorithms and
methods are utilized. Specific topics include, but are not limited to:

              * distributed algorithms
              * discrete algorithms
              * frequency allocation
              * localization and location tracking
              * ad hoc and sensor networking
              * wireless networks
              * cryptography and security
              * error correcting codes
              * handover (handoff)
              * modeling
              * optimization
              * satellite communication
              * scheduling
              * site allocation
              * synchronization
              * telecommunications
              * routing, multicast and broadcast
              * dynamic networks
              * dynamic graph algorithms
              * mechanism design
              * cooperation enforcement
              * energy conservation
              * complexity analysis of algorithms for mobile environments

* HISTORY

This workshop is a merging of two workshops: DIAL M (Discrete
Algorithms and Methods for Mobile Computing and Communications), which
was held annually from 1997 to 2002 as a workshop in conjunction with
ACM/SIGMOBILE MobiCom; and POMC (Principles of Mobile Computing),
which was held in 2001 in conjunction with the ACM/SIGACT and SIGOPS
Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC), and in 2002
in conjunction with the ACM International Symposium on Distributed
Computing (DISC).  Last year DIAL M and POMC were held jointly in San
Diego, CA, in conjunction with ACM/SIGMOBILE MobiCom 2003.

* PAPER SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

All submissions will be handled electronically. Papers must not exceed
10 pages (US "Letter" size, 8.5 x 11 inches) including text, figures
and references. The font size must be at least 10 points.  Accepted
papers will be published in the workshop proceedings.  Submitted
papers should be orginal, unpublished work and not currently under
review for any other conference or workshop.
(Concurrent submissions to journals will be considered on a case-by-case
basis; inquiries should be sent to the program co-chairs.)
To submit a paper, please refer to the instruction for the electronic
submission of papers. The link to our electronic submission instructions
is the following:

** IMPORTANT DATES

   * Paper submissions due:        JUNE 24, 2004
   * Notification of acceptance:   JULY 23, 2004
   * Camera-ready version due:     AUGUST 4, 2004
