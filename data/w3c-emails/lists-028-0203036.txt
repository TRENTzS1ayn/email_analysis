"If only I could find an easier way to make a higher income I could afford a NEW HOUSE and enjoy time with my family."

"If I had more money, I could pay off my bills and enjoy the things I like!"

DOES THIS SOUND FAMILAR? We all have pondered these thoughts at some time or another. The question is, what would you do if you found a way to solve your finacial problems? Would you grab the opportunity with both hands, or would you simply ignore it, believing it to be too good to be true.
