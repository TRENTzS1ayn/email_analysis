Overall, I like it.

A few suggestions though... gotta suggest something...

It would be handy to include links to the specs on the front page.  for 
exmple, to reach the HTML 4.01spec, you have to click on HTML and hunt 
around... it's one quarter down the page ... unless you spot the HTML 
4/3.2.0 link about 3/4 down the page... in which case you then have to 
click yet again.

To make the list a bit quicker to scanyou could then nest items, e.g.

o  HTML
     - 4.01 spec
     - HTML Tidy
     - HTML Validator

The HTML link goes to the home page of course.

--------
It would be convenient for people with screenreaders to have links at the 
top jumping to the index, news, and sitemap (or whatever to call the second 
column).  Otherwise they have to tab through all those links on the left...
You might want them to define a class that makes them hidden to keep the 
present look.

It's good that you described the layout in the table summary, but the links 
would be more useful.
-------------
I looked at the use of H2 and H3 (using the WAVE, 
http://www.temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/

and although they make the size of the type right, they don't really seem 
to be the logical choice.  I'd suggest re-doing to use them in more logical 
order and then using CSS to get the sizes what you want.

------------------
Aside from that though, which is getting into the details. good job!
