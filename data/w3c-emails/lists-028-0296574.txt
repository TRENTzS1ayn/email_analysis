Taborder, yes.

The first links on the page (in Lynx) are to the 
different chunks of the page and let you jump the
long list of links:

   #Technologies | News | Contents | Search

Ok.

Accessible as the fourth link on the page (see above).

Ok.

1) All news items are marked up as class="item". Headlines are
   marked up as class="headline". Dates are marked up as
   class="date".

2) The alt text of the red arrows could be empty. Yes, that
may be better since the red arrow has not semantics other than
visual.

To draw the eye to it. The fact that it is the most important
is also represented by the fact that it is the first headline
(i.e., the top headline) on the page.

That's another option, yes. We should probably do that.
(There's some history why it's that way, but no important
history.)

Ok.

That's exactly what we want the home page to do:

Include headlines of changing news and
send people to pages (e.g., the TR page) with complete
information about tech reports, or "About W3C" for complete info
about W3C.

We had talked about putting a blurb at the bottom of the page
"About W3C", but opted instead for the "About" link at the top
of the page.
