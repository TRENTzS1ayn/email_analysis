Surprisingly, I actually agree with Jonathan on this part.  (I
disagree with some of the other aspects of his comments, which
I've snipped.)

I understand that the design philosophy of the W3C site is "they
can find out information by clicking on the 'about' link" --
but I think that is a very flawed, dangerous philosophy that
promotes unusable sites, one that would not be accepted in most
non-academic web design.

I agree 100% with the suggestion that any main page of a site,
when visited by a user for the first time, should give enough
information for that user to determine if he or she wants to
use the site.  This is a basic of usability and user-centered
design, not to mention general web common sense.  The W3C's
site -fails- on that, and thus is less effective than it should
be.
