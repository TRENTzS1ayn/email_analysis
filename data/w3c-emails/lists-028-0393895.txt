Hi Alex,

I agree wholeheartedly that we should provide links to relevant
information from relevant pages. So if the SVG and DOM specs rely
on IDL, they should link to the IDL definition or some relevant
resource. Same goes for ECMA script, if it is referenced from
a spec. Activity home pages should also have links to related
organizations (so, for example, you'll find a link to the WAP
forum from the Mobile home page http://www.w3.org/Mobile/).

However, I don't think the home page is the appropriate place
for a bunch of links to non-W3C specs or even to related 
standards organizations (except, for example, in a news item).

It would be useful to have a page dedicated to links 
to other standards bodies. The Process Document has some
of this information already in an appendix [1], and one of my
projects is to move this information out of the process document
to the Web site. The question is: would people naturally
go to that special page to find links, or would they prefer to
find them in context (e.g., a link to the WAP forum from
the Mobile home page)?

Thanks for your support!
 

 - Ian
