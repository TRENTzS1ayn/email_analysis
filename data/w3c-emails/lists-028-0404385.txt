Basically, yes, we should link the IDL/ECMScript pages except that
providing a link to the OMGIDL/Ecmascript is difficult. They keep
changing their sites. I asked ECMA to maintain the old URIs but they
don't really care.

For example, this OMGIDL page is still "under construction":
http://www.omg.org/gettingstarted/omg_idl.htm

The latest version of the DOM spec contains the two following links:
OMGIDL
http://sisyphus.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/corba_2.htm
ECMAScript
http://www.ecma.ch/ecma1/STAND/ECMA-262.HTM

but I can't garantee that these links will still be available in one
or two years.
