A frequent problem with the opening page of Web sites is that it is very
frequently designed by people within the entity on display and their
interests prevail even though they are not the intended or usual
audience.

It is difficult for those of us in, as it were, the bowels of this
technology to appreciate the daunting effect on a visitor who wants to
learn about this organization being confronted with (in a prominent
position) something like: "XHTML Events Working Draft Issued" and its
accompanying paragraph. 

Although this seems technically tame enough to those designing this
site, it borders on the arcane for someone who wants to know what goes
on here in a more "accessible" (lower case sense <g>) way.

I propose that the first page be even more of a link farm than it
already is! The just-mentioned "story" would have to be accessed via a
click and there is some concern (properly) about many clicks adversely
affecting usability, but that mainly concerns those who would be using
this route to these specific items repeatedly. A "news" link would put
the "off-putting" techno-babble safely out of view.

Just my opinion.

ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT - NOT PRIVILEGE
