Hi Bill,

Like many organizations, we want to announce news on the home page
as well as provide links to more detail "inside". W3C doesn't have
much in the way of news except technical news. We mostly announce
the publication of new (technical) documents and information about
upcoming conferences and meetings. Not much non-technical stuff
goes on here. We should also offer palatable forms of technical 
material, but today we are aiming at the technically savvy audience.

The Comm Team has discussed having "another site" (virtually
speaking) for non-technical visitors. We haven't 
dedicated resources to its development yet. However, the more
requests like this that we get, I believe the more likely it is
we will get resources to develop educational materials.

Thanks,

 - Ian
