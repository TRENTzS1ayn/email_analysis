Ian,

Do you have any idea what kind of traffic the various parts of the
W3C site get?  What are people specifically looking for when they
come to the site?  Are there patterns of use?  What's the most
popular destination?

That could help you identify the parts of the site to highlight
and feature prominently; for example, Jakob Nielsen puts his most
popular "back issue" columns in bold.  Something of this sort
could be useful to consider on the W3C site -- make the most
common destinations the easiest to find.

I'm enjoying the "openness" of this discussion you're having, by the
way, and I think this message archive would be a valuable reading
exercise for students in my Web Management class the next time I
teach it (http://www.hwg.org/services/classes/catalog/w201.html) --
you don't mind if I use this as an example that gives insight into
the "site tweaking" process, do you?
