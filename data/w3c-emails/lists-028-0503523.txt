About www.w3.org new home page :

I am using Mozilla on Win32. Wherever is the mouse pointer in
the main section of the document, I have a *very* annoying tooltip that
hides a lot of data. It shows the contents of the SUMMARY attribute
carried by the main TABLE :

  "Layout table: The first cell contains a navigation bar of
   W3C technologies, the second contains news, and the third another
   navigation bar of W3C pages."

***Please*** Ian, could you just remove that attribute until we
standardize the :tooltip pseudo-element ?-)
