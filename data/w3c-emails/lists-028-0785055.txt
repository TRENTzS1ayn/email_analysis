Hi!

The new design looks nice.

But I'm surprised that XHTML Transitional is being used. 
I would have supposed that W3C would go for XHTML Strict.

The design uses a layout table. I thought that was considered
bad style. Is this really tabular data?

If the window is made less wide than the logo plus the menu column,
the menu disappears from view. That could have been prevented by 
placing the logo by itself at the top. Actually this kind of 
"problem" is seen a lot these days on many pages. One single image 
limits the possibilities of resizing the window. In your case it's
not nearly as bad as in some other cases...

Bye!
