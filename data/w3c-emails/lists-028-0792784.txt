Hi Bertilo,

We tried very hard to use CSS floats instead of a table, but
the behavior across browsers was inconsistent and in some cases
made the content inaccessible. Had the results been different
across browsers but acceptable, we probably would have gone with
floats.

You are right, the data isn't tabular and we're using a table
for layout. However, we made sure that the results made
sense when "linearized" (e.g., when used with Lynx).

We tried that design as well, then changed it to the current
form in order to save a little space. Thank you for your input!
