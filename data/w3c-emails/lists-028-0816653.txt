Hello!  I like the new colour scheme that you guys have picked, and the 
way you've broken the page up into 2 pieces with a colour difference.  
However, I think you guys have overlooked the reason why people come to 
your site.

When I come to your site, it's typically to look at current standards to 
get information or to find some details.  The old site had all of the 
current standards broken down intelligently in the upper right hand 
corner.  Now, I have to scroll down and read a "blob" of information to 
try and find the spec that I'm looking for.  I would encourage you guys 
to consider altering the layout so that this information was back in the 
upper right hand corner in the well-layed out format that it was in before.

Everything else looks wonderful!
