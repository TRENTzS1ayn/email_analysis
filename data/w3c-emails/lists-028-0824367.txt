Hello,

Here is a comparison of the links available from the old and
new home pages.

-------
SUMMARY
-------

 - 72% of important links are unchanged.
 - Domain links have been deleted but are at the top of
   "W3C Activities", one link from the home page. 
 - Historical links have been moved from the home page to
   the Background section of "About W3C".
 - The links to the Process Document and Press Releases are
   gone but in the navigation bar at the top of "About W3C".
 - Links to four Activity home pages are gone but their
   constituent parts are available from the home page.
   The Activity links are available from "W3C Activities"
   and the site index
 - The five remaining deleted links are one off the home page.

There were 95 links on the old home page and there are 
83 links on the new home page (30 June 2000 at 23:40:24).
Links on the old home page are in one or more of the 
following places:

 1) The new home page
 2) "About W3C"         http://www.w3.org/Consortium
 3) "W3C Activities"    http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Activities

 Both 2 and 3 are linked from the right-hand side nav bar of the 
 new home page.

DELETED

Links on the old home page only, and where they went:

  Domain links moved to "W3C Activities" and site index

     http://www.w3.org/Architecture/
     http://www.w3.org/WAI/#Guidelines
     http://www.w3.org/WAI/#IPO
     http://www.w3.org/WAI/#TechnicalActivity
     http://www.w3.org/TandS/
     http://www.w3.org/UI/

  Historical links moved to "About W3C" (section on Background).

     http://www.w3.org/Daemon/
     http://www.w3.org/vl/  
     http://www.w3j.com/
     http://www.w3.org/WWW/
     http://www.w3.org/History.html
       (Note: History.html is currently linked from home page, but
              only temporarily.)

  Links moved to top of "About W3C" and in site index

     http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/
     http://www.w3.org/Press/

  Activity links not on the home page but their constituent 
  parts are in the list of key words. The links to the Activities
  are found in both the site index and the list of Activities.

     http://www.w3.org/Graphics/ (PNG, WebCGM, SVG)
     http://www.w3.org/Style/ (CSS, XSL)
     http://www.w3.org/ECommerce/ (Micropayments)
     http://www.w3.org/Metadata/ (RDF, PICS)

  Host icons moved to "About W3C"

     http://europa.eu.Int/
     http://www.darpa.mil/
     http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Prospectus/DARPA.html
     http://web.mit.edu/
     http://www.w3.org/Icons/DARPA/globe_80x48

     http://www.w3.org/Icons/WWW/inria_48x48
     http://www.w3.org/Icons/keio.gif    

  Other links:

   The Web Characterization is, I believe, inactive. It is linked
   from the list of Activities and the site index, however.

     http://www.w3.org/WCA/

   The CSS and HTML validators are linked from the home page, but
   the core styles and test suite are not. They are available from
   the site index, the Style Activity home page, and the Open Source
   Software page.

       http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/
       http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/Core/

   The list of W3C Members is available from "About W3C" and
   the site index.

       http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List
 
   The Help page is linked from the site index. However,
   the Webmaster help page is linked from the home page.

     http://www.w3.org/Help/

   The page of mailing lists (essentially a page of links) is available
   from the site index:

     http://www.w3.org/Mail/

   I'm not certain whether the site-comments mailto and  
   link to archive will be a permanent feature of the home page.

64 links common to both files (some permanent, some news articles).
    (67% of original links, 72% if you don't count the host icons).
