Actually, if you click on "keywords", you should go right to the
blob...

People have requested that links be organized in a number of ways,
including
sorted by domain, sorted alphabetically. We've had them sorted by
domain for quite some time, but for people unfamiliar with the domain
organization, they have had to go through the list to find what they
want.

So, we decided to leave the keywords in alphabetical order and move
the domain organization one off the home page, in "W3C Activities" [2].
That page has a little bit more description of each Activity, includes
links to the home page of each Activity and the latest Activity
statement.

Thank you for taking the time to send comments. Since the page is
fresh, we'll let comments accumulate a bit before we make any changes.
