I guess it's not so much the order that bothers me (I'll get used to 
anything eventually! <grin>), but the fact that it's now a jumble of text 
that takes *alot* of work to read.  I feel like there's a barrier now 
betweem me and the information because I need to look at a bunch of 
acronyms in order until I find the one I'm looking for.

The domain organization page is nice, but large so it doesn't serve the 
same purpose as the original.
