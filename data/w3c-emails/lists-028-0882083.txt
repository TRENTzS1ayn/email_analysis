Older screen readers may have problems with side-by-side text, it's
true. (I will try to get some data about this.)

Meanwhile, checkpoint 5.3 [1] in the WCAG 1.0 reads:

   5.3 Do not use tables for layout unless the 
       table makes sense when linearized. 

This table makes sense when linearized (for example, check out
with Lynx). We tried to use floats instead of tables, but didn't
have enough success across browsers.
