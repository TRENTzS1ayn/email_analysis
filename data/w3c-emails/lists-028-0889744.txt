Ok, well thought you'd like a comment.  I liked the site much better before,
better organized, easier to find things, and it was easier to see how
everything linked together.  Now its all in one big list like:

Accessibility, Amaya, CSS, CSS Validator, DOM, HTML, HTML Tidy, HTML
Validator, HTTP, Internationalization, Jigsaw, Libwww, MathML,
Micropayments, Mobile, P3P, PICS, PNG, RDF, SMIL, SVG, TVWeb, URI/URL,
Voice, WAI, WebCGM, XForms, XHTML, XLink, XML, XML Query, XML Schema, XML
Signature, XPointer, XSL

Ick.  Anyways, good luck!  :)
