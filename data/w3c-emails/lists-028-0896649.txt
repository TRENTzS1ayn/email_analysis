It is not evident from a first look that the second part of the 
right panel navigation bar is an alphabetic index. 

The only distinction between the two parts is a wider horizontal rule.
(there are also the practically un-noticeable "contents" and "keywords"
links at the top; Keywords? what does that mean?)

I suggest to add a short heading to each part, namely:
"Contents" to the first, and "W3C technologies A-Z" to the second
(this is of course inspired from the full fledged site index).

Another suggestion: Put the search box towards the top
(rather than at the end and link to it from the top), and 
change the text "submit" to "search". (make this change of text also in 
the advanced search) All the submit buttons of search
on the web say "search" and therefore so should the W3C's.
Also get rid of the search "options" in the overview page. Leave those only to 
the advanced search. The overview page is quite crowded as it is.

Overall I find the new design better as it looks simpler than
the old one. My motto is "try to simplify further."

Regards,
Nir.
