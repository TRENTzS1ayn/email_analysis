This is possible to get working without causing problems -- my home
page, 
http://chris.croome.net/ has 2 columns for people using Netscape 6 and 
IE5 and a single column for people using older browsers. This has all 
been done using CSS and it's XHTML strict and it's been tested using 
Lynx etc The CSS I used is all linked to as text files from here:
http://chris.croome.net/css/

It is also possible to get this layout working for Netscape 4 and IE4 
but I decided not to bother as I would have had to go for XHTML 
transitional due to the hacks needed...

However I guess you want non-CSS browsers to get the column layout... 
so no option but to use tables (yuck!).
