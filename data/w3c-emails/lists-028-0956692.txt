There is no browser sniffing on my site in terms of CSS :-)

All browsers get the default style sheet (or another if they 
selected a different one using cookies) and then browsers that 
support @import (IE 4/5 and NN6) get an additional style sheet 
which sents some sizes using em's (this is to prevent IE3 doing 
daft things) and finally there is a third style sheet only used 
on the front page and this does the columns and it's called using 
@import as well so Netscape 4 won't get it.

The only browser sniffing I have set up is a special message that 
Lynx users get! 

BTW this list archive is rather cool with all the Reply-to links 
set up to work really well :-)
