Can you explain what that means: "or another if they

This is absolutely browser sniffing: you are giving some clients
content that others do not get (based on their known support
for @import). Our style sheet has been designed to work across 
a number of browsers, but once we've decided that 
(and it's an all-too-small subset of the CSS specification) 
everyone gets the same style sheet.
