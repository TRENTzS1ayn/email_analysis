Hi

# 1 thing to say... GREEEAAAAT site... Those validators just ROCK!

Then the rest :)

1. Why is the CSS Validator front side so weired?
ex: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
Now, i'm not stupid... not much anyway, so I figured out, that the one with the 'en' would be english language, so I chose that one, but anyway, how about redoing that home page :)

2. I run my site, http://sk.lir.dk/e-skapehp/ , through your HTML validator, and I got an error for my site as following:
^^
Line 17, column 28:  
   <TABLE CLASS="back" height="100%" CELLSPACING="15">                              ^
Error: there is no attribute "HEIGHT" for this element (in this HTML version)
^^
Well... If i remove it, then the table does not reach the bottom of the screen, so it must exist, right???
3. Still q's about the validator, here goes: (It's a mailto:-link)
^^
Line 76, column 50:  
  ... ring; din hjemmeside &quot;e-SKape HomePage&quot;&body=Hej over-s&osla ...                                                         ^
Error: unknown entity "body"  
^^
Works fine for me... A click on the link opens a email messages with text in the To:, the Subject and the Body field...  
so the entity "body" is just unknown to your validator, or...?
4. Validator still:
^^
Line 85, column 50:  
  ... tp://www.dr.dk/nav/netplayer/player.asp?station=1&venstre=true">DR P1< ...
                                                          ^
Error: unknown entity "venstre"  
^^
Off cause it's onknown to the validator, it's a variable on http://www.dr.dk ...

That'll be it for this time... But i'm not finished validating my sites, so i'm sure i'll be back :)
Yours...
