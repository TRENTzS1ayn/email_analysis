On http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/W3C-REC, could:

 :active { color: #C00; background: transparent }

be changed to:

 a:active { color: #C00; background: transparent }?

It's quite annoying when selecting text on a CSS2 browser to have whole
paragraphs turn red, I'm sure that was not the intended effect of the
selector.

Thanks,
  David Emmerson.
