David,

This is an interesting question. According to section 5.11.3
of the CSS 2 spec [1], the ':active' pseudo-class "applies while an 
element is being activated by the user." I do not believe that the
spec intended to consider text selection as element activation. In
my opinion, your browser should not highlight the paragraph upon
text selection given :active styling. Bert can you comment on this?

Which browser are you using?

Meanwhile, I think we can change our style sheet to the
more specific a:active. I don't think we would lose anything in
doing so.

Thank you,

  _ Ian
