I am a webmaster who tries to keep in touch with the various actitivities of
the W3C (I am not as up-to-date as I would like, but that is another
matter). In attempting to interest others of my colleagues to do the same, I
find that there is major drawback in not having a single repository of the
current Recommendations. 'Instant Gratification' is unfortunately
undermining the effort. Sifting through the site is not a loathsome task,
but much can be said for the quick reference approach especially when
dealing with a superior who is unwilling, or unable to spend much 'sifting
time'. Would you, or could you, consider the creation of a Current
Recommendations option on your site? Thanks for hearing me out.
