I'm using this perl script: http://www.vex.net/~gonzo/scripts/

I understood sniffing to mean detecting a user agent and then serving up
different content to different ones...

If using stuff that one knows is supported in one browser and not in
others then just using CSS is sniffing as Netscape 3 doesn't support
CSS...

That means that you have use the first version of IE3 which supported
CSS as your base-line -- yuck!!

This might be worth looking at:

I don't know what IE3 would make of it but it's a column layout that
works in NN4 and IE4.
