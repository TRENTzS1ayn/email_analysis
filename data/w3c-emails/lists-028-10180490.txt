Hello:

Likewise, I use the W3C validator all the time.  I own a web design firm and I teach a web developer certificate program at a college in RI and I have come to rely on the validator.  Don't know why it goes down from time to time, and I've contacted W3C on this before but don't ever get a response.  Hoping it comes back sometime soon.

My company, students and I all appreciate this great resource.  On the days it is mysteriously down, I use another from Dr. HTML at: www2.imagiware.com/RxHTML/
