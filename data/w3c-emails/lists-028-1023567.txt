Dear all,

I like the new style of the page. But I miss the list
of the current Members of W3C. As describes in the
Process Dokument, the member Organisations play a
primary role. In order to find this list, you have
to go to the point "Membership" and from there you
have to scroll a lot. In many talks me had to
potential W3C members, they told us that they thought
W3C is something like a "secret circle". It would
be helpful to make the member Organisations more
visible.

Best

Henning
