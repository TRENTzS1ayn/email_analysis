Hi,

Recently I have noticed that I'm having a lot of problems connecting to your
validator web site.  I use it quite a bit for validating web pages and have
found it to be a very useful tool.  The error I get when I'm trying to connect
is as follows:

Gateway Timeout
The following error occurred:
A gateway timeout occurred. The server is unreachable.

Is this a problem with your servers?
