Hello W3C web site team,

Today I visited a MS related Seminar on the toppic Web Services.
The lecturer was making fun of W3C not being sure of the right
interpretation
of the four letter word WSDL. Apparently the header of the W3C website
Web Service Description Language (WSDL) says:

...<title>Web Service Definition Language (WSDL)</title>...

As opposed to the real interpretation in the text on the same page:

...<h1><a name="_Toc492291034">Web Services Description Language (WSDL)
1.1</a></h1>...

Being a member of the AC I feel I have to inform you :-)

Kind regards,

Bernd Beimdick
