Peter,

I believe your browser has unzipped the document on the fly. 
However, your browser has not renamed the file ".tar".

I just checked the link and what I get is a gzipped tar file.
I've seen this type of message for other specifications, and in each 
case, the answer is that the browser does the unzipping silently.
