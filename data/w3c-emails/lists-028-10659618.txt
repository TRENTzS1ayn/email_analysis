Your website is horrendously complicated.  

As a newcomer to HTML I was looking for a list of browser-compatable colours
and was pointed in the direction of your website.  

After 20 fruitless minutes of searching (even using the search engine), I
gave up, disgusted.

Yours sincerely

Brian Longstaff
