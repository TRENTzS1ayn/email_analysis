I noticed this typo a couple of months ago. As the submission
request[1] points out, the title should read "Web Services Description
Language (WSDL) 1.1", the same way the h1 element does (in compliance
with the W3C publication rules[2]).

Since W3C does not modify documents after publication, the typo will
stay.

As you probably know, the Web Services Description Working Group is
developing a description language basing their work on WSDL 1.1.  So
there will be a Working Draft of a Web service description language in
the near future on which the joke will not apply anymore. :-)
