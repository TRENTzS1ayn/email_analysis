In CSS1, the anchor pseudo-classes (:link, :active, :visited) have no
effect on elements other than 'A'. Therefore, the "A' can be omitted
from the selector.

However, CSS2 doesn't define which elements may be in the :hover,
:active, or :focus states, meaning that the browser is free to do
whatever it likes.

In Mozilla's case, it is possible for (at least) the li elements to be
in the active state, meaning that the http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/home
stylesheet applies the active pseudo-class to more that it originally
intended. (Try clicking on the bullets on the front page.)

This may or may not be a Mozilla bug, but changing the :link, :active,
and :visited rules to a:link, a:active, and a:visited won't hurt
anything.
