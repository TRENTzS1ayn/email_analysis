Dear Mr. Jacob Moorman (Quality of Service Manager, SourceForge.net ),

This is a Quality of Service Issue, you have a broken link on your page 
(http://tidy.sourceforge.net/). Your WEB site is poorly designed, not user 
friendly and really doesn't give a clue as to where to report a bad link 
on one of the WEB pages. All I wanted was better quality of service (which 
seems to be part of your job title though lacking in performance of 
duties), through a link that worked. so I could download the Tidy GUI 
frontend.  Things were so much better when one could get Tidy and from the 
W3C site, at least the links worked. 

Bruce....

Greetings,

SourceForge.net provides hosting for more than 34,000
different Open Source software development projects,
including tidy.  Inquiries regarding project web content for
the tidy project should be directed to that project, not
SourceForge.net staff.  Please submit a support request on
/that project/, rather than /alexandria/ (which is the
project used to provide support for SourceForge.net
itself.).  We state this on the submission page for
alexandria support request, but it appears that was
overlooked when you posted your request.

Various parts of the SourceForge.net site are actually
controlled by individual projects /ON/ SourceForge.net, not
by SourceForge.net staff.  So, in order for this to be
corrected, you need to report the issue to the tidy project
on SourceForge.net, as seen at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tidy -- not to the
SourceForge.net team, who merely provide hosting services to
the tidy project.

Thank you,

Jacob Moorman
Quality of Service Manager, SourceForge.net

Issue with the SourceForge.net site or services: You have a 
bad link to the Tidy GUI on your page at
http://tidy.sourceforge.net/. You link to 
http://perso.wanadoo.fr/ablavier/TidyGUI/ but the page 
cannot be found.

I would really like to obtain this GUI.
