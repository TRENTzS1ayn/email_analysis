Just a couple of humble comments for the Great Oz:

A few pages of HTML and CSS specifications in plain English would be nice.

Much of your documentation is legacy data, making people wade through useless, outdated info; I think that all docs (yours especially) should include, "last updated xx/xx/xx"...
