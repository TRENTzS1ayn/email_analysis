Hi, just wanted you to know I was quite shocked to find you linked into IANA.ORG. Every attempted and one successful trojan attack on my machine in the last 6 months origanated with their servers. Sent them all data and they have vere responded. So really am quite surprised considering what you represent you link into a server that seems to be a safe haven for everything from script kiddies to phreakers.
