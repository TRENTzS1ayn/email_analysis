Greetings,

I'm a student at the University of Glamorgan in Wales. As a part of my 
coursework I'm writting an essay on how XML and emerging XML related 
standards will address weaknesses with the current HTML based WWW. Could you 
please provide me with relevant information? That will be helpfull.

Thank you for your time

V.V
