Hello!

I am not sure I am writing to the correct address. I would like to make a
suggestion on the improvement of (X)HTML. 
I am also not sure whether this has been implemented already, but I think
either you or someone you can forward this message to is guru enough to
discern whether it is a useful suggestion or not (please let me have some
feedback on it).

Very simple, here goes:
When a link is clicked in a page, the browser should retain that link being
displayed until all the rest of the elements of the page have been loaded.
Thus, for instance in preprogrammed slideshows the user is sure not to
leave out any parts of the slideshow with hasty over-clicking the advance
one step button (link).

Thanks for the interest,
Thomas Tschoellitsch
