TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

 

We have just spent one hour trying to find the document that specifically
explains how to write an accessibility site map, which is compliant with
W3C. We have been told the document exists, but we can't find it and have
given up. We have found the site complicated, convoluted and difficult to
understand and to source the relevant information. 

 

Even locating how to e-mail W3C took us about 4 screens of information
before finding the appropriate email link. We think its quite ironic.
