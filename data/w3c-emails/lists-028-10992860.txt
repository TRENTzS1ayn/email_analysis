Hello,

I'm sorry that you didn't have an easier time finding
the document you were looking for, though I'm not entirely
sure which one you are referring to.

The starting page for information about W3C's Web
Accessibility Initiative is:
    http://www.w3.org/WAI/

 From there, following "Resource index":
   http://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/

You will find brief descriptions of some documents related
to accessibility, and in particular building more accessible
Web sites: http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/

I don't believe there's much in that document about site maps,
however. You may find more information on the home page
of the Working Group for the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines:

  http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/

Just yesterday we added a new resource that is linked from
the top of our home page: Finding your way at W3C:
   http://www.w3.org/2002/03/new-to-w3c

I would be interested to know whether, had you used this resource,
you think you would have found what you were looking for more
quickly.

Thanks for helping us improve the site,

  - Ian
