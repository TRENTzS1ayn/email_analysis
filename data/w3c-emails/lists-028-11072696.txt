Sorry if this exists, because I'm not seeing it.  I think there should 
be a place where people can post suggestions about various web 
standards, such as CSS.  As the World Wide Web Consortium is where all 
this stuff is put together, I think it's important that we can give our 
input on what becomes of web technologies.  If such a place exists, 
please reply and tell me about it.  Thanks.
