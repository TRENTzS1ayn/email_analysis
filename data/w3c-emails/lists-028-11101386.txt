Hello,

As of September 2002, W3C is using a new system on its mailing 
lists, to obtain explicit approval from posters to include their 
messages in our mailing list archives on the Web.

I have asked that this system be applied to site-comments.

We have hundreds of archived lists and although we try to be clear 
about the purpose of a list whenever we refer to it, we can not 
control how others refer to our lists. Therefore there is always the 
possibility that someone will send a message to our lists without 
knowing it will be archived on our Web site.

This system takes care of that problem by requiring explicit 
approval from each poster before allowing their message to be 
distributed to the list. For the vast majority of posters who do not 
mind having their messages available in our Web archives, there is 
an option to approve any future messages they may send to W3C 
mailing lists as well.

A nice side effect of this system is that it helps to reduce spam on 
our lists, since spammers generally do not read the replies they 
receive (and many or most of the return addresses they use are bogus 
anyway.)

More information on the archive approval system  [1] is available.

Thank you,

  - Ian
