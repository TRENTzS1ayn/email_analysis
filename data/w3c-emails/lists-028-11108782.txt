I have not found any place on your web site a place I
could download or find a list of all the HTML, XML,
MML and ect. codes in a list and how to use them and
what they wil do and how they will look. something
like a book type. the list i have found are to hard to
list for my records. and your site is to hard to work
with. Your site has to many links that take you
everwhere but what your looking for. I would like to
know if you have a list i could download or copy of
all the codes. I'm a student work on web sites and I
work very close with my teachers too. but with all the
new changes we never find the new codes, or how to use
them and what they do for us. do you have some kind of
book or list that show all this, and if you do can you
send me the link. 

Thank you
