Louie,

You should be able to find the list of elements in
each document that defines them. Those documents
are listed here under the heading "Recommendations"

  http://www.w3.org/TR/

For instance, for HTML elements, look under "Recommendations"
for "HTML 4.01 Specification":

  http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/

At the top, you'll see a link to the completed list
of HTML "elements":

  http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/index/elements

I am not aware of a place on the W3C site for all the
elements of all the languages W3C defines. However,
the site index includes links to "DTDs" (document
type definitions) of different documents:
   http://www.w3.org/Help/siteindex#D

Usually, the way elements "look" in browsers depends
on a number of factors, such as style sheets. So
a paragraph (<p>) element in HTML doesn't have just
one way of being presented. It can depend on style
sheets, how a particular browser behaves, or even
whether the paragraph is being displayed visually
or spoken by a speech synthesizer.

I hope this helps,

  - Ian
