I have been told by a website developer that your validator will NOT
validate a website unless there is text in the search box (e.g. enter text
here) however, I note that your own site does not have anything within the
google search box.  Have I been misinformed?

I have used the search facility to try and find the answer, and browsed
various sections of the website, but my technical language is limited so am
not quite sure where to look (searching on the terms I used brought over 1k
responses).

Thanks
