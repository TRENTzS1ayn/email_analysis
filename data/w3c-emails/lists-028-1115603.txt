I have to admit that when I read Sally's mail I went to the home page and 
it was not immediately evident that the Membership link was the "how to 
join" link.  The "Membership (List)" with 2 different links gives a clue, 
but at least I don't think people should have to go thru the logic of 
having to say, "I wonder why those parentheses are there? Could it be that 
there is some other useful information available from this line?  Maybe I 
can tell what's going on by looking at the link expander at the bottom of 
my browser window."

Boo!!!!

We want to make it trivial for even the most logically challenged 
organization to join (and pay).
