Good day ...

My name is Betty Hopkins and I work for Course Technology
(course.com). We publish textbooks for the education industry/arena. 
I would like permission to use the illustration of Berners-Lee's
original 
WorldWideWeb browser and HTML documents which appears on your website at

http://www.w3.org/History/1994/WWW/Journals/CACM/screensnap2_24c.gif 

in a book entitled "Discovering the Internet." We will, of course,
include photo credits to your specifications within the book. Our
circulation of each edition is 10,000.

Your consideration in allowing Course Technology to include 
your illustration would be very much appreciation.

Betty Hopkins
