Good day [Betty] (again) ...

My name is Betty Hopkins and I work for Course Technology
(course.com). We publish textbooks for the education industry/arena. 
I would like permission to use the illustration of Berners-Lee's
original WorldWideWeb browser and HTML documents which appears on your
website at

http://www.w3.org/Consortium/
<http://www.w3.org/History/1994/WWW/Journals/CACM/screensnap2_24c.gif>  

in a book entitled "Discovering the Internet." We will, of course,
include credits to your specifications within the book. Our
circulation of each edition is 10,000.

Your consideration in allowing Course Technology to include 
your text  would be very much appreciation.

Betty Hopkins
