What about <h2>More news</h2> ?

While I hear clearly your emphasis, I'm not sure we'll change it. People
will never agree on colors. We had a yellow option, but that interfered
with the default selection color on Netscape. If we use white on blue,
that breaks with some browsers. The number of color-related issues,
not to mention taste, goes beyond what I'm willing to worry about...

Yes, people seem to agree pretty universally that the list of keywords
is
not working. We will try to come up with another approach, I think.
