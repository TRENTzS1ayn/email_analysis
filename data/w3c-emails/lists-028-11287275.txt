Hi there!
At the time I?m reading a lot in your technical reports about XML and SVG. Sometimes I encounter grammatical ("syntax") errors in a document (e.g. "evemt" instead of "event"). Are you interested in replies about this kind of errors? If you are  then where should I post them?

Regards,

HJ
