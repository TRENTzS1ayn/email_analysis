Your document  "Adding a touch of style" has several comments 
regarding using font sizes that are not so small as to make the text 
illegible.

Yet, if you look at your "HyperText Markup Language (HTML) Home Page" 
on a Mac with the monitor set to 1024x768 (not an unusual resolution) 
you will not be able to read the navigation bar without much 
difficulty.
