Hi Matthew,

We do have PNG graphics available for the icons. The format
you get depends on what our server and your client agree on
(we make both PNG and GIF available, and probably will
add SVG as the number of SVG clients grows). In fact,
I believe our server is configured to suggest PNG first,
then GIF.
