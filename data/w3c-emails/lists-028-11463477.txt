Hello,
I don't want to make a comment but I would appreciate it if you helped me.
I am a final year student at the University of Durham and my project 
will investigate the use of XML to describe software components and 
develop a web-based component reuse support system to facilitate reuse 
of such described components.
Is there a similar application of the eXtensible Markup Language  for 
describing software packages and their dependencies?
Through my research I only found the Open Software Description (OSD) 
format.
Could you please send any URL relevant I would be ever so grateful.
