As far as images are concerned, our server serves the formats with the
following qualities:
- image/svg (0.85)
- image/jpeg (0.8)
- image/png (0.7)
- image/gif (0.5)
- image/tiff (0.001)

The W3C logo is therefore served preferably as PNG if the client
requests it. I agree that we should provide an SVG version too.
