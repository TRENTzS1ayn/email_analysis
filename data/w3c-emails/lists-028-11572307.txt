Dear Mr. Wakefield and w3c.org, I am familiar with Section 508 testing tools such as bobby at cast.org, Ask Alice at ssbtechnologies.com, Wave 2.01 at temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/, and other commercial testing tools. However, I need what testing tools are available for an Intranet for Section 508 compliance?

All ADA testing tools that I have found are commercial tools. Please help.

Robin
