        I really enjoy how everything in the website is all HTML. 
Perhaps a little Flash designs would make it better. By the way, i 
was wondering if you would know any HTML or Webdesign sites that have 
free tutorials for intermediate to advanced users. I know there are 
many but i havent really found a site that explained everything from 
HTML all the way to ASP and XML and such. If you culd help it would 
be great.
