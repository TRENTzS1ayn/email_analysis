I realize the URL for the XML recommendation, but it seems wrong
that

    http://www.w3.org/TR/xml

should return a CSS stylesheet, despite how many people in the W3C
who think CSS is more important than XML. If anything, either a
reference to the XML Recommendation or a 404 seems much better.

Thanks,

Murray

      Stop the Bush-Cheney Reign of Terror:  no war in Iraq!
      2800 people dead in New York? 1 million in Iraq, about
      half a million of them children. Sanctions against Irag
