Could we please have a little disclaimer/note about why we
used tables for layout on the home page?

maybe next to the WAI Icon, or at least under the "new home
page design" news item, while that item is still news.

attached mail follows:
The new W3C home page design (at http://www.w3.org/) is in fact an example <g>:

<table
summary="Layout table: The first cell contains the body of the page, the second a navigation
bar."
 border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="10">
