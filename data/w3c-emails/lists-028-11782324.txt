Murray, 

  the uri for XML recommendation is http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml

 It is a bad practice to guess URIs as a URI doesn't have a meaning and
is just an identifier.

 We are considering though putting a comment in this file so that
people can find their way.

 Thanks for you comment,

regards
