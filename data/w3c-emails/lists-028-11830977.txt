Hi.

A couple of W3C-site web pages don't seem to be written with the generality
that other W3C specifications (e.g., HTML) try to remind authors to keep in
mind.

1.  The resource at http://www.w3.org/2000/08/w3c-synd/home.rss does not
     let text wrap to fit the user's browser window.

     That page's stylesheet, http://www.w3.org/2000/08/w3c-synd/style.css,
     appears to be the problem.  If I'm reading the CSS right, here's what's
     making things a fixed width:

       channel, item {
         ...
         width:50em;
         ...
       }

2.  On the page at http://www.w3.org/RDF/, all body text is displayed smaller
     than normal.

     The stylesheet http://www.w3.org/RDF/rdf.css is the culprit.  It says:

       font-size: smaller

     Pages such as those at http://www.w3.org, http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/,
     http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/, http://www.w3.org/XML/, and
     http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml all seem to leave the text at its default
     virtual size (letting it display with whatever screen size the user has
     chosen).  The RDF page really shoudn't go against that precedent.

     (For more explanation, see http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~mudws/font.html.)


Thanks,
Daniel Barclay
