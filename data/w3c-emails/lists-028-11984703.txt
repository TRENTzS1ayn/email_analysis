When I try to search W3.org using the form on the home page I almost 
invariably end up with dozens or hundreds of results from your 
mailing list archives.

I expect a search form entitled "Search <organisation name>" on a web 
site to provide search facilities for the content of the *web site*, 
and not to include all the archives of associated mailing lists.  I 
don't think this is too unreasonable. ;-)

It is frustrating to have to either wade through all the dozens of 
mailing list messages returned or add a filter to the Google search 
terms (ie -site:lists.w3.org). Especially since there is a link right 
underneath the search form to a page entitled "Search W3C Mailing 
Lists"!

James Harvard
