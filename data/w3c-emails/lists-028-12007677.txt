You're taking McLuhan rather out of context, but readability is
certainly a goal of my pages. I don't know what you are seeing, but
all the browsers I tried display it fine. Maybe you don't like the
style. That's OK. It's CSS, so you can turn it off.

It prints OK as well. Browsers aren't very good at printing,
unfortunately, but this page isn't any worse than others. It doesn't
need a separate print style sheet.
