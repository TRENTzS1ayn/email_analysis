Hello, Rob.

Thanks for your mail. This is the first message I have received from 
you, and take your question seriously.

What you have found in this message:

<HTML xmlns:v="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml" 
xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40">

is inserted by the application that created this document -whether it's 
an email message or a web page.

This part:
xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"

is a good indicator that the person who sent this message to you, used 
Microsoft Office to creat the message.

This part:
xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40"

says, "Use the official W3C Namespace for HTML 4.0 as the reference for 
the markup language for this message."

In other words, it's only saying "Use the W3C standard for formatting of 
this reference." Computers can't automatially tell what language you 
wish to use for a file - you have to give the application a clue to what 
language or format you're using. That's where you've found the reference 
to us, since we (a standards body, not a company) have defined the 
technical standard for HTML.

Put another way - if someone sent you a MS-Word document, and you don't 
like the content, you don't threaten to sue Microsoft. You find out who 
sent you the document, and who wrote the document - in case there is a 
difference there.

Since I can't tell what kind of document you received, nor how it is 
"taking over" your site, I can't be of much help telling you how to 
remove it. I can tell you that you should find out who sent you this 
message/document, and take it from there. You may also want to ask a 
techie Webmaster at your location, or at Clear Channel, to see if they 
can diagnose the problem.

Best regards,

Janet
