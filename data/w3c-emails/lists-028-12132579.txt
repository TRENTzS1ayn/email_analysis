Dear Webmaster,

Please notify the webmaster in your group that maintains the following
site on 508 standards:  http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/

 

When choosing the document in PDF, an error occurs in loading the
document.  The error message is:  "There was an error processing a page.
There was a problem reading this document (110)."  The first page does
not display and any subsequent searches lock the document.  

 

I hope this helps.

 

Thank you,

Gary Morgan
