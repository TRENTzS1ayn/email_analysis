Hello, Richard,

Though I am not completely sure, I believe that the W3C list best
suited to this question is the WAI User Agent Accessibility Guidelines
Working Group list <mailto:w3c-wai-ua@w3.org>.

The list archive has some fairly recent discussion of access keys.

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ua/2003OctDec/

This is the group's home page:
