Hello, Evan,

Sorry for the delayed reply. For HTML and XHTML 1.0, this list from the
HTML 4 Recommendation might help.

http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/index/elements.html

Whether or not an index like that exists for any given specification is
really up to each Working Group and the editors. Many W3C
specifications editors read the public list spec-prod@w3.org so I am
forwarding your note there as well. Thanks for sending these comments.
