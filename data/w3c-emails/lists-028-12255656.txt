Hi,

Your W3C standard clearly specifies that all HTML tags should now be in
lower case.
However, right through your site, you give example after example of code
with UPPER CASE tags.

For instance... go to
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/present/styles.html#specifying-external

So... are tags upper or lower case?

You also state that every tag must have a corresponding end tag.  This is
one of your examples from that page...

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
   "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<HTML>
  <HEAD>
    <LINK href="special.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
    <P class="special">This paragraph should have special green text.
  </BODY>
</HTML>

And the end tag for <p xxxx> is where?

You are trying to the the Standards Authority, and you do great work... but
if you are going to set the standard, you have to live by it.
