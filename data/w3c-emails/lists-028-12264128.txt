Thanks for your very informative email. yes, the discussion does 
seem quite interesting, with some sort of international consensus 
being formed.

However, with regards to the W3's own website, although it has 
introduced some accesskeys (and these are very useful), I have 
noticed that there are one or two that conflict with some common 
browser's keyboard shortcuts:

B is used in both Opera and Mozilla for Bookmarks
E is used universally for Edit
T is used in both IE and Mozilla for Tools

I was just wondering if the W3 had considered expanding on their 
use of shortcuts even more (soas to set an example to others), and 
maybe also adopting this numerical scheme?

Thanks for your time.

Regards,

Richard
