Hello,

In HTML (2.0, 3.2, 4.x), the case of the element names didn't
matter and some end tags were optional (an SGML feature).
XHTML has more constraints than HTML so that it is easier
to parse. One of these constraints is on the case of
the element names. 

The HTML 4.x specification (which I edited) used uppercase
element names to help the elements stand out from the
text. We also used lowercase attribute names. 

So, if you are using XHTML, use lowercase element names.
If you are using HTML, it doesn't matter (and many
HTML authors use uppercase element names).

Hope this helps,

 _ Ian
