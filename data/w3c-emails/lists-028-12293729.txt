Firstly I suggest you organise your pages so its crystal clear where 
and what everything is. Secodnly i suggest a design that makes 
navigation sensible, easy and logical. I felt lost looking at the 
nerdy menus and since Ive no idea where to send my problem its gone 
to you.

Ive re-written my side using valid html 4.01 and css (its not 
uploaded yet). The problem i have is this: Using a valid doctype 
(html transitional) internet explorer on the mac screws up in a big 
way. I think it might having somehting to do with the fact i use 
absolute and relative positioning. The code works fine in safari, 
netscape, ie on pc even. The interesting bit is that if i remove the 
doctype completely, ie on mac works fine. Why is this?

Im happy to put a note on my site slagging IE and telling mac users 
not to use Evil Empire software, but would like the matter 
investigated further (there are still some mac users who rely heavily 
on IE).

Thanks
