Hello, Philip,

Some browsers including Mac IE in some versions have multiple rendering
modes. A Google search will probably turn up other documentation. Here
is a start:

http://www.hut.fi/u/hsivonen/doctype.html
http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/quirks/quirklist.html
http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/doctype/

I think you can get help with Mac IE in the
comp.infosystems.www.authoring.stylesheets newsgroup on Usenet and on
the Mac IE talk mailing list.
