Hello,

I was reading through http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/wwwsf1.html#GEN-Q1 (Q2) and recognised a trivial error in the spelling of a word. I am terribly sorry to bother you with such non-sense however, I felt that if no one bothers with such trivialities then.., there will be no room for correction.

Under the Sub heading of "Browser-side risks, including" there appears the line "The misuse of personal information knowingly or unkowingly provided by the end-user."
As you will note, the second word unkowingly should perhaps be corrected to become the word unknowingly.
Excellent paper - thank you ever so much.
Best Regards and Seasons Greetings.
