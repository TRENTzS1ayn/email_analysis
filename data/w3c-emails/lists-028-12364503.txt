Hi W3 Org Fans,

well as the year goes by i'd like to say thank you to all the nice helpfull peopel here !!!

I got real great hints about PNG use and will start my link engine http://www.hotspot24.de with PNG Pics and hope this will be a nice design later on !

And later in 2004 i will start new projects for webmasters like http://www.cashcorner.de or counter services like http://www.hit-counter.ws or http://www.free-counter.ws which will be ready in Spring 2004 and i hope you webmasters will visit my new free service then !!!

Wishing you all nice holidays and a happy new year 2004
