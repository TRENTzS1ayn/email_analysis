Hi Glenn,

Thank you for your report.
I fixed the link in the May 10, 2000 version:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-DOM-Level-2-20000510/references.html

I sent an email to ECMA two months ago and they replied that it is
too difficult to provide a redirect for the old address (thankfully,
the postal services don't work like this).

Philippe
