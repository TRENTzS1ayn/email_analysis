I don't know why, but Internet Explorer does not like the format of
http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/logo-REC .

I am using IE6 on Win2K (sp2). The above URL produces a broken image (with the
right dimensions, interestingly). I've heard rumors of IE having PNG bugs, but
can't find any definitive info on what exactly they are.

Anyway, the image in question seems to do just fine if I open it in Photoshop
6 and save it out again using Save for Web. The new file is a bit bigger,
byte-wise, but it works. You can see mine at http://skew.org/~mike/w3/logo-REC

I don't know if you are interested in working around IE's bugs, but it seems
like this one is a relatively easy fix.

Mike
