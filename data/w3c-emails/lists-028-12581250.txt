Hi,
In your page:
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/#html4
In the first paragraph under the HTML 4.01 heading, the last sentence reads:
"This allowed us to reduce the size of the XHTML 1.0 spec very
considerably."

I think this would be better if re-written as:
"This allowed us to considerably reduce the size of the XHTML 1.0 spec."

Hope this helps :-)
