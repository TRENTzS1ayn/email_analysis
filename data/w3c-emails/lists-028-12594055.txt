     Hi,
I'm a high school student in Turkey and I want to learn XML. I know HTML and 
ASP. But I realized that XML is getting more important. So I wanted to learn 
this language, I found some documents on the web, but they aren't enough for 
learning. So can you please help me?

                                Thanks,
                                    Duru Can CELASUN
