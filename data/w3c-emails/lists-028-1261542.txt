Ian,

The new redesign looks great.  Very clean and functional too!

I am sorry to that the "banner buttons" still have problems.
(1)  The .GIF versions have a white background instead of transparent (the
.PNG versions don't have this problem).
(2)  The images use colors outside of the 216 "browsers safe" palette.  No
excuse for this one!
(3)  The images use 8 bit (256 colors) when, really -- with just a little
bit of work, 4 bit (16 colors) would work.  If it's slow -- say so!
(4a) The WAI graphic  doesn't match the others.  The "W3C" part is too small
and the white / gold boxes aren't the same size as with the "mainstream" W3C
buttons.
(4b) The WAI graphic is 88x32 instead of the "standard" 88x31 pixel size.
(I suppose 88x32 makes more sense than 88x31 -- but then the other graphics
would have a line added too.)

Volunteers (myself included) have offered you versions that correct these
deficits, why not use them?  Better yet, why not have the artist you
contracted with for them fix these problems?

Cheers,
Bruce Bailey
