Hi,

Just thought you might (or might not) appreciate a bit of feedback 
about one area of the W3 website.

I find the 'Tips' that are inserted into validator results very interesting
and usually following the link.  For example, my validation result:
http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.safoodonline.com%2Ftaste%
2Fa8_publish%2Fmodules%2Fpublish%2Fcontent.asp%3Fnavgrp%3Ddiscover%26id%3Dsc
orecard
Displayed the very prominent tip:
"Cool URIs don't change!"
http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI

I was quite interested in the author's topic, so I worked my way
up one level and back down a few and found this interesting page:
http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/References.html
and this page IS full of broken links (I've reported 3 of them via 
http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/FAQNotice.pl )

So, this isn't so much as a request for a fix, but more a comment 
that I'm surprised that W3 is giving a relatively high focus to such 
old information.  It's information that is useful, that's for sure, but 
I'm not sure about making it so easy to find if there is no intention 
to update / maintain.  Even just adding the disclaimer found at 
the top of this page:
http://www.w3.org/Provider/
to some of the other pages not recently maintained might help.

I do find the information helpful and interesting, if I can assist 
(even with just the broken links) I'd be happy to do so.  

Hope I've made my point clear, without sounding like a 'nag'.

Thanks for the continual good work that is W3.

Kind regards,
