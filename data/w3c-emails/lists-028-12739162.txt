Hmm... I tested the page with IE6 on WinXP and on Win2000 and there
wasn't anything that overlapped, not even when the window is very
narrow. I just tried again, but I can't reproduce your screenshot, so
I have no idea what causes it. It's not just a few pixels, which could
be a round-off error, but the overlap is a whole word, so I don't know
what to do about it. Apparently there are different versions of IE6
:-(

I already made a special case for IE6. I can change more properties,
but for the moment I don't know which...

Thanks for the screenshot. I'll try to find out more.
