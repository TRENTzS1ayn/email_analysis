w3.org is killing my machine -- I cannot visit w3.org with IE5 on a Macintosh without having the
site freeze up my machine entirely (OS9.2.2 Titanium powerbook). I tried twice...same results.

Luckily, I still use NN4, so I can navigate your depricated pages without having to deal with
you attempting to show off what you apparently cannot do... manage cross-browser/cross-platform situations.


Very poor showing...
