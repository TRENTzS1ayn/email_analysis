Sorry you had problems. First thing to try: sometimes only a restart
will cure memory leaks. Microsoft recommends 8196k and I think they can
happen no matter how much memory you give IE.

Next try emptying the cache (Edit > Preferences > Advanced > Cache >
"Empty Now").

As a last resort if IE freezes elsewhere, follow the instructions in
section 3.12 of the Mac IE 5 Read Me. At the moment, a copy of the Read
Me is in the Microsoft Knowledge Base [1] as article number 258540.

That is fortunate. Pardon if I say that demonstrates cross-browser
success.
