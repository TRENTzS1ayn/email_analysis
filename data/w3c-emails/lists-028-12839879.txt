Hi - I just wanted to inform you that our new website went up yesterday and
we have included a link to your site.  Our main site is at
www.officestandard.com and the link to your site is at
www.officestandard.com/microsoftcrm/resources.html.  We are very excited
about Microsoft CRM, .NET and Web services.  Hopefully we will generate some
traffic to your site and if we can ever be of any assistance to you, please
feel free to contact me directly.  Have a great day!


Best regards, Pete.
