Amaya doesn't yet support the CSS 'float' property. I asked an Amaya
developer about this. They thought it would at some point.

Current versions of many popular browsers implement 'float'. For
example, many if not most Netscape, Mozilla, IE and Opera users see
columns. The information displays in just about any user agent.

Thanks for writing.
