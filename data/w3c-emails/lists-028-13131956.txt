In the message at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/site-comments/2002Dec/0003.html
Dom mentions that a rewrite rule is being used to override the
serving of XHTML with the application/xhtml+xml media type.

The rule apparently only works when the request URI ends in ".html".

If you use Netscape 4 or IE 6 to follow, from the w3.org home page,
the link to "HTML" (http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/), you are prompted to
download, and there's nothing you can really do to view the page.

Perhaps the rule should be amended to also apply when the request
ends in "/"?

Mike
