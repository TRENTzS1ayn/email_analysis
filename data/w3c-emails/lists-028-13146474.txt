For some reason I cannot open the HTML (http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/) page
in Internet Explorer (version 6.028 SP1).  I get a little pop up window
that asks me if I want to download the file "MarkUp".  I tried using
Opera (version 6.04) and it worked with no trouble.  I just wanted to
know if you guys are aware of the issue and plan on fixing it?  Let me
know.
