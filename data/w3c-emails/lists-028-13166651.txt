Hi;

I am running  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="main.css" />

which is what is listed in W3C commands for external link.

My doc type us  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
        "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

My tags look like this:

<meta name="description"       content="Two tier Affiliate Programs and How to make them Work"></meta>
  <meta name="keywords"          content= "2 tier,two tier affiliates,how-to,directory,home business,second income,associates,free lancing,partnerships,income,self employment,home office,work at home,reseller,money,revenue,residuals,cash,business venture,entrepreneur,on line marketing,tips,tricks,techniques,profit,full time income,part time income,marketing,promotion,direct market,guru,on line,Internet,Web,business advice,promotion,referrals,financial freedom,Ragabe,ragabe">
  <meta name="revisit-after"     content="10 days"></meta>
  <meta name="robots"            content="index,follow"></meta>
  <meta name="resource-type"        content="document"></meta>
  <meta name="aesop"             content="sales"></meta>
  <meta name="distribution"      content="global"></meta>
  <meta http-equiv="content-type"  content="text/html; charset=utf-8"></meta>
  <meta http-equiv="pragma"         content="must-revalidate"></meta>

It's giving me an error that it cannot validate my document because it is unable to validate text/plain.  I'm not running text/plain, I don't think.

I tried changing the doc to transitional, but that didn't work either.

I have previously validated with this type of head info and have had no problem.  What am I doing wrong?

Can you help me?

Thanks.
