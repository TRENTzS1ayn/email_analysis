All of today (2003-01-06T9Z/17), I have been unable to access the W3C
homepage from the URI: http://www.w3.org/ .  I get the following error
message (in all browsers):

> Multiple Choices
> The document name you requested (/Overview.xhtml) could not be found
> on this server. However, we found documents with names similar to the

> one you requested.
> Available documents: 
>
> /Overview.html (common basename) 
> /Overview.var (common basename) 
> /Overview.html.good (common basename)

I am behind a proxy so maybe the page had a problem at some point and
the proxy here is still caching the error page because it does not
appear to the proxy that the page has been updated (although have no
roblem with other sites like this).  Just as I was about to send this,
It has started working again so I do not know what caused it.

Great website BTW,
