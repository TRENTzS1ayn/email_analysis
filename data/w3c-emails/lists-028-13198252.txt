Dear Mr Petry,

There are days when one would like things different, and one
for a moment forgets all the reasons why they are as they are:
the issues and needs of different people all needing to use the
technology, and the hard work together which made a standard
come out in the end.

Of course, I cannot help you with your javascript problems.

The only thing I can do is point out that as far back as I can remember,
FAQs have always been Frequenty Asked Questions.
