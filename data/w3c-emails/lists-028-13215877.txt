Hello,

Can you indicate whether you saw this position
advocated?

You will find your position strongly supported
by the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines
(UAAG) 1.0 Recommendation [1] in a number of places:

  3.4 Toggle scripts

    1. Allow configuration not to execute any executable content
       (e.g., scripts and applets).

  5.3 Manual viewport open only

    1. Allow configuration so that viewports only open on
       explicit user request.

The UAAG 1.0 emphasizes user control. W3C does not
advocate that everyone use a browser in which Javascript
cannot be disabled.
