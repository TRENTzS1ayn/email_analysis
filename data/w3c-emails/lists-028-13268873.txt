*HELP!!*

I am in desperate need of documentation/user manual, etc. for amaya in
*.pdf, ps. or other generic format.
With these I may print them out like any book, keep for reference, etc.
html format causes to print too many pages!!

Thank you.  Have A Healthy, Prosperous Day!!

P.S.:  Are there any books on using amaya available??

robert
