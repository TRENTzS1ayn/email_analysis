Hi,
it would be very useful if you offered some html page templates, covering 
principal kinds of web sites. I (and many others I think), have no deep 
knowledge of HTML, XHTML and css's, nor much time and complex web developing 
activities to justify an heavy study of them.
So I'd like to find a simple template in which easily customize text, images 
and style elements like colors, alignment, etc.
In that way the users, and you, would be sure that many sites on the net 
would be compliant to w3c standards, thing not ensured with page templates 
found in amateur sites.

Many regards
Michele Alessandrini
