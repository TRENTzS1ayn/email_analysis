Dear w3c,

In regards to your deprecated elements in HTML, it would be very useful if
you provided links to examples how to accomplish the same effect with CSS
beside where the old method is listed as deprecated.  I try to keep my web
pages up to the current w3c standards but it is difficult to find
information on the new way of doing things in place of these deprecated
methods.  

For example, the latest thing I have tried to do is create an ordered list
in HTML that starts with a number other than one.  The old START= attribute
is listed as deprecated but no other method is specified that can achieve
the same result by a currently w3c supported method.  I have spent about an
hour searching the Web for an alternative to this deprecated method, but
none is listed anywhere I can find.

Providing examples of doing things the current way would allow people who
read your site to write Web code that is up to the current standards.

Sincerely,

Kevin Meixner

P.S.:  If you could tell me how to accomplish having a list starting from a
number other than 1 using CSS or forward this email to someone who can I
would appreciate it.
