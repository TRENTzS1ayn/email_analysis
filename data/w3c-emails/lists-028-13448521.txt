Hi

Enjoyed reading Amaya features on:
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Press.html

Suggest you use reverse chronological order.

When I first arrived at the page I saw date '1996', 
thought "Oh this is moribund" and was about to 
click away when I noticed that items below were 
more recent, and way at bottom a 2003 item.

Best to put most recent press item at top.

regards,
John McKeown
