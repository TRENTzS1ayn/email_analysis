When I first came across your site, it was very self explanatory, and very
helpful with the way it described how to go about writing html.

 

Now, theres just way too much junk on every page.  Its very confusing, and
Ive lost any interest in learning anything off of your site which claims to
be from the inventor of the internet.

 

If the original inventor is reading this, hopefully you understand and
agree.
