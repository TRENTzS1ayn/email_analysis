The change in the font used for displaying the W3C documents makes them 
EXTREMELY difficult to read ... and I am not vision-impaired.

It's seem paradoxical for an organization so devoted to web accessibility 
issue to make their own site so difficult to view!

Please CHANGE this, or at least give the user an option to change the font.
