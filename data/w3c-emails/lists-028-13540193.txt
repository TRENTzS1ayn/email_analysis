Hello W3C

I am a UK Open University Student researching Internet Protocols and have 
come across this page (odur.let.rug.nl/~bert/PROSA/rep-protocols) of useful 
information in my search but cannot find an author to attribute it to.

Links from this website keep bringing me back to W3C pages. 

Can you tell me if this page is page part of your website?  - just wondered 
if you have any ideas about who wrote the information and posted it?  Your help 
would be very much appreciated.  Many thanks.
