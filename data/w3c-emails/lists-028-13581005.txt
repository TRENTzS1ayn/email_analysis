Many pages on the Jigsaw website at http://w3.org/Jigsaw/ appear to not display as the author intended in the Mozilla browser and other browsers based upon Gecko (such as Mozilla Firebird, Netscape Navigator, AOL for Mac OS X, CompuServe 7, Galeon, and Camino).

There's a report filed regarding this issue in mozilla.org's bug system. You can view comments and add comments yourself:

The problem is that the Jigsaw-logo image partially or fully obscures the first line of text (i.e.:
the title) (in H1 element).  This appears to be caused by the CSS although I cannot be certain.  I would be grateful if you could check this out.

Thanks,
