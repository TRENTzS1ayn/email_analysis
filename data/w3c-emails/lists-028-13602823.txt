At Sidar we believe that the requirement to have default place holder  
text in search fields no longer holds, and causes some usability  
problems for people with motor disabilities. Although we have not been  
able to get a response from the WCAG group as to whether or not they  
believe that checkpoint 10.3 - Until user agents handle empty controls  
correctly, include default, place-holding characters in edit boxes and  
text areas [1] - applies we would therefore suggest the following:

<label for="inputField">Search W3C<input type="...." etc="etc"  
/></label>

(We would also recommend not putting the search into the taborder with  
a tabindex different to the one it would naturally get - i.e. in order  
to change its tab ordering, move it on the page).

I'm interested in your view on this approach.
