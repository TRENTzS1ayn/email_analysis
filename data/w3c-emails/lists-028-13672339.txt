I checked the list W3C mailing list, and there seems to be a few
inactive test emails.  Unfortunately, they don't seem to accept incoming
email any more.

However, URLs seem to be changed into hyperlinks (although the software
sometimes makes annoying mistakes).  The information on mailing list
format, such as mime-types accepted (text/plain, text/html,
application/xml...), font/markup, line length, and others, really should
be added as a note on the main page [1].

One other question:  What's the line length, then?
