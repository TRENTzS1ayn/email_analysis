I am forwarding my notes to you on changes to the web page "Evaluation,
Repair, and Transformation Tools for Web Content Accessibility" Page
necessary. I sent this information to the address listed on that page (About
WAI) and it was returned to me as an incorrect address. I am simply a
student in Kynn Bartlett's class who is trying to send correct information
to you about this web page. Below you will find the information needed to be
changed.

Kathy Painter.
