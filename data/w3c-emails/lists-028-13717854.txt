I wanted to print out a hardcopy of the new SOAP 1.2 documents and 
discovered that no printer-friendly version (like pdf or ps) was 
available -- or at least, none that I could find. Looking back at other 
recommendations, I see that this is true for many other (but not all) 
recommendations. Why is this? I would think there would be a fair amount 
of demand for a pdf option.
