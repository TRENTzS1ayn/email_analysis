The HTML or XHTML is the normative format for W3C technical reports.
Alternative (non-normative) formats like PDF can be provided at the
discretion of the editor, but this is optional and they aren't the
"genuine article."

In this case you will need to print the desired parts individually. If
you need PDF, there are HTML to PDF utilities on most platforms.

Hope this helps a little,
