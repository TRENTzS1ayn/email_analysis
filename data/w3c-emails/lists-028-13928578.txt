Thanks for fixing the above mentioned pages at W3C. It made my 
navigation thtrough the site a bit easier.

However, while browsing the W3C web site I found these pages do not set 
colors correctly (or set them in a way my browser does not understand):


Background color:
http://www.w3c.org/Mail/Lists.html
http://www.w3.org/Mail/Request

Text (and link) color:
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/
http://www.w3.org/Library/User/Guide/#Expat

Link color:
http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ (link color)
http://validator.w3.org/
http://www.w3.org/Jigsaw/
http://www.w3.org/DOM/
http://www.w3.org/Style/LieBos2e/enter/
http://www.w3.org/Style/css2-updates/REC-CSS2-19980512-errata
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/
http://www.w3.org/Amaya/
http://www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG/
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/

Visited Link color (only)
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/

Most problematic pages have only link color unspecified but most 
keywords in recommendations link to their definition which makes the 
whole text very hard to read.
