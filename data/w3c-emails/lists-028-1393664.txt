 I saw your site relating to software development. I am looking for 
a program that will automatically read e-mail, and
search for keywords and numericals. I would like this software to 
catergoize the e-mails into seperate folders. One
folder would contain e-mails that caontain one or more of a few 
key words. Another folder would contain numericals,
and the third folder would contain e-mails that contained neither 
any key words nor numericals.

       Please let me know if you or your orginization has produced 
this, knows where I might look for this.


                                                Thanks, 

                                                            Tony   (727)365-4326
