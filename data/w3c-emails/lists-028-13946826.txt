W3C is not a domain registrar and can offer no opinion.

I think off hand that changing hosts is easy to do. There are lots of
hosting companies. pair Networks [1] is one.

Changing domain owners will likely require the owner's cooperation.
ghandi.net [2] who registers domains might be willing to answer
questions.

In case it helps, the domain registration is in this database [3].
