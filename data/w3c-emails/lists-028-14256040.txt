INVESTMENT / MIGRATION TO YOUR COUNTRY
My name is SAMARA BLIN SAVIMBI, wife of late Dr. Santos Savimbi who in the process of regaining his political position in our country Angola, under went a twenty eight (28) year war with the Angola Government during his life time. He secured the northern part of the country, which was rich in mineral wealth especially diamonds and gold which most western sponsors took advantage of.
He walked into a setup and was assassinated early 2002, ever since then we had being victimized by the ruling government. However we stubled into a private documents, which he mentioned how he kept some $32,600,000 and few diamond in a security company in Ghana called Verith Ghana Ltd. Which is there as safe keeping of family treasures in my name.
At a great risk of life and death we moved from one country to the order to arrive in Ghana, and declared political asylum few weeks ago with me and three children in the refugee camp.
Upon approaching the company about our intention to receive the boxes as next of kin and owners, the company told us there was and instruction by my late husband that they should be sent to Europe where it would be claimed. Being the rightful owners, we are advised to move to Europe and collect them as this boxes are now in the Cargo section within Heathrow airport, and had given us the company who will clear them and gave them to as accordingly.
With due respect and honour we got your contact, during search in the Ghana chamber of commence foreign section, and decided to inform you about our position, and seeking help from you in four separate ways:
1.  Agreeing to come to our rescue in receiving this boxes containing these funds and diamonds for us and arranging a viable business which we shall invest this funds into and sells of the diamond.
2.  Arranging the full process to enable us migrate to your country and indefinitely  living there with me and my kids.
3.  We shall both agree on what percentage should be due you when you successfully handle the whole process.
As soon as you receive this letter and urgently indicate your interest, we shall urgently give you all the information you need to know.
a.  Certificate of deposit, with serial, and private coded numbers, as attached with stacking and batch numbers.
b.  Airway bill documents for dispatching the two boxes from Verith Ghana Ltd. Through Afgo Cargo terminal Ghana to London Heathrow Airport cargo warehouse.
c.  Personal declaration from my husband, to me and children and few more.
d.  Certificate of change of ownership, transferring it into your name, in Ghana.
With the above you will be linked to the London (UK) Company for the release of the boxes to you, containing the funds and diamonds.
Please be very discreet as to this business since our government is still in search of such funds and diamond through its embassy.
We assure you there is no risk anymore.
