hello,
i wanted to report you, that your specification of the dom-2 core 
and the appended java files do not match in content. the java files 
lacks the import node which is mentioned in the html-page. I just 
hope you forgot to put it into the java file rather than putting it into 
the spec by mistake since i really need this feature -- bit more than 
air to breathe.

i stay a big w3c-fan (except for dom-1 and html<4),

nick
