I just checked http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/java-binding.html and
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/PR-DOM-Level-2-Core-20000927/java-binding.zip,
and importNode is there in both. Make sure you're looking at a current copy
of the bindings.

(I would have been very surprised if this was missing; the bindings are
generated directly from the specification's XML source.)
