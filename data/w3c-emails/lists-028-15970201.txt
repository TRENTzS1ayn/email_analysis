There seems to be a CSS problem with the home page (http://www.w3.org)
when viewing the site with the latest version of the Amaya web browser.
The last line of the news sections overlaps the "Read the FAQ..."
footer.  You should repair the style sheet so that the W3C appears
correctly in the W3C's own browser!
