You're right, and I apologize for any distraction I may have caused.

I've been having a few email-related problems recently, and while I thought 
I'd allowed for the effect of these, I now realize that it was a bunch of 
messages that came to me by a different route that were missing the 
most-useful X-archived-at header.  Now I'm getting service-as-normal again, 
I'm also getting the headers.

Thanks for your attention.
