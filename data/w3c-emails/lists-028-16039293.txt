Hello,

I noticed this very little mistake, on page http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/tables.html#q2,
  table-header-group (In HTML: THEAD) 
  Like 'table-row-group', but for visual formatting, the row group is always displayed before all other rows and rowgroups and after any top captions. Print user agents may repeat footer rows on each page spanned by a table. 
It should reads instead :
    table-header-group (In HTML: THEAD) 
    Like 'table-row-group', but for visual formatting, the row group is always displayed before all other rows and rowgroups and after any top captions. Print user agents may repeat header rows on each page spanned by a table. 
That's all.
