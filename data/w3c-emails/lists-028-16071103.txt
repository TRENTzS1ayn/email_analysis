When will the W3C redesign their site? Currently, the site is usable, 
but isn't exactly something that would get anybody interested in web 
standards; it's really designed for technical people, who already know 
about them. Perhaps you could have another W3C-sponsored site "for the 
rest of us", or even links to other ones that currently exist. As well, 
it would be great if you could have a site devoted to getting web 
designers themselves to switch over to using standards.

I'm sure that you're aware of it, but there are some excellent 
redesigns of your main page at <http://w3mix.web-graphics.com/win.php>; 
it would be wonderful if you could use one of those, for starters.

Thanks!
