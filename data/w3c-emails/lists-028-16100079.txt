Hello, I just noticed that the whole right side of the front page, once
clicked, brings you to googles search engine.
I'm not quite sure if that's supposed to do that. :-)
Click pretty much anywhere on the right side of the page except on a
link, and I believe you will notice what I'm talking about.
