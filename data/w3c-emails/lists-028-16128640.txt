Hi There,

Sorry to you bother you all as I'm sure that you are busy enough...

I've been spending some time in the site and I can't seem to find any specific contact information. Here are my questions:

1. Who is actually involved in the W3C? Is it a formal company? Are they volunteers? Are they paid?

2. What sort of official status has it (W3C) been able to garner with regard to standards and the browser makers?

3. Your best guess as to why the browser makes refuse to use all ofthe standards set forth by you?

Any information that you could provide me with would be great. I'm putting together a site focusing on XHTML and CSS standards and this would be good info to pass on. If you can just pass me on to a page(s) that has been set up for this kind of info that would be fine as well.

Thanks in advance,

Kevin Whelan
