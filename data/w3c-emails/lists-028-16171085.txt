Thanks for the report and sorry you had problems. You might have an
plug-in mis-matched to Mozilla (they changed plug-in architecture).
I don't know about Galeon. I am sending a copy of this mail to Chris
Lilley, Graphics Activity Lead, to see if he can help next week.

In the meantime, if you wish, try removing any outdated "SVG" or "ASV"
plug-ins. (I am assuming you are seeing these errors at this URI:
