[This should be part of a FAQ since I think we'll get this
question a lot.]

We also published a PNG-only version of the spec that shouldn't
cause a crash:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-PNG-20030520/index-noobject.html

The status section of either version points to the known
compatibility problem.

Sorry for the inconvenience; we are hoping this software
incompatibility will be fixed by the vendors.
