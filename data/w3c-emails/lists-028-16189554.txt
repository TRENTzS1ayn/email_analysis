The page, http://www.w3.org/XML/Core/Translations contains the following
spelling mistake.

"Origianlly" should be "Originally"

In addition a more fundamental problem is the misuse of definition lists to
list translations of the page. The term

"Chinese (Simplified)"

is not defined by the definition description

"Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (W3C Recommendation)"

The description should provide a definition for the term, the current page
misuses these elements for seemingly presentational purposes and seriously
undermines potential semantic uses[1] for these elements. The website of the
W3C should be a "guiding light" to authors, and not cited as a misuser of
HTML markup[2].

I would suggest following the example given on the HTML translations page,
http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/translations , where alternative translations are
provided without using dl's.
