Sorry that you had problems. Its not so much what is behind the link,
as what is in your Mozilla plugins folder.

You have an unsupported beta version of an adobe plugin for the SVG
format, which was released before Mozilla made a major change to both
their plug-in API and changed which compiler was used on Linux.
However, the Mozilla and Galeon browsers you are using date from after
these changes.

As a result, there is a known binary incompatibility between this
plugin and both of the browsers you tried (both of which use the gecko
rendering engine):

You may want to consider uninstalling the incompatible plugin, or
installing a newer one: please see the Bugzilla report on it:
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133567

Please use this alternative link to view the new PNG specification
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-PNG-20030520/index-noobject.html

The content is identical, except that there are no object elements in
this version and thus, the incompatibility is not triggered.
