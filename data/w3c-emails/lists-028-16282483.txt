Hi I am trying to conduct content usability testing for the ACT Government
web site. However your pdf-located at this url does not open 
 
 <http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/checkpoint-list.html>
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/checkpoint-list.html. 
 
when it opens in Adobe acrobat, it provides the following error:
 
There was an error processing this page.There was a problem reading this
document (110). 
 
 
We have gotton people outside the network, and firewall to try and download
this document to no avail.
Could you please advise on when this will be fixed, or please provide a copy
of the PDF required for testing
 
Regards,
