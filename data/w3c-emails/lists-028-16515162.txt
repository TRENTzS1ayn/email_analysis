When creating web pages, I frequently find myself trying to remember if 
a certain element/tag is deprecated.  Then I come to the W3C web site 
to find out.  Yet, I don't think I have ever been successful because I 
typically drill down into the particular recommendation I am designing 
for and search for some kind of list of deprecated elements to see if 
the one I am pondering is on there and always get lost in the sea of 
information and links that makes up a recommendation.  It would be 
tremendously helpful if you could place, prominently, on the site a 
simple reference of what elements are valid in which recommendations.  
Or, alternatively, add a reference guide to each recommendation listing 
all elements/tags that make up that recommendation.
