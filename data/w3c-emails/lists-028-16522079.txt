Hello
I have sent an e-mail recently regarding accessibility - I think one thing that would improve ease of use greatly (for me anyway) of the W3C site is a bit more care taken with provision of navigation links - that is especially regarding the internal navigation. I find myself scrolling and scrolling and scrolling down miles of text and then when I want to get back to say two pages up, I am searching longer than I would like. How about inserting a few 'TOP' links?

Kind Regards

Felicia
