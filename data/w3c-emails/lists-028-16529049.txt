As was the case with IG discussion about the WAI page - there is an address
listeed on the homepage for sending feedback. Me experience has been that the
response for the W3C Home Page, especially on accessibility issues, is rapid.
In this case teh label element is correctly marked up according to the
specification, so the problem might be the browser or browsing environment.
