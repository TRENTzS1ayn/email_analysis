THE BENEFITS OF LIGHTING UPGRADES

Excerpt from TED Mag: Resources US Govt. D.O.E.

If a building owner can reduce the electric operating costs from $1.06 per 
square foot through new energy-efficient lamps/ballasts and advanced controls 
(producing a 50% reduction in lighting energy consumption), the following 
benefits can be accrued:

Net operating income for the building goes, increasing the buildings value. 
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Energy Star Buildings 
Program), for every $1 invested in energy upgrades, such as lighting, asset 
value increases by $2 to $3.

The property includes more high quality lighting and other systems designed 
for occupant needs and is therefore marketable against competitive properties.

Utility costs are lower, which can be used to attract new tenants.

Rents can be increased for existing tenants if there is a demonstrable 
decrease
in pass-through utility costs.

This is a direct cost-savings benefit in gross and fixed-based leases, 
increasing 
the profitability of the lease revenue stream.

"If your eyes have changed...shouldn't your light?"

The "Integra Light" [Private Label/Specific Specs] reduces 
eyestrain caused by glare, and brings the look and feel of 
natural daylight inside. Practically glare and heat-free, this lamp will 
change the way you look at your work.
