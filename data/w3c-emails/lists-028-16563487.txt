Hi,

Not sure if I've missed the point of W3C but I asked this of the Hampshire
Linux User Group and they encouraged me to ask you.

The question I posed them, was what is "THE" standard we should using to
develop web pages in. I've read the road map and that recommends HTML4.01
and XHTML1.0 and 1.1 so how can there be three right answers?

I can see there are add-ons for mobile devices etc that might determine the
answer for any one situation but my question relates to the general WWW
community.

For what it is worth the answer for compatibility across all browsers was
HTML3.2, but that XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2.0 are a reasonable choice as long as
you are careful not to do anything IE6 doesn't support.

Well hope I'm not wasting your time.

Best wishes

Steve
