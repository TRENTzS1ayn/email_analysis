Dear W3C,

I was wondering if you were aware fo the emerging standard 
scheme for accesskeys? It has been suggested by the UK 
government, and in the absence of any alternative scheme, this 
has rapidly become a worldwide standard, adopted by council, 
military, healthcare and academic.sites in the UK, as well as 
government sites in Australia, educational sites in the USA and 
Africa, and more recently, commercial sites in Canada and on 
mainland Europe.

Aside from the clear advantage of inter-site consistency (meaning 
that people are more likely to know and use the keys because they 
don't need to relearn a new set for every site), this standard is also 
for the most part numerical, and so is not affected by alphabetical 
browser menu conflicts, as well as being compatible with WebTV 
and mobile phones.

So to conclude, have the W3C considered implementing these 
"standard" accesskeys into their website?

Thanks for your time,

Regards,


Richard
