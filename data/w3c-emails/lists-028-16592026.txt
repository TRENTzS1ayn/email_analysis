" Hi Steve,

Just wanted to thank you for this wonderful opportunity!!! I signed up two
days ago and so far have sponsored five people. One of those people I
sent an email out to with the Tell A Friend System. I never thought she
would join. She signed up and bought another Team Member with her.
Never under estimate anyone!! Tell everyone about this opportunity!!!
I'm enjoying the ride. Thanks again Steve!!!! "   Ruth
