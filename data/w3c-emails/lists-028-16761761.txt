Hello WC3,

I was a member up to several months ago. During that time I posted one
message (
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2003AprJun/0446.html )
regarding a spam attack. Since then my name "nichandros" and e-mail
address nichandros@juno.com appears in Google with a reference to this
page. 

Can you 1) remove this page, 2) or change my ID on the page, 3) or remove
my e-mail address from the page. Thank you very much - especially if you
can do something to get me off the Google list. 

Thanks again,
Harry
