To whom it may concern,

I found the 2-letter language codes at the following URL to be very useful:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm

There were a couple of language codes that I did not see at the page at the
URL above.  Would you provide the 2-letter language codes for the following
languages, or let me know where I may find them:

Spanish - for Latin America (I believe that ES is for the Spanish
spoken in Spain, and LA is for Latin)

Simplified Chinese (I believe the code for Traditional Chinese is
ZT)

I also noticed broken graphics on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Home
page:
