To solve this problem, we could require subscription to the list
(which would be easy) and then we would reduce dramatically the amount
of spam). Furthermore, we are working on a way to allow people to
subscribe
to just one w3c list and then for those where they had open access
before, they
wouldn't have to do anything special.

In short, we are all suffering from the amount of spam we are getting
and we're trying to find reasonable solutions.

Stay tuned!
