Dear Reader,

First, thanks for all the work you've put into the w3
site.  Generally, the site is well designed.

Unfortunately, one aspect that I find frustrating is the inability
to download the DTD files for the various standards.  For example,
for the xhtml-1.1 standard, the file xhtml11-framework-1.mod is
referenced but it appears not to be available on your site.  This
renders the standard useless to me.

Could you provide a section of your site that allows downloading of
the DTD files directly without going through the standard
document?  Maintaining previous versions would be useful as well.

Thanks,

-- 
Jean Pierre
