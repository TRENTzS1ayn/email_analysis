    Branded Identity or Fund Raiser

    In the never ending search for a custom made item that will promote THE 
NAME 
    of your company or website, I present The Amazing Dip-er-do Stunt Plane :

    Using only AIR, these stunt planes Loop, Circle and Return Ready to Fly.
    They also have YOUR COMPANY logo, message or website address printed on 
the plane's
    wingspan.
    These stunt planes are for anyone who has ever used a keychain, mug, or 
    T-Shirt to advertise their company. These (collapsible) stunt planes are 
custom 
    designed for YOUR COMPANY and come in their own envelope with flying 
instructions. They mail / travel 
    flat and pop open for easy use . A typical purchase lasts 1-3 years, 
provides 
    immediate, soul-satisfying amenities and costs $2000 - $12000. These 
planes are 
    truly Amazing and will put your business in a favorable light. Give it 
away 
    to prospects (the personal touch) or use it as an order stuffer (show 'em 
you 
    care) -- it's the best marketing device because it works!

   Stunt planes are palm-sized and manufactured in The USA.
   Markets we serve : retail, individual & corporate/affinity group
