Thanks for the suggestion.

What is the URI for the "w3 schools site"? I found two in a quick search
at http://www.google.com/ and they don't appear to be associated with W3C.

The only other thing I think of is the new course offerings at the
W3C Netherlands Office which currently is on the home page news.

Best wishes,
