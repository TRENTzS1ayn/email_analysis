Hello From OmPlace

In an effort to maintain a current city-by-city Contra Dance 
Guide, we have added Contra dancing to the OmPlace City Guide.
Please check the listing for your area to see if the 
information is current. If your dance group or Community is not 
listed, please email us or use the form provided. Go to:
http://www.omplace.net  Click on City Guide

We are interested in other types of dance, as well as listing 
other social groups. If you have any suggestions please 
contact us at mailto:dmdesigns@mindspring.com
We are interested in dance related articles for our NewsRoom
as well. 

Additionally, we offer Community Profiles. This is a resource 
that allows you to contact people around the world who share 
similar interests, dancing and otherwise. Please signup for a 
free listing if you are interested in participating.

Peace and Blessings
Editors of OmPlace
