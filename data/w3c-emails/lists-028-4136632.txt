I followed an old bookmarks to

http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/

and I was told "Sorry, Forbidden."

When I made my way back to the home page http://www.w3.org/,
i found that it lists publicly accessible and restricted URLs without
any indication to distinguish between them.

Rather confusing.

(by the way, I was looking for an HTMl reference guide which sued to be
publicly accessible)
