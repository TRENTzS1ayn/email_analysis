Ranjeeth,

W3C doesn't have a process by which XML applications are registered.
You will find some information about XML applications linked
from the XML Activity page (http://www.w3.org/XML/). You might
also check out http://www.xml.org/, which includes a registry 
that seems to be along the lines of what you're looking for.

I hope this helps,

 - Ian
