Hi!

I tried to get the following specs
  DOM Level 3 Core Specification
  DOM Level 3 Events Specification
  DOM Level 3 Content Models and Load and Save Specification
from your site.

I get Error 403:
We're sorry but the link you tried to access is forbidden.

I dont understand that because they are announced as:
first *public* working drafts?

Maybe I misunderstood that?

Thanks and best regards
Karl-Horst
