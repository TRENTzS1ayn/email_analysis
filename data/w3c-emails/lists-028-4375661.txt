Hello comrades,
Ever heard of pdf? It's a format capable of delivering high
quality text for easy online reading. That is if the whole thing
isn't ruined by visible link boxes! (that's hint number 1).
Pdf doesn't have to be stuffed to be accessible on the web.
Especially not in a mac-unfriendly gzip format. (that's hint
number 2). I have tried both on a Mac and on a PC to download
the HTML401 spec in pdf format. (http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/html40.pdf.gz)
In both cases I get error messages that say the file is corrupted.
Please, don't be geeky and give us the plain pdf and loose the
visible link boxes in the file. And if you must compress do it in
formats that can be read.

Sorry, pissed off.

Steven Scholten
