To whom it may concern,
The following page has the following page has a legend with the
line below. The alphabets in the parenthesis is the letter used to
represent the word.

http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/index/elements.html

[...] (F)orbidden, (E)mpty, (D)eprecated, (L)oose DTD, (F)rameset DTD

Unfortunately, the representation for "Forbidden" and "Framset DTD"
are BOTH "F". This is potentially misleading, and should probably be
changed to make it clearer. Thank you for your attention.
