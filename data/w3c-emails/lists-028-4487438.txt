I cannot answer your first comment, but I can answer your second one.

GZIP is an encoding format describe in RFC1952 which has been developped
to be platform independent.

It is one of the 4 content coding listed in the HTTP/1.1 specification
(RFC2616, section 3.5) and is served as such by our Web server:

Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 962329
Content-Type: application/pdf; qs=0.001

As far as I know, most of the programs able to uncompress ZIP files can
uncompress GZIP files (WinZip for example - I am not a Mac person so I
can't speak about Macs).

The file sometimes _appears_ to be corrupted because the Web browser
uncompresses the file on the fly and names it html40.pdf.gz whereas once
uncompressed it is PDF and should most likely be named html40.pdf, or
doesn't modify the file and names it html40.pdf instead of html40.pdf.gz
since in this case it is still GZIP'ed (I have seen such behaviors on
PCs).

Basically, we are compressing the PDF file to save bandwidth and reduce
the downloading time (the file would be 3 times bigger uncompressed) in
a standard way.
