It is a royal pain in the behind to have to specify colours as hex 
numbers in css style sheets, just because browser makers can't get 
together on a set of standard colour names and their precise 
definitions.

I enclose the list used by Netscape and suggest you make it an 
official standard or at least post it on your site as a suggested 
set.
