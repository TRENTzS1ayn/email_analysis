Hello,

I am working at CERN, and I am presently the CNL (Computer
NewsLetter) editor. We are producing a special edition to celebrate the
35th birthday. For this I reproduced (and slightly reviewed) your
page at http://www.w3.org/History.html. 
Can you please have a look at the article, at
http://ref.cern.ch/CERN/CNL/2001/001/www-history/
and confirm if it is OK, regards copyright ? 

Thanks for a (quick) feedback.

Regards,
Nicole.
