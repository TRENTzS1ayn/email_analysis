Hello Jose!

Thanks for the tip - WinZIP was in fact able to handle the two 
part extraction (TGZ->Tar->DIC), but it wasn't particularily "easy" - 
I would still be in favor of providing the dictionaries in ZIP-format, 
which is much more familiar to PC-users, easier to extract, and 
gives the same or better compression ratio as TGZ.

Thanks again!
