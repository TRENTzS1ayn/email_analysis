In general, no; there are some which have begun to create tools which
do this but the average visual web authoring tool does not easily
create valid HTML, let alone valid HTML strict.

Things may be changing soon with the increasing use of XML and XHTML,
which -require- greater attention to syntax and validity.  The next
generation of tools will hopefully be XML-based and thus be able
to create code against a certain DTD or schema.
