Hi there,

It's a common habit for news sites to include a short "permalink" at the end
of each story, pointing to a persistent URI in the news archive for people
to link to, etc. Unfortunately, the W3C site does not have any such URI,
since news stories are not given a place in the archive until they are
removed from the home page. It would be great if you could pre-create these
URIs like:

    http://www.w3.org/News/#e20010406

That way they could be included at the end of each news blurb and included
in the RSS file. This is important because, as it stands now your RSS file
speaks about the page the news item talks about, as opposed to the news item
itself. This leads to invalid RDF assertions, such as the statement that

    http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xhtml-modularization-20010410/
      is titled
    "XHTML Modularization Becomes W3C Recommendation"

It would be great if you could fix this, and it would be a simple change.
All that would have to be done is the inclusion of news items on the /News
page as soon as they are added to the homepage.

Thanks for your help,
