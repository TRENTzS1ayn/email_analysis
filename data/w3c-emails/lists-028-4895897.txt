Hello,

I would just like to add to Dominique's comments that I agree
that it would be useful to have more of our pages translated
into different languages. Our primary problem is resources:
while we have an international Team, the Team doesn't have time
to do its work and to translate all of our documents into
all known languages. So we rely on the public to help. 

Let us know if you are interesting in translating any
of the materials on the site. 

Thank you,

 - Ian
