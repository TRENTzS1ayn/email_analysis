Typing HDML in our search box in our home page gives me this
page:
http://search.w3.org/Public/cgi-bin/query?mss=simple&pg=q&what=web&filter=w3c&fmt=.&q=HDML

with links to:
http://www.w3.org/Submission/1997/5/
http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-Submission-HDML.html
and http://www.w3.org/Submission/1997/5/Comment.html

Typing compactHTML (aka cHTML) in the same search box:
http://search.w3.org/Public/cgi-bin/query?mss=simple&pg=q&what=web&filter=w3c&fmt=.&q=compactHTML

with link to http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-compactHTML-19980209/

By the way, knowing that cHTML is related to XHTML basic, I can find
this link at http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/#a_refs the references for
XHTML Basic.

We have a list of all our published technical reports available
at:
http://www.w3.org/TR/

As you may see, this list is already very long and it wouldn't make
sense to display all these references on our home page.

We are always looking for making our site better: the task is
really not easy as our site is really big, but any advices are very
welcome!
