All our technical reports are listed on one page:

I agree they should be linked from other pages as well, but you
have to consider one point: to put a link in the HTML home page to a
"thing we don't recommend" is giving it a much bigger impact than what
we want: users will go and see it more often, and further more, search
engines ala Google will give it a much bigger weight in their results.

Thank you very much for your input! I will do my best to ask to the
different maintainers of the different pages to take them in
consideration when they design and update their pages.
