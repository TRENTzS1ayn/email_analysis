Hello,
    Whenever I use your CSS validator tool it always displays the results to
me in Japanese. I am physically located in Tokyo and the operating system on
my computer at work is Japanese Windows 2,000. However my browser is English
Explorer 5.5.
    I would prefer to be able to see the results of your CSS validator in
English. Could you either provide links to different language versions on
the results page or change your system to look at the language of the
browser rather than the operating system? You could also check to see if the
user is coming from the English version of your home page. (Even if I go to
http://www.w3.org/ which is in English and click on the link to the CSS
Validator it redirects me to the Japanese language Validator page.)

Thanks,
Kristin
