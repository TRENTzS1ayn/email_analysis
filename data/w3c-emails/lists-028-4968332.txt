To:"'site-comments@w3.org'"<site-comments@w3.org>

I respectfully suggest that the W3 lists main archive index pages (like
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/site-comments/> for example) should
include links to (1) the area one the W3 site the list reference, (2) a list
FAQ, (3) contact information for the moderator of the list (this last bit of
information would ideally be easily found under (1) and (2) as well, but it
REALLY needs to be a single click away from the main topic index.  Thanks.
