Dear Web Developer:
I should first of all appreciate your hard and nice working. Secondly I
would like to say that I have recently got an admission with CIW in BMS
in Islamabad Pakistan. Your Site has been given to me by our respectful
teacher Mr. M. Tawfiq Khan. I found everything so useful for me walking
around in your site. I would like to kindly bring it into your attention
that there are some spelling and grammar mistakes when you go into a
link. These mistakes that mostly relate to some technical points should
be corrected so that the browser get correct information.

Thanks for your good understanding.

Best regards,
Aziz Samadi
