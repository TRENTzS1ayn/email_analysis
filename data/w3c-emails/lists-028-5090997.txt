I find it somewhat ironic that in attempting to use your own standards,
XHTML/XML, you've "broken" access to all the HTML and XHTML pages. I am using
MacOS 8.6.1, MSIE 4.5 and the /MarkUp pages for HTML and XHTML display raw code!

I would like a PDF of the XHTML guidelines and tags for starting a new web
project...can you provide an FTP address or fix the pages in question or provide
a direct URL?
