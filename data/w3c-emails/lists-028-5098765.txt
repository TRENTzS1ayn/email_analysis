It sounds like you are looking at the page http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/
which has this XML declaration:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

Unfortunately that is a known bug in MSIE 4.5 Mac, only for XHTML (XML)
documents with an XML declaration (which is optional). I had the same
problem for years and then, inexplicably, it went away one day. You may
want to report it to Microsoft by subscribing to this mailing list:

If you have a PowerMac or later, MacIE 5.0 will run in Mac OS 7.6.1 and
later. System requirements:

As you are a Web developer, you may be interested to know that in MacIE
5.0, XHTML documents with an XML declaration may not display offline.
When working locally, I cut that line, and then add it before uploading.

For XHTML 1.0 (the entire specification) the PDF version is:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xhtml1-20000126/xhtml1.pdf

If you need any other links, please let us know.
