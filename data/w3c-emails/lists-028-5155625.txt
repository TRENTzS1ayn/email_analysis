Nigel,

Thanks for your comments. Do you have URLs to specific
pages that specify serif fonts? Many of our pages (e.g.,
the home page, tech reports) use a style sheet that does not
specify a font style for text (at least most text). So
you may be getting a serif font due to your browser
settings. If you have URIs to pages that specify serif-fonts,
please let the owner of the page know.

Of you have other design suggestions, this is the forum for
discussing them.

Thank you,

 - Ian
