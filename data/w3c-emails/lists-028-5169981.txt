Hi my name is Jason and I have been visiting w3 for a few months now. I am 
trying to learn web-site design and enjoy the turorials. However now that 
the site has been redesigned I cannot find any tutorials. I see the links to 
tutorials but none of these have the online ones you can do by example. I 
may not be looking in the correct place and will continue to try to find 
them. Do you have a web address for the site the way it was before you 
redesigned it? I am sure it will grow on me, but I really loved those online 
tutorials and now I cannot find them, where before I would just click on the 
tutorial on the left menu and would go straight to it. Thanks in advance.

Jason
