I have two questions and possible bugs.

First, the following code was given to me by the CSS validator when my site http://bwbohh.net was sucessfully validated. This code is clearly not XHTML compliant.

<p>
 <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">
 <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
       src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss" 
   alt="Valid CSS!">
 </a>
</p>

The following would be compliant, placing a /> in the img tag.

 <p>
  <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">
   <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
         src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss" 
 alt="Valid CSS!" />
  </a>   
</p>
   
Secondly, is <meta /> not legal in HTML 4.1 transitional? It killed the validator, thinking that I had closed the </head> tag. In order to keep both HTML 4.1 transitional and XHTML transitional compliance, I was forced to do <meta></meta>. As far as I know, this is a bug in the validator.. but maybe you can enlighten me.
