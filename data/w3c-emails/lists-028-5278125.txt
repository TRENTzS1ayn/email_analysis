..>WHAT< is this Google promotion doing
on the W3C front page?  Google is a private,
for-profit organization.  I certainly would not
expect to see the W3C providing promotions
for private companies.  My company has paid
$5,000 for membership in the W3C.  Can we
have a promotion on your front page?
Be assured that I will raise this issue as rapidly
as possible to the highest possible level in the
organization.
