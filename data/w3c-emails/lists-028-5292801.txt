Paul,

Our search engine has been down for some time,
and we have received a number of complaints that 
finding information on the public Web site and mailing 
lists is difficult as a result. We are currently
investigating a solution that is more effective
than our previous search facility.

The Team decided that, until we have a long-term
solution in place, it is so important that people
be able to search the public Web site and mailing
list archives, that we are willing to live for 
a short time with the Google logo on the home page
(see part 3.3 of their terms and conditions [1]).

This situation is temporary.

Thank you,

 - Ian
