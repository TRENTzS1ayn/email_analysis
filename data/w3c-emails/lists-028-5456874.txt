Hi!

My name is Jim Bryan, and I'm the Business Development VP for
www.cyberrecruitingsecrets.com.  I came across your website while surfing
and it occurred to me that we could both benefit by a reciprocal link
exchange. 

I have found that trading links is one of the best sources for increasing
qualified traffic to my site. Maybe you've found the same to be true for
increasing traffic to your site!

If you have an interest in exchanging links with me, you can find out more
about our reciprocal link exchange program on our website at
http://www.cyberrecruitingsecrets.com/Help/AdInfo.asp. 

If you would like to exchange links, please use this information to place a
link to our web site. Then e-mail me with your information and I will
arrange an immediate reciprocal link to your links page.

I look forward to hearing from you!
