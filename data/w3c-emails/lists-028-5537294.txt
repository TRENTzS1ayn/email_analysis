I'm not sure if my first mail was clear. Hopefully
this will make more sense.

In the html 4.0 spec zip file, downloadable from
http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/html40.zip
, cover.html contains the following image:

<img src="images/w3c_home.gif" (etc....)

This is good. Having downloaded the files, I can
browse them without being connected to the internet.
It's nice and fast.

In the html 4.01 spec zip file, downloadable from
http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/html40.zip, the same
image is sourced as:

<img height="48" width="72" alt="W3C" src= 
"http://www.w3.org/Icons/w3c_home" (etc....)

The image is still included in the .zip file, still at
images/w3c_home.gif . Now my browser wants to go out
on the internet to get it, though. This is slow, and
sometimes impossible.
