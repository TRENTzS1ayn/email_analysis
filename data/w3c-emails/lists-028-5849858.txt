Thank you for the report.

It could be a bug. The CSS Pointers Group lists a known bug for
Windows IE 5.x related to a 'font-family: serif' declaration [1]:

"...font-family: serif - inappropriate font selected as replacement for
     generic when font size changed through UA preferences - avoid"

The activity-home.css style sheet has one of those:

body {
background: white; color: black;
font-family: serif;
}

Have you changed the font size from IE's default? If not it might be
a good idea to report this to Microsoft.
