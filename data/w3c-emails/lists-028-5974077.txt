In the reference manuals of <THEAD> in dynamic html, it states that it can be used "for static headings when body sections are rendered in a scrolling pane".

This is exactly what i need done, but i can't get it to work by myself and neither can i find an working example of it anywhere.
Would appreasiate it very much if anyone could help me out with this one problem. (Would also be great if it were added somewhere on  the site, if it's not there already)

If you can point me in the right direction -please mail me berge_aadland@hotmail.com   thanks :)
