What percentage of the registered domains have been activated and put
into
use.

Also I would like to have your best rough guess based upon your 
experience and insights:

1.How many domains are there presently such as .com .net .gov .edu .org
etc., etc., etc.,and how many are presently registered, and of these,
how
many do you estimate are in use presently?

How many additional of these domains will be sold between now and 2003?

2. How many new extentions are going to be created this year, and what
are
there ( .bus .corp. .doc etc???) and how many of these do you estimate
will be sold in the period between now and 2003?


3. How many internation domains are registered dor countries like .nl
.uk
.ru etc.

Thank you for your assistance
