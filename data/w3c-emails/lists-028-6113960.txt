Stephen,

Please refer to previous comments on this topic sent to this list:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/site-comments/2000Oct/0016

The short answer is: W3C would love to use CSS for horizontal layout,
and cross-browser support is nearly there. When we redesigned the home
page, we were not satisfied with the results. The number of deployed
browsers that support CSS may be significant enough that we should
scrap the table. We have not tried the experiment recently.

Daniel Glazman has already proposed a redesign:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/site-comments/2000Oct/0033,
but to my knowledge, we have not tried to implement it yet.

Having said this, I (and I believe W3C) support the principle that 
tables should be used for data, not layout. 

 - Ian
