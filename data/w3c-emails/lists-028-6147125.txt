No problem. I appreciate your taking the time to write and I hope
we can help.

Can you explain how you tried to find it? That will help us understand
user expectations. Let me note that:

 * We are not currently thrilled with the search functionality offered
   on the home page. We are working on improving it.

 * The HTML specification is not one link from the home page. You can
   get there on link from the TR page (http://www.w3.org/TR/), the
   site index (http://www.w3.org/Help/siteindex), or the HTML home page
   (http://www.w3.org/MarkUp), all of which are one link from the home
   page. 

 * From the HTML 4 spec, the "elements" link at the top of the
   cover page takes you to a table of all HTML elements.

But that's cheating, because I already know how to find this
information.
Please indicate how you went about looking for the information.

Thanks, Mark, for your input.
