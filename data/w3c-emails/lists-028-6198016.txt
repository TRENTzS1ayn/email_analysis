Billy,

I am not sure whether a zipped version will be made available.
Generally,
each Working Group decides which formats it will use to make its
specifications available. Today, to my understanding, the only
"mandatory"
format for publishing a W3C specification is some version of HTML.

I suggest that you write to the email address in the specification that
interests you and request that they include a zipped version in their
future drafts.
