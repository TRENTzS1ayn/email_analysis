The short answer is that W3C hasn't been very good (with few exceptions) 
at graphical communications on the Web. We have technologies for doing 
so (PNG, SVG, etc.) and some talented designers, but it's not been a 
high priority generally. I agree with you that pictures of how things
fit together would spruce up the site a lot, and a number of people
have been urging the W3C to be more graphical (Note: accessible
graphics include text descriptions.)

Many of the talks [1] that have been given include graphics,
but these have not made to the Activity pages (in any notable
way, though I haven't looked at all of them lately).

Here's an idea: if you (or anyone) wishes to contribute graphics
to our Web site, I think we could consider them. This could
be done on a volunteer basis (like translations). I don't know
how copyright would work for these graphics, however. Ideally
W3C would keep the copyright and acknowledge (somehow, I don't
know where) the work of the artist.

Suggestions on this idea, or graphics, welcome.
