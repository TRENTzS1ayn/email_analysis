This comment is not about your site, it's about the W3C DOM (Document
Object Model) for Netscape 6 and IE 5+...  why on earth did they
eliminate the window object?  How do you do 'window.print()' now?  How
do you do 'window.innerWdith' now?

Where can users send suggestions anyway to the folks who decide what the
DOM will be?

Actually, I do have a comment about your site:  on the left bar, where
it says "W3C A to Z" I see no listing for JavaScript..  thanks....
