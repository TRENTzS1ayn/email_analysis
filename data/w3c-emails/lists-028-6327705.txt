The 5 Mar headline is 'W3C Hosts Technical Plenary and All-Group Meeting'
but the "details" link goes to
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Prospectus/Joining
which has little relevance to the headline. Isn't there something that
we can link to that's more relevant to the headline? if not, just
don't use rel="details" at all.

Please take a look at the examples in the RSS spec
