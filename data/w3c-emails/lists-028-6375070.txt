Many of the documents available from this site are .ai files, but
when I try to open them in Adobe Illustrator, I get the message
"MPS Parser cannot parse this file".

Could you please tell me the exact product I need to read these 
files?

It would be nice if documents were configured in a format that could
be read by free readers.
