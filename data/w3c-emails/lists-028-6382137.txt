I defy you to find the link to the Hong Kong conference on www.w3.org.

Start by searching for conferences on the front page search engine.
The first link returned is

http://www.w3.org/Conferences/Overview-WWW.html

This seems to be about one year out of date.

The word "conference" does not appear on the home page of www.w3.org.

The word "conference" is not a hyperlink from the site index.

I thought the W3C was a sponsor of this conference.  But anyway even
if it isn't, shouldn't it be possible to find a list of the
conferences where W3C is involved?
