Your site used to be somewhat easy to use, but then
you....uhm, "improved" it.

Get a new user who has not been to your site before
and see how long it takes them to find the latest XML
standard withouth using the search box. On your XML
page you've got it keenly hidden in the middle of a
sentence, which redirects you to an anchor tag, which
finally gets you to the document.

Just put a link at the top of the page that says
"Latest XML Standard", which is similar to how I
believe it worked before.
