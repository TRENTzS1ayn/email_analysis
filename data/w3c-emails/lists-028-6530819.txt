My default foreground and background colors for web browsing happen to
be unconventional (foreground: #cccccc, background: #000000).  With this
scheme, I found areas of the W3C's site serve me poorly, as they do not
follow the W3C's own recommendations for accessibility.  The result is
poor (light gray on white) (or with particular colors, zero) contrast
between foreground and background colors.

I refer to the lack of implementation of item 9.1 "Color Contrast" in
the "CSS Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" (
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-CSS-TECHS/#style-color-contrast ),
specifically the last line, "Ensure that foreground and background
colors contrast well. If specifying a foreground color, always specify a
background color as well (and vice versa)."

While composing this email, I found examples of this nonconformance in:
http://www.w3.org/
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-CSS-TECHS/

Although the site (well, at least the homepage) bares only WAI-AA
conformance, and the issue I'm raising is Priority 3, is there a good
reason it hasn't been implemented?  I applaud what the W3C is trying to
do, and would like to see you take the lead in implementation! :^)

Thank you.
