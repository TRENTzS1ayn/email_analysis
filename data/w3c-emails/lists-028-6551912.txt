Dear W3C,

Would it be possible to get the list of W3C members in Australia.

I am in charge of making a presentation about W3C to a CSIRO- Mathematical
and Information Science board, and it would be useful to get this
information. Maybe it should be available on the Web (not just the name of
the members).

Also Could you tell me who is the new W3C chaiman?
I think Jean-Francois Abramatic is no longer the chair.

Thanks,
Best Regards,
Anne-Marie Vercoustre
