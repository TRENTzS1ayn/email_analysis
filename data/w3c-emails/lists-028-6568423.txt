[[[
Note: This list is not intended to be an exhaustive list of
XML software, but rather a list of software that we have
evaluated and found useful to the developer community.
If you want your software in this list,

     make sure the license terms clearly allow free
     non-commercial use, and 
     invite the developer community to use it via the
     public forums above. 

Preference is given to Open Source software.
