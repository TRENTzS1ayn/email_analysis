Hi Anne-Marie,

Jean-Fran?ois is still the W3C Chairman. We are seeking
a "Chief Operating Officer" (refer to job description [1]) who
will take on some of the Chairman's (and Director's) 
responsibilities. 

About Australian Members:

 * The list of all W3C Members is public:
   http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List

 * Employees of W3C Members have additional tools for
   querying the Member database (linked from the
   Member home page). This tool will allow you to 
   sort Members by country.

Hope this helps. And hi, by the way!

 - Ian
