Hi Rosemary,

As to who does the work: The HTML Working Group (whose composition
changes over time).

On the HTML WG home page [1], you'll find out information
about versions of HTML (excluding versions of xhtml):

HTML 4.01: Published 24 Dec 1999
HTML 4.0: Published first 18 Dec 1997
HTML 3.2: Publihsed first 14 Jan 1997
HTML 2.0: first published November 1995

I hope this helps,
