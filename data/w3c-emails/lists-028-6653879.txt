Hello, I have been trying to learn how to write CGI scripts (using my 
Mac as a server) and thought that your site would be a good place to 
start for information. Your front page (http://www.w3.org/) has a 
nice index (W3C A to Z) on it, but this makes no mention of CGI even 
though, after searching around, I found you had a page at 
http://www.w3.org/cgI/. Do you think it would be a good idea to add 
it to the list?
