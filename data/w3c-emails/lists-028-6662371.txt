Wow, I didn't even know we had this page 
"CGI: Common Gateway Interface" [1]!

W3C is not currently doing any work (to my knowledge) related
to CGI scripts per se, and the interface in question is not
defined in a W3C technical report. That's why CGI doesn't
appear in the index on our home page. We could add it to the
site index, on the other hand.

How did you locate it, by the way?
