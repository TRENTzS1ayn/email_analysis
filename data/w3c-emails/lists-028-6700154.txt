Hi,

I use your site all the time to read and re-read specs but it is getting
increasingly hard to find them.

May I suggest that every section has a prominent link saying "here's the
latest recommendation/note/whatever for css/xpath/whatever" at the top of
each page.

Thanks & keep up the good work,

Kevin
