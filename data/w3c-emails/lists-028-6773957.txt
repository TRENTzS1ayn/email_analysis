  Hi,

   Some of the advanced texts are difficult to read, such as:

      Document Type Definition
 
      http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/sgml/dtd.html

   The difficulty is due to a special syntax that I'm not familiar with.
   I suggest adding a standard button to such a page (together with
   the contents and index buttons) that gives a link to a page
   that defines this syntax.


                      Best Regards,
                                      Rita Bijlsma
