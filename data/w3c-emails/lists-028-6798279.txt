Hi

I'm an Information Architect working for a web consultancy. I was wondering
if there are any W3C recommendations on usability (covering
navigation/feedback/site structure etc)? I've got the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, but these only cover users with disabilities,
rather than the universal user.

Thanks in advance.
