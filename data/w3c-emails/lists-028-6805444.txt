Chris,

W3C does not currently have usability Guidelines. There has been 
discussion about a generalized set of usability guidelines that 
would incorporate accessibility, internationalization, general 
usability, and more. W3C will be pursing quality assurance in
a new Activity, and it may be that usability is one of the topics
addressed in that Activity.

Cheers,

 - Ian
