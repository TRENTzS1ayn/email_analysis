Hi,

Simple comment really: None of the images for w3.org work, in Netscape or
IE, using the Windows OS (any version.) I noticed this first on the
Validator (validator.w3.org), but even on the home page, all the images show
errors as not being there.

I notice in the code for all the web pages, there are no file extensions for
the graphics where IMG tags are concerned. No .GIF, .JPG or .PNG, just file
names alone with no extensions.

Like I said I tested the site both with NS and IE to make sure it wasn't a
browser-specific issue.

Is there something I'm doing wrong where I can't see the images? In both
browsers I have the images turned "on" (checked to make sure!)
