Hello,
  In doing research on the use of  cascading style sheets I  have found
a
discrepancy in the way browsers handle them. What's new about that,
I know! :-)  But I thought it would be useful information anyway.

This is the URL of the page in question:
        http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/figures.html

The browsers I used to view the page are:
    - Amaya v4.3.2
    - Netscape Communicator v4.77
    - Internet Explorer v5.50.4522.1800
    -K-Meleon 2000-2001
    - Opera v5.11

Computer system:
    Intel PIII running Microsoft Windows 98se.

As far as I can tell Opera and K-Meleon are the only ones that display
the
page correctly.

Netscape places both  images on the left over the text. And it displays
the W3C logo but not the banner links. And it doesn't display the red
and
yellow Figures & Captions image.

Internet Explorer places the W3C logo and banner links on top of the
page
before the main heading.

Amaya doesn't display the W3C logo and banner links. Places both images
in the center of the page and only partially displays the red background
image.

My question is this. What is the likelyhood of using PDF documents to
illustrate
the proper layout of the examples? It would help to show the intended
layout
rather than relying on a browser that might display the example
correctly.
