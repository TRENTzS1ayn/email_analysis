I think <address> is something of a misnomer; the HTML 4
spec doesn't say much about style. But take a look
at the "Sign It!" page in the styleguide...
  http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/SignIt
Based on that, I take the <address> tag to provide
a signature for the page; signatures usually include
dates, ala

signed this 8th day of May, 2001, __Daniel W. Connolly__.

That seemed right to me on various occasions, but now
I can't think of a good explanation as to why.

But some things that do seem to fit are things like

-- the title of the signer; i.e. the role which
the signer is playing

-- other forms of endorsement; e.g. if the Florp
group approved the document today, I'd include
"approved 7 May 2001 by the Florp group" in
the <address>.

Please don't look at it that way. Think of it as a way
to say "on this date, I make myself accountable for this
information; here's some contact information that you
can use to hold me accountable."

It's a lot like a .sig in email.
