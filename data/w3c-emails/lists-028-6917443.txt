Thanks for the report. W3C press releases are prepared in the three
host site languages, US English, French, and Japanese. That link is
the resources:

    http://www.w3.org/2001/05/xml-schema-pressrelease.html.en
    http://www.w3.org/2001/05/xml-schema-pressrelease.html.fr
    http://www.w3.org/2001/05/xml-schema-pressrelease.html.ja

The server returns your preferred language. What browser and
operating system are you running, with what language preference?
(For example, in IE 5.0 for Mac OS, this setting is found under
Edit -> Preferences -> Web Browser -> Language/Fonts -> Language.)
