|Thanks for the report. W3C press releases are prepared in the three

I see. This time I used MSIE 5.0 on Win '98. There are no such settings
available here as far as I can see. I tried Opera 5 and Netscape 6
and they apparently sent the right HTTP headers since I got the press
release in English.

You should probably return the English version as default when no HTTP
headers are sent by the browser, or even better - let the user decide
by sending an HTML file with available language options.

Thank you for your quick response.
