Yes of course. I am always using <em> and never <i> as I follow the
specification as by law. What puzzled me is that I often turn to W3C's
website for examples how some of stuff in HTML 4 is used "in real life"
when the examples in the specification is not enough, and it was then I
came across this weird usage of <address> by the W3C.  Hence why I took
the oppurtunity to ask on this list.

All my web pages are Triple-A verified for accessability, so don't worry.

Yeah, I know, and hence the <address> is so vaguely specified and
vaguely used by W3C themselves I am not currently using it at all.
