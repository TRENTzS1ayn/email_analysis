  Statement that H1 and P are of type block not consistent with
  HTML 4.0 specification, while that specification is referred to:

      ... elements like 'H1' and 'P' are of type 'block'
      ... 
      ... in the HTML specification [2].

  Following the [2] link to the HTML 4.0 Specification:

        <!ELEMENT P - O (%inline;)* 
        ...
        End tag: optional
        ...
        The P element represents a paragraph. 
        It cannot contain block-level elements (including P itself).

        ---  

        !ENTITY % heading "H1|H2|H3|H4|H5|H6">
        ...
        !ELEMENT (%heading;)  - - (%inline;)
    
  
   The endtag of p could not be optional if p were of type block.
