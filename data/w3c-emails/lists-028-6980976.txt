The page listing implementations of SVG,
http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/SVG-Implementations, includes an
incorrect statement.  In the row for Adobe Illustrator 9.0, the Notes
column says, "Has SVG import and export capability."  This is incorrect.

Adobe claims to support SVG import in several technical literature
pieces, but if you actually purchase the product (like we did), you'll
find that it does NOT, in fact, support importing or placing of SVG
files.  For some documentation of this error, see
http://www.adobe.com:80/support/techdocs/258ce.htm, which is the list of
"Illustrator 9.0 Documentation Errors."

Please fix this error as soon as possible.

Otherwise, if you make the perfectly legitimate decision not to maintain
the list of implementations, you should note that somewhere on the page.
Perhaps where you say "This is the official W3C list of implementations
of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)."
