Greetings.

I am Lise Scheuermann. I am designing a Netcourse for Virtual High School.
In Week 14 of the course the topic of the history of the Internet and World
Wide Web is covered. I would very much like to include a link to your World
Wide Web History page.

Thanks in advance for your response.

--Lise S. Scheuermann <><
