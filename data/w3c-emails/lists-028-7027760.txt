There are other XML-related specifications that
have been raitifed by W3C;
cf http://www.w3.org/XML/#events
and http://www.w3.org/TR/

I'm not aware of any XML specifications in the
public domain; W3C holds copyright on the above specifications.
But our license is very liberal; it allows royalty-free
redistribuition.

I don't understand this question.

some other organization to ratify XML? What organizations
do they like to see ratification from?
