Hi,

   I'd like to have a simple method to refer to the articles in the W3C
Mailinglist Archive. Currently, each mail that comes through the
listserver contains a header line ala

  X-Mailing-List: <html-tidy@w3.org> archive/latest/2694

and one could refer to it like

? mailto:?subject=archive&body=get%20latest/2694&to=html-tidy-request@w3.org

but I really don't like that. Since I the above header line refers to
the local file system, it should be easy to set up a alias/script that
enables us to refer to e.g.

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2694

instead of digging through the archives and use

? http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/2001AprJun/0188.html

regards,
