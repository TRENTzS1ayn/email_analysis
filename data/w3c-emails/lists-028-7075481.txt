Hi Geoff,

We made a conscious decision not to include it there, but we
should revisit it. Maybe it's appropriate to have it in the A-Z list.

That's an interesting suggestion. Currently, the process is
described at the *bottom* of the TR page, in a section entitled
"About W3C Technical Reports" [1]. I can ask the W3C Communications
Team if they think it's a good idea to have a link from the
status section to a specific version of the Process Document.

Thank you for your suggestions,
