This has to be one of the most frustrating sites I have ever visited.

I am a Teacher Consultant for students with disabilities at TAFE NSW
Australia. Part of my role is to assist teaching staff to develop accessible
materials in print or web based design.

WC3 should be an incredible source of info, but the page layout is
horrendous.

I start reading, lose the plot, get a headache & finally wonder why I am
resorting yet again to this site.

It is logged on my list of favourites but it is a preferred source, not a
favourite.

Whoever is putting your info out there needs to remember some simple things
like : do people read mass material on the web ? No. People go for snappy
info in bite size chunks. Do people get lost between pages ? Yes. Links no
more than 3 pages please.

If the WC3 site is to have an educational or informative function, then the
developers / content writers need to use some basic educational premises.

This so frustrating. This site should exemplify good universal design,
accessible by many. I just don't know who the many are.

There is no way I could use this directly with teachers who develop online
content. Limited tech heads involved !

Any explanation would help.
