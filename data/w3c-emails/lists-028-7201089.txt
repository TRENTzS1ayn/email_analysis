Dear Friends at W3C,

While it is possible to access a search capability to search
the W3C web site, there is no indication on the home page
<http://www.w3.org/> on how to find that capability. I happened
upon the search capability by going to the Site Index page.

A simple way to help users find the search capability easily
(he said!) would be to make a small revision to the horizontal
menu at the top and bottom of the page. Change this:

 Activities | Technical Reports | Site Index | About W3C | Contact Us

to this:

 Activities | Technical Reports | Site Index & Search | About W3C |
Contact Us

Otherwise, the word "search" doesn't even appear anywhere on the W3C
home page.

Thanks for listening.

-Todd.
