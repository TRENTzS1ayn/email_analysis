Hi,
I keep thinking I should bookmark the XML REC page but...

Why is the link from http://www.w3.org/XML/ (from the W3C home page) to
the XML REC at http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006 so obscure.
It would seem logical to me that many others goto http://www.w3.org/XML/
expecting to find the Recommendation. 
At the very least, this page should have a prominent link to the Rec.

Thanks,
