I would love to take a printed version of the soap WD with me to study.
I cannot find any pdf version or so on the website. Is there a reason for 
some documents not having a pdf version available while they are available 
for some other documents? Or am i simlpy missing something.

Thanx and kind regards

Thomas Klocke
