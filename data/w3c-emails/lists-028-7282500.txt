This is a known error in the spec. Refer to the list
of CSS2 errata [1]:

  <blockquote>
   The index includes anchors that differ only by base ("A" and "a") 
   and this is not legal HTML. From HTML 4.01, section 12.2.1: 

     Anchor names that differ only in case may not appear in 
     the same document. 

  Browser behavior may differ because of this.
