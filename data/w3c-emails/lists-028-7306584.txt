Thank you for using the W3C validator. It is definitely worthwhile, and
as you have found, a single typo can cause multiple errors to appear.

Have you tried WDG at http://www.htmlhelp.com ? WDG also has some
validator help files at http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/ .
I imagine that Google will list other help sites. http://www.google.com

Hope this helps,
