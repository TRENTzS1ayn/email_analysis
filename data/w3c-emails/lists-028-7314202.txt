attached mail follows:
Hi Dan

I think you are the man to whom useability issues should be addressed?

If not please forward to right person with thanks

It took me quite a while to find the search facility - Jakob Nielsen et all
suggest it should be prominently placed on the home page...

Unfortunately when I did find it - unexpectedly in truth - on the site map
page the damned thing didn't work anyway....

Over to you blue leader.
