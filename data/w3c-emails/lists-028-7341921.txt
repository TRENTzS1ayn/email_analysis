Hello Vikki,

On what page did you see references to hundreds of free industry
standard DTDs? That's not really what W3C does, so I'm surprised
if it was on our site. 

I'm sorry for the frustration. [Plus, our search engine is down!]

You might find what you're looking for at the xml.org registry:

Hope this helps,

 - Ian
