Why not optionally allow for a simple </> to end a XML node? Sure, it could cause confusion, but if someone wants to compress a finished XML document so it doesn't need decompression, this could come in handy...
For example:
<bla>
    <a/>
    <b>
        <c>
            <d/>
        </>
    </>
</>
