I think the RAND issue should be on the front page. Everybody who cares 
to visit this site should know about this proposal, and evaluate whether 
it worth to spend time on standards issues if they end at the very end 
in patent payments to MS. It's the killer proposal for free software 
development, and from my knowledge of the style mailing list most of the 
activist's are involved in free software development. So please make 
this RAND topic really public and be prepared to get the well deserved 
public response. This proposal changes completely the rules of the game, 
so don't hide it, or are you also ashamed of the greedy proposal.

So I would propose a headline like:

New patent proposal will change w3c rules
