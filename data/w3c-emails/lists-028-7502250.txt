Hi, 
Tried to download the pdf document
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/wai-pageauth.pdf
and encountered the following error message "There was an error
processing a page. There was a problem reading this document (110)." ( I am
using version 5 of the Acrobat PDF Reader ) 

I wanted to inform you of this but I could not find a e-mail address or
other contact information on the page I was viewing at
http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/  nor could I find a link to a site map
or to your home page, which I thought was not particuarly user friendly.  

regards
