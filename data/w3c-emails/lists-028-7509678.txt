Phil,

First, thanks for sending your comment, and thanks for
using WCAG 1.0 [1].

In the status section of the cover page of the spec, you'll find:

   "The list of known errors in this document is available at    
    http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WAI-WEBCONTENT-ERRATA.
    Please report errors in this document to wai-wcag-editor@w3.org. 

This type of information is found in every W3C tech report
status section.

I have not heard of this PDF error and will investigate.

The W3C icon at the top of each tech report links to the home page.

From the home page, you can get to the site index [2] and
contact information page [3].

We welcome specific usability suggestions for the home page, and
do our best to integrate them to the design.

Thanks again,

 - Ian
