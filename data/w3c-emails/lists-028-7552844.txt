Hello from Greece.

I happen to investigate the little history of the www in your site and 
when trying to reach www.cec.lu i got the following message.

"
EUROPA has changed address 
from www.cec.lu to europa.eu.int

Please notify the maintainer of http://www.w3.org/History.html which 
courteously linked you to this http://www.cec.lu/en/comm.html. 
Thank you! 
The new URL is: http://europa.eu.int/en/comm.html.
"

Thank you for your time,

Lekeas V. Paraskevas
