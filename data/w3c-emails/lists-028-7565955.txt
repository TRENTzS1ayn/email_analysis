Sorry to bother you but it appears you have fixed this problem with regard
to IE6 on the w3 homepage.
As the WAI homepage is apparently still broken,
about and participation don't work, news and resources do.

I'd be very grateful for some insights as to what is breaking the
functionality.
mainly for this draft: Script Techniques for Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 2.0
which is currently here:
