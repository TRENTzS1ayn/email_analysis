Hello, 

I cannot locate the ASCII code for the Service Mark "SM" (similar to
TradeMark, "TM") anywhere on your site.

If none exists, who do I contact about requesting this be added?  It's
not efficiently added to HTML pages now since it needs to remain in
cap's and be superscripted.

Thank you,
Deb Dorsey
