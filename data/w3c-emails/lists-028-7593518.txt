No, &#x2120; or &#8480;.  And you should not use the "sup" element,
since "SERVICE MARK" character in Unicode is defined to have
superscript glyph.

Mozilla / Netscape 6 rendered SM on Mac / Windows, Netscape
Communicator 4.78 rendered it on Windows 2000 it a document is
served as UTF-8, and even Netscape Communicator 4.08 can render
it if you use decimal numeric character reference (&#8480;), and
of course if you have an appropriate font.  Mozilla on FreeBSD
rendered it as "^(SM)", maybe just because I don't have an
appropriate font.  Neither IE 6 on Windows nor IE 5 on Mac seems
to work, nor does Opera.

Its hex representation is &#xAE;.  174 is decimal.
