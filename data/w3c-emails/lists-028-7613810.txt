Old browsers tend to work better with decimal NCR, since hex NCR
is rather "new" in HTML.  So "in general", it would be safer to
use decimal NCR rather than hex NCR in HTML.  Of course all
conforming XML processors (and hence all conforming XHTML user
agents) must understand both decimal and hex NCRs.
