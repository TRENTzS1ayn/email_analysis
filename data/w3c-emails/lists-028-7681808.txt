Hello,

Regarding the 'basic style for all W3C pages'.
http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/base

This Netscape 4.x work-around has a draw back.
a img {color: white;}

It makes the image's 'alt' text white.
Turning off the browser's support for images makes
the 'alt' text invisible against the white background.

A solution would be to add a background colour
to the work-around rule.
