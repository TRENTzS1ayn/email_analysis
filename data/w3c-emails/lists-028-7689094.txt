I need to have a page break at a certain point in a web page when it is sent
to a hard copy printer.  I can not find instructions on how to use this.
What would help is a library of commands and usage, that could be searched
by key words.  If anyone reading this, can clear things up for me, PLEASE
respond.

Best Regards

Val
