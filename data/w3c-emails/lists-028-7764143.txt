Dear Joy,

We're aware that the readability of the Web Content Accessibility 
Guidelines (WCAG 1.0) is not ideal. When we released WCAG 1.0 in 1999, we 
provided a Checklist format to use in conjunction with the guidelines for 
easier reference when developing a site, while at the same time maintaining 
the explanatory detail in the main body of the guidelines. The Checklist 
for WCAG 1.0 is available at:
         http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html

But we are also working on an advanced version, Web Content Accessibility 
Guidelines 2.0. This document will address more advanced Web technologies, 
and at the same time, do this is a more understandable manner. While WCAG 
1.0 will remain the stable and referenceable version for some time still, 
you may want to look at the early drafts of WCAG 2.0
         http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/
and provide some feedback on the simplicity and clarity of the language and 
the availability of examples, which as you mention, are so important.

We appreciate your feedback on this general concern, but also invite 
specific comments on draft documents as they are most helpful for the 
development process.

Regards,

- Judy
