I often find that W3 pages do not render in any readable script on my
browser (ie 5.5).

An example is http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Overview.htm8 and which seems
to render in a script I do not recognise.  If I copy and paste in to Word
where Times New Roman is the default font, it is easily read.

Do others have the same problem?  This is not the first example I have had.
