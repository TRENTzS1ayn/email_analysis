Hello,

Please look at this:

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) 1.0 Becomes a W3C Recommendation
5 September 2001

Refactoring RDF/XML Syntax Working Draft Published
6 September 2001

SMIL Animation Becomes a W3C Recommendation
5 September 2001

These are the news from http://www.w3.org . I though the news are
counted from bottom to top, but now I don't know what's happening. Why
there is Sep5 then Sep6 and then Sep5 again?

Regards,
Alexander.
