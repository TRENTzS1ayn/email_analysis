Hy there,

I work as programer and web designer here in Brasil, in a Telecom company,
Called Claro Digital
I think i discovered a new kind of technique to put scrollers on a page,
very easily
i call it fake frame scroll or F.F.S
please check it and distribute if you want. Just tell that i'am the author

the technique:

Step 1 >>>

create a normal html file show.htm
 <<show.htm>> 

> Step 2  >>>
> 
> Create a frameset - important, one of the files doesn't exist (yes, it's
> true) for example x.htm. the other file is that from the step one, called
> show.htm
> 
>  <<fr_show.htm>> 
> 
Step 3  >>>

put the tag bellow where you want the scroll to appear

<OBJECT TYPE="text/x-scriptlet" WIDTH=187 HEIGHT="288"
DATA="fr_show.htm" ALIGN="LEFT"> 
</OBJECT>

 <<index.htm>> 

you can also give a good effect adding style to the scrollbars

that's it

wait for repply
