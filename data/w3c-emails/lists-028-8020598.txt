Thank you for the suggestion.

Accessibility guidelines [1] ask that one not use color alone to
distinguish items. As it stands, the top story is distinguished in two
ways: position and color.

Other means, like labels, 'hr' elements, font size, and so on might
accomplish this. In any case, I think that given our current design the
top story has to be first and be legible without scrolling.
