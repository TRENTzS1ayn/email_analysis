Currently, one of the most annoying inaccessibility trends on the web is the use of CSS to restrict the displayed font size to whatever the page 'designer' deems is appropriate, i.e. by using absolute font sizes. Although it is the case that W3C have been very slow to pick-up on this trend, I am still amazed to find the 'Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) Project' practicing said dumb designers inaccessibility trick!
