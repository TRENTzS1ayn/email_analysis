Hi W3,

The following URL on your site:

   http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/

and

   http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/

have a link in the section near the top of the page called "This version" 
which has a link for a GZip'ed PDF as follows: "gzip'ed PDF file [963Kb]) "

I downloaded the link and it appears not to be a GZIP file (even though 
it's named .GZ) but in fact it's a PDF. I renamed it to be .PDF and I can 
view it fine without unzipping it.

FYI, thought you'd want to know.

Thnx,
Tom
