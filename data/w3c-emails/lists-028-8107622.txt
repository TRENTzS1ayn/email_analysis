In the process of looking for a torture test for Mozilla's XML+CSS 
rendering, I came across your XML(1) spec page (might as well start at 
the source, right?) When I try to open the XML(2) version in Mozilla, it 
shows plain text and no formatting. I reported it as a bug in Bugzilla 
(see the thread at 3), but they insisted your page isn't serving up a 
css for Mozilla to render. It looks like I may have to build the torture 
test myself, but you may want to check the compatibility of your xml 
spec with the browsers that supposedly support it, especially Mozilla, 
as they go way out of their way to support your specs.
