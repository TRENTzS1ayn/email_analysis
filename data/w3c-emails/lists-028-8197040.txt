Dear Madam/Sir:

Could you tell me which organization I must contact to propose an entity?  
What I want to propose is the superscript 4.  Now the entity for this symbol 
is &#8308;.  But it does no display on many browsers.  

I am proposing it because it is frequently used on the phonetic writing 
system for Chinese.  Chinese is a  tone language.  It has 4 tones.  Placing a 
superscript after letter spellings as tone indicator is convenient.  But 
currently there are only sup1, sup2, sup3, but not sup4.  On the web page, 
superscripts can be achieved with the <sup></sup> tags.  But the tags do not 
work on other situations, such as in emails and BBS.  

I propose to make sup4 an entity.  It will help a quarter of the world 
population on the Internet, word processing and other applications.  Thanks 
for your help. 

Best regards, 
Juli Zhang
