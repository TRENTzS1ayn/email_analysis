Hello,

Unless I'm mistaken (which is possible as I am not an
internationalization expert), W3C has an entire Recommendation
to meet your needs. It's called Ruby Annotation [1] and was
published in May 2001.

For more information about Ruby, refer to the Ruby home page.
(I don't information on that page about implementations of
Ruby.)

Let me know if this answers your request. Thank you,

  - Ian
