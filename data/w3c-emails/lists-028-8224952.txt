Dear reader,

I have used the free service html-validator on your site and I think there is
a flaw in the system, when a validate http://utopia.xs4all.nl/cgi-bin/cal.pl it
seems to be oke, but if you look at the source the </body> and </html> are
missing, can you tell me more about this?

Groet,

Govert
