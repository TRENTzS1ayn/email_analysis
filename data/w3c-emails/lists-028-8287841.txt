Thanks to the detailed schedule of W3C Team Presentations at the top of the
homepage, news regarding the site content are pushed down too far to the
bottom. Of course, one can subscribe to the "W3C Weekly News" newsletter,
but I usually visit w3.org more often than once a week and like to think
that visitors are generally more interested in the site's content than in
presentations of its makers (a log analysis of links clicked on the homepage
may belie me, but I dare doubt that).

In my opinion, better alternatives are
- to unstick the "Team Presentations" entry so that it moves down (like the
other entries)
- if you feel it need stay sticky at the top, to remove the actual schedule
and leave only the introductory text, which would at least make the site
news visible again without scrolling at 800x600 window size
- or, to combinedly shorten and unstick it.

At the same time, /Promotion/Appearances/ could be given a slightly more
legible design.

Moreover, the "upcoming appearances" link should obviously come first in the
news text - it's more relevant to see where the team will be than where it
has been.

Best regards,
