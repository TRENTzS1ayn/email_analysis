greetings;

i am looking for xsl/xslt test suites. the google search from the w3c
root page yields, among other, the two urls:
 http://www.w3.org/Help/siteindex
 http://www.w3.org/QA/TheMatrix

the latter would be quite useful, were it not that it appears to date
from january of 2001.
it would also be nice if the QA entry from the index page also appeared
under test suites.

...
