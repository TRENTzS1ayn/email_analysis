Your Validators are an excellent idea, and I think they can do nothing
but good for the internet.  I just finished validating all my CSS and it
feels good to see that "Congratulations!" message when everything is
finally A-O-K.
 
However, when I started to validate HTML, I got a ton of errors
regarding the structure of my comment lines.  The URL for it is
http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ftony.gonk.net%2Findex.htm
l .  However, I was not aware there was anothing wrong with that comment
structure, and the validator just says "check your comment syntax."  It
would be most useful if it replied with a suggestion, or the words
"check your comment syntax" linked to a page detailing the correct
syntax for comments.  I did search your site for the correct stucture,
but it is vast and difficult to find a specific solution in.  If it is
possible please see to the reply to my comment problem so that it can be
corrected quickly, for me and for other people who might fall into the
same situation as I have.

Thank you!
