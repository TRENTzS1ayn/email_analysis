Hi,

I don't want this to sound "cheeky" but you really could do with a redesign 
of your corporate identity and web site (all within w3c recommendations of 
course ;o)

It works perfectly well in a functional sense, although your site's 
navigation and presentation could be dramatically improved, and make it 
more accessible for non-techhies.

regards

Jake
