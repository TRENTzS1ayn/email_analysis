Dear Nick,

For WAI-specific site issues you can post more directly to 
wai-site-comments@w3.org; however, site-comments (the address you posted 
to) also eventually gets to us.

WAI maintains a list of over 30 evaluation and repair tools
         http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html
including yours. Bobby's existence, and its familiarity to many users, 
pre-dates WAI; and Bobby was actively and consistently promoted by CAST, 
resulting in international familiarity, including among organizations that 
had not heard of W3C/WAI.

While WAI does not endorse any single evaluation tool, we are aware that 
particularly on some of our older Web pages, written when there were few 
evaluation tools available, Bobby may be cited as a sole example. We are in 
the process of changing these pages.

>I would cite as cases in point the UK government guidelines

We do not to my knowledge link to Bobby from WCAG 1.0. (See below.)

We can find no link to Bobby from the WCAG 1.0 Guidelines at
         http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/

We will, however, review the WAI site within the next several weeks to 
review the status of reference links to evaluation tools.

Thank you for your comments,

- Judy
