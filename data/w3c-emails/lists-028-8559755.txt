Your validation for HTML is so stupid!  I made a page of my owen and your 
site found hundreds of things that make NO difference if they were there or 
not.  No one cares about using "proper technique" because it works anyway 
and users don't look at the sites code.  Start concentrating on doing things 
that help people.
