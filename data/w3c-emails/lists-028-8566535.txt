Thank you for writing. I hope that this page at the Web Design Group
will help explain some of the reasons why HTML validation has always
been important. For example, pieces of an invalid HTML page can be
invisible for the user in some browsers. I daresay invalid HTML can
cause a bad user experience and at times can result in data loss.
