It is my intention to make sure this will evolve, thanks to the trick
documented at
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2002Dec/0005.html

But we need some wider experiment before that (as you know, some quite
widespread browsers do not support application/xhtml+xml)

Thanks, that needs to be fixed, indeed!

> Beyond that, in what way is W3C an Acronym?

It is, W3C stands for World Wide Web Consortium. It's not a standard
acronym, but remembers that's the point of using <acronym> and <abbr> is
to help people understanding the underlying text, much more than to
determine if something is an acronym, an abbreviation, a geekism, etc.

Hmm... Aren't you overstating this a bit? Besides "invisible" (which is
indeed presentational, see below), I see: banner, bannerLink, navBlock,
navhead, navlink, etc. that do rely on a semantic structure.

More generally, I could tell you that the fact the class is called
"invisible" doesn't mean anything, but in the mind of the conceptor of
the page. What if I told you that by class="invisible" we meant "links
to skip navigation blocks"?

I agree that's the name is probably not very well chosen, but I do think
that the discussion on class names is moot, since they are only tokens
for computer, not for humans.

Thanks for your comments,

Dom
