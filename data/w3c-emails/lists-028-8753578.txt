This is just a cosmetic issue, so it's probably pretty subjective, but i 
find it quite uneasy to promote standards with a site whose home page 
looks like it's broken (or ugly depending on your point of view).

The point is : the three columns are not aligned at the bottom, which 
produces a "i cut an article in the newspaper" effect which may be hard 
to sell to unevangelised people.

"Looks like this site is broken !" is what i heard w3c-illiterate people 
say in my office...

My 2 subjective cents.

Regards

Laurent
