This is some feedback giving my experience with that three column layout.
I have tried Netscape 7 and Mozilla 1.2.1, IE6, Opera 7 beta, all on Win 
XP. I usually have browser windows sized at an external width of 800 
pixels but with Netscape 7 or Mozilla I make heavy use of the sidebar 
panel resulting in the content area having a width of about 620 pixels.
This with both Netscape 7 and Mozilla 1.2.1 results in the link with 
text Internationalization being cut off, you can read Internationalizati.
This caused me to try to check rendering when the content area is even 
smaller, and indeed when you resize the window to a smaller width 
Mozilla/NN7 keep the three column but content in the left column is cut off.
When I check the same with IE6 it behaves much differently, it assures 
that the content in columns is visible but drops the three column 
layout, e.g. at a content are width of 566 it renders the left and 
middle column side by side but the right column is rendered below the 
other two. If you further reduce the width then IE moves the middle 
column below the left, keeping the left column content visible (e.g 
Internationalization is not cut off).
Opera 7 beta exhibits the same behaviour as Mozilla, even with a very 
low width of the content area the three columns are rendered side by 
side but the content in the left column is cut off.
Thus at least with Mozilla and Opera it seems that the choosen CSS 
column layout has its shortcomings as content is cut off in the left 
column if the content area width is low.
I am also wondering which browser is doing the right thing here, Mozilla 
and Opera keeping the three columns side by side but cutting off content 
or IE6.
