Clicking on "respond to this message" didn't get me the result I expect, 
a webmail interface complete with quoting of the previous message, which 
is irrelevant to my comment anyway.

Why is the identification paragraph so unimportant that it must be 
rendered at only about 80% of normal, yet needs to be right near the top 
of the screen? I realize that this size is the result of "font-size: 
small" css (8/9). To me, the absolute value sizes are far too 
granular..92em or .93em would be a much better single step smaller, and 
  more nearly correct size for this paragraph, assuming any deemphasis 
at all is appropriate.
