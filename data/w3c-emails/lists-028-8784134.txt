Excellent!! :-)

Why don't you go a step further and try to publish it in XHTML Basic?

It wouldn't be difficult and you would improve accessibility even more. You
should only have to do some minor changes (remove a <map> tag, a <sup> tag and
adjust some few attributes), and it's done!

Best regards.
