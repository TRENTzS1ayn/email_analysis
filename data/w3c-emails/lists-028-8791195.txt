  My husband is handicapped and frequently presses a lot of buttons on 
this computer without realizing what he is doing .  Now we get your page 
instead of my home page of yahoo.  He has lost all of our email and 
bookmarks which I use.  Please remove this from our computer.  I am 
sorry that he did this and hope you will be able to do this for us. We 
are new to this home computer and only use it on a limited basis.  I can 
see this web site or program is far above us.

Sincerely,  Joan and Dick Schultheis
