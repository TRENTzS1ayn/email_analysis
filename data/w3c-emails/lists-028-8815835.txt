I have adapted W3C Home page to XHTML Basic 1.0. It was far from difficult (*),
and I also improved a little the CSS style to bottom aligning the three columns
(an issue which has received some complains in this mailing list). :-)

Please, take a look at http://www.it.uc3m.es/vlc/World.html and you will see the
result (W3C Home page from 2002/12/06). I have also changed the logo to properly
point to the XHTML Basic logo.

You can validate it as XHTML Basic at
http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.it.uc3m.es%2Fvlc%2FWorld.html

Best regards.

(*) Changes needed to improve W3C Home Page from XHTML Strict to XHTML Basic can
be seen at
http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=XHTML+Basic+1.0&verbose=1
. It was not difficult indeed. Only some minor changes at the page and at the
CSS files. Very easy!

With XHTML Basic, accessibility is much better improved.
