I'm concerned if it went ahead because of the many people (myself included) who use older browsers because of, for example: Corporate Policy,Older and less capable computers,old operating system and/or non upgradable internet appliences and consumer set-top boxes.You should maintain a set of pages for older browsers,to keep compatibility.Compatibility is what the W3C is about of course,isn't it?
