I have checked and you are not subscribed to any W3C mailing lists. I
suspect what happened is that "http://http://" was typed (twice)
instead of "http://" (once). There is a software bug in Netscape
Navigator that sends everyone to our site in this case. It wouldn't
explain the loss of bookmarks but it might help explain how you got to
the w3.org Web site. Please let us know if we can be of assistance.

Best wishes,
