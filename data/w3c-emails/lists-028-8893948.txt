This is almost certainly because your browser is telling the W3C site that
it accepts XHTML
by sending application/xhtml+xml in the Accept: header.

If you have installed XML Spy that would explain it, since it incorrectly
causes this to
be added to the IE accept: head; but there may be other reasons.
