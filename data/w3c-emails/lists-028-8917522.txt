In other words:

  1. Open Registry Editor (regedit.exe)
  2. Check [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Accepted Documents]
     to see if 'application/xhtml+xml' got added
  3. If it's there, delete it
  4. Quit Registry Editor and restart IE

Then you should be able to access http://www.w3.org/MarkUp with IE, i.e.
it gets 'text/html'.  IE doesn't support the 'application/xhtml+xml'
media type yet.

If the above process didn't fix your problem, please let me know.
