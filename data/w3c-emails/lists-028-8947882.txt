I was unable to view the redesigned home page. At first IE6 opens the download file dialogue box and then an error message saying:

"Internet Explorer cannot download / form www.w3.org.
Internet Explorer was unable to open this Internet site. The requested site is either unavailable or cannot be found. Please try again later."

No problems viewing the page in Mozilla and Phoenix. Just one nit to pick. Underlining of links with <acronym> tags seems to be a bit inconsistent. In Mozilla 1.0 some letters inside the <acronym> tag are underlined double thickness and in Phoenix all the content of <acronym> is underlined double thickness.

Bye,

Perry
