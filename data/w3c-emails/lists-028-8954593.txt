Hi.
 
I have been working on web pages since 1995 and always did it the
old-fashioned way by typing in all the HTML by hand.  Currently,
I am just learning CSS and XHTML and I REALLY like the look of the
w3c.org page and the fact that it validates so well.
 
http://w3c.org
 
I am the webmaster of a public library web site:
 
http://www.stockton.lib.ca.us/
 
and we will be re-designing our pages early next year and I was
wonderig if it was permissable to lift the code for the basic structure
or your page and the style sheets and change them to our colors,
information, and so on.
 
I have worked up just a preliminary look (with most of your code still
included  as the info.)
 
http://www.stockton.lib.ca.us/w3c_layout/w3c_layout.xhtml
 
I am assuming that this is somewhat like copying HTML as many web
designers  have done in the past to get a similar layout effect.
 
As I said, I REALLY like the look of your front page and wanted to make
sure if there was any problem in making our page look almost the same
(although different colors).
 
Thank you for responding to this message.
