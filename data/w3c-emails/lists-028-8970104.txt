I think that the order of the page is off, because it doesn't flow 
nicely
in linear order from most important to least. At the very least, the 
news
(as the thing that is updated the most) should come before the list of
links.  This is easily accomplished using CSS-P (CSS2) to place the page
components in proper two-dimensional position while still allowing the
linear page order to make sense.

The Lynx rendition of the homepage follows this message, in plaintext.
