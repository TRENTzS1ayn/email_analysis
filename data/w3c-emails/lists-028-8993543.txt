Thank you for the kind words. You are welcome to use the style sheets.
Please follow the instructions in the W3C Software Notice and License [1].

I should say:
- the page is in progress and can change
- float columns can require copyfitting

The W3C European host moves from INRIA to ERCIM on 1 January 2003. At
that time the copyright notice will change a bit and I expect it will
be appended to the CSS files.
