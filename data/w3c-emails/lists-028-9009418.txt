It would be possible to have a more logical order (i.e. have the "news 
block" first, followed by "A to Z" and the other navigation bar) if you 
are willing to sacrifice a wee bit of semantic goodness.

I included the news block and the A to Z in a container div which I 
floated left. The news block and A to Z are both floated right. The 
other navigation block is also floated left, so it touches the news 
block. After a bit of border fiddling*, it seems to work in Mozilla 1.3, 
IE6, Opera 6 and 7 (all on Windows, don't know about other OSes). Might 
be an approach worth trying?

* It requires that the news block is the longest of the three blocks to 
have the borders appear correctly

[Sorry Ian: was meant to go to the entire list in the first place]
