Hello,

Unfortunately, our policy prevents us from changing the already
published document. Our specifications no longer use this
background for good reason...

You can download the first page of the specification
and in the HTML change:

   <body background="images/recbg.jpg">

to:

   <body>

I note that the chapters after the cover page do not
use the background image.
