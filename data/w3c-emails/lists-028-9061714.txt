Hmmm. I can see why, yet this is purely a presentational change.
Isn't the point of CSS to separate content from presentation, so
that presentation can be changed without affecting the content?
Adding anchor styles to "styles/default.css" would in no way
change the spec, but *would* make it more readable in some cases.

Surely in the CSS spec of all places, this should have been:

<body style="background-image: url(images/recbg.jpg);">

in the first place :-)
