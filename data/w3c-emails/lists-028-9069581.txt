I know that lynx is an ancient way to view Web site text,
but I'm surprised that I can't seem to access your updated
site using lynx.  I get a status bar message saying:

    text/html;charset=utf-8  D)ownload, or C)ancel

I check my Web sites for lynx compatibility because a
blind friend once told me he used a reader based on
lynx to access Web sites.
