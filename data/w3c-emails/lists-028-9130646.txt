I want to have a local mirror on my laptop of the current
recommendations.

When I run wget, it seems to be traversing and getting multiple copies
of the same documents - perhaps the site is set up with links, but wget
doesn't know this.

I know things are updated regularly, but I am in Vanuatu and my download
costs are really high, and so I want to be able to read while offline.
It is pretty frustrating for me at the moment.

If there is such a thing as a download tarball of the site - or even for
different groups of documents/ standards, that would be really, really
appreciated.

Sincerely
Zenaan
