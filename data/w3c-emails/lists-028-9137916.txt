Hello Zenaan,

Certain W3C tech report editors make available packages for
offline reading. However, W3C does not make available a big
package of stuff (e.g., all Recommendations). We've talked
about that in the past but not pursued it for a number of
reasons.

Do you have access to a tool (e.g., wwwoffle [1]) that will
do caching of style sheets, etc. for you? I myself have
not used such tools extensively, but they should be more
convenient than individual GET requests.
