Hi!,

First of all, congratulations for the recent redesign!

I've noticed a bug which occurs on Internet Explorer 5.5 and 6.0 for PC
(and possibly on other versions/platforms) because of the label element not
having a separate closing tag.

The two following label elements appear on the W3C home page as part of the
search form.
<label for="inputField" accesskey="E" />
<label for="goButton" accesskey="G" />

IE6 seems to thinks that these are open tags which are never closed. This
results in submitting the search form (as if the "Go" button would have
been clicked) accidentally whenever any non-link part of the page following
the "Go" button is clicked.
Try clicking on the right pane (below the form) and also in the copyright
text at the bottom of the page. This results in accidentally submitting the
form.

The following work-around causes Internet Explorer 6 to behave as expected:
<label for="inputField" accesskey="E"></label>
<label for="goButton" accesskey="G"></label>

Best regards,

Patrick
