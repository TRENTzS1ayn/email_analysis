To Whom It May Concern:
 
The new look of the W3C site is very nice and much better when compared
with the older style.
 
There is one problem.  When I try to navigate the the Markup Directory I
receive a download prompt.  Attached I am sending screen shots of what I
see.  I am using the latest IE 6 browser and have installed all the
latest patches.  If you have any insight as to why I am seeing this
prompt, could you please let me know.
 
Thank you for your time.
 
Sincerely,
 
Richard Norman
Web/Application Developer
