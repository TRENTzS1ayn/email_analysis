Hello,

It is very difficult to find or navigate to the most current
standard or draft document. The link is usually hidden in the middle of a
sentence contained in a list or not present at all. An example would be the
XML and related standards. One would assume that the most current standards
document would be popular downloads or page views. Thus, the site would be
improved if these links were placed in a more apparent location.

Thanks,
