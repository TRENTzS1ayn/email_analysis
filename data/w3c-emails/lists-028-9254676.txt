In my earlier mail I didn't mention the file I downloaded.

Some downloadable HTML-documents ? the ones I downloaded, e.g.: PNG (Portable Network Graphics) Specification.htm ? have an error in there in-document named link URL's. Those named link URL's are still pointing to the original document on w3.org, instead of the named link in the downloaded document.

I solved this problem with the search and replace function of my editor, but I assume it wasn't ment and it's a real error. For the rest the your site is the best resourch-site I know about.

With kind regards,
