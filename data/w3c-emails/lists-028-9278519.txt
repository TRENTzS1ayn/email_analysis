On 6 January 2002 W3C's base style sheet was changed thanks to your
suggestion.

a img {color: white}          /* To hide the border in Netscape */
@media all {                  /* Hide from Netscape 4 */
     a img {color: inherit}    /* Undo the rule above */
}

Thank you again for writing. Apologies for the delayed reply.
