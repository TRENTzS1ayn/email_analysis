Hello,

I suppose the main page of the Archive of W3C News and Announcements:
  http://www.w3.org/News/
should have a link to news in this year.  This will be a very little
improvement of navigation.

I do not subscribe this list.  If you need more information, please
contact me by direct email.  Thank you.
