Hi Joe,

There is no "DTD specification", which may explain why
we haven't done more to expose one. A number of different
specifications define DTDs. That list is available in
the site index [1] under "DTD". The site index is linked
from the home page.

If you type DTD in the search box you get some of the
specific DTDs for various specs (e.g., HTML 4).

The XML 1.0 specification defines what it is
to write an XML DTD. The following question is in the
XML FAQ [2]: "C.12 How do I create my own DTD?" (C.15
talks about XML Schemas). I would *definitely* like
to make FAQs easier to find. Some are linked from the site
index, but the XML FAQ is not. I'll make sure it's
added.

Here's a project I'd like (personally) to outsource
to the Web community: design an alternative home
page that is less technical than the current home
page. I don't want to get rid of the current home
page because it's useful to the technical audience.

I'd like an alternative "New to W3C?" home page to
have less information and provide the following:

  * Links to W3C FAQs (which should also be in the site
    index)

  * Links to tutorials

  * A brief explanation of what W3C does, with links
    to the TR page, the software page, the activities
    page, the site index, search box, and of course
    the regular home page.

I have a preference that this new page not use tables
for layout.

Looking forward to contributions,

  _ Ian

Wouldn't it make a lot more sense to just have a link to it in the left navigation bar?  It's hard to learn how to write a DTD when you can't find a spec on it. ;)
