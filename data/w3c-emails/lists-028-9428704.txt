Hello,
On your web site, the page:
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/
has this link (in the section "This version:" ):
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/html40.pdf.gz     gzip'ed PDF file [963Kb]
I tried to download the file twice, each time it started OK then went extremely fast and I wound up with a 2940 Kb file that I could not open.
It seems the file being delivered has a problem. I downloaded plain text [794Kb] with no problem.
