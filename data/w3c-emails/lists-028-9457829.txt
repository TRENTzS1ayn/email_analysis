Hello all together (and please sorry may bad english)

I am looking for your Logo WAI-A to put at my homepage.

The URL is http://www.afba.de

I do not understand all items of the WAI-A, AA and AAA text, so i can't
prove myself.
So please, can you look and tell me, if I may use your Logo or not.
Or is there any machine like bobby?

Thats all.

Have a nice day

Yours

Bernd Marscheider, webmaster of afba.de
