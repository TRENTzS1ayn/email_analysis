Despite a lot of effort, I was unable to find any link to
any XML specifications through your Web presence.  (I found
tons of other interesting material.)

It seems to me that learning HTML, XML, XHTML, etc would be
one of the main things that would draw users to your site,
and that you could at least provide some useful links, if not
the actual information.

Through a search on Google, I discovered www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml.  :-)
