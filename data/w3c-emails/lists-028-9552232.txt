Ok, this time I have directed my "reply" to site-comments@w3.org....

Maybe something as simple as an additional link "Documents" or
"Documentation" or "Specifications" on the blue banner at the top.  
[I don't know WHY I never noticed that banner before.]   
Then one should arrive at a page organized by *topic*, including 
*just* the things the newcomer or user would care about.
I'm picturing something like this:

HTML
HTML tutorial
HTML 4 standard
HTML 3.2 standard
HTML 2.0 standard
link to other documents
XML
XML FAQ
Introduction to XML
XML Specifications
XHTML
(etc)


BTW, I *love* the w3 site and have used it over the years
as a primary source for material I use in classes.  Too 
often, secondary sources turn out to be wrong.

I think if you made your site more beginner-friendly, more
people might tend to follow your advice and buy in to your 
point of view.  Today's beginner is tomorrow's practitioner. :-)
