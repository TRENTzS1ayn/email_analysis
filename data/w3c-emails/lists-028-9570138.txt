Hello,

I am working with the web technology for years. I use to go for my search or
research purpose on net. One thing which always border me is that I do not
know how actual is the information which I am reading. Because it not the
normal practice to embossed web publishing date on the web page.

I am not worried about now, because our web technology is not more than 14
year old. But what will happen when we celebrate silver or golden jubilee of
WWW. If at that time w3 would have answer for this important question. I do
not think if we have another 10 year of web development than anybody can
sort immense information according to date.

I want to suggest that embossing a time stamp should be made as web
development standard. I have also suggestion, how it should be implemented.
If it is some how interesting for you then let me. I will let this
discussion for the next mail.

With best wishes.
