Kamal,

HTTP/1.1 includes a "Last-Modified"  entity-header (see
section 14.29):

   "The Last-Modified entity-header field indicates the date and 

    time at which the origin server believes the variant was last
    modified.

Then:

   "HTTP/1.1 servers SHOULD send Last-Modified whenever feasible."

Perhaps what you want is already standardized.
