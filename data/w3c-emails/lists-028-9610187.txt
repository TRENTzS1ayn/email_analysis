Hello,

at http://www.w3.org/XML/ info says that "The XML FAQ" by Peter Flynn et. 
al. is in version 1.5 (1 June 1999), while in fact on his page it is v. 2.1 
(01.01.2002) now. But if he doesn't care to correct, it's okay with me as 
well :-) All the best for you guys!

Best regards
Przemyslaw Jackowski (mr.)
