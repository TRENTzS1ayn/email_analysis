Hello, Art,

>  What is the URI for the RSS format of the W3C's home page?

http://www.w3.org/2000/08/w3c-synd/home.rss

>  How often is it updated/re-created?

I think it is created on demand from:

http://www.w3.org/2000/08/w3c-synd/home2rss.xsl

The profile URI from the home page head element has some
information that might help:

http://www.w3.org/2000/08/w3c-synd/#

Does this answer your question?

(If not I will ask about this for you.)
