There's is no need to be agressive !

What I'm trying to explain you is in the W3C FAQ :

http://www.w3.org/Help/Webmaster#spam

that you have read, as any sysadmin or user  complaining about spam 
coming from W3C has, haven't you ?

You even didn't quote the message we were supposed to be responsible for.
I will be happy to help you if you did me the common courtesy of sending 
the message and the headers.

Best regards.
