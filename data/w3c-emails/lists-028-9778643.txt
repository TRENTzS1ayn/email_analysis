Hi there, 
This is the only email I could find relating to w3c, if this does not apply 
here, could u please forward this msg to the right individual. 
I was wondering if there are any tools out there, that clean up code to XHTML 
Strict 1.0. I know HTML Tidy does XHTML cleaning, but only to Translational. 
If you do know where I could find about such a tool I would greatly 
appreciate it. Thanks.
