Hello,


The tidy documentation [1] indicates how to generate strict
XHTML 1.0. Use the "doctype" option:

doctype: omit, auto, strict, loose or <fpi>

   This property controls the doctype declaration generated by Tidy. 
If set to omit the output file won't contain a doctype declaration. 
If set to auto (the default) Tidy will use an educated guess based 
upon the contents of the document. If set to strict, Tidy will set 
the doctype to the strict DTD.

So, try:

  tidy --output-xhtml true --doctype strict file.html
