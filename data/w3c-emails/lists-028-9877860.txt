I'm using IE6 (v6.0.2600.0000) on Windows 2000 SP2 in the US.  When I go to http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/ I get a big blue screen that is completely blank.  Viewing the source I see the following as the first few lines and the rest of the page after that:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>

<!DOCTYPE html
  PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

I would assume that the xml tag shouldn't be there and the DOCTYPE should be the first line.

When I save the site without the <?xml ?> IE6 renders it just fine.  Heck, when I view the source and then save it it works fine.

When I save the site WITH the <?xml ?> IE6 renders it just fine. Wierd.  Oh, I just realized that it's because IE stuck this at the top of the page when it saves it:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<!-- saved from url=(0028)http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/ -->

Might it be a problem with the MIME type the file is being sent as?

GET /Style/XSL/ HTTP/1.0

Nope.

Even when I used Fetch to put the page on my own site saved as beckman.html it rendered in IE6.  So I'm just plain confused why it will work on my server, will work locally, but won't render correctly when on your site (www.w3.org).

HELP!
