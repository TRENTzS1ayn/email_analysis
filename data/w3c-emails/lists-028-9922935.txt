To Whom It May Concern: 

Good evening. 

I am currently developing a CSS editor, which will reach its final stage of development very soon. 

I based most of its development on the W3C's Recommendation for CSS Level 2. 

It is a commercial software, but I was wondering if you would be kind enough to grant me the right me to add in the package the complete HTML version of the Specification, as a *free* and convenient tutorial that would be accessible (offLine) from within the application, and navigated through by means of navigational links on the application interface in which it would be embedded. 

Please note that I do not need to alter the documents in any way, but merely to make its pages relevant to the application quickly accessible without forcing the user to either work onLine or to open a browser window. 

As the four major browsers are getting closer to a full implementation of CSS2 (except maybe for aural styleSheets), I would like my future users to base their knowledge of CSS on your Specification for CSS2, which I found to be clear, concise and very accurate, in other words, the best CSS tutorial available onLine. 

Secondly, I would like to know if I need any kind of permission from the W3C to allow the user of the application to use, when onLine, the CSS Validator on your site to validate styleSheets created from within the application. 

Please, do respond and let me know how to go from there; I think it may be in our common interest that I get this permission, in that it will spare me the paraphrasing of this huge Specification, and will help spread the standards of CSS much better than the superficial CSS Tutorials generally accompanying similar applications, which I would have to have recourse to in case of a refusal on your part because of lack of time. 

Nothing bothers me more than to add pages of compatibility issues, and cannot wait until the day when your edicts will strictly be adhered to by the browser developers. 

In advance, and in any case, thank you for your time and attention, as well as for making such a high quality reference freely available onLine. 

I am looking forward to reading back from you. 

Sincerely, 

Charles-Eric Sesiano.
