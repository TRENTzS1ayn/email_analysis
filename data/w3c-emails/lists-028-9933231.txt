I believe the usage you describe falls within the scope of the
document use notice [1]. You need to include a link to the
source document at the W3C site, and include the original
copyright statement and status section.

See also:

  'We request that authorship attribution be provided in any
   software, documents, or other items or products that you create
   pursuant to the implementation of the contents of this document,
   or any portion thereof.'

And copyright FAQ question 5.2 [2].

Right: 'No right to create modifications or derivatives of W3C 
documents is granted pursuant to this license. '

Glad to hear it. :)

That sounds like a good idea. I do not think there is any problem
providing a link to http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ from
your software. You should probably acknowledge it as the W3C CSS
Validation Service.

Good luck, and thanks for implementing CSS2!
