Hello Jonathan,

Actually there is no error here. In this case the order doesn't
matter. Within the 'border' property, the width, style and color may
be put in any order. That is what the '||' means. The order of the
other properties also doesn't matter, since none of them influences
the border.

The order is only important in cases where there are multiple border
properties, as in this case:

    border: thin solid silver;
    border-top: thick solid silver
vs
    border-top: thick solid silver
    border: thin solid silver;

In the first case, the top border will be thick, since the 2nd line
overrides the first. In the second case, the top border will be thin.
You can easily see that, if you expand the shorthand properties. The
first case expands to:

    /* border -> */     border-top: thin solid silver;
                        border-right: thin solid silver;
                        border-bottom: thin solid silver;
                        border-left: thin solid silver;

    /* border-top -> */ border-top: thick solid silver

which contains two occurrences of 'border-top' and thus the first one
is ignored.
