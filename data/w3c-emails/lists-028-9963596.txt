I was about to give http://www.w3c.org as a good reference for error
free code, but I see even your own site has errors, not many but
several in isolated areas.

Used
http://www.htmlhelp.com/cgi-bin/validate.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3c.org&spider=yes

was this appropriate, BTW no affiliation with that site.

Best regards
Colin Knight
