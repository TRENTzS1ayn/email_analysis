A good choice for suitable content. (Photographs, for example, are
more suited to JPEG compression).

The current version of Netscape is 7.1. The first version of netscape
to understand PNG graphics was 4.04, released in the summer of 1997.

Possibly you got the impression that PNG is not supported in netscape
from this article on the history of PNG:
http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pnghist.html
please note that this historical article was written in January 1997.
Things have moved on in the intervening 6 years ;-)

Yes, IE supports PNG on both the Windows and Mac versions of IE.

1 October 1996 was when PNG became an approved Web standard.
