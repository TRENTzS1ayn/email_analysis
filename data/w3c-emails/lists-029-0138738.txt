To whom it may concern:

My name is Richard Fisher. I am currently in the development stages of
building a web page and starting a business in the web design field. I would
like to gain permission from you to link to your site concerning XML. There
will be no adult material on any of the pages I make, for myself or for
clients. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
Richard A. Fisher
