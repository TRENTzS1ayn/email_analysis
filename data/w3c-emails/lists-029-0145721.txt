There seems to be an incompatibility between the W3C mail list archives 
and MS Outlook 2002/2003.  Others have noted it, and I expounded on the 
problem some a month ago [1].  I've been told that the Outlook 2002 
messages do have the correct soft line breaks when they leave the 
corporate mail gateway, so I'm not so sure that is the problem.

This is becoming a bigger and bigger problem for W3C communications.  
Can someone figure out that the problem really is?  Something in 
Outlook 2002/2003 output?  Or at W3C mail receiver?  Or at an 
intermediate server?  Is there a better place to ask this question?

Thanks,
xan
