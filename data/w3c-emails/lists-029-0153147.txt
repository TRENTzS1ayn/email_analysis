The list of XForms implementations
  http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/#implementations
would be much more useful to me if, for each
item there, it listed (a) platform, (b) license.
Bonus points for (c) release date.

Also, it's not obvious why some implementations
are listed before others. I suggest either stating
the ordering criteria or ordering them alphabetically
or by release date or some such.

Also, have you verified all of the claims made there?
If you're quoting materials that you haven't verified,
please make that clear (i.e. use <blockquote>).

Hmmm... the sentence "The XForms 1.0 Public Test Suite is available on
the W3C site." above the list suggests
the things in the list pass the tests in that suite.
I suggest adding something like"

The XForms 1.0 Public Test Suite is available
on the W3C site. Please use it to evaluate
the implementatations and report any problems
you find to the suppliers and/or to the
Working Group.

FYI, this is prompted by discussion of XForms and RDF...
