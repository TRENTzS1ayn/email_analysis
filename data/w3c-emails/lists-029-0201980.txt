Hello, Vanessa.

Thanks for your mail.

One of the most challenging things we face at W3C is how to produce the 
technical standards that serve as the foundation of the Web, and to 
somehow make them accessible to everyone.

Physically, we meet the challenge through posting them on the Web site, 
and giving people the option to request print copies if they like, and 
don't have their own printer.

But the writing level of specifications, often written by engineers (not 
technical writers) for engineers, can place obstacles for many readers. 
And certainly the acronyms we use can be confusing to those not familiar 
with Web technologies.

Since you've taken the time to write, perhaps you can indicate some 
specific examples of what you find so problematic. The "whole site" may 
be a valid way to express frustration, but pointing out a page, and 
making suggestions will better help us understand what results you're 
seeking and how to yield them.

Best regards,

Janet
