To Whom It May Concern,

I am wondering if the rendering of the content sections of your site is unique to me or if it is illegible to all who visit it. The type seems to be horizontally scaled by quite a bit, and the result is that I can't read more than a paragraph from it before developing a headache. I have tried increasing the text size in IE6 to "Largest" but the text is still nearly unreadable. I would choose a system font that is more easily read and avoid the bolding of almost all text, which makes following the hierarchy of the site overly challenging. As I have found in http://www.w3.org/2003/03/site-css/css/1-import.css, the use of the system font declaration of sans-serif results in the use of one of the least readable fonts on most machines...following the lead of other css driven sites which commonly use Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif in their declaration would be welcome.

Thank you for your attention to this matter,
Mike Carnohan
