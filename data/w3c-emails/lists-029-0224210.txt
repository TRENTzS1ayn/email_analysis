I followed this link...
"W3C Team
      * Past Talks"
from http://www.w3.org/ to http://www.w3.org/Talks/
where I see "Members of the W3C Team [...] often give talks and
presentations..."

which strongly suggests that Deborah Dahl, W3C Multimodal Interaction
Working Group Chair,
is in the W3C team.

Please revise the bits about these being talks
by the team. (Or take the talks by non-team
folks off or whatever).
