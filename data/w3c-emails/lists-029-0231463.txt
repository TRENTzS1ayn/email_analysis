"soft line break" means "a non-significant line break in the encoded
text (RFC2045)" of quoted-printable encoding. So our archive system
removed them and combined lines.

To solve problem, could you please check the value of "Automatically
wrap text"? It should be smaller than 76 (70 is safe for deep
quotation), or should be enough large (100, for example) and should be
line-broken manually within 76 characters.
