Surely the usefulness of soft line breaks is so that message viewers can wrap text freely to the user display knowing that they're not destroying significant line breaks.  I think the Archive utility that converts a message to HTML should apply some wrapping for the sake of readability.  If you still want to indicate which line breaks were in the original message then use a symbol for it in the HTML.

The current Archive behavior confounds member communication.

(I've changed my "Automatically wrap text" value to 70 for this message.)
