This site and address were associated with one or more unsolicited emails 
and advertisements that showed up on my computer.  I am sick and tired of 
this type of material.  I have decided on two courses of action.  One is to 
boycott any and all business that participate in this type of 
solicitation.  The other is to seek out civil and/or criminal actions 
against those that are participating in unsolicited emails and 
advertising.  I am putting you on notice with this message.  REMOVE my 
email addresses from any and all lists that you have access to, knowledge 
of or control of:  Do not sell my email addresses to other providers.
