Hello,
can you help us?
We try to reach the webmaster of the CUI
http://cui.unige.ch/meta-index.html
But no chance to reach him.

Can you please add our search engines
www.firstsfind.de
www.firstsfind.com

To list above?

That would be great.

Please write back soon, we're looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Matthias Schmid
