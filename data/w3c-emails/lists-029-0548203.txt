The list of ISO 639 language codes at:

http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm

incorrectly lists 'su' as "Sudanese"; in fact it should be "Sundanese".
(This seems to be a common error, and several other lists online show the
correction being made in 1992.)

This page comes up as #3 in a google search for "iso language codes" and
the w3c will be considered an authoritative source by many, so it may be
best to ensure that it's accurate.
