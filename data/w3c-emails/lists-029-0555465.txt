Hi folks,
Your work is very valuable. In the interest of making your work 
accessible to all who need it, and with all due respect, the manner in 
which you present your information online is absolutely counter 
productive. In a word, it's inaccessible, from the standpoint of 
usability or user-centered design. It is impossible to find what you're 
looking for, the language and written style is impossible for mere 
mortals and even web designers to understand (programmers may possibly 
understand it).

Who are your audiences?
Where is the:
" logical information architecture that is relevant to your several 
audiences?
" consistent, clear navigation on every page?
" consistent use of a well designed (readable) page layout?
" concise, easy to understand, well written content that is 
understandable to your audiences?

Best wishes,

Joy Bower
