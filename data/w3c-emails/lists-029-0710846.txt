Yes, this is a deliberate joke: look at the title of the slide!

The point I was making in the talk is that you don't have to be blind to
need accessible websites: people at the back of the room in a lecture often
can't read the slides.

(To add to the humour, I asked a blind person in the audience to yell out to
increase the size of the font).

'reatment' is a mistake, and should indeed have been 'treatment'.

Best wishes,

Steven Pemberton
