Hi,

The markup validator at http://validator.w3.org showed a result page
containing a link to
http://validator.w3.org/docs/errors.html#not-allowed-contained

Unfortunately this html document does not have an anchor called
"not-allowed-contained" (although it does have "not-allowed" and
"not-contained").

I was trying to validate http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au (which is missing a
DOCTYPE, so I forced it to HTML 4.01 Transitional).

Regards,
Luke.
