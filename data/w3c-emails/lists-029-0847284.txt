Hi!
Thanks for supporting this site - it's very useful.
I have to support a few web-pages and validate them for CSS-compatibility. I began to learn a syntaxys of CSS, and got to your site, where I took some examples and I... can't validate your examples!!! And now I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. Could there be some problem with your validator? Please, help me.

Here are examples from your site:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN">
<HTML>
  <HEAD>
    <TITLE>A compact box example</TITLE>
    <STYLE type="text/css">
      DT { display: compact }
      DD { margin-left: 4em }
    </STYLE>
  </HEAD>
  <BODY>
    <DL>
      <DT>Short
        <DD><P>Description goes here.
      <DT>too long for the margin
        <DD><P>Description goes here.
    </DL>
  </BODY>
</HTML>

It falls to validate with CSS.
Thanks, Dima.
