Recipe Summary

Prep Time: 20 minutes

Cook Time: 4 minutes

Yield: 4 servings

1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 8 pieces and lightly
pounded
Coarse salt and cracked black pepper
2 egg whites, beaten
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan
1/4 cup chopped parsley
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest (I use a rasp)
1 cup all-purpose flour, for dusting
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 lemon, cut into 8 wedges

Season chicken generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Place egg
whites in a shallow dish or plate. Whisk in cheese, parsley, and lemon zest.
Dredge
each chicken piece through the egg mixture, shaking off excess, and set in
flour. Shake the plate so chicken pieces get coated, turn chicken over and
repeat.
Shake off all of the excess flour. Lay on a cookie sheet lined with
parchment and set next to stove.

Heat oil in a 12-inch non-stick pan over medium high heat. When hot but not
smoking, add chicken and cook, turning once, until golden and cooked
through,
about 2 minutes per side. Serve with lemon wedges

ileana.
