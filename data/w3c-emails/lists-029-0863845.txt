  Amount  Measure       Ingredient -- Preparation Method
--------  ------------  --------------------------------
  2               cups  defatted, unsalted chicken broth
  1         tablespoon  olive oil
  2          teaspoons  ground cumin
  2        tablespoons  pickling spice
     1/2                red bell pepper - sliced
  1              pound  boneless chicken breast halves
     1/2                yellow bell pepper - sliced
  2        tablespoons  minced jalapeno chili
  1                     onion - halved and  thinly sliced
     1/3           cup  rice wine vinegar
     1/4           cup  fresh cilantro leaves
  3              large  garlic cloves - minced

Boil broth and pickling spice in heavy large saucepan ten minutes.  
Strain and return liquid to saucepan.  Add chicken, onion, vinegar, 
garlic, oil and cumin to pan.  Simmer over very low heat until chicken 
is just cooked through, about ten minutes.  Transfer chicken and onions 
to shallow dish.  Top with bell peppers and minced chile.  Boil cooking 
liquid about ten minutes, until reduced to 2/3 cup.  Pour liquid over 
chicken and let cool 30 minutes.  Add cilantro to chicken mixture.  
Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, turning chicken occasionally, 
about 4 hours (can be prepared one day ahead).  Slice chicken and 
transfer to plates.  Top with marinated vegetables and some of the 
juices.  Serve with tortilla chips.  130 calories per serving;  4g fat,
