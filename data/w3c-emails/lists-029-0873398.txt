**I use leftover, frozen turkey gravy instead of water....  If you use water, watch it very closely as it can scorch.

Hatch Green Chile Sauce

Source: "The Border Cookbook"
by Cheryl Alters Jamison and Bill Jamison

Ingredients:
3 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced 
2 tsp all-purpose flour
2 cups chopped roasted mild green chile, preferably New Mexican or Anaheim, fresh or frozen
2 cups chicken stock 
1 tsp salt
1 tsp ground coriander


Directions:
- In a heavy saucepan, warm the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and saut? until well softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and saut? for an additional minute, then add the flour and continue cooking for another 1 or 2 minutes. Mix in the chile. Pour in the stock and add the seasonings. Bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to a low simmer and cook for about 15 minutes, until thickened but still very pourable.
- Serve warm with enchiladas or other dishes. The sauce keeps, refrigerated, for about 5 days and freezes well. 

Note from Linda: I buy loads of the fresh Hatch chiles from Hatch, New Mexico when they are shipped to Arizona each year. They are wonderful in this sauce and for everything else! 

If you have a hard time finding Hatch Chiles in your neck of the woods check out this website. They sell authentic Hatch Chile products and deliver right to your door Hatch-Chile.com . 

Now you don't have an excuse, go buy some!

Gloria's Green Chile Stew 

Green chile stew is not a North Mexico/South Texas dish, but popular here. It is a high country New Mexico dish made with mutton and New Mexico chiles (Chiles Anaheims). We make it with either Boston butt or pork chops. The chiles are roasted and peeled as described in the appendix on chiles("Cocina Ranchera"). Chiles Poblanos may be used and if so, are handled the same way as the Chiles Anaheims. 

Ingredients:
12 green chiles Anaheims, chopped coarse(substitute two-7 oz. cans)
1 Tbsp flour
2-1/2 lbs pork chops, trimmed
3 tomatillos, chopped coarse
? cup chicken broth
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tsp black peppercorns
? medium yellow onion, chopped
1 tsp whole comino


Directions:
- Cube pork chops and dust in flour. Fry cubed pork until barely browned.
- Grind garlic, comino, and peppercorns into paste in mortar or molcejete.
- Add all ingredients together in large skillet or enameled cast iron pot. Simmer about 15 minutes.
- Mix chicken broth and garlic/comino mixture and add to meat in pot. Simmer until meat is tender and flavors are blended. Add water as needed to make "gravy".
- Serve over cooked rice.
