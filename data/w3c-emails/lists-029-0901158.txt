CROCKPOT CHICKEN AND CORNMEAL DUMPLINGS

1 (9 ounce) package frozen cut green beans, thawed
2 cups cooked chicken, cubed
2 cups potatoes, diced
1 (13 3/4 ounce) can chicken broth
1 (12 ounce) can vegetable juice cocktail (V8)
1 teaspoon chili powder
6 drops hot pepper sauce
1/3 cup yellow cornmeal
2 tablespoons parsley, snipped
1/2 cup celery; chopped
1/2 cup onion, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cups biscuit baking mix
1 cup sharp American cheese, shredded, divided
2/3 cup milk

Put green beans in crockpot. Mix together chicken, potatoes, chicken broth, vegetable juice, celery, onion, chili powder, salt and hot pepper sauce, and add to crockpot. Cover. Cook on LOW for 4 hours. Turn to HIGH and heat until bubbly. Add water at this point if needed.

Combine biscuit baking mix, cornmeal, 1/2 cup cheese and parsley. Add milk and stir until just moistened. Drop by tablespoons onto stew; cover. Cook 2 1/2 hours more (don't lift cover). Sprinkle dumplings with remaining cheese.
