Hello W3C,

I find your site very helpful and turn to it a lot.  I'm a web designer and 
find that i'm moving more towards building websites for larger resolutions 
1024x768 as people tend to be setting there resolutions smaller these days 
whilst having larger monitors.

My question is: According to the W3C do you still consider 800x600 a 
standard browser resolution or is it now 'old hat' and not supported?  I ask 
so that i can relay this information on to clients when requesting there 
chosen display/design.

I look forward to your response.
Kind regards
Jaime
