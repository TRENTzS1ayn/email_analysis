Jose, Susan,

Can you elaborate on that a little?  So we can know what we (and our 
mail clients) are doing wrong and can avoid the problem in the future?

I noticed the problem happens on messages from me when I use Outlook 
2002, but not Outlook 2000 or Mac Mail.  Looking at the messages, 
Outlook 2002 and 2000 both claim to be doing quoted-printable, and both 
are wrapping lines at 78 characters or less, but 2002 messages have an 
"=" at the end of each paragraph while 2000 (and other clients I've 
observed) use "=" or "=20" for soft breaks within a paragraph.  So an 
Outlook 2000 paragraph looks like (hoping the "=" doesn't get lost):

1 .................78
This is a wrapped =
paragraph sent =
from Outlook 2000.

(Don't remember if there is a final "=" or not.)

An Outlook 2002 paragraph looks like:

1 .................78
This is a wrapped
paragraph sent
from Outlook 2002.=

My raw message viewer doesn't let me distinguish line endings, so I'm 
not sure about CRLF vs CR vs LF.

Oddly, if a sysadmin looks at my message at the SMTP gateway, the 2002 
message looks like the 2000 message (it has "=" at the end of each 
line), so I'm still investigating.

Thanks for any information.
