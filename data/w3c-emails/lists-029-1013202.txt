Good Morning,

I am the Webmaster of a Penn State Web site, and we have purchased a new tool to 
assist us with keeping our site ADA compliant.  The new tool is telling us that we need 
to "clarify natural language".  We have the following code at the top of all of our Web 
pages:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

It was our understanding that this code clarified our natural language.  Could you advise 
us if we need to make revisions to this code?

I greatly appreciate your assistance.

Thank you.
