Greetings,

I've been using XSL to transform XML documents into HTML for a couple of
months now.  All the examples I've seen use different XSL versions.  The two
that I use the most are http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform/
<http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform/>  and http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xsl/
<http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-xsl/> , while the latest is
http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/ <http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/> .  It would be nice if
the W3C can add a page that compares one version of a W3C language with
another version.  Make one of these two the latest, but give them the
ability to compare any two.  It would also be nice if it was intuitive
enough to tell us when something became obsolete, what should be used
instead.  I would like to modify all my XSL documents, eventually, to use
the final XSL standard.  Unfortunately, I don't know what to replace certain
tags with and this would help a lot.  Thanks.
