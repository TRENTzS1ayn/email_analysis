Integrating E-learning, Learning Management and Knowledge Management: Challenges and Opportunities for Human Capital

THE CHALLENGE:
In today's knowledge economy, many organizations are reliant on the knowledge and competence of individual organizational members. According to GAO, more than 50% percent of the government's 1.6 million full-time employees will be eligible to retire in the next five years. In addition, 65 percent of the Senior Executive Service will be eligible for retirement by 2004. 

US organizations spend $100 billion annually on training and consulting, often failing to improve operations. Research indicates only 10 to 20 percent of this training investment results in enhanced job effectiveness. To achieve mission success, organizations have to find a way to capture, index, disseminate and reuse the knowledge, wisdom and experience of their most valuable asset, their knowledge workers. The President's management agenda recognizes this, making Strategic Management of Human Capital an objective and a critical imperative for success. 

The objective of these emerging systems is to enhance individual and organizational performance through integrated knowledge management and structured organizational learning. 

Strategic Knowledge Management (SKM) aligns your mission with an integrated web-centric e-learning, learning management, knowledge management solutions to enhance individual and organizational performance, using dynamic, personalized content. The result is on-demand, task-specific, automated, customized, intelligent and seamless access to organizational knowledge and intelligence. 

THE EXECUTIVE BRIEFING
Join other Government and industry leaders at the National Press Club to learn how Knowledge-Media and Autonomy can radically enhance individual and organizational performance using the latest automated knowledge management, learning management and e-learning technologies and standards.
