For comparison, we use "cvs diff", i.e., we use the power
of the cvs archives and the ability to look at the diffs
between any two versions. Often, editors make available
the diffs between two documents in succession at a stable
URI.

I don't think we want to create a separate page for this,
because we would have to update it constantly. This is something
that should be done by programs on request.

W3C has pondered that problem at length. We have chosen a policy for the
time being that gives preference to "never touching the bits" over "show
me when this document is obsolete". In other words, we consider the
archival value of stable document to be greater than the value of
informing the user when a particular document has become obsolete.

Instead, each document includes two URIs, the "latest version' and the
"this version" URI.

You will always find the latest version of a given document series at
the "latest version" URI. If you need stability however (i.e., an
unchanging specific version), you would use the "this version" URI.

The stable Recommendation this version URI for XSL 1.0 is:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xsl-20011015/

The XSL WG is working on version 2.0 of the language, currently
a Working Draft (which means it WILL change). The "latest version" URI
of this version of XSL is:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/

I hope this helps.
