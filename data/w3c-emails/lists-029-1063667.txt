Looks like forcing iso-8859-1 didn't help for the wrapping on the list archive.  Trying the same message with utf8 (again from outlook 2002).

Just to add some information (and test my theory by posting to the list), I have noticed that the problematic messages (no soft breaks) from Outlook 2002 seem to only occur when the encoding is us-ascii.  If I force the encoding to something else like utf-8 or iso-8859-1 by either including a non-ascii character or telling Outlook to not auto-select the encoding, then it seems to wrap correctly with soft breaks.
