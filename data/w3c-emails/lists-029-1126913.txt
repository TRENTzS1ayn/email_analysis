Dear Sir/Madam

Well the Royal Society media thing certainly doesn't work on SuSE Linux 
8.0 (with RealPlayer 8.0 installed and working perfectly, thank you).  
The popup I get has a dead RealPlayer on it and no link or URL to allow 
me to get at the video/vnd.rn-realvideo or whatever media I need to open 
in RealPlayer. 

Why try and be so clever with all your popups and scripts that we don't 
have a simple, standards-compliant link to the streaming media???  Do 
you understand the irony???  You've made it necessary for me to have the 
latest Micro$oft products or this part of the World Wide Web (with T 
B-L's webcast on it) is unavailable to me!!!!

I wish I had Tim Berner's Lee's e-mail address,  I'd cc this to him.
