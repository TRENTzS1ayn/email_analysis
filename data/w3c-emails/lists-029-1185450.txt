sure, but they're meager:
http://www.w3.org/2001/04/20-ACLs

I just went through and added some pointers to other docs at the bottom.

The system is designed to be general to any organization -- the

structure. I'd be interested to see it used elsewhere and see what
needs to be adjusted to do so.

Have fun and let me know if you need anything.
