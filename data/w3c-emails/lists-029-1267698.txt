Hi, the W3C web sites have many answers to technical questions,
but for non-members it's rather difficult to find any contact
info for administrative questions.

So far I found http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1ietf-liaisons.txt with
an appointed W3C liaison, the same person also listed as the
current IAB chair.  Unfortunately affiliated with verisign.com,
and that might be a conflict of interests as stated on your
page http://www.w3.org/2003/06/Process-20030618/policies.html

Where can I find further details about these procedures, as far
as the W3C is concerned ?
                         Bye, Frank
