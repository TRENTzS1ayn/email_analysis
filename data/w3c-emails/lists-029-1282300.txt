For over 3 years now I have been wondering why the community that manages 
the web domain extentions has not enforced the use of .xxx | .sex | .adu for 
all pornographic sites that are out on the web.

Please explain to me how we may be able to get these sites converted over to 
an extention such as those listed above. This would make filtration of these 
types of sites very efficient and would protect our children from viewing 
this type of content.
