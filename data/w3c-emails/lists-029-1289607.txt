Hello,

You may wish to direct your question to ICANN, as W3C does
not manage the domain name registry.

While I have not researched the question, one answer may
be that the expectation was not that people managing
adult sites would be required to change domain names, but
that people who wanted more obvious domain names could
have them.

In short: that such sites would be easier to find, but
not necessarily easier to filter.

But this is my entirely uninformed guess. Please contact
ICANN if you have further questions.

Thank you,

 _ Ian
