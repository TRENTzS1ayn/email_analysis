Hello-
I looked through the home page and several other pages looking for the place where I can check my website to see if it meets W3C web accessibility criteria (essentially something where I can place my web address and get a read-out of the various priority areas).
Please direct me to this information on your site.

Thank you

Scott Steinbrecher
