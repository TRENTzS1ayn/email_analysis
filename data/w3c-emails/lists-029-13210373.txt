Dear Sir,

Royale Sport are a long established wholesaler specialising in clearance sportswear.

We are interested in buying any close out lines you may have for cash purchase. We are particularly interested in any Rugby or Cricket goods currently available, but will consider anything else you may have. Please let me know of any offers you have.

We also have a number of lines to clear ourselves, so let me know if you would be interested in receiving our list.

I look forward to hearing from you

Best Regards
