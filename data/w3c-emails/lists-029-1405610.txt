Presentational elements and attributes were deprecated in HTML 4 and
thus in XHTML. The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language is most often
used for presentation. For centering text elements like h1-h6 or p's or
div's I use the CSS rule 'text-align: center;". Tables used to be a
little harder because of browser implementations but I imagine newer
browsers do fine with the CSS margin properties.

If you search the www-style archive [1] I think you'll find discussion
on centering, for example for the search phrase "center table" [2].

If you have a newsgroups client,
comp.infosystems.www.authoring.stylesheets has knowledgeable
participants or look for other groups [3] or in the Google groups
archive [4] for comp.infosystems.www.authoring.stylesheets.
