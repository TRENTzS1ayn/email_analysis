Dear Sir,

This letter may spring surprise to you ,however,the contents and the 
underlying intentions are very genuine.
I am Mr Hassan Tukur from the Republic of
Zimbabwe.

I got your contact from an information center,here in Australia.

I am the son of late Michael Tukur of Republic of
Zimbabwe,my father was one of the wealthy black
farmers, whose farms were confiscated by the
government of President Robert Mugabe.

If you are conversant with public issues,you will know
that Zimbabwe has been passing through a prolonged
period of civil and political strife.
My father who was a frontline opposition politician
was one of the people killed by president Robert
Mugabe because he opposed the acqusition of white
owned farm lands by the president.

In his life time,he was the chairman of the bulawayo
farmers association.Prior to his death,there was a
certain sum of money $8.5millionUS Dollars to be
precise, which was earmarked for the purchase of arms
to wage war against the government forces by the
farmers.

This money was taken to a security company in Europe deposited there as gold 
and
emeralds,pending when the negotiations regarding the
purchase of the arms will be finalised.Unfortunately
this negotiations did not come through before my
father died.

Right now,i am the only person who has knowledge of
where this money is,and i am also in posession of the
relevant documents relating to this deposit.

I am now in Australia as an asylum seeker with the help of some

party members from my place, the government of Robert Mugabe is unleashing
terror attacks on our opposition party members.
The asylum laws here do not allow asylum seekers to
engage in any business to the magnitude of the money i
have mentioned here.

I am asking for your assistance to help me transfer
this money in any overseas account of yours,where it
can be invested in any viable business,and part of it

sent to me so that i can leave this country.

I promise to give you 20% of this money for your
assistance ,while we will set aside 5% of the total
sum to defray costs arising from this transaction.

Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk
free.If you are in the scope to help me carry out this
transaction,kindly contact me via my email.

I look forward to your response.
Best Regards, 
Hassan Tukur.
