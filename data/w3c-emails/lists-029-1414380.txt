I looked at the WAI home page and found Evaluation and Repair Tools [1]
in the WAI Resources index [2]. From past experience, Bobby is wonderful
as are others but you have to take that readout carefully (don't waste
time until you are certain that the suggestion applies in your case). I
think it is still necessary to do the final check yourself using the
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines [3].

For more information please contact WAI directly as they really are the
experts.
