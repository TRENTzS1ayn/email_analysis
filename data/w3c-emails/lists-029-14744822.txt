DEAR SIR,                  

               STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL   

WE ARE MEMBERS OF A SPECIAL COMMITTEE FOR BUDGET ANDPLANNING OF THE
NIGERIAN NATIONAL 
PETROLEUMCORPORATION (NNPC). THIS COMMITTEE IS PRINCIPALLY CONCERNED WITH
CONTRACT 
AWARDS AND APPROVAL. 

WITH OUR POSITIONS, WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SECURED FOR OUR SELVES THE SUM OF
TWENTY-ONE 
MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS(US$21.5M).THIS AMOUNT
WAS GOTTEN 
FROM ACCRUED COMMISSIONS I MADE FROM SOME CONTRACTS THAT I WAS PRIVILEGED
TO AWARD TO 
SOME FOREIGN CONTRACTORS THAT DID CONTRACTS FOR MY CORPORATION IN THE YEAR
1999.  BASED ON 
INFORMATION GATHERED ABOUT YOU, WE BELIEVE YOU WOULD BE IN A POSITION TO
HELP US IN 
TRANSFERRING THIS FUND (US$21.5M) INTO A SAFE ACCOUNT. 

IT HAS BEEN AGREED THAT THE OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT WILL BE COMPENSATED WITH
20% OF THE 
REMITTEDFUNDS, WHILE WEKEEP 70%, AND 10% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO OFFSET
EXPENSES AND PAYTHE 
NECESSARY TAXES.  ALL MODALITIES OF THIS TRANSACTION HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT
AND ONCE STARTED 
WILL NOT TAKE MORE THAN 10 WORKING DAYS, WITH YOUR FULL SUPPORT. THIS
TRANSACTIONIS 100% 
RISK FREE.  

IF THIS PROPOSAL SATISFIES YOU, PLEASE REACH US BY FAX OR PHONE,FOR MORE
INFORMATION. IT MIGHT 
BEDIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH TO ME, BECAUSE OF POORTELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEM
HERE. PLEASE 
KEEP TRYING, YOUWILL DEFINITELY GET THROUGH. PLEASE TREAT AS URGENTAND
VERY CONFIDENTIAL. 

YOURS FAITHFULLY, 

DR.FRANK MADU.  


NB.:
FOR CONFIDENTIAL REASONS AND DUE TO THE POOR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IN MY
COUNTRY, MOST 
OFTEN FOREIGNCALLS COULD BE DIVERTED TO THE WRONG PERSON. SO FOR YOU TO BE
VERY SURE YOU 
ARE RIGHTLY SPEAKING WITH ME, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN YOU CALL AND
ASK FOR ME,THE 
MOMENT I PICK UP THE PHONE, YOU SHOULD ASK MEFOR THE "CODE WORD" AND MY
ANSWER WOULD BE 
"BORN GREAT"BEFORE WE PROCEED DISCUSSIONS, BUT IF I DO NOT SAY"BORN
GREAT",THAT MEANS YOU 
ARE NOT SPEAKING WITH ME JUST DISCONNECT THE LINE AND CALL ME BACK TILL I
GIVE YOUTHE CODE 
WORD.
