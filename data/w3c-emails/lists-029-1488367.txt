respond to serach engine reviews !

I do some work with searchengines and at the moment there is no other relevant search engine than google !!!

try to get a good listing in google and you will be indexed by lots of other searchengines !!! 

google database is used in AOL and Netscape and may more ! 

try to do lots of linktrades with other topic related websites and then you will see it will take a few weeks and you got a decent listing in google !

best wishes,
Mike
