ATTN:MANAGING DIRECTOR,                          

You may be suprised to recieve this letter since you don't know me personally. I am Mr DEDE KUKU the son of Dr.PETER KUKU, who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. 

I got your contact through South Africa Information Exchange (S.A.I.E) here in Johannesburg and I decided to write for an assistance. My late father, was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of President Robert Mugabe. For his alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean Opposition party controlled by the whites.

Before his death, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US$20,000,000.(Twenty Million United States Dollars) with a security and finance company as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. 

The money was deposited in a box as a consignment, to the security company to avoid seizure, and also to avoid much demurrage from the security company. This money was given to my father by president Mugabe for investment purpose while they were still in good terms. This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new land act, which wholly affected the rich farmers, and some few blacks eventually vehemently condemned the modus operandi adopted by the government.

And that resulted to rampant killing and mob actions by the veterans and some political thugs, precisely, more than thirty-one (31) people have been killed. Heads of government from Western World, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe 's plan subsequently, the South African Development Community (S.A.D.C) has continuously supported Mugabe's new land reform act. It is against this background that I and my family who are currently staying in South Africa have decided to transfer my fathers's money into a foreign account. 

As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking an account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who had tactically freezing our family wealth and South African Government seems to be playing alongside with them. we have decided not to invest this money in South Africa for the fear of seizure and encountering the same experience in future,since both countries have almost the same political history. More so, the South African Foreign Exchange Policy does not allow such investment hence I am an asylum seeker. 

As a business man I should entrust my future and that of my family on his hands, I should let you know that this transaction is risk free. Therefore if you accept to assist my family, we are willing to accept any reasonable condition you may deem necessary. And we can as well go into partnership business with you. 

please reply immediately to facilitate immediate action toward the transaction. Remember this business is highly confidential and shall be kept within you alone.Thanks. 

Best Regards 

Mr.DEDE KUKU.
