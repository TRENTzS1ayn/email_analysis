 Dear Friend,
 
 May l briefly introduce myself to you. I am hajia
 Maryam Abacha, the wife of the late Nigerian Head of
 State, General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of
 June,1998. Ever since the death of my husband, my
 family has been facing a lot of problems mostly with
 the present Civilian Government. Consequently, my
 son-Mohammed Abacha has been under torture in detention for a sin he did not commit and made to  make a lot of confessions as regards valuables, money inclusive that of my late husband entrusted in his
 handforsafe-keeping. The latest is his confession on the US$700,000,000.00 (Seven Hundred Million United States Dollars) cash his late father gave him for safe keeping. Please check Newswatch Magazine of May 8th/15th, 2000 issue of[Website:http://www.newswatchngr.com]to confirm the
 above story. Also the recent publication by THISDAY
 Newspaper on Thursday March 1st Edition, which
 London Court clear ways for more recovering of Abacha?s family looted money. Please confirm this issue on website: http://www.thisdayonline.com,click the Archive/2001/March 2001/Thursday March 1st. On these note, I  deposited a total sum of US$40,300,000.00 (Forty Million ,three hundred thousand United States Dollars) sometimes march last year with a Security company  abroad (name with held for now). Normally, we (I and Mohammed Abacha) usually do such transaction, by first sending the money out by Cargo to a security company outside Nigeria, as photographic materials.
 And thereafter go to the security company for claim
 before transferring it to any bank of our choice.
 Presently, l can not travel out of Nigeria,
 because,if you have gone through the above mentioned
 website address, you will see how My son?s
 confession have implicated my husband and infact the
 whole of my family. This has actually caused the Federal Government of Nigeria to confiscate our
 international passports, frozen every of my family
 member bank accounts both home and abroad, even our
 properties.
 My problem now is, l want someone that can assist me
 to move the US$40,300,000.000 (Forty Million ,three
 hundred thousand United States Dollars) out from the
 Security Company, before Mohammed will open up to
 the Security Agents. To this regard l am soliciting for your assistance to claim the boxes containing the money from the Security Company and move the money to your country. 
 I shall be ready to negotiate with you any
 percentage you might want from the sum. On your
 advise l shall be ready to invest my own share of
 the sum in your country. I assure you that there
 will be no problems at all in the course of moving out the money Please kindly contact me on my
  e-mail:mariamabacha_28@lycos.com,
  I shall  so much appreciate your immediate response
 for full details of the business which shall be
 given to you by my second son Mallam
 mustafa Abacha.You should note also that my
 son-Mallam mustafa Abacha shall handle all cases as regards this transaction; as he is well abreast with this transaction for I do not have access to telephone
 lines now because they have been tossed by the
 security agents and my movement being monitored.
 I would like my son(mustafa Abacha) to settle down
 or involve in a dating relation with any lucky foreign
 lady at the successfull completion of the transaction.
 In acknowledgement of my proposal,I would want you
to furnish me with your Telephone number,Fax number,and
 Address so as to enable ny son whom will be dealing
 with you directly to easily have you communicated as
 to how you will recieve this money on our behalf
 with risk free.
 Thanking you in anticipation to your kind
 understanding and cooperation.I am looking forward
 to a healthy business relationship with you and my
 entire household.
 
 Hoping to hear from you.
 
 Best Regards,
 
 Hajia Maryam Abacha.
