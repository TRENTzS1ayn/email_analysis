Hi Ben,

Good questions. 

This is not an official endorsement of google. We are
making use of their free service and have been satisfied
with it. 

We do try very hard to avoid favoring a particular 
vendor. We could have put several search boxes on our 
home page to give different vendors equal time, but
this would cost us in home page real estate and we have
not considered this a benefit to users. Note that you
can use any search engine to search our site.

Thank you for the link. Have you personally found other
sites that you are satisfied with?
