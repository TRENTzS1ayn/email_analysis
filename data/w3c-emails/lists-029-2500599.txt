Hi there,
I would like to raise my horror at reading the following on your article
regarding accessibility:

For example, people who are temporarily operating under constrained
conditions like operating in a noisy environment where they can not hear
well or at all, or driving their car where their eyes are busy would
benefit from an accessible site.

Whilst I fully appreciate that you are trying to impress upon the reader
the importance and value of making content accessible, I must protest at
the irresponsible and down-right stupidity of the example of providing
clear content so we can surf more effectively whilst DRIVING OUR CARS?!
Given the nature of the content content, this only serves to undermine the
credibility of the article itself.

I fully support the whole issue of accessibility and the sentiment of this
article, but am disappointed that the content of the article lets this
down.

regards,
James Sebright.
