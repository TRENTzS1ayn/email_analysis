I guess you probably have no idea how many homebound, disabled persons like myself that your group has helped with your WorldWideWeb. I'm sure there are thousands upon thousands of people who manage to really reach into the world around them with the help of an old (1995) computer and the virtual worlds you helped to create.

Keep up the good work. I've often wondered how I might help, but those limites skills that I have were learned late in life and aren't enough really be of any use.

I've learned how to right some very basic games for Math and even finally figured out how to create a AutoBoot CD, but in the discussion of the really important things I'm just an amateur.

So I'm glad you can do the work that I can't.

Thank you,

Rollie Anderson, Gladwin, MI
