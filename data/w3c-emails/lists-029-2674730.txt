Hey?

Where can I submitt my work for competative evaluation?

I think w3c should set the rules for, and host the judging of websites.  
This is a great way to promote w3c awareness, and satisfy folks like 
myself, who are gifted.

There could be a friendly number of catagories, from static raw html, to 
the extents of Free and Open development products.  Ix Ney on the 
prorietary stuff.  They don't need the promotion, and they're stuff 
isn't freely available, nor "catagorically" supported.

Focus various evaluations on technical merits, artistic value, 
messaging, ....

Hey!  It's the internet after all, there will be LOTS of interest.

What say you?
