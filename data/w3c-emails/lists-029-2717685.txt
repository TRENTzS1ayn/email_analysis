http://www.northwestwriters.com is a new Web Site for the Authors of Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, & British Columbia, Canada.  Authors list their books for sale and the writing industry advertises their services to the writers. What is the best way to let your members know about the site?  And, I am interested in exchanging links.

 

Thank you
