[To the scientist, intellectual or space cadet among you:  a simple witness 
about the ?Maker of All Things?, from His envoy]                             
A ?created? entity needs to have a fundamental, symbiotic relationship [base 
of essence] with the uncreated, preexistent entity! [As a scientist would 
have with his ?creation? or special project]  Although both are incorporated 
within the ?natural? environment, an allusion would be the ?water cycle?!  
My best to you, the ?Keeper of the Flame? (Senior Ambassador to the planet 
Earth)??.[[ Oh, lest I forget:: for the last 2,000 years, that uncreated 
entity?s name has been ?The LORD GOD Jesus Christ?*, when He made a 
?created? body to permanently inhabit?.(for a mutually beneficial 
relationship with some of His ?creations?---us)?.much the way a hermit crab 
inhabits an unused shell ]]                                 [Reference]: 
*{GOOD NEWS BIBLE: Romans 10:9=John 1:1;  and, Exodus 3:14=John 8:24b?I AM 
WHO or THAT I AM (proper name of GOD)?the same GOD talking in both verses, 
as in John 14:9---?Philip, you?re looking at Him?. In other words, Jesus 
Christ is the same GOD that talked to Moses, said ?Let there be light? in 
Genesis 1:3, and made you!}
