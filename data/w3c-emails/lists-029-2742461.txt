 ('binary' encoding is not supported, stored as-is)

Hello, my name is Douglas Brunner, and I found what I believe to be an annoying bug.

I have attached one file located at http://www.arcanenexus.com/layout.php

When I send the online validator to the URL it validates without one warning.

I then copied the source (Right from the web server and not my local machine, just to make it's the exact same) and saved it to a file (The one attached) and uploaded it for validation.

The file upload and textarea submission both said the file failed validation.

So, which one is right?
