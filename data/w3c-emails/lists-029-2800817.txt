I have run into a problem with some of the working group style sheets. 
I believe the problem is linked back to the use of the margin-left: -4% 
on H1, H2, H3, H4, H5.  This causes the headings to start off the 
visible portion of the page on mozilla 1.7 and IE 6.0 WHEN the width of 
the screen is very wide ( >1280 ).  Below is the original and one 
possible correction.

## original

BODY        { margin: 2em 1em 1em 50px; ... }

H1, H2, H3, H4, H5 {
               ...
               margin-left: -4%}

## end original

The correction replaces the body margin-right with 4% to offset the H 
margin-left.  You can also replace the header margin left with 2em to 
offset the body.

## correction

BODY        { margin: 2em 4% 1em 50px; ... }

H1, H2, H3, H4, H5 {
               ...
               margin-left: -4%}

## end correction

I know that those users that have screen that wise is small, but the use 
of negative margin-left ( by percent ) should be depreciated if not 
embedded in a block that has a corresponding positive indent.

Cheers,
