Dear Shawn,

Thanks for yoru email.

Thanks... On most sites that have them, Alt+1 for home is 
definately by far the most useful, as it saves having to highlight the 
URL field and delete the part after the slash.

Sites that offer shopping or interactive media obviously have 
different requirements from your own, but the main sections 
(News/FAQ/Map/Contact/etc) would all do well to have their own 
accellerator. On page-specific forms and links, I suppose it all 
depends on the specific content.

Regards,





Richard
