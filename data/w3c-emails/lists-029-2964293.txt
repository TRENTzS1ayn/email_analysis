What I find incredible is,
after the number of years using and reading the w3org web pages,
I still find its layout mostly more difficult to read or browse,
compared to pages created by my friends - 
i.e. friends who know little about html.

My first law of web page design:
Comprehensive and readable web pages do not need more work and can be
just as easily and simply authored.
Meaning - badly designed pages have no excuse.

Incredible because,
people who are defining the standards do not know how to use them;
neither do they then seem to know why they are defining those
standards.

For example, I am (today is 2004-01-05) looking at
http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/ .
Do you personally call that good web page design?

Which reminds me of English professors and lawyers who couldn't seem
to bring themselves to use ordinary and comprehensive English.

Does it bother you people to use Front Page or some HTML editor? That
also reminds me the pride of the same professors who refuse to use the
spellchecker on their word processor.

Happy New Year and make a good web page resolution!
