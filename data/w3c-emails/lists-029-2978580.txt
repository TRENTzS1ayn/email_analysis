The CSS page (http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) has a _wonderful_ menu, 
making it particularly easy to revisit a particular page.

Sadly, the Markup page (http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/) is woefully 
inadequate: for example if I want to dip into the XHMLT1.1 
recommendation (say), I have to scroll to the right place and click on a 
link amidst a sea of text.  A nice menu would be well worth the effort, 
IMHO.  The CSS page provides a very good model.

Hope that's helpful,

Rick :-)
