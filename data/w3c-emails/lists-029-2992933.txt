In my constant endeavour to provide my customers web services and interfaces
that are easy for all to access and use - your site has got to be the worst.
Navigation is terrible, there is so much jargon and gobbledegook it is
almost impossible to understand, clarity - there is none, there are broken
links, dead ends, no home page buttons, slow to download to mention a few of
the horrors.

What is level two (AA)? I have to comply with it and I have no idea how to
after 1/2 an hour of  searching - a summary would be helpful, simple answers
would be wonderful. Where did the three click rule go?

We are talking about making websites accessible and easy to use by all - not
explaining the meaning of life.

I would be delighted if someone would call me to help me out - on the other
hand I would not be surprised if I did not hear a peep from you.

Frustrated but hopeful
