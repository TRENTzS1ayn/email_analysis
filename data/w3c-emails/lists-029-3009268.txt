Hi Rory,

Sorry for the confusion. We are working to improve things like
navigation and consistency in the site. By all means if you find broken
links on the site, please let us know. 

I think you are looking for the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG), produced by W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). Here are
some helpful links.

1) WAI home page
   http://www.w3.org/WAI/

2) WCAG 1.0, a W3C Recommendation
   http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/

   Level "AA" means that you satisfy a set of requirements in WCAG.
   Please see that document for what the requirements are.

3) WCAG 2.0, a new version in development (not yet stable!)
   http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/

4) The home page of the Working Group who is developing the 
   Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
   http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/

5) Getting started making a Web site accessible
   http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/Overview.html.en

I hope this helps.
