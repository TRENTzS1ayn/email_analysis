Subject: is there an error on your page?


Hi,
My first visit to your web page 'new visitors' has a text link at the bottom proclaiming with obvious pride that the page has been created without any use of a layout table.
I followed the link, but unfortunately am not sufficiently fluent with the french language to take it all in.
I'm based in uk, using IE6.
Regards
Lindsay Akerman
