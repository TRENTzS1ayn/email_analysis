Hi, 

I recently stumbled once again upon a W3C language (probably XML Schema)
snippet and by looking at the namespace URI I wasn't sure whether the
snippet was in the Recommendation language or in one of the previous
draft versions.

I wonder therefore whether it wouldn't be advisable that the namespaces
of W3C language drafts (up to, maybe including CR) be marked as such,
say http://www.w3.org/drafts/2000/10/XMLSchema or
http://www.w3.org/2000/10/draft/XMLSchema.

I know the particular case of XML Schema is set in stone now, but maybe
future drafts should be mandated to use a draft NS URI.

Best regards,
