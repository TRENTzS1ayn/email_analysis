<p style="font-family: courier">
This is a paragraph
</p>

Since I'm not supposed to use font anymore, how am I supposed to make some 
words, not the paragraph, a certain way?

With <font> I can do

<p>
This is a<font face="courier">paragraph</font></p>
but I don't know how with css
or are i not allowed?
