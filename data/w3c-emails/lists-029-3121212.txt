Hello

This is Regarding our multi award-winning screenplay ( which we've been in pre-production on) it's a high concept highly commercial Epic feature film project "The Legend of Johnny Kakota. This has the potential to be a Franchise-Blockbuster/Cult classic. Our proposed Budget is between 15.9- 20.3 million Depending on final cast. We were going to shoot this in Arizona, but after hearing of the Financing program and tax incentives and New Mexico and having the same if not better epic scenery which is need for our Epic feature film project we knew it would be a great fit. We've currently secured distribution both foreign and domestic with Lone Star Pictures Intl. (who has Domestic deals with Paramount & Universal Pictures). We expect an opening weekend between 15-20 million and currently seeking  a stand by Letter of Credit for  7.9 mil. for the NM loan it's due and payable in five years and no interest.So for an investor/Banker  it would be a nice deal, they wouldn't have to fund it and they would reap the benefit of the rate of the LC.(as you know genre's like ours do that fairly regular, with our add marketing campaign we expect a better than average opening along with much follow up Box office business.) We've already have the other half of the budget committed. Do you know of any investors/VC/Angels or banker that would be able to issue that type of LC. Thanx, look forward to hearing from you, feel free to call any time 562-943-1651

God Bless
