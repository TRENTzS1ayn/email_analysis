PRESS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Treotiger.com Launched: The first online store exclusively for Treo
accessories 
Users of Treo? smartphones can now buy original, custom-made, reasonably
priced accessories from an online store exclusively for Treo patrons.

Arlington, June 2, 2004: Moftware LLC, North America?s leading provider
of wireless solutions, has set up Treotiger.com, the Internet?s first
exclusive online accessory shop for Treo palm top accessories.

Treotiger.com offers Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) products to
users of Treo Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). Since these mobile
enhancement devices are made by the makers of Treo itself, the customer
is assured of custom-built goods, made with the best materials, at
reasonable prices. With in-depth product descriptions and product shots,
Treotiger.com has a focus on individual accessories. The websites is
easy navigable, with a choice of browsing by phone model or by
accessories.

With the launch of Treotiger.com, Moftware LLC has added its second
website catering exclusively to a single brand of phone accessories. The
first to be launched was Blackberry.com, which caters to users of the
BlackBerry PDA.

On the newest addition to the Moftware cluster of websites, Dinbandhu
Dinesh, CEO, Moftware LLC, says, ?We are pioneers is several aspects of
the wireless market. In taking this step of setting up an online
accessory shop for a single brand of mobile communications devices, we
recognize that the mobile phone customer has come of age. We are really
taking wireless solutions to the next level.?

Mobile phone and PDA accessories itself have two uses. The tangible use
is optimization of existing phone features in terms of amount of usage
(hours) and extent of usage (if the user makes use of all the features).
Products which help to get the best out of the user?s phone are
chargers, batteries, connectivity tools, data cables and handsfree
equipment. Intangible uses are the factors that help project the user as
a prototype of his own desire. Cases and cradles help in doing just
that. Treotiger.com caters to the needs of all users.

All orders are shipped by DHL, with a choice of overnight shipping to
4-5 days in the US, and 2-3 days to 5-7 days for other countries,
depending on the customer?s choice. There is special provision for bulk
buying, purchase by government agencies and armed forces APO/FPO address
delivery as well. Since Treotiger runs on a 128-bit Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL), payment through credit card is completely secure. The Verisign
payment gateway also ensures secure transactions.
