Janet, <http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#format>, are
you saying that this request does not comply with these terms? Or that
it does comply with these terms but W3C rescinds the right to distribute
the work because it finds that it leads to confusion regarding the
original document's status or integrity? Or that W3C rescinds the right
for reasons you do not cite? I am concerned that what you say here and
in

  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/site-comments/2004May/0064.html
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/site-comments/2004May/0065.html

is that W3C never grants permission for derived works including
translations, annotated specifications, and reformatted work. You keep
saying that the IPR FAQ does not apply for reformatted works, even
though such works are explicitly covered there. I would welcome your
clarification why what you say here does not contradict the IPR FAQ.

regards.
