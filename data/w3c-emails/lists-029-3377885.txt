Bjoern, since this topic is related to W3C's policies and not to the 
structure of the site, I am moving this thread to site-policy. For some 
reason, the requestor double posted, and now the thread is more 
challenging to track. Please, if you have further questions, drop the cc 
to site-comments, and we'll keep it on the public site-policy list.

Ah. Clarity is always a worthwhile pursuit.

How is it that you redistribute our works?

Bjoern, as long as the W3C maintains its web site and mirroring systems, 
there are ample ways and avenues for the materials to be distributed. As 
you know, W3C does not have the staffing to chase down every possible 
person who decides to redistribute documents.

Most people who have been pointed to us - that is, those who don't even 
bother to read the FAQ or document license -  make a simple copy with a 
different URI, thinking that's acceptable. Others make changes to the 
documents, either because they think they have a "better" idea for 
presentation - either changes in the stylesheets or the document format 
- or in more extreme cases, because they think there are aspects of the 
document content itself that can use some tweaking.

W3C reserves the right to evaluate requests. Nothing in the FAQ, nor in 
the document license, says that all modifications will be granted based 
only on the minimum requirements listed in the FAQ.

Right. Our own WGs produce non-normative PDF versions of the original 
documents, when they see fit. In each of those cases, those WGs cited 
the need for a predictable, portable print format as their rationale, 
which is compelling. It has made the publication process a bit more 
difficult, particularly when errors are discovered in the normative 
format after the PDF has been generated. That said, the case for 
predictable, portable printing is convincing.

It is not clear to me why there is a compelling need for a CHM document. 
CHM is specific to one fairly restricted use for one operating system, 
as I understand it. I could be wrong.

I was providing you an example of what is required, even from known 
trusted parties. So, the context in terms of how permissions are 
considered is entirely relevant. The details would not necessarily 
belong in a FAQ, where the "fa" stands for "Frequently Asked".

That's fair, except that it is present in the Document license. Nowhere 
does it say that this is all you have to do.

Sure. I will add clarifying language to the FAQ, to make it more clear.

Thank you for your attention, and for your assistance in making our 
policies more transparent.
