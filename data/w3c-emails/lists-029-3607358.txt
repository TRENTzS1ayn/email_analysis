The image at http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-html401.png is supposed to have a 
transparent right edge, but instead, the edge is solid white. This makes the 
image look pretty ugly on pages that do not use white backgrounds. All the 
other valid-* images do have the correct transparency. Please fix if you get
a chance. Thanks.
