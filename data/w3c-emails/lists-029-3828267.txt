Hello Guillaume,

Can you say more about what you mean by "file naming"? 
The URI is the identifying mechanism of the Web. I don't know that
there are good practices in the Web Architecture for how you
name files on your server. URIs that you create will be
easier to use if:
 
a) Files names are short
b) File names are in ASCII

Let me know if there are other issues you're thinking about.
