Hi

First let me say from my view point your site is very confusing.

However, my reason for sending this email is that I am unable to locate a 
document (most document titles are confusing) that contains the complete 
list of HTML tags and their valid attributes.

I have spent almost a hour on your site without identifying what I would 
term a specification or standard. The best example I can give is the ANSI 
standards, they are numbered and named specifically and are complete, i.e. 
all commands are listed in a single document. What I have found on your 
site is bits and pieces that lead me from here to there and back again, but 
don't provide the definitions of HTML tags that I am looking for.

Your assistance in identifying the single document that contains the tag 
definitions is appreciated.


Regards,


David L. Smith (Sasquatch)
