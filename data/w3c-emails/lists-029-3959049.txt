Hello, David,

>I am unable to locate a document (most document titles are

>valid attributes.

HTML is defined in the HTML 4.01 Specification which has indexes of 
elements and attributes:

http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/

Sorry you had problems finding it. HTML and all of W3C's specs are 
listed in the index of technical reports:

Hope this helps,
