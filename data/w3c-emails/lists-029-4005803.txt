Hello Bjoern,

Thank you for your thoughtful comments. I made some comments below but
no definitive statement. I'll try to get some discussion on this in the
Team.

 Thank you,

 - Ian

Notes:

You shouldn't try to read meaning into a URI unless there's a published
policy for a particular convention. W3C has a published policy for
URIs for TR documents. W3C does not have a published policy for numbers
in other URIs such as /2001/tag. It turns out that the Director prefers
not to "fill up" top-level URI space after www.w3.org. In the case of
/2001/tag, we put the date when the TAG came into existence. This allows
us to reuse "/tag" later if we choose.

We have millions and millions of documents. You SHOULD use links or
a search engine to find them, not your memory.

If you have to resort to trial and error because our site does not
provide you with useful navigation, please let us know clearly what
resources you are looking for. If you prefer trial and error in spite of
available search and navigation mechanisms, then you might consider
(after your own experience, in fact), relying on better means.

We do not want people to memorize URIs. We want them to create
bookmarks, to use our navigation tools, and to use our search tools.

I'm not sure when or why this change was made. I'd have to go dig up
the history.

Don't rely on mod_spelling to help you. See the TAG's architecture
document:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-webarch-20031209/#identifiers-comparison

   "If a URI has been assigned to a resource, agents SHOULD refer to the
resource using the same URI, character for character."

Ivan, can you have a look at this?

Vivien, can you have a look at that?

Ok.

"Much slower" seems like a bit of a stretch, but I agree that if you
can avoid a redirect, you should.

That, I believe, is a browser problem. In particular, see CUAP
checkpoint 4.1.
