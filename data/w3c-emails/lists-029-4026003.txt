Hello

When I view the page of your website which gives WAI Accessibility Guidelines for level one ie http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/

I am surprised you have some vertical text in the left hand side say Recommendation!

As I recommend to people who I provide guidance not to do this. I'd appreciate your comments

Many thanks
Philip
