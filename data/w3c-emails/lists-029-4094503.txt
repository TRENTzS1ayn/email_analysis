http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/   uses a non-scrolling
menu system which looks very nice.  However it is 
taller than window in some browsers (Netscape/mozilla/firefox)
and thus every option does not show up unless one moves
the taskbar to the right edge.  How much of the menu shows
is highly dependent on user config of toolbar/status/address bar 
etc....  This is strictly a design issue about assumptions and
failure to check design on other than designer's machine ;-] ;-]
It becomes an accessibility issue for the user though....

This was discovered using Amaya which can't do the 'fixed' element
mode yet so i could see the stuff at bottom.  

Best fixed by pulling some of spacing that exists between menu heading
and menu items ....
