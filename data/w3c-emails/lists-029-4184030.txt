===========
Position papers for the W3C Workshop on Web Applications and 
Compound Documents are due Friday 30 April.

http://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/

IMPORTANT NOTICE: Due to an unfortunate error in the submission
system, submissions entered before Wednesday 28 April may have been
lost. Please submit again to be safe.

The workshop will examine the development of platform-independent
applications on Web clients, as well as technologies surrounding
the combination of multiple formats into a single document.

The workshop is open to both W3C Members and the public (non-members).

Position papers are required for attendance, and can be from 1 to 4
pages in length.

Any questions, contact the Workshop co-chair, Dean Jackson <dean@w3.org>
