Hi!

It's probably not a problem really, but I couldn't find any helpful information
on your site about removal of borders from-between frames. There are words
about to write attribute "frameborder=0" but actually it just causes the
browser (IE or Mozilla whatever) to remove 3D drawings around the border, but
the border stall exist.

Eventually (and just empiricly), I've found the solution: the "border=0"
attribute in the FRAMESET element that (so strange) is supported by both IE and
Mozilla...

So I think it's a sort of standard to have a border atribute for a FRAMESET
element, however it doesn't work in conjunction with style sheets. I guess I
have to write something like above to IE & Mozilla development teams, right? I
just cannot realize why the de facto standard hasn't been reflected in W3C
recommendations (or vice versa).

Thanks.

Dmitry.
