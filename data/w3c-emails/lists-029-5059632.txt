Hi,

I've put some specs (HTML & CSS) online after reformatting them, here:
http://www.visiomode.com/docs/

Would you be interested of such formats? Is there something I could do for
it? Maybe provide this web viewer and CHM converting capability? Or would
you like to put link to this page somewhere?

Thank you,
Ilkka
