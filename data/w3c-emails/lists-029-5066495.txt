Hi.

 

Concering the page HYPERLINK
"http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl"http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl

 

The page title for the WSDL definition is incorrect. It lacks an S, it
should read ?? services?, but today it is only ?? service?.

 

The specification header on the page is correct though, so it could be quite
confusing for unsure visitors.
