Hello,

I am writing to you to report a problem with the
http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/ page.

It uses the text/html MIME-type, while being written in XHTML 1.1.

According to W3C Note from August 1st, 2002 [1] this MIME-type is
illegal for XHTML 1.1 documents, which should be sent with
application/xhtml+xml MIME-type. Or, if the text/html MIME-type
is preserved, these documents should be rewritten in XHTML 1.0.

I think it is quite strange for the W3C to break its own XHTML
1.1-related recommendations on the XHTML 1.1 TR page...
