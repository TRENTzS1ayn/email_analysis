I keep getting these pop-ups that appear in the bottom right corner of my computer monitor.  I have identified the source as your website as it says www.w3.org<http://www.w3.org/>.  I cannot find how to remove this from my computer and I am asking you to give me instructions on how to remove it.  Please reply as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Stefany Bea
