Hello, Dmitry,

My guess is that you will have better luck by contacting a site or 
mailing list that specializes in answering questions about CSS. There 
are several resources linked from the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
home page:

http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/

Sorry I don't have a fast and neat answer to your question.
