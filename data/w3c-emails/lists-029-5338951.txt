Hi Susan,

And thanks for the answer.

I took them offline for a moment, because I found out that I may need a
permission from W3C to actually put them online. There waw some confusion in
that process, first I thought they wuold be ok to distribute, but then
someone instructed me to ask you for permission.

The URL is now: http://www.visiomode.com/w3c/

That URL is not "public" - it's not linked from anywhere.

So, if you have some comments on those specs now at that URL, I would be
very interested. Can they be put online, would you be interested for
distributing them?

Thank you,
Ilkka
