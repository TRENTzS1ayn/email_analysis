Dear Sir/Madam

Which of your two mission statements most accurately reflect your "mission"?

"W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential, which it does by
developing technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools)
that will create a forum for information, commerce, inspiration, independent
thought, and collective understanding."

"By promoting interoperability and encouraging an open forum for discussion,
W3C commits to leading the technical evolution of the Web."

Are you giving too much information?

Thank you for your help.

Paul
