Hello, Paul,

W3C's mission is to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential.

>Which of your two mission statements most accurately reflect your "mission"?

I think the longer paragraph on the W3C home page is an amplification 
of the mission statement, explaining what it means. If you need to 
state the mission, go with the short form.

Does that help?

Best wishes,
