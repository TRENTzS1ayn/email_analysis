Hi,

Thanks for the answer.

Could they be published if I change the stylesheets to comply to your
standards?

There isn't any major reason to why I have changed the stylesheets - I
didn't know about those rules originally. So I could very easily change the
stylesheets to the same what you have (they could be exactly the same, I
think).

So... if this could help it?

Thanks,
Ilkka
