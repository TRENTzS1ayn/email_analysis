Hi,

I have read those, and I thought I was following them to the extent that
would be enough - it seems that I need to do some modifications. I wasn't
precise enough.

The reason for my enquiry was this, someone pointed out that I may need a
permission from you:
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#format

-------- quote -------
5.9 May I publish your specification in a different format (e.g., PDF)?

The creation of a reformatted work is a derivative work, something we do not
generically permit in our document copyright license.
-------- /quote --------

So, that's why I was concerned. I'm not sure if this case applies to me - my
reformatted specs are the original HTML code.

Sorry for not pointing this out clearly.

Ilkka
