Ok, I see that this URL
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#format
talks actually about the same thing - if the content is changed then the
republishing cannot be granted, but if the content stays the same, then
publishing is generally granted.

I will change the stylesheet today, and see that everything complies to the
license.

So, I guess we can consider this conversation as the notification of those
reformatted specs - I assume the knowledge of them ahs spread wide enough
and there wouldn't be any badwill from the publishing - as log as I change
the specs to comply the standards.

Sorry if this was confusing, but it wasn't clear to alt.html folks either -
there were opinions that a permission should be asked if reformatted specs
are distributed, so I decided to do so.
