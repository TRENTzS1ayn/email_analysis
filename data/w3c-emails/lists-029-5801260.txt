PRESS RELEASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Blackberrystuff.com Launched: The first online store exclusively for
BlackBerry accessories
Users of BlackBerry PDAs can now buy original, custom-made, reasonably
priced accessories from an online store exclusively for BlackBerry
patrons.

Arlington, May 15, 2004: Moftware LLC, North America's leading provider
of wireless solutions, has launched Blackberrystuff.com, the Internet's
first and only exclusive online accessory shop for BlackBerry phone
accessories.

Blackberrystuff.com offers Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)
products to users of BlackBerry Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs).
Since these mobile enhancement devices are made by BlackBerry itself,
the customer is assured of custom-built goods, made with the best
materials, at reasonable prices. With in-depth product descriptions and
product shots, Blackberry.com has a focus on individual accessories. The
website is easy navigable, with a choice of browsing by phone model, by
accessories or by software.

The highlight of the website is the eOffice software, that is the
customized edition of Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel packages.
Created specially for BlackBerry appliances, this software enables the
user to create, edit, send and receive Word and Excel documents on the
BlackBerry PDA.

On the newest addition to the Moftware cluster of websites, Dinbandhu
Dinesh, CEO, Moftware LLC, says, "As a pioneering website in terms of
the unique products that we offer, Blackberrystuff.com has every kind of
accessory for most BlackBerry phones. Unlike most other websites that
offer accessories for a host of phones, we concentrate on BlackBerry,
and give the user the best in quality and pricing."

All orders are shipped by DHL, with a choice of overnight shipping to
4-5 days in the US, and 2-3 days to 5-7 days for other countries,
depending on the customer's choice. There is special provision for bulk
buying and purchase by government agencies as well. Through the Verisign
payment gateway, the customer is assured of secure transactions.
