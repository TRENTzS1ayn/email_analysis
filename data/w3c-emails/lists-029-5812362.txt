While in the middle of compiling an e-mail message, a screen opened and an ad 
for a mortgage company appeared.  A few minutes later, the same thing 
happened again.  When I went to the site indicated by this obnoxious spammer 
and checked the "View Source" option to try to find someone I could complain 
to, there was this reference in the opening line:

"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"

The company is called Preferred Mortgage and its practices are obnoxiously 
intrusive.  I trust you have nothing to do with them.
