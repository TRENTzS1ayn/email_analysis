Hi Douglas,

The SVG specification defines a Document API for SVG in a
programming neutral language called IDL. You can find the
interfaces written in IDL scattered through the SVG specification,
and collected in Appendix C of the SVG 1.1 Recommendation.

http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/idl

The IDL is also compiled into Java and ECMAscript bindings
and included in the specification. The one you are looking for
is:

http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/escript

That's the current Recommendation of SVG. The latest draft version,
called SVG 1.2, contains many more interfaces that are not directly
related to either documents or graphics, but are designed for
applications development. For those, refer to the SVG 1.2
specification:

http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG12/

I hope this helps!

Dean
