In considering the vote on the SMIL 1.0 specification, I'm a little
concerned by the fact that there is nothing at all in the document that
mentions HyTime (one way or the other).  I'm far from being an expert in
this area, and so I may be misled on this subject, but my understanding is
that HyTime is designed to address at least some of the issues being
addressed by SMIL. In view of the relationships between SMIL and XML, XML
and SGML, and SGML and HyTime, it seems to me that some explicit mention of
HyTime, and its relationship or non-relationship to SMIL (e.g., why it is
irrelevant here), would be appropriate, if only to fend off any unnecessary
concerns that the wheel is being reinvented for no good reason.  Thanks for
your consideration.
