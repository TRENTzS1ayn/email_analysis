Frank,

thanks for your comments.

The main difference is that HyTime is far more complex than SMIL, and 
thus is unlikely to gain the wide acceptance in industry that SMIL was 
designed for, see e.g

ttp://www.real.com/corporate/pressroom/pr/smil.html

Also, see the following messages for a more detailed discussion of
SMIL vs. HyTime.

In addition, two HyTime Experts (Lloyd Rutledge and Jacco van Ossenbruggen)
were involved in the development of SMIL. Feel free to contact them,
should you have further questions (for e-mail addresses, see the
two messages above).

The relation between the SYMM work and other existing work has been
explained in the briefing package that formed the basis of this work:
