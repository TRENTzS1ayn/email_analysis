Philipp--

Thanks for your prompt response.  Your description of the situation, i.e.,
that there was detailed consideration of HyTime, and it was felt to be too
complicated for the application, was roughly what I expected (and hoped)
the answer would be.  However, I still think there should be some explicit
reflection of this in the specifications.  A short paragraph in an
Introduction (or even in an Appendix), possibly pointing to the briefing
package or other relevant material if necessary, would take care of it;
nothing major is required.  I just think that the specification should
*itself* raise (and deal with) the issue, since not all readers of the
specification (like me!) will have the background in hand, and think to
search for the briefing package, and it might forstall a lot of
communications like these!
