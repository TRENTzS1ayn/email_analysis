Two things:

*  The object properties of fill="freeze" are defined, but not the visual
characteristics (at least, not that I could find; I was trying to tell
someone where it was defined)

*  In the description of "title" in the "meta" section (3.4) it's defined
as the '"title" attribute', which is technically not true, and has led to
folks trying <meta title="foo">.
