i think it's the other way around - but still a bug - thanks !

haven't thought about this - if you think this makes sense
a) express your support on the mailing list
b) we'll discuss it at tomorrow's telecon

as a general rule, i'm not so hot on adding new things at this
late stage, especially given the shaky political situation (we'll
have to wait until next friday to know more - maybe we should postpone
these sort of things until then) - i'll have to check 
warner's mail to find out his  exact reasons.
