The full description of case 1. says that "The document may not contain a
document type declaration for SMIL 1.0. If it does, it is invalid"

That seems pretty clear

I'd suggest we add 3:

"3. The document contains a document type declaration for SMIL 1.0. In this
case, it may not contain any non-SMIL 1.0 elements, even if they are declared
using XML namespaces. This is because such extensions would render the
document invalid"
