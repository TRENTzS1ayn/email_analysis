attached mail follows:
Would something less strongly worded be appropriate?  I realize that we're
trying to make sure that the XML requirement is stated consistantly and in
one place (the XML spec), but saying "The following cases can occur:" and
leaving out this very important case is extremely confusing.  If it needs
to be #3, that's fine, but the current wording led to some unnecessary
confusion around here, and I suspect that it'll lead to it elsewhere.
