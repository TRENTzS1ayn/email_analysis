Then I still am in favor not to specify this, but find another 
escape for current practice.

What about something like (wording is not correct, but sufficient
to indicate the idea):
"implementations may let the media time be effectively the
same as presentation time, or use presentation time to estimate
media time."

In this way it is not part of the SMIL format specification,
such that we keep the concept formally clean,
while we allow vendors or other providers of player implementations 
to do what they think best (or can do).

Letting plug-ins to control our format specification doesn't 
sound as an attractive road to me.

We misunderstand each other somewhere. I agree on your
conclusion that ** should be in 0-10 range. I thought 
effective end indicates the 10.

To me, 'effective duration' doesn't indicate a time *instance*.
You may wish to reword to 'effective begin + effective
duration', which is by definition 'effective end'.

- --

I am not sure if effective end indeed refers to the time 
instance I am thinking of. For example, consider the 
following case:

<par>
  <video id="v" end="10" dur="15" fill="freeze"/>
  <img begin="id(v)(**)" ... />
</par>

Now, in my opinion, ** is in 0-10, and may not be in 10-15:
The mediaclock of "v" has stopped 'ticking' at 10s.

(I assume intrinsic durations is of sufficient length, but 
that may also influence the allowed range. Etc.)
