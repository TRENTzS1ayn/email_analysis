I went through the draft once more and crossed these issues.

Comments 3, 4, 6, (8), 9, 10 are probably the ones
of interest to the list.



1. sec.3.2. typo
The example:

Either remove <seq> or add </seq>
(adjust indentation of </switch>)


2. sec.3.4.
Explanation text to "title" (of meta element).

Here, "title" is a property (value) not an attribute.
The sentence "It is strongly recommended that ALL meta
elements...." needs adaptation to something "It is
strongly recommended that there is a meta element
having the title property with a meaningful description."
The currently second sentence can be left away.


3. sec.4.2.1.
Explanation of "clock-val"

3a.
"....The clock may either give presentation time elapsed
since the effective begin, or it may give the media time
of the object."

I thought it is essentially ONLY the latter (thus: remove 
first part).
Implementations may let it be effectively the same.

3b.
"It is an error .... greater than the effective duration of
the element generating the event."

Should be "...the effective end..." (clock of element has
stopped continueing at the effective end), I would say.


4. sec.4.2.4.2.
Paragraph on implicit end, 1st bullet:

I find the modeling of indefinite looping cryptic :
At the other parts of the model, fill="freeze" or fill="remove" 
behavior is happening after an end. Here, fill="continue"
together with fill="loop" is implicitly expected.


5. sec.4.2.4.2. typo
Paragraph on implicit end, 4th bullet:

insert "object" between media and element.


6. sec.4.2.4.2.
Paragraph on effective end, last main bullet, 2nd sub bullet:

The added "next" before "child element" makes me puzzling
about this sentence (aside that in a seq either an element's
effective begin is when its predecessor ends, or that
predecessor's effective end is when that next element begins,
but not both effectives together).


7. sec.4.4.
7a.
Should we add a sentence that default value equals "true"
(or that unspecified test attributes do not count, or....)?

7b.
Should we add a sentence that test attributes bear the
prefix "system-" ?


8. sec.4.4.
system-captions:

How influences the value "on" or "off" the evaluation
to "true" or "false"?


9. sec.4.4.
Example 6)

Why not place the 'system-overdub-or-caption' attribute
on the switch-elements? That would improve readibility
(as well as might assist evaluation by the player).

This implies that in the DTD the switch element's ATTLIST 
is extended with %system-attribute;
I think this extension should be the case anyhow, as a switch
can be a child of the switch and the children of a switch 
can bear %system-attibute; 

The <a> neither has %system-attribute;


10. sec.4.5.1./sec.4.3.

When an <a> element is a child of a switch, can 
the <a> have multiple children?

<seq>
 <switch>
    <a>
      <video id="v1"/>
      <audio id="a1"/>
    </a>
    <par>
      <video id="v2"/>
      <audio id="a2"/>
    </par>
 </switch>
 <img/>
</seq>

Are the v1 and a1 in a seq, ie. the <switch> is 
also tranparent for the synchronization?



10. sec.4.5.2.
1st list item:
Should it be "link source" iso. "link destination"?


11. sec.4.5.2. typo
Example to z-index:

<anchor> is given with 'top' and 'left' attribute;
should be 'coords' attribute.


12. sec.5.2. typo
Remove parts of heading comment:
"this is a draft and experimental....."
"this is work in progress......"


13. sec.5.2. typo
<!ATTLIST region

fit has value 'fill' not 'fit'.


14. sec.5.2. typo
<!ENTITY % body-content

remove the * after %container-content;
(the asterisks appears at the call of %body-content;)


15. sec.5.2.
<!ATTLIST switch

add %system-attribute;
(see 9. above)
