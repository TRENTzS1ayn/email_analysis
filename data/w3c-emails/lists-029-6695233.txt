Philipp,

Here's an editorial change.

Section 4.2.3 Media Object Elements

It currently has the following definition for 'src '
    "The value of the src attribute is the URI of the media object, if it
is included by reference. It is illegal for a media object element to have
a "src" attribute if the media object is written inline."

Remove the reference to inline media objects.

Michael

ps Do you want me to continue testing?
