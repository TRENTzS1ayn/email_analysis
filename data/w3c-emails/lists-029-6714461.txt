Draft revisions based on feedback
- ---------------------------------

The current status can be seen at
http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/Group/PR-smil-19980409/

Changes are marked red.

- - Addding "skip-content" to media objects was wrong - please
  ignore the previous announcement

- - "show" was added to the "anchor" element

Still to do

- - Namespace id for SMIL is URL of the spec
- - Clarify relation to CSS even more
- - Clarify working of "system-bitrate"
   -> connect to server to find out bitrate is one possible
      interpretation
   -> strike "average", say "approximate bitrate"
   -> players can support varying degrees of exactidue in
      how they determine the bitrate
  ACTION: Rob- suggest wording


Status of interop testing
- -------------------------

Report any missing data within next 24 hours !

ACTION: Bruce/RN - update testfiles based on feedback
from other testers

ACTION: Bruce/RN - make "tar" file of JPEGs available that
are used in RN's testsuite

ACTION: Philipp: Update tar file at W3C

Looking at AT RISK features in
http://smil.nist.gov/Testcase.html

at the time of the telecon:

"anchor-content-skip.smil":
- - 2nd "pass" missing
- - ACTION: Wo will provide implementation

"element-end.smil":
- - 2nd "pass" missing
- - Hope: Jin can do this ??

"embed-smil.smi":
- - No pass
- - not a requirement for interop test
- - ACTION: Wo: mark with a *

"embeded-link.smi":
- - No second pass
- - Reason: uses textstream, not html
- - ACTION: RN: update testfile
- - ACTION: CWI: test it (should work)

"ignore-prologs.smi":
(my notes are a bit sketchy here)
- - No second pass
- - Wo: some problem with his XML parser on this one
- - Doesn't look critical

"link-to-fragment.smi"
- - Misses second "pass"
- - Jin: support the feature
- - Michael: tested other example with HPAS, didn't work
- - Philipp: J{AS pass was recorded at Washington meeting
- - ACTION: Jin - get the test to run, and report it

"smil-link-over-embedded-link.smi"
- - Misses second "pass"
- - Reason: rtsp URL used
- - CWI should work
- - Michael: can confirm that
- - ACTION: RN- update testfile

"switch-ele.smi"
- - Misses second "pass"
- - Reason: value in system-bandwidth too big
- - ACTION: CWI - use lower bandwidth, and rerun test
- - ACTION: Philipp - describe resolution of this case in 
  specification: if the bandwidth is higher than an 
  implementation-defined maximum, always ignore the 
  element

"switch-new.smi"
- - Not in specification
- - ACTION: RN/Wo: remove from testcases

"sync-par.smi"
- - misses second "pass"
- - ACTION: RN: make this work

"z-clash.smi"
- - no pass
- - Reason: RTSP URL
- - Action: RN - update the test

"z-index-anchor.smi"
- - Misses second "pass"
- - Wo: works for me, only this test doesn't work, because of
  "ref"
- - ACTION: RN: replace "ref" by something that would work for "Wo"

Remove z-index attribute for anchor
- -----------------------------------

Agreement: this can be done at the editor's discretion, nobody 
insists on it
Philipp: will make an effort to keep it

Features that whose support is not yet tested in http://smil.nist.gov/Testcase
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"repeat":

- - CWI has full support, according to Washington meeting
- - Nabil: works only on media objects, not on "par/seq"
  Can provide support quickly if needed
- - Wo: should work
- - ACTION: Nabil - provide support
- - ACTION: Wo - test feature
- - ACTION: RN - add testcase

"fragment-id":

- - CWI: support it for one renderer
- - ACTION: Jin - will try support
- - Philipp: you need a renderer for which this actually makes sense,
  so this can probably be treated similarily as "embedded SMIL"
- - ACTION: RN - add a testcase

"fit="scroll"":
- - Talking books supports it
- - Wo supports it
- - ACTION: RN - add a testcase

"fit="fill""
- - Wo supports it
- - CWI supports it
- - ACTION: RN - add a testcase

(aside - maybe somebody else could provide the testcases, to
lower the load on folks from RN)

ACTION: Wo - make player accessible asap

Other business
- --------------

Dan: How will information on interop test be distributed ? Possibilities 
range from W3C note to providing a "tar" file with players and tests, so
that people can run tests themselves

Philipp: Planned to provide link to NIST page

Decision
- - contact info for people who make claims should be available

ACTION: Philipp - Update list of WG members on WG homepage so that this
is true

Michael: Does "begin/end" for linking have a second implementation ?
Didn't see one when I tested - only RN seems to support it

Wo: I support this

Reminder: ANY MISSING DATA for interop criterion should be reported until
          TOMORROW 6 PM FRENCH TIME
