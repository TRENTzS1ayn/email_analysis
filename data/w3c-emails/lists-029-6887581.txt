Hi Phillip -

(I sent this once already, and got a bounce - sounds like your mail server
is full).

I have fixed the logo and links problems (my high-tech HTML editor inserted
some links I had not intended).  I had to guess at the name to be used
("NOTE-html+time-19980918").

Please note as well that one of the references I included from the SMIL spec
seems not to be valid.  It is the link for the "URI" entry in the references
section.  It was an oversight on my part to include this, as I did not
reference it directly in the spec. I have removed it from the submission
document.

As the spec is not available on a public server, I cannot run the validator
on it.  I am looking for a solution on our side, but would welcome any
suggestions.

(I did not attach the revised version, in hopes that the smaller mail will
go through).

Thanks for your help.

Patrick

this is what i got from the guy handling the submissions here.
looks like a couple of more admin things are required.

the good news: we're preparing to ack this early next week
(monday to be precise) - but please don't bank on this date
(e.g. prepare press release and shout at us when the date changes),
the date is preliminary - I don't see reasons why the date should
move today, but they may come up

comments on what is required below (marked by PH:)

for starters:
http://www.w3.org/Team/1998/09/HTML-time-sub/HTMLplusTIME.html,checklink
returns several broken links that are external to our web site. The
authors need to fix that.

PH: i'll send you the list of broken links in a follow up
message

The W3C icon is missing.

PH: please see other recent submissions for the format required,
e.g.
http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-dcd

Validation is >>required<<. Their DTD was wrong, I replaced it with the
correct one, and I still get a couple errors. Point them to
http://validator.w3.org so they can pick up the right DTD.

PH: Please use one of the HTML 4.0 DTDs, run it through the validator,
and correct bugs

Next: http://www.w3.org/Team/1998/09/HTML-time-sub/submission
It looks all blue (problem with stylesheet ?). icon missing as usual.

PH: I'll see if i can take care of that one
