Hello,

I' not quite sure, but there could be two misprints in the SMIL 1.0
specification:
1. Table of Contents: Shouldn't it be "4.2.4.2 Determining Time Model Values
for ..." instead of "4.2.4.2 Determining Values of Model Values for ..."?
2. DTD (5.2), comment on Layout Element: "by" could be missing; "... or
other elements defined _by_ an external layout mechanism."
Of course, these aren't serious errors, but I just want to be sure about
them.
Thanks.
