Philipp,

What is the best place to send errata?  I do not see a good place to send it
in the document.  It shows a place to send comments.  Should I send errata
to that also?

There is a portion of the document with some sort of bad link.  Find the
part of the document that says:

pics-label or PICS-Label 
     The value of this property specifies a valid rating label for the
document as defined by PICS [PICS].

Then follow the link [PICS].  It should send you to:
http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-smil-19980615/#ref-PICS
<http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-smil-19980615/#ref-PICS> . There does not
seem to be a PICS section in the references.  Try the link.  It takes you to
the first page of the spec.
