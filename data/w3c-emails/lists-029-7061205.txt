Hi!

My name is Georg Valtin and I?m a student from Germany. I?m writing my
diploma about streaming multimedia with SMIL and have almost finished a
german translation of the SMIL Specification. Would you like to publish
this on you translation webpage, when I finally finished the
translation?

And if, how is the procedure? Should I send it to you as a HTML-Document
per mail or what would it be?

Regards,

Georg Valtin
