I couldn't find this in the list of known errors, and it looks like a 
mistake to me, although somebody who is more familiar with XML DTDs might be
able to correct me.

It relates to the href attribute of anchor elements, and I note that a
related error (omission of this attribute in section 4.5.2) has been
previously corrected.  We have:

<!ELEMENT anchor EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST anchor
        %skip-attr;
        %smil-link-attributes;
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        %sync-attributes;
        coords          CDATA                   #IMPLIED
>


and

<!ENTITY % smil-link-attributes "
        %id-attr;
        %title-attr;
        href            CDATA                   #REQUIRED
                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        show            (replace|new|pause)     'replace'
">


which seems to mean that every anchor element must have an href, which
contradicts example 3, presentation B and the apparent intent of 4.5.2.
If anchor elements do not need an href (i.e. they can just be link
destinations) then the attribute show should probably be optional too.

My apologies if I have misunderstood the DTD.
