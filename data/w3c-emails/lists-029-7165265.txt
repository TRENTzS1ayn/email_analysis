Hi:
Is there anything in SMIL that allows the playing based on absolute 
times of the year.  For example:
a) start presentation1 on Dec 29, 1999 at 12:32 am (local time)
b) start presentation2 on Dec 31, 1999 at 12:50 pm (again local time)
 
I might have missed it while reading the smil specification.  If so, can 
you direct me toward the tag for specifiying local absolute times.
 
Thanks
