I plan to start a translation of the SMIL Specification in French, as
the only languages available are Japanese and Portuguese.

I am student in Ecole Centrale Paris in France and currently in
internship at Alcatel Telecom in England, so I have some spare time.

Can you tell me if you are aware of other people already involved in
this translation ?

Thank you.
