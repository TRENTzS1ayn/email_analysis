publish it in Siberian State University of Telecommunication and
Information Science web-page (http://www.neic.nsk.su). At this time it
is alredy done some of sections of specification.
The cause of translation is requirement in reading this specification by

translation for your approval, as the Russian edition of the offical
SMIL 1.0 scpecification.
