Hello,

My name is Tony Heller and I own a multimedia company in Bali, Indonesia.  


We are a company who specialize in developing multimedia presentations for 


digital business cards (CDROM's that are the same size as a normal 
business card)  We are looking for a company or partner to outsource work 
for multimedia projects.   Please visit my website to see a wonderful 
demonstration of multimedia.  You can also create an online quotation to 
see that our prices are very inexpensive due to low labor costs.  

I hope that you may know an investor or have some work which we could take 

off your hands.

Have a look at my site if you can.

Thanks very much and I look forward to your response.

Tony Heller
