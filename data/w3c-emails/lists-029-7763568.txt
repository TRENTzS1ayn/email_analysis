What is SMIL?
Definition
W3C has designed the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL, pronounced ???smile???). The language, the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) is written as an XML application and is currently a W3C Recommendation in 1998.

Simply put, it enables authors to specify what should be presented when enabling them to control the precise time that a sentence is spoken and make it coincide with the display of a given image appearing on the screen.

The SMIL language has been designed so that it is easy to author simple presentations without requiring a sophisticated authoring tool.

W3C currently published the SMIL 2.0 specification on 21 SEP 2000.

In additional, RealNetWorks??? products can only support the SMIL language, now.

??? SMIL can offer alternate forms of a presentation using different language.

??? SMIL makes a use of URLs, CSS-based layout, HTML-based hyper linking, and XML-based syntax.
