Greetings;

We have been searching the Internet and discovered your site. We would like
to learn more about your company and products. We have developed and
marketed for the past 17 years, promotional incentives that can help your
company improve a number of things:

Increase traffic flow
Increase same day sales and per ticket sales
Motivate employees
Increase your closing percentage
Give you an edge over your competition

How we do this is simple, we help your company learn how to use travel
incentives to improve business. We have low-cost high-sizzle programs
starting from a few of dollars to complete packages that offer tremendous
sizzle - a resort week vacation, dream cruise, or all inclusive resort down
in the Caribbean. No marketing plan or budget is to small or to large.

We can provide you with corporate references,
registrations/licensing/bondings for every state, sample programs to try
before you buy, and to eliminate any further concerns, at our expense we
will bring you to our headquarters in Tampa to meet our president and
founder, Michael Burke Sr.

Take a look at our websites:
