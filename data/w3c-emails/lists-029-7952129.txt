Do you have too much traffic on your Web site, or what?
No?!?
Then you need MCspider(tm) !! 

MCspider(tm) is a business tool for collecting email addresses from Web pages that meet a user-defined set of criteria.  Using this program, an email address list can be constructed to reach a particular audience.  With MCspider(tm), you can build a list of potential customers that is specific to your business by controlling where and how it searches for addresses.  When connected to the Internet through a cable modem or other reasonably high-speed connection, MCspider(tm) will visit thousands of pages per hour in search of customers for your business.  Since it collects email addresses from publicly available Web sites, you know potential recipients have published their address for the world to know.  You should therefore be able to contact them with little fear of SPAM complaints.

MCspider(tm) is a multi-threaded, fully user configurable Windows application with a complete Help system.  It records the Web pages it visits, in addition to the email addresses it found.  You can therefore rest assured the list it produces is "clean" of duplicates, and that it won't waste time repeatedly looking at the same page for new addresses when it's already found them. 

MCspider(tm) is guaranteed to perform substantially as is described in its documentation, and on its Web page.  Note that this is different from what seems to have become an "industry standard" - the practice of selling software "as-is," without any warranty.  (Have you really read any of the license agreements for software you purchased recently?)  Only by purchasing software from vendors who offer to stand behind their products with a viable warranty can you, the consumer, do anything to combat the proliferation of the "crapware" so common in today's marketplace.

MCspider(tm) is in final beta testing while the Help system and installation prorams are being written.  It is going to be officially released on September 28, 2001 for US$ 249.00 per copy.  Any paid orders received prior to the official release (i.e., payment received on or before Sept. 27, and for delivery on Sept. 28, 2001) will be given a 60% discount - only US$ 99.00 per copy.  This offer is definitely going to expire at the end of the day Sept. 27.

Act now!  Don't miss out on this special offer!  Go to http://L5Software.com/go?MCspider to order your pre-release copy today!

In case you're wondering how we got your email address, MCspider(tm) found it in one of the searches we had it do.  The program does work, and quite well!
