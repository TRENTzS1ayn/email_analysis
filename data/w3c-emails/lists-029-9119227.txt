ATTN: CEO/PRESIDENT.

l am sorry for the embarrassment this my letter might cause you as we have 
not had any correspondence before this letter. l got your address through my 
newphew who works with Nigeria Chamber of Commerce lndustry and Minning 
during my research for a reliable and trustworthy partner who l can do 
business with though l did not disclose the nature of the business l intend 
to do with whoever herecommend for me.

l am DR. MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian Head of State, General 
Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June, 1998 while still on active duty. l 
am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of
great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial relationship.

l currently have within my reach the sum of Eight Million US Dollars
(US$8,000,000) cash which l intend to use for investment,like Real Estate 
Development specifically in your country. This money came as a payback 
contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries 
multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The Russian Parters returned my 
husband's share of USD$8,000,000.00, after the death of my husband and 
lodged in my husband's security company of which l am director. Right now, 
the new Civilian Government have
intensified their probe on my husband's financial and oil company. ln view 
of these, l acted fast to withdraw the US$8,000,000.00 from the company's 
vault and deposited it in a West African Security Company in Accra-Ghana. l 
have since declared the Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existed 
concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no 
documentation showing that we received the money from the Russian.

Due to the current situation int the country concerning government attitude 
towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money within. The pressent government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all 
our bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad. Thus consent l shall 
expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this 
transaction.

Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, l 
proposed a percentage of 30% of the total sum to you for the expected 
service and assistance, 5% for offsetting minor expenses incurred
in the course of this transaction.Your urgent response is highly needed as 
to stop further contacts. All correspondence must be by the email address 
above.

l will give you my tel/fax numbers where you can contact me when l hear from 
you. l must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost 
indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential whatever your 
decision while I await your prompt response.

Best Regards.

DR. (MRS.) MARIAM ABACHA.

NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family, l 
have decided that this transaction exist between you and my Attorney, 
Barrister SANI AUDU. His e-mail address is:   saniaudu@hotmail.com.  
Remember to include your private tel/fax or mobile number for easy 
communication.
