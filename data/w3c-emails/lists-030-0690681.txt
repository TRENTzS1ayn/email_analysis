     REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE: _STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

I AM DR ABAH JOHNSON, THE CHAIRMAN OF CONTRACT AWARD
AND REVIEW COMMITTEE SET UP BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
OF NIGERIA UNDER THE NEW CIVILIAN DISPENSATION TO
AWARD NEW CONTRACTS AND REVIEW EXISTING ONES.  I CAME
TO KNOW OF YOU IN MY SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE AND
REPUTABLE PERSON TO HANDLE A VERY CONFIDENTIAL
TRANSACTION, WHICH INVOLVES THE TRANSFER OF A HUGE SUM
OF MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT.

THERE WERE SERIES OF CONTRACTS EXECUTED BY A
CONSORTIUM OF MULTI-NATIONALS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY IN
FAVOUR OF N.N.P.C. (NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM
CORPORATION) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF THESE CONTRACTS
WERE DELIBRATELY OVER INVOICED TO THE SUM OF
USD$32,000,000.00 (THIRTY TWO MILLION UNITED STATE
DOLLARS).  THIS AMOUNT HAS NOW BEEN APPROVED AND IS
NOW READY TO BE TRANSFERED BEING THAT THE COMPANIES
THAT ACTUALLY EXECUTED THESE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN FULLY
PAID AND THE PROJECTS OFFICIALLY COMMISSIONED.

CONSEQUENTLY, MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE WILLING TO
TRANSFER THE TOTAL AMOUNT TO YOUR ACCOUNT FOR
SUBSEQUENT DISBURSEMENT, SINCE WE AS CIVIL SERVANTS
ARE PROHIBITED BY THE CODE OF CONDUCT BUREAU (CIVIL
SERVICE LAW) FROM OPERATING AND/OR OPENING FOREIGN
ACCOUNTS IN OUR NAMES.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE TRUST
REPOSED ON YOU AT THIS JUNCTURE IS ENORMOUS, IN
RETURN, WE HAVE AGREED TO OFFER YOU 30% OF THE
TRANSFERED SUM, WHILE 10% SHALL BE SET ASIDE FOR
INCIDENTAL EXPENSES (INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL) BETWEEN
BOTH PARTIES. IN THE COURSE OF THIS TRANSACTION YOU
WILL BE MANDATED TO REMIT THE BALANCE TO OTHER
ACCOUNTS IN DUE COURSE.

MODALITIES HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL
OF THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND THE CENTRAL BANK OF
NIGERIA FOR THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THE FUNDS WITHIN
14 WORKING DAYS SUBJECT TO YOUR SATISFACTION OF THE
ABOVE STATED TERMS. OUR ASSURANCE IS THAT YOUR ROLE IS
RISK FREE.TO ACCORD THIS TRANSACTION THE LEGALITY IT
DESERVES AND FOR MUTUAL SECURITY OF THE FUNDS THE
WHOLE APPROVAL PROCEDURES WILL OFFICIALLY AND LEGALLY
BE PROCESSED WITH YOUR NAME OR THE NAME OF ANY COMPANY
YOU MAY NOMINATE AS THE BONEFIDE BENEFICIARY.

ONCE MORE I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT HAVING PUT
INOVER TWENTY-FIVE YEARS IN THE CIVIL SERVICE OF MY
COUNTRY, I AM AVERSE TO HAVING MY IMAGE AND CAREER
DENTED.  THIS MATTER SHOULD THEREFORE BE TREATED WITH
UTMOST SECRECY AND URGENCY IT DESERVES.

PLEASE, YOU SHOULD SIGNIFY YOUR INTENTION TO ASSIST BY
WRITING ME ON MY CONFIDENTIAL EMAIL ADDRESS TO THAT
EFFECT SO THAT I CAN BRIEF YOU FURTHER. I WANT TO
ASSURE YOU THAT THIS BUSINESS PROPOSAL IS 100% RISK
FREE AS WE HAVE DONE OUR HOME WORK PROPERLY.

I QUITE BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL PROTECT OUR INTEREST BY
TAKING THIS DEAL STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL, AS WE ARE
STILL IN GOVERNMENT SERVICE, WHICH WE INTEND TO RETIRE
FROM.

KINDLY EXPEDITE ACTION AS WE ARE BEHIND SCHEDULE TO
ENABLE US INCLUDE THIS TRANSFER IN THE FIRST BATCH
WHICH WOULD CONSTITUTE THE FIRST QUARTER PAYMENTS FOR
THE 2002 FINANCIAL YEAR.

THANKS AND GOD BLESS

DR ABAH JOHNSON.
