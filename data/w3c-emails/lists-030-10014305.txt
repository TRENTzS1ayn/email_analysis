There's a variant of the XSLT stylesheets for (a variant of) xmlspec dtd
in the MathML CVS tree (Math/Group/spec, for those with W3C access)
and checked out into the XML zip file linked from the MathML2 REC
at http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/XML-MathML-20010221.zip

There are two stylesheets one going to HTML and one going to LaTeX (used
for the pdf versions of the spec)
