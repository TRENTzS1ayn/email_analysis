Since you are talking about fixing stuff:

My comment what about the alt attribute of the graphic element (not
tables):

  <!ATTLIST graphic
  %common.att;
  %simple-xlink.att;
  source                  CDATA           #REQUIRED
  %auto-embed.att;
  alt                     CDATA           #IMPLIED
  %local.graphic.att;>

I was advocating that for accessibility purposes, it should be
mandatory, considering its definition (extracted from [1]):

   alt
          An optional alternate string to display if the graphic data
          cannot be displayed or viewed.

Hmmm... I see it listed in the issues section[2] though... well, just
a reminder then. :-)

> Philippe: also summary on tables.

Philippe was saying that summary, for table should be required:

  <!ATTLIST table
  %common.att;
  %width.att;
  summary         CDATA           #IMPLIED
  border          CDATA           #IMPLIED
  frame           (void|above
  |below|hsides
  |lhs|rhs
  |vsides|box
  |border)        #IMPLIED
  rules           (none|groups
  |rows|cols
  |all)           #IMPLIED
  cellspacing     CDATA           #IMPLIED
  cellpadding     CDATA           #IMPLIED>

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0[3] list this
checkpoint[4] as a priority 3 ("A Web content developer may address
this checkpoint."), but documents are never "too accessible", so I
guess that this change would not hurt.
