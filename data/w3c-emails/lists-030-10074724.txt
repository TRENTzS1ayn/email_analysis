Dears, 
the formalization problem you mention seem to have a 
quite general nature. 
The former MathMl WG is currently formalizing the new charter
proposal. If you have any interesting idea or suggestion to
approach MathML to your activities, I would strongly suggest 
you to contact the main responsibles of MathML. 
(I send a copy in CC to Patrick Ion).

Best wishes.
