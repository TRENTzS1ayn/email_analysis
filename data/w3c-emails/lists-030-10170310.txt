   Hi,

   The spec-prod tools have a very bad side effect on anchors semantic. 
   It would be great to fix it.

   See my report in http://www.w3.org/2001/07/QA-revxmlinfoset.html#toc 
   Anchors and section.


Any chance of making that available to those with out W3C access (this
is a public email list) or even to people with standard W3C Member
access (as opposed to W3CACL)

thanks

David
