/ Karl Dubost <karl@w3.org> was heard to say:
| The spec-prod tools have a very bad side effect on anchors
| semantic. It would be great to fix it.

| See my report in http://www.w3.org/2001/07/QA-revxmlinfoset.html#toc
| Anchors and section.

While I appreciate the intent, translating this

  <a name="intro"/><div>
  <h2>1. Introduction </h2>
  <p>This specification...

into this:

  <div>
  <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction </h2>
  <p>This specification...

fails because there are many browsers that don't recognize that #intro
should go to the element with ID intro; they insist on locating an A
with a NAME of intro.

And translating into this:

  <div>
  <h2><a name="intro">1. Introduction </a></h2>
  <p>This specification...

fails because some browsers make the text surrounded by an <A name="">
tag blue and underlined. (They shouldn't, but they do.)

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
