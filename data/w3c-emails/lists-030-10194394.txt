but
    <div>
    <h2><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>1. Introduction </h2>
    <p>This specification...

works everywhere so far as I can tell...

  While I appreciate the intent, translating this

    <a name="intro"/><div>
    <h2>1. Introduction </h2>
    <p>This specification...

  into this:

    <div>
    <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction </h2>
    <p>This specification...

  fails because there are many browsers that don't recognize that #intro
  should go to the element with ID intro; they insist on locating an A
  with a NAME of intro.

  And translating into this:

    <div>
    <h2><a name="intro">1. Introduction </a></h2>
    <p>This specification...

  fails because some browsers make the text surrounded by an <A name="">
  tag blue and underlined. (They shouldn't, but they do.)

                                          Be seeing you,
                                            norm
