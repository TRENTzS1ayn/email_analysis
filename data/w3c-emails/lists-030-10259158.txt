I have done two modifications to xmlspec.xsl[1].

1) When w3c-doctype is not a W3C Technical Report, the style sheet
used is <http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/base.css> instead of a TR
style sheet.

2) When other-doctype's value is "editors-copy", the W3C logo is not
show and the status says:

  This document is an editors' copy that has absolutely no standing.

I am attaching the diff against version 1.11[2].

Editors' copies have the following mark-up:

<spec w3c-doctype="other" other-doctype="editors-copy">

If people are happy with those changes, I will commit them.

Also, other-doctype="editors-copy" could override the value of
w3c-doctype so that a standard style sheet could be used instead of a
TR one, and we could have something like:

<spec w3c-doctype="cr" other-doctype="editors-copy">

If that's desirable, I will edit the style sheet and propose a change
to the documentation[3].
