/ Hugo Haas <hugo@w3.org> was heard to say:
| 2) When other-doctype's value is "editors-copy", the W3C logo is not
| show and the status says:
| 
|   This document is an editors' copy that has absolutely no standing.

I would personally have been a little less blunt. Perhaps

   This document is an editors' copy that has no official standing.

(The document does presumably stand as an editorial draft :-)

| Editors' copies have the following mark-up:
| 
| <spec w3c-doctype="other" other-doctype="editors-copy">
| 
| If people are happy with those changes, I will commit them.

Fine by me.

| Also, other-doctype="editors-copy" could override the value of
| w3c-doctype so that a standard style sheet could be used instead of a
| TR one, and we could have something like:
| 
| <spec w3c-doctype="cr" other-doctype="editors-copy">
| 
| If that's desirable, I will edit the style sheet and propose a change
| to the documentation[3].

Perhaps we need to factor this differently. Maybe we need:

  <spec w3c-doctype="cr" role="editors-copy">

and

  <spec w3c-doctype="other" other-doctype="something random" role="editors-copy">

I don't like the idea of using other-doctype when w3c-doctype isn't "other".

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
