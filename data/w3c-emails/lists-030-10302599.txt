I think it's too late to make such a change to the DTD, it wouldn't be
backward compatible. The DOM spec has instances of lists in paragraphs.
The tool we use to generate the HTML simply closes the paragraph before
the list begins and opens a new one when it ends. I'm sure the same can
be done in the style sheet.
