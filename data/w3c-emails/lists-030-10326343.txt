> Would that be acceptable to just disallow lists inside paragraphs?

No!!!!

It is a major failing of HTML that it does not allow lists inside
paragraphs, but even so, the fact that xmlspec (like docbook, tei,
latex, and pretty much any other document system) allows lists but HTML
does not does not mean that:

It just means that the XSL stylesheet has to be a bit careful in how it
constructs lists and paras. (See for example the stylesheet used for the
mathml spec.)
