I believe this style was deliberately chosen so that normative references 
could be summarized in one place.  In practice, it's annoying to have to 
jump twice to get the actual referenced document; this would be a good 
application for XLink, where you have two links from the bibref: one to the 
official References section and one to the document itself.  A pop-up could 
allow you to pick which one you wanted...
