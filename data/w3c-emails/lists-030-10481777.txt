The first draft of the "W3C Manual of Style" [1] is ready for review by
the W3C Membership and the public. Dan Connolly, Ian Jacobs, Joseph
Reagle, Tim Berners-Lee, Karen MacArthur, and H?kon Wium Lie wrote most
of this document beginning in 1995. It is a publicly accessible
companion to "W3C Publication Rules" [2]. Because of its complexity and
so it can evolve before adoption, I have penciled in 1 January 2002 as
a tentative effective date. Your additions, corrections, and comments
are welcome at mailto:spec-prod@w3.org and/or mailto:lesch@w3.org.
