In general, I would like to see more about using the xmlspec DTD
and/or XML in general to produce W3C documents.  I don't mean
docn of the xmlspec DTD itself, but info on production/publication
of docs written in XML.  For example, at least a mention if where
to go for xmlspec resources, what an editor should do with the 
XML and HTML (and PDF or whatever) versions when submitting
them for publication, etc.

I note in section 10.2 that spell checking is required.  However,
in the sample Rec at http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/REC-sample
there is the phrase "W3C Technial Reports" [sic].

Section 10.4 talks of punctuation, referring to the Chicago
Manual of Style wherein it recommends the use of a comma 
(or colon if appropriate) after "e.g." or "i.e.".  However I 
note this Style document does not do that.  Was this an oversight 
or a conscious decision?

Also, do you have any comments about the business about putting
punctuation such as commas and periods inside quotes (which used
to be the recommended way, but is sometimes confusing and rarely 
followed these days)?

When I try to go to http://www.w3.org/TR/Templates/tech-report.html
using Netscape 4.7, I get error 400 due to the fact that I appear
to get redirected to 
http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/W3C-%%Status:WD,CR,PR,REC,NOTE%%
which is not well-formed.
