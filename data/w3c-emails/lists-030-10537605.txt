If there are volunteers to write a few sentences or more about
production with XMLspec, xmlspec.xsl, html2ps or whatever is in use,
contributions are most welcome. Tonight I installed a new chapter 10 as
a placeholder.

http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/#Production

XMLspec, xmlspec.xsl, and diffspec.xsl are added to References.

Fixed.

Conscious, only to stay lean. But it is UK usage I am told, and has
been switched to commas because you noticed.

I was taught (in the US) that commas and periods are inside quotes,
except when the quoted material is technical or otherwise likely to be
misunderstood because of trailing punctuation. The Chicago manual has
more information on this question than I have ever applied. For clauses
and sentences in our specs ending in a term, I like the Gregg manual
rule 290: "Italicize or underline as a unit whatever should be grasped
as a unit...." (replacing "Italicize or underline" with "Mark up").

Reported to the authors.

Thank you for your comments.
