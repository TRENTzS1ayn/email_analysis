Although all the points Martin makes in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/2000AprJun/0058 are
indubitably true, I think it would be better to express the rule as:

"First person pronouns ('I', 'we') should not be used *in the text of
examples* because this can be hard to translate. See [PRONOUNS]."  

And I think it would be better for [PRONOUNS] to point to something that
clearly includes the example Martin used in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-xml-linking-comments/2000JanMar/0079
.html (final paragraph)

Of course, in normal text the process of translation would take care of
rendering the meaning in culturally acceptable syntax, and pronouns would
not be an issue (unless you used machine translation - which I wouldn't
recommend). 

Cheers,
RI
