The Manual of Style includes the following example:

... as is done for the 'page' property of CSS2 ([CSS2], section 13.3.2).

The question recently arose, should be parens be used when there is no "...
section 13.3.2"? (They are not used by the Manual of Style).

Eg. 
... as applications of XML 1.0 [XML].

or 

... as applications of XML 1.0 ([XML]).  

The above being different from:

for specifications such as [XML 1.0] and [CSS2]. 
(I prefer no parens).
