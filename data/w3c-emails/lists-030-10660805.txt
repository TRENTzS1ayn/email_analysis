Maybe the introduction to punctuation in the Chicago Manual 5.2 applies:

  "The tendency to use all the punctuation that the grammatical
   structure of the material suggests is referred to as close (klos)
   punctuation. It is a practice that was more common in the past, and
   though it may be helpful when the writing is elaborate, it can,
   when misused, produce an uninviting choppiness. There is a tendency
   today, on the other hand, to punctuate only when necessary to
   prevent misreading. Most contemporary writers and editors lean
   toward this open style of punctuation yet preserve a measure of
   subjectivity and discretion."

Is that enough to support your view?

I admit to using some extra commas in my life.

The first looks preferable.

Here we cut a corner too quickly. What do you think of this instead?

   for specifications such as XML 1.0 [XML1] and CSS2 [CSS2].

I agree.
