Is that so? I understood from Martin's article that first person should
be avoided anywhere except some special case like in the status section.

If you have a moment, see if this note about examples helps.

Well, thanks to IANA and RFC 2606 and many reminders, example.com,
example.net, and example.org have taken the place of evocative domain
names in W3C specs. I would not link to MyAnything because W3C has no
control over what is returned over time. There have been some doozies.
Would a non-URI example help? If yes, maybe I could link to this:

Moved.

Thanks very much for your comments. (The errata link idea in your third
message is great and I hope you get some more replies about it.)
