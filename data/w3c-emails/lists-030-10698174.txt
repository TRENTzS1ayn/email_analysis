It's an obviously reasonable idea.  I say take silence (on the chairs 
list) for consent.  I haven't seen anyone on spec-prod complain, and
if someone really cares about the production of specs, they should be
on this mailing list.

Unless someone on spec-prod speaks up soon, let's make this change to 
Susan's document, ask Norm to make the necessary change to xmlspec, and 
be done with it.
