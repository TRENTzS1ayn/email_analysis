There are some outstanding additions that would be useful for the mathml
spec as well (relating mainly to inline graphics, if I recall).
If it would be useful I'll try to generate a list of things we added
(this isn't entirely trivial as mathml is an extended version of xmlspec
version 1 and most of the features got added in version 2 but not
necessarily with the same syntax, but I'd like to get the sources back
as far as possible to the current xmlspec, just in case we ever get the
urge to do a mathml3.)
