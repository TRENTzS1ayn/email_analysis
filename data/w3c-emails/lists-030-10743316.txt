I have to admit that I've fallen down on the job; I've been meaning to do a 
comprehensive XMLspec update for at least a year now.  I've collected a ton 
of RFEs, and was thinking about doing a backwards-compatible minor update 
(to V2.2) before considering any of the backwards-*in*compatible options 
(which would require a V3.0).

At the same time, I've been feeling like XMLspec was already going in the 
direction of being a "kitchen sink" DTD -- it's really hard to decide *not* 
to add features, so it grows.  A V2.2 might exacerbate the problem, so it's 
probably a good time to re-examine our premises about what it should be.

Philippe brings up the idea of possibly merging DocBook and XMLspec.  I 
think this would be a very worthwhile discussion, even if the result is to 
make them much more loosely coupled (e.g. an XMLspec hierarchy/metadata 
module vs. a DocBook hierarchy/metadata module on top of a DocBook-like 
information pool?).

In a separate message I'll send out my current list of XMLspec RFEs...  I'm 
pretty sure it's not complete, but it should cover about a year's worth of 
requests.
