W3C accepts XMLspec just like it accepts postscript, PDF, and
other representations; there's no reason it wouldn't accept
DocBook in the same way... that is: as an alternative
representation. We still require HTML (with particular
constraints) as the official version.

How the HTML is produced is up to the editor.
