I agree with this analysis.  More below:

It would need to allow it "wholesale" (you'd want to be able to pop in the 
whole W3C structure).  This would also be useful if we wanted to 
accommodate IETF documents (an idea mentioned in my message on RFEs).

I just saw Dan's mail about using dc: metadata, which sounds like a fine 
idea too, as long as (a) W3C's pubrules are adhered to and (b) there's 
enough flexibility to add new types of header information, which XMLspec 
has had problems with in the past.

I think DocBook should begin to allow HTML tables anyway...

If we had buy-in from the community for the project, and if most/all of the 
changes could be accommodated with an XSLT transformation, and if 
stylesheets were available quickly for the new format...I bet there 
wouldn't be any problem.

As long as there's a stylesheet to produce acceptable HTML (as Dan noted), 
there shouldn't be a problem.

I see great promise in a merged schema.  But a harmonization project would 
need real resources to be done properly.
