I would say that's the job of the editor so we should not let us stopped
by this issue.

I would suggest to keep the XMLspec format here (and in general to always
prefer the "special purpose" elements over a general element). I don't know
about the XSL but the DOM generator is doing different manipulation depending
on the element (specref, xspecref or bibref).

This will force the DOM working group to revise its DOM generator and the
XSL for the DOM Test Suites but it is possible to do it. I'm waiting for
more feedback before asking the group directly.

As Dan pointed out, the W3C has no constraint on tools used to produce as long
as the resulting document HTML valid and conforms to the W3C style. I don't
think that all working groups are ready to switch to XML yet unfortunately. We
will need to ask/persuade the working groups who are currently using xmlspec to
switch to the new format.
