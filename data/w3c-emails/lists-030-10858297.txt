Fair enough.

I tend to favor the other approach myself, allowing the link behavior
to be determined by the thing it points to. But I don't feel very
strongly about it.

Yes, we definitely need more feedback. It's too early to start changing
things :-)

That will probably be easier than persuading the working groups not currently
using XML at all to start using it :-)
