How about the psychological issues?  We have had trouble
getting people to use XML at all for drafts; getting them
to wrap their minds around docbook as a precondition for
drafting specs is potentially a pretty strong disincentive.

And I'm sorry, CALS tables are *right out*.  Don't go there.

Having said that, there's certainly a lot of infrastructure
in place for docbook. -Tim
