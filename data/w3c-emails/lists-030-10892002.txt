This isn't practical in the general case.  For example, how would you be 
able to tell, by looking at the thing linked to, that a reference to 
another W3C specification is normative vs. non-normative?  I realize that 
XMLspec currently doesn't make this distinction, but it's something that 
has been brought up a few times.

The association may have semantics that neither of the endpoints has on its 
own.  XLink and RDF teach us this. :-)
