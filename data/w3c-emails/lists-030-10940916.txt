  This isn't practical in the general case.  For example, how would you be
  able to tell, by looking at the thing linked to, that a reference to
  another W3C specification is normative vs. non-normative?  I realize that
  XMLspec currently doesn't make this distinction, but it's something that
  has been brought up a few times.

  The association may have semantics that neither of the endpoints has on its
  own.  XLink and RDF teach us this. :-)
