Well, that may be true in the general case, but an xref to a bibl is
probably a bibref and an xref to a div is probably a specref, etc.

Individual elements work fine when there are only a few, but how many do you want?

  specref
  bibref
  glossref
  tableref
  figureref
  prodref
  protoref
  funcref
  ...

                                        Be seeing you,
