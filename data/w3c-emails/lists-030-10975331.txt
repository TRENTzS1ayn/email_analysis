A lot. For example, there are references to "the latest version of a spec,
whatever that may be", to a specific version, to a part within either of the
foregoing. There are references to an image, a movie, a sound file, which may
be normative depictions, or just illustrations. There are references to
metadata that is going to change, or to content that is known to be stable.
There are of course references to stylesheets, glossary entries, tables of
contents at various level (this massive spec, this section, this subsection).

And there are bound to be others I haven't thought of or haven't needed
myself.

  Well, that may be true in the general case, but an xref to a bibl is
  probably a bibref and an xref to a div is probably a specref, etc.

  Individual elements work fine when there are only a few, but how many do you want?
