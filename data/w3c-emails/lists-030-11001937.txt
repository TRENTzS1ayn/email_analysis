Oh, I want there to be as few links as possible - and as much flexibility
about what they mean as possible. So I can say "show me all the links" really
easily, or so I can say "what types of links are there here?" easily.

I would prefer one link element - using a decent CSS tool I can rpesent them
how I like (if not via XSLT, or some nasty PERL hack, or ...)

  My question had nothing to do with how many types of links there are
  (an unbounded set, probably), but with one aspect of the mechanics of
  linking. Do you want a discrete element for each possible type of
  link, or do you want a small number of linking elements and a little
  sophistication in the tools that render them?
