Can't you instead suggest to use the left and right double quote
characters. Especially for those specs that are (also) published typeset
as pdf, using left and right quotes rather than ascii straight ones is a
distinct improvement, and it's never particularly reliable to try to go
the other way and "infer" keft and right quotes from markup that just
uses straight ones.
