A better suggestion, at least for those using xmlspec (is there any
reason not to be authoring all specs in XML now?)  would be to use
markup and let the stylesheet(s) worry about which quote characters to
use.

xmlspec has:


<!--    quote: Scare quotes and other purely presentational quotes. -->
<!ELEMENT quote (%p.pcd.mix;)*>
<!ATTLIST quote %common.att;>
