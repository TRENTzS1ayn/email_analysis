One clarification: this *is* compatible with HTML, see "12.2.3
Anchors with the id attribute" [1] of HTML 4, for example.
RFC 2070 [2], which was published in January 1997 (as old as
HTML 3.2), also added the "id" attribute on most elements.
The "id" attribute can be found even in the first proposal of
HTML+ (in 1993), so this is really an "old" feature in HTML.
Nowadays almost all browsers except Netscape 4.x supports
the "id" attribute as an anchor.

You may call it as an incompatibility with legacy HTML browsers
(such as Netscape 4.x), but please don't call it as an
incompatibility with HTML.

Because it is Netscape 4.x which is broken, not links.

I'm not against using both the "id" and "name" attributes (when
it is feasible), but the link validator MUST NOT give "errors"
for perfectly valid link targets, and they do work in many of
the deployed browsers (except Netscape 4.x).
