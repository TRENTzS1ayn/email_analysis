I believe it is also the case that where Netscape 4x would display alt text
as a tooltip, but not title text, Netscape 6x displays title text in the
tooltip, but not alt text.  Do people think we should (on practical grounds)
apply the same text to both alt and title elements, or is it better practise
to wean people off the idea that alt text will appear in a tooltip?
