No question that Netscape 4.x is broken in this respect, but...

...[change "give errors" to "give warnings" and] I disagree
completely here.  The validator gives warnings for things 
like a missing or extra trailing slash and such, and the
fact is that for the large proportion of real people out
there using Netscape 4.x, these links simply do not work.

Let's face facts, if the W3C were a corporation trying to
attract customers with its public web site, it wouldn't
put up pages that don't work for a large segment of the
population regardless of "whose fault it is."  We should
change the validator so that it gives warnings for links
that do not follow the XHTML compatibility guidelines.
