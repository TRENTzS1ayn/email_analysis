Well, alt text is required by HTML, and by WCAG - 2 W3C recommendations.
Putting the same thing into a title attribute that is in an alt attribute
isn't an intrinsically bad thing, but it isn't the best way to go in some
circumstances either. Title doesn't seem to mean the same thing as alt
(although it isn't so well defined what title _does_ mean).

title is probably about the closest thing to a 'tooltip' attribute that there
is (although the concept plays a little differently in a voice-based system,
of course).

  I believe it is also the case that where Netscape 4x would display alt text

  apply the same text to both alt and title elements, or is it better practise
  to wean people off the idea that alt text will appear in a tooltip?
