Your timing is great. Susan Lesch and I discussed this yesterday.
Here is our plan, to be executed as soon as we have time:

  - No rules in pubrules will appear in the manual of style.
    There will be links from the m.o.s. to pubrules.

  - There will be no notion of conformance to the m.o.s. We will
    replace things like "You must have correct spelling" with
    "Spell-check your document."

Why no notion of conformance? There's no prize or penalty for
conforming! We'll just say what good things to do are.
