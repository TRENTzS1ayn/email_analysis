Hello,

I've decided to translate XHTML Basic into another language but I have
no idea how to create text-only, PDF or PostScript versions.
Can anyone help me with this?

I use Windows so I cannot take advantage of lynx, html2ps or ps2pdf.

I just hope to find someone using the OS to generate the
above-mentioned formats among the subscribers of this list. Because if
I use tools different from yours I will obviously get
different-looking pages.

Thanks in advance,
