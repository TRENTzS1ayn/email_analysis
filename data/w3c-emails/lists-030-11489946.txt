As for text only versions

  http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/html2txt
  http://www.delorie.com/web/lynxview.html
  http://www.slcc.edu/webguide/lynxit.html

And you can write it by hand, I don't see the problem.

Lynx and ps2pdf are available for Win32, html2ps is a perl script,
it runs on any platform Perl does, including Win32. ps2pdf is included
in the Cygwin package, Lynx Win32 binaries can be downloaded from
http://lynx.browser.org.

XHTML Basic has been published by the HTML Working Group, I suggest
asking on www-html@w3.org, the editors or the HTML Activity Lead would
be a better idea.
