The problem I see here, is that in fact only a very small number of
technical reports are written uisng the xmlspec document type. Maybe
it'd be a better idea to have some informal XHTML classes for this
purpose, if that's not anyway the ides. This would be way easier to
adopt by Working Groups and users of technical reports also have
access to this information.
