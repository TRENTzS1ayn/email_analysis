Well, in order to be able to test specification implementation it is helpful
to impose these constraints on the way the spec is written. I agree that it
adds to the already significant workload of editors who are not doing this,
but I think it is an important part of ensuring the quality of our
specifications to enable them to be tested.

  This sounds like it might force a particular writing style and constrain
  the sentence structures used by editors. Am I reading too much into this?

  I am concerned about anything that would increase the work load or the
  constraints on editors. We've got an enormous amount of work to do as it is.
