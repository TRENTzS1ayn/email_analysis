Well, this has been done with the WAI guidelines (WCAG - Recommendation may
1999, ATAG rec feb 2000, UAAG and XAG in draft stages) and is being followed
up with the QA framework because it worked well for WAI. It has undergone a
few minor tweaks as we have more experience with it.

Another approach is to look at the testing experience in SVG, MathML, CSS -
all of whom have large test suites and results from them.

  As a first step, I would suggest testing this on a small scale with a spec
  where the editors are particularly interested in trying this.
