Scott,

Being an editor of the Specification Guidelines document in the QA 
activity, where I advocate this, I'm happy to see that more people are 
thinking about these things. In the document (see 
http://www.w3.org/QA/WG/2002/04/qaframe-spec-0429.html for the latest 
draft), you'll find similar ideas that definitely need to be worked on. 
I look forward to your input and will provide comments on your work.

best,

/Dimitris
