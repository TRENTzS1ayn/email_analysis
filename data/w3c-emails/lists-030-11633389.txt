I completely agree with Scott's sentiments here, as well as with Charles' 
in the previous message of this thread.  Because testability of 
specifications should be a priority issue, and not a afterthought, the QAWG 
is taking up this aspect of the QA Framework now.

In mid-May, we expect to publish 4 WD members of the Framework family plus 
two checklists (see the overview table at [1]).  Amongst these working 
drafts will be the first public Working Draft (FPWD) of "Specification 
Guidelines" and its companion checklist.  You can see a preview of these 
(Editor's drafts) at [2], [3].

The topic of spec anatomy (grammars for authoring) is addressed in the 
Introduction, and in Guidelines 12 and 13.  Discretionary behaviors were 
mentioned in this thread, and we address those in Guideline 8.  This is 
just the FPWD now, but we (QA) view this as the start of a major project -- 
both the development and progression of this specification, and work on 
actual techniques (specific markup).

One comment in the thread was interesting -- the startup hurdle of 
switching to xmlspec suggests the utility of a half-way step, such as some 
class definitions for XHTML authoring.

By the way, these techniques -- markup to enhance testablility, location of 
test assertions, and even direct generation of test suties -- are not 
speculative.  They're in use now.  An example that we have looked at in 
QAWG is DOM.

Regards,
Lofton.
