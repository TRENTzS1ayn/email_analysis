Scott,

Can you explain what you mean by "testable assertion"?

Can you relate your proposal to the XQuery formal semantics?

It seems to me that many of the issues being raised ("you want a
specification, not just a vague collection of words") are also
addressed by formal semantics.  (See quote in sig below.)

Cheers,  -- P
