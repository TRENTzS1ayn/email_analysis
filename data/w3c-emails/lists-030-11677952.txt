Please use this version,

[2] http://www.w3.org/QA/WG/2002/framework-20020506/qaframe-spec.html

instead of Dimitris' reference.  Mostly editorial improvements on the path 
to publication, but significant ones there.  Note that these are not stable 
references, as they are editor's working copies!  (Okay, having pointed to 
it, we can leave it as is for a while.)
