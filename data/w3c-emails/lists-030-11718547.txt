Alex, by no means do I think that testable assertion tagging can solve all
problems with testing.  But my experience is that many of the specification
statements are made without thinking about how to verify these statements.
I think that markup in the xmlspec can help, though I am purposefully not
proposing a design yet.  It sounds like the QA WG has already been thinking
about this, and, indeed many already have experience in such techniques.

What I am worried about with the current thread is trying to solve too
much.  What I am looking for is some simple markup that we could add to the
xmlspec DTD/Schema that would make testing and verification better.  And it
would really be nice to have something in time for the XPath 2.0/XQuery
1.0/XSLT 2.0 specs,  IF we can do it in a way that does not slow down
progress.  In other words, I'm really just looking for some useful baby
steps right now.
