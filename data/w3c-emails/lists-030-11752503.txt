>Can you explain what you mean by "testable assertion"?

This term came from work being done by the QAWG and a companion
effort of the (generic) Conformance TC of OASIS. You will probably
see a formal definition from the QAWG soon. Informally, it is any
sentence or equivalent assemblage of words that prescribes the
behavior that must be obtained when a stimulus occurs under a certain
set of conditions. The associated test would create the conditions,
cause the stimulus, and allow capture of the resulting behavior for
evaluation.
