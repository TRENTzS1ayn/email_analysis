I like this. This allows someone else to work on the assertions without 
having to share the source of the document.

Also, I think the assertions in this document helped me understand what you 
are trying to accomplish. I think this is a good thing to do - particularly 
if it leads to the development of a test suite.

My instinct is to use a separate document, not to embed markup in the 
source document, to allow work to be shared more equitably. Currently, only 
Don and I really edit the source fo the XQuery language document.
