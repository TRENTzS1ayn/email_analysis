Request for Urgent Business Relationship.



Attention: Managing Director/ C.E.O. 

Sir, 

Request for Urgent Business Relationship. 

First I must solicit your confidence in this transaction.This is by 
virtue of its nature as 
being utterly confidential and top secret. We shall be counting on your 
ability and 
reliability to prosecute a transaction of great magnitude 
involving a pending business transaction requiring maximum confidence. 
We are top 
officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel who are 
interested in 
importation of goods into our country with funds which are presently 
trapped in Nigeria. 
In order to commence this business we solicit 
your assistance to enable us RECIEVE the said trapped funds ABROAD. 

The source of this fund is as follows : During the regime of our late 
head 
of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, the government officials set up companies 
and awarded 
themselves contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various 
Ministries. The NEW CIVILIAN Government set up a Contract Review Panel 
(C.R.P) and 
we have identified a lot of inflated contract funds which are presently 
floating in the 
Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N). However, due to our position as civil 
servants and 
members of this panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names. I 
have therefore, 
been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues of the panel to 
look for an 
Overseas partner INTO whose ACCOUNT the sum of US$31,000,000.00 (Thirty 
one 
Million United States Dollars) WILL BE PAID BY TELEGRAPHIC TRANSFER. 
Hence we are 
writing you this letter. 

We have agreed to share the money thus: 
70% for us (the officials) 
20% for the FOREIGN PARTNER (you) 
10% to be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign 
expenses. 

It is from this 70% that we wish to commence the importation 
business. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and we hope 
that the funds 
arrive your account in latest ten (10) banking days from the date of 
reciept of the 
following information by email: A suitable name and bank account into 
which the funds 
can be paid. 

The above information will enable us write letters of claim and 
job description respectively. This way we will use your company?s name 
to 
apply for payments and re-award the contract in your company name. 

We are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your 
confidentiality in this 
transaction. 

For security reasons, please respond only to the above Telephone number 
I will bring you into the complete picture of this pending project 
when I have heard 
from you. 

Yours Faithfully, 
Mr.Pius Banjo.
