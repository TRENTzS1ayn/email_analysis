I think the following, from  the recent XQuery draft, is a "testable
assertion":

   A variable evaluates to the value to which the variable's QName is bound
   in the evaluation context.

I think the following is NOT a testable assertion:

   Each input document, and each node or node hierarchy constructed during
   expression processing, is a separate data model fragment.

...so I'm making this up as I go along.  It's probably a judgement call for
each sentence.  I'm not sure how much of this can be done after the fact
(of writing), or how much really has to be done as part of the writing
process.  Probably a little bit of both.

You make a good point.  I'm not sure.  My impression was that the formal
semantics document just described a part of XQuery, not the whole of it.  I
would think that the Formal Semantics would be not much different from the
other docs, except the job might be easier with it?

Scott,

Can you explain what you mean by "testable assertion"?

Can you relate your proposal to the XQuery formal semantics?

It seems to me that many of the issues being raised ("you want a
specification, not just a vague collection of words") are also
addressed by formal semantics.  (See quote in sig below.)

Cheers,  -- P
