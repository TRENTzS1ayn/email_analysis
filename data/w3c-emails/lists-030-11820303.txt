This is a strong assertion that may be true but probably requires some 
supporting evidence.  In my experience the human-readability of a spec 
is an important factor in its successful uptake by the community.  XML 
1.0 is admittedly a counter-example, but should I ever undertake another 
large-scale core-technology spec editing assignment, I'd put a lot more 
energy into the prose.

Having said all that, the testable-assertions hypothesis probably merits 
serious investigation.  I'm not sure it merits immediate adoption. -Tim
