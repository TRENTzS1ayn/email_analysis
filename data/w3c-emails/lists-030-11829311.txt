I don't think it's totally either one or the other.  And most specs are
better anyway if they are declarative, in my experience.  Also, there is
the path that Schema took, which is to provide a tutorial.

It depends on what baby steps may be taken.  I believe a large amount of
work lies in wait for the creation of test suites for XPath 2.0/XQuery
1.0/XSLT 2.0.  We may be able to save a lot of person hours by taking some
simple markup steps now.

This is a strong assertion that may be true but probably requires some
supporting evidence.  In my experience the human-readability of a spec
is an important factor in its successful uptake by the community.  XML
1.0 is admittedly a counter-example, but should I ever undertake another
large-scale core-technology spec editing assignment, I'd put a lot more
energy into the prose.

Having said all that, the testable-assertions hypothesis probably merits
serious investigation.  I'm not sure it merits immediate adoption. -Tim
