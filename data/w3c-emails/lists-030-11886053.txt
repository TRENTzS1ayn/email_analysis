Dimitris,

There is a lot in this thread, and I think at the least that QAWG needs to 
"mine" the thread for specific issues (points of contention from past 
messages) that we should state as SpecGuide issues, and then resolve.

I also believe that some of the goals that Scott originally stated are 
immediately realizable, and possibly without too much added burden on spec 
editors.  The obvious realization is in xmlspec, but we should also 
consider a less ambitious class-based markup scheme using XHTML (which if 
properly designed, could automatically be transformed [e.g., XSLT] later to 
xmlspec).

To recap, I include Scott's goals with your replies, then your "Road ahead" 
proposal.  First the goals...

And now to your proposed way forward...

It looks sensible to me.  I would add an item, to try to untangle the 
numerous intermingled issues in this thread and enumerate a set of discrete 
issues (for the QAWG Issues List).

Are you proposing to launch such a project, i.e., to initiate the first 
steps?
