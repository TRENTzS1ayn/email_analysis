[dd] Right; we could either go for xmlspec, which I think would raise 
more protests that going for a class-based XHTML scheme. I personally 
feel quite good with xmlspec, but we'd have to do the survey I propose 
below to find out if that goes for enough people.

[dd] The "standard" I mention here would be the testable assertion 
markup we've discussed and the linking technique (pointing to a testable 
assertion from a part of the actual test, say).

[dd] Seems to be the proper way forward. I can start working on such an 
untaglement right away.

[dd] Yes, I do. I can build on this email you just sent, look through 
the thread again, and raise the separate issues we have at hand.

Scott, have you had time to look through the thread recently? Your views 
would be appreciated.
