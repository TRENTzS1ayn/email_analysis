The comm team changed the format of the head and requires a separate
paragraph for the alternative versions
[[
8 Links to any alternative (non-normative) formats or packages for the
document. For instance:

<p>This document is also available in these non-normative formats: <a
href="WD-foo-20020101.html">single HTML file</a>, <a

The style sheet needs to updated:

Some documents have (available in ...) in the xml unfortunately. Those
will need to keep only the loc elements.

The DOM specs list the <> locations, take the first one as being "this
version" and others as alternative. So I just need to update the DOM
generator.
