Given a question about the creation of derivative works based on [1,2], 
elsewhere [3] I recommended the authors clarify the copyright owners (W3C 
or specific persons) and the specific licenses (W3C document or software 
license) under which they be distributed. I'm repeating this request in the 
spec-prod forum. The ambiguity created by these documents in the context of 
being hosted on the W3C site (which has specific terms and licenses) should 
be eliminated.

Yes, or if Eve feels that she wishes to exclusively retain the copyright: 
"Copyright (c) 2000 Eve Maler. All Rights Reserved. W3C(r) liability,
trademark, document use and software licensing rules apply.

" In either case, I recommend a further statement that it was obtained under
a dated version of the W3C Software license:
and "This document was made used in accordance with the W3C Software Policy
