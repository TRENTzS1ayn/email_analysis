/ Joseph Reagle <reagle@w3.org> was heard to say:
| Given a question about the creation of derivative works based on [1,2], 
| elsewhere [3] I recommended the authors clarify the copyright owners (W3C 
| or specific persons) and the specific licenses (W3C document or software 
| license) under which they be distributed. I'm repeating this request in the 
| spec-prod forum. The ambiguity created by these documents in the context of 
| being hosted on the W3C site (which has specific terms and licenses) should 
| be eliminated.

I have cleaned up the header comments and asserted Sun copyright on
behalf of Eve and myself. I don't know what statement Chris, Henry, and/or
Ben might like added.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
