The version of the stylesheet I last touched, 30 April 2000, had this 
statement:

<!-- This stylesheet is copyright (c) 2000 by its authors.  Free
      distribution and modification is permitted, including adding to
      the list of authors and copyright holders, as long as this
      copyright notice is maintained. -->

I feel that that's sufficient for my needs.
