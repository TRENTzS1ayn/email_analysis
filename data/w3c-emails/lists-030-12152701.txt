Hello Max,

I'm nominally the maintainer of the DTD, but have not been able to devote 
time to it for quite a while.  Norm has made some corrections when they've 
been absolutely necessary, but that's about it.  (Norm maintains the 
stylesheets fairly actively.)

A colleague of mine, Sabine Ocker, has agreed to be the point person for 
changes to the XMLspec DTD to help ensure that they're done in a consistent 
manner.  She's been following this list for a couple of months now.  She's 
ready to start taking an active role in fielding DTD requests and making 
changes; there are quite a few requests for enhancement that have been 
piling up.

Your id/name request is related to the stylesheets, right?  I'll assume 
that Norm will follow up on that one.

         Eve
