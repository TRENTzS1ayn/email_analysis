/ Max Froumentin <mf@w3.org> was heard to say:
| The last round of publications has shown that the xmlspec DTD and
| stylesheets are somewhat out of date with respect to new publication
| rules, and that it would help future drafts if they were updated.  To
| name a couple of issues: id and name attributes on headers

I just applied patches to fix that.

| and link to
| errata are missing in the current CVS

How is that supposed to work?

| I've sent a patch for the
| former but it hasn't been checked in or refused. So I'm wondering if
| Norm or Eve still maintain it or whether it is left to contributors to

No, I'm still doing it.

Can we make a web page for the xmlspec stylesheets? I'd like to be
able to make more official releases than just checking stuff into CVS.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
