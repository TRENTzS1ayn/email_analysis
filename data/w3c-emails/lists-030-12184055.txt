Yves, Sabine, Max,

The i18n Working Group recently reverted the Character Model WD to XML.  We
made some changes to the DTD and XSL to meet our needs: including creating
XHTML output in UTF-8.  Its not perfect, but I thought it would be good to
share this.  

A list of changes to DTD and XSL is given below.  There are also additional
files to support editing in XMetal 2.1.


FILES
---------
You can find the following files at
http://www.w3.org/International/Group/charmod-edit/

xmlspec-CM.css (for XMetal rendering)
xmlspec-CM.ctm
xmlspec-CM.dtd
xmlspec-CM.mcr
xmlspec-CM.rlx
xmlspec-CM.xsl
xmlspec-CM_structure.css

Overview.xml
Overview.html




DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------
The enclosed documents below provide some documentation.  (One is a copy of
the XML Spec documentation I have doctored slightly and applied new styling
too (just add graphics).  I found the new layout makes it much easier to
look things up in hardcopy form.)




CHANGES
-------------
To XSL:
19 Dec 2001: (richard.ishida@gbr.xerox.com)
- additional.css: added css declarations to this document, rather
than using a separate file (to get around the pubrules requirement that the
W3C stylesheet is the last one called)
- ipr-notice: changed ipr-notice link to ipr-notice-20000612 in all
(3) locations

14 Dec 2001: (richard.ishida@gbr.xerox.com)
- olist, ulist: because a list may be a child of req and not just p,
changed the validity.hacks transforms
- abstract, status: corrected duplicate assignment of id 
- created anchor element for list items if an id was assigned in the
xml
- created anchor element for notes and examples if an id was
assigned in the xml

12 Dec 2001: (richard.ishida@gbr.xerox.com)

- output: changed to output as xhtml
- general: for every <a> with name=, added id= with same attr value
- general: lowercased all element and attribute names in output
- ednote: made appear using <span class="editor-note">
- example: if first child is p and no head, heading 'EXAMPLE: '
appears *inline* at beginning of first p
otherwise 'EXAMPLE:' appears in its own block
heading 'EXAMPLE: ' wrapped with <span class="example-head">
- note: if first child is p, heading 'NOTE: ' appears *inline* at
beginning of first p
otherwise 'NOTE:' appears in its own block
heading 'NOTE: ' wrapped with <span class="note-head">
NB: CharMod commonly uses notes for informative text
- graphic: added code to deal with height and width attributes
- item: added name= and id= attributes to allow linking to list
items
added <span class="req"> to highlight if part of a
requirement
- kw: changed <b> to <span class="keyword"> to allow more
flexibility in presentation
- olist, ulist: used $validity.hacks to close off <span class="req">
and start again if a requirement includes a list
- del, ins: added code to deal with these new elements (expectation
that all ins and del markup will be removed prior to publication)
- quote: surrounded with <span class="quote"> to allow for
alternative styling (CharMod italicises the text)
- html and head elements:
- changed document declaration for xhtml
- added xml:lang to html tag
- added charset declaration, set to utf-8
- made the default stylesheet link relative
- removed internal css (added to local css file mentioned
below)
- linked to local css file (that currently overwrites
everything in the default for CharMod)
- added link to javascript file and constructs to allow for
hiding/showing redlining (this will be removed prior to publication)
- term: replaced <b> with <span class="term"> to allow for
flexibility in rendering
- added new templates to deal with the following new elements:
- req
- qterm
- qchar
- rfc2119
- uname
- abbr
- acronym
- figure (includes its own caption handling at the moment)
- image

To DTD:
12 Dec 2001
- %illus.class: added image and figure
- %termdef.class: added abbr and acronym
- %local.emph.class: added del and ins
- %tech.class: added qterm, qchar, rfc2119, and uname
- p: added req
- graphic: added attributes height and width - CharMod doesn't use
the alt attribute - this is replaced by an alt element that is part of image
- td, th: changed rowspan and colspan from NMTOKEN '1' to #IMPLIED
- added the following new elements:
- ins
- del
- req plus req-type, req-text
- rfc2119
- qterm
- qchar
- abbr
- acronym
- uname
- figure plus image plus alt
