Dear xmlspec maintainers:

I got the following error report from T.V. Raman when editing
a chapter of the XForms spec. I wouldn't have made these mistakes
if the dtd hadn't allowed me to make them :-(. I hope either
the dtd or the xslt can be fixed to avoid such problems in
the future.

This should be made mandatory.

This is the usual problem. I guess the stylesheet should
produce <p></p><table></table><p></p> for HTML from
<p><table></table></p> in the input.


Regards,   Martin.
