11.8 says (in part)

 if pre examples are too long to fit on a 640x480 screen, shorten them.

This doesn't really provide enough information. In particular, this will
depend on font size used... by the user, not the style sheet (which according
to WCAG should in any event not be setting a size).

There is a problem in trying to use (X)HTML for producing examples of text
where the layout is really important, and where the examples are useful in a
device-independent world. But I think that the use of (repeated) &nbsp;
elements at the beginning of a line, and providing the examples in a format
that sizes reasonably according to the monitor size used, is the best
approach.

It is equally annoying to find that because I use a largish font size the
text over-runs its surrounding box (which nicely reflows on my screen - itsef
varying between about 800x800 and 1600x1200), and to find that I have a
little column of text on the left hand side that I could have had flow across
whatever space is available.
