Do folks think we should define these terms and try to use them 
consistently?

Hello Norman,

I remember once asking if there was a normative definition of normative.
(This certainly came up in questions of dependencies between
specifications.) Regardless, never saw anything in writing and a convention
for the W3C has yet to appear [1] though some WGs use the distinction.
However, I've found the context of the reference to be more useful than
this distinction in a bibliography and most of our references are normative
(in that the import meaning/protocol/procedure necessary for xmldsig
conformance). Quickly eyeballing them I'd say everything is normative
except for:

Informative: read for interesting context/background
[ABA,RDF,SOAP,XHTML1.0,XLink,XML-Japanese]

Important: I expect you should read if you're going to be capable of
implementing the spec but no meaning is imported.
[DOM,SAX,LDAP-DN]
