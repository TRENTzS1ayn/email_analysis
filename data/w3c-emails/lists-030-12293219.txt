Pubrules makes also reference to "How to Write a W3C Technical Report",

http://www.w3.org/Guide/Reports

which is considerably lengthier than pubrules itself.  It seems that the 
reference is normative -- "Editors and Team contacts should consult 'How to 
Write a W3C Technical Report' for detailed guidance." -- i.e., you have to 
do the stuff in "../Reports".  Is that correct?

It does do all of those things -- presenting lots of helpful information to 
editors -- but it also gathers together (subsumes?) the stuff in 
"../Reports" and also (I think) much of pubrules.  In doing so, it gets rid 
of all of the "@@" incompletions, such as "@@Not sure what this section is 
about..." and "@@In development@@" (in ../Reports), and is generally a more 
polished document.

So that is where the duplication is.  For my own (novice W3C editor) taste, 
the style guide is a nice reference for "one stop shopping" on editorial, 
pubrules, and style questions.  As Dom has pointed out, pubrules (and 
"../Reports) is the definitive normative source.  But that doesn't mean we 
couldn't evolve the style guide so that it had normative and informative 
sections, where the normative sections eventually replaced pubrules+Reports.
