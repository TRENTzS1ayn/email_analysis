Hi,

I was using the current versions of the xmlspec DTD from the CVS
repository when I found a place where it needed to be extended slightly.

I was trying to make a glossary list with hyperlinks in the <label>.
This was not possible because %ref.class; was not in %label.pcd.mix.
A similar problem occurs if you try to have hyperlinks in the
<head> of the <div*> elements.

May I suggest the xmlspec DTD be updated so that those entity declarations
are:

<!ENTITY % head.pcd.mix
        "#PCDATA|%annot.class;|%emph.class;|%tech.class;
        |%loc.class;|%ednote.class;
        |%ref.class;">  <!-- Here's the change -->
<!ENTITY % label.pcd.mix
        "#PCDATA|%annot.class;|%termdef.class;|%emph.class;
        |%tech.class;|%loc.class;|%ednote.class;
        |%ref.class;">   <!-- Here's the change -->

This seems to render correctly with the xmlspec-html.xsl stylesheet. I've
not tried it with the FO stylesheet yet.

Thanks,
