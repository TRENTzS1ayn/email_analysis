/ Francois Yergeau <FYergeau@alis.com> was heard to say:
| It's a nice idea to add an 's' for multiple <loc>s, but it needs to say
| "count(loc)" in the 6th line to work right.

Fixed in CVS.

| 2) The various "divX/head" templates each have code to generate an <a
| name=".."> from the id of the div, instead of calling the nice "anchor"
| template.  Is there a reason for that?  A downside is that the <a> has
| name=".." only, not id=".."
|
| I tried calling "anchor" as follows:
|
|       <xsl:call-template name="anchor">
|         <xsl:with-param name="node" select=".."/>
|         <xsl:with-param name="conditional" select="0"/>
|       </xsl:call-template>
|
| with the expected results and no obvious ill effects.

Right. Also fixed in CVS. The anchor template is a relatively new invention :-)

                                          norm
