Hi Norm,

yep, w3.org/spec-prod is too high.

In general, you would be probably want something like
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/spec-prod (and that doesn't change when you want to
add some more stuff next month/year - it is just a way to be "reasonably
sure" that there aren't going to be big collisions in namespace 4 years
away...)

Cheers

Chaals

  Can someone on the team name a directory for me, please? Perhaps
  http://www.w3.org/spec-prod except that I expect that's too high up
  the hierarchy.
