But Norm is neither talking about a namespace name nor
a single document.  Go to http://www.w3.org/ and run
your mouse over the list of URLs under "W3C A to Z".
You don't see a single URL with a month number in it,
and most of them don't have a year number in it either.

I would think that's more like the kind of thing he's 
talking about.
