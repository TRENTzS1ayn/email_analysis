Getting something in that column generally involves
a management decision... often a full, 4-week
review by the AC and all that.
Is that what you're asking for?

you/we can use
  http://www.w3.org/2002/03/spec-prod
pretty much for free.

Anything else is going to involve negotiation; e.g.
you/we could use
http://www.w3.org/XML/spec-prod
if you negotiate with the /XML/ owner, i.e. Liam.
