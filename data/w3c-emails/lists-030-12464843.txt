/ Micah Dubinko <MDubinko@cardiff.com> was heard to say:
| When I use the latest diffspec.xsl stylesheet, I get the following message
| at the top of the generated document, which makes me happy:
|
| The presentation of this document has been augmented to identify changes
| from a previous version. Three kinds of changes are highlighted: new, added
| text, changed text, and deleted text.
|
| When I use the stylesheet with show.diff.markup = 0, I still get the
| message, which doesn't make me happy.
|
| When there's no diff marking, shouldn't that message be suppressed?

Yes. Fixed in CVS.
