| Hi Susan,
|
| That CSS is generated by the XSLT stylesheet which transforms
| 'xmlspec' documents to HTML. I've cc'ed the maintainer of the
| stylesheet to alert him to the problem.

I fixed the problem by removing the offending CSS fragment. I haven't
checked in the change yet, though, because I'm on the road...
