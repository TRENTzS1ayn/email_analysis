Someone at the W3C must be harvesting metadata out of the headers for
documents posted on the TR page. Are you using a standard ontology
(e.g., Dublin Core) to store that metadata?

I ask because the pubrules changes mean that the metadata in XML Spec
has to change (for alternate forms of the document, for example).

It occurs to me that there are DC elements for this purpose, so if
you're dragging the data into DC anyway...maybe a bunch of the
elements in xmlspec should be replaced with DC elements?

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
