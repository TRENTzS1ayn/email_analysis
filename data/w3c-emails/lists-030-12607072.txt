Thanks for the work Norm.

I'd like a few addition to the next version:
- would it be possible to define a namespace for the xmlspec elements?
  http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xmlspec (or something like this).
- would it possible to use xlink? ie s/href/xlink:href/
- the DOM added two attributes on the DOM extensions in xmlspec:
 <!--
  #1999-07-21: lehors: Added since and version attributes to most idl elements
  -->
 <!--    since attribute:
         Provides the version in which the element was introduced. -->
 <!ENTITY % idl-since.att
         'since                  CDATA           #IMPLIED'>
  
 <!--    version attribute:
         Provides the version in which the element was modified. -->
 <!ENTITY % idl-version.att
         'version                CDATA           #IMPLIED'>

Have a look at [1] to see where we use them. I quickly adapted your
version with what we're using today. If you add the two attributes, I'll
be able to use v2.2 without modifying at all.

Some examples:
  <method name="insertBefore" id="ID-952280727" version='DOM Level 3'> 
  <method name="getUserData" id='Node3-getUserData' since="DOM Level 3">
- it would be nice to have an XML Schema (and others as well) version of
the DTD.
