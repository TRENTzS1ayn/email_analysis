/ Philippe Le Hegaret <plh@w3.org> was heard to say:
| I'd like a few addition to the next version:
| - would it be possible to define a namespace for the xmlspec elements?
|   http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xmlspec (or something like this).

No. Doing so would break every existing stylesheet for xmlspec.

| - would it possible to use xlink? ie s/href/xlink:href/

Yes. But it would be a significant backwards-incompatibility problem.
Certainly not something I'd want to do before a 3.0 release.

| - the DOM added two attributes on the DOM extensions in xmlspec:
|  <!--
|   #1999-07-21: lehors: Added since and version attributes to most idl elements
|   -->
|  <!--    since attribute:
|          Provides the version in which the element was introduced. -->
|  <!ENTITY % idl-since.att
|          'since                  CDATA           #IMPLIED'>
|
|  <!--    version attribute:
|          Provides the version in which the element was modified. -->
|  <!ENTITY % idl-version.att
|          'version                CDATA           #IMPLIED'>
|
| Have a look at [1] to see where we use them. I quickly adapted your
| version with what we're using today. If you add the two attributes, I'll
| be able to use v2.2 without modifying at all.

Good to know. Eve, Sabine, and I are (slowly) working on gathering
requirements for 3.0 by looking at what extensions other groups have
made. Ideally, we'll be able to produce a 3.0 that few groups will
need to customize.

| Some examples:
|   <method name="insertBefore" id="ID-952280727" version='DOM Level 3'> 
|   <method name="getUserData" id='Node3-getUserData' since="DOM Level 3">

FWIW, I've become convinced that putting human readable text in
attribute values is a bad thing. It's just not properly
internationalizable. I suggest instead that you use a keyword in the
version attribute and have the stylesheets "do the right thing".

| - it would be nice to have an XML Schema (and others as well) version of
| the DTD.

It would. And perhaps for 3.0 we can. There is an experimental,
possibly non-functioning, W3C XML Schema version in CVS.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
