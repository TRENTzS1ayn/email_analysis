then let's change the stylesheet as well. I've been working with Ian on
an issue system designed for the W3C Process and I'd like to reuse the
xmlspec elements as much as possible.

ok, but since we're going to have to replace the DTDs and stylesheets,
why don't we bite the bullet and switch to xmlspec v3.0 then. Lots of
WGs already have workarounds to be in sync with the latest pubrules so
the value of v2.2 is not really significant for them.

I'm going to chew this and see if we can come up with something better.
