Well, yeah, sure. Except that there are lots of mutated copies of it
all over the world, a whole raft of important legacy documents, etc.

I hear you.

I'm not saying we need to have a 2.2 before we have a 3.0. But if it
turns out that 10 or 15 small backwards-compatible changes would help
most WGs a lot, I'd like to do that too.

If we make 3.0 radically different (like in a new namespace or with
completely different linking semantics), many existing documents will
never convert to the new spec.

This means I'll get to maintain the old version with it's multiple
hacks, the new version, and a set of stylesheets for both. Can you
sense my hesitation :-)
