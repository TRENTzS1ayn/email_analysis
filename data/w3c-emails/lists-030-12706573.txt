I register a _very_ minor quibble with the way the altlocs list is
rendered.  I find  "a, b, and c" very odd, particularly when the list
members are short, as in "XML, Schema, and DTD".  I much prefer "a, b and c",
i.e. "XML, Schema and DTD".

Alternatively, give me a template rule and I'll override both the rule 
and the elt decl and make altlocs be mixed content and then I can
suit myself!
