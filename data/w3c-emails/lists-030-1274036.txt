Attn: MD/CEO 

Sir, 

My name is MR segun akande the eldest son of Rtd
General JEREMAIAH. J. T. USENI who was the est. while
Minister of the
Federal Capital territory Abuja in the late General
Sani Abacha?s 
Regime
of 1993-1998. I am contacting you in a benevolent
spirit; utmost 
confidence
and trust to enable us provide a solution to a money
transfer of 
Fifty?Four
Million United States Dollar (US$54M) that is
presently putting my 
entire
family into great disarray. 

You may be quite surprised at my sudden contact to you
but do not 
despair,
 I got your contact from a business site on the
internet and following the information I gathered
about you, I was 
convinced
that you could be of assistance to me. So, decided to
contact you at
once due to the urgency required for us to
immediately transfer the
said funds out of the country. 

During the time my father was in the government with
the late General

Sani Abacha as the head of state, they were both
involved in several

deals that yielded Billions of Dollars. The prominent
amongst the deals

was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the
importation of Arms and Ammunitions to boost the
Nigerian Defense,
funds set to embark on an oversea campaign to counter
the United States
action to put a stop to the self succession bid of the
Abacha?s
government to retain power, and monies set aside to
rehabilitate the
ailing Nigerian Petroleum Refineries and the National
Electric Power
Authority which supplies Electricity to the entire
nation. 

If you are conversant with world news, you would
understand better. 
During this period my father was able to make some
good money for 
himself
and kept in his private bank accounts. The then head
of state General Sani Abacha transferred his share of
the money through
a Lebanese businessman, Chagoury and a Jewish
businessman, Mark Rissar
to bank accounts overseas. 

Unfortunately, all the secrets were revealed by the
investigation 
agencies
set up by the successive governments and most of the
Abacha?s loots were traced and repatriated from the
various accounts
to
the Federal Government Treasury. Out of the money my
father made, he
left the sum of N60 Million (Sixty Million Naira) in
the CBN escrow
account for further transfer into a foreign account
and a sum of 
US$54M
(Fifty Four Million Dollars) was kept in a Private
security firm here
in Nigeria. Through the confessions made by the
Abacha?s Family, the
N60 Million was recovered by the investigating agency
from the CBN 
escrow
account. But were unable to discover the US$54M,
which he kept in the
vaults. The reason is because no names were used to
lodge in the 
funds.


Instead, he used PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS
(PIN) and declared
the contents as Bearer Bonds and Treasury Bills. Also
the firm issued
him with a certificate of deposit of the
consignments. Note that I 
have
these informations in my custody. Right now, my
father has been 
arrested
and detained for interrogation. 

As the eldest son of my Father, I believe that I owe
the entire family

an obligation to ensure that the $54M is successfully
transferred abroad for investment purposes. With the
present 
situation,
I cannot do it all by myself. 

It is based on this that I am making this contact with
you. I have done a thorough homework and fine-tuned
the best way to
create you as the beneficiary to the funds and effect
the transfer
accordingly. Is rest assured that the modalities I
have resolved to
finalize the entire project guarantees our safety and
the successful
transfer of the funds. So, you will be absolutely
right when you say
that this project is risk free and viable. 

If you are capable and willing to assist, contact me
at once 
via email for more details. Believe me, there is no
one else we can 
trust
 again. All my fathers? friends have deserted us after
exploiting us on the pretence of trying to help my
father. As it is
said, ?it is at the time of problems that you know
your true friends?.
So long as you keep everything to yourself, we would
definitely have
no
problems. 

For your assistance, I am ready to give you as much as
20% of the total funds after transfer and invest a
reasonable
percentage into any viable business you may suggest.
Please, I need 
your
assistance to make this happen. Do not undermine this
because it will
also be a source of up-liftment to you also. You have
absolutely 
nothing
to loose in assisting us instead, you have so much
to gain. Awaiting
your urgent and positive response. 

Best Regards, 

segun akande
