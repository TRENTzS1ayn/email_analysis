I think the Guidebook is the right place to start:
   http://www.w3.org/Guide/#Tools

However, that page isn't public. [There have already been
requests to make the Guidebook public; duly noted.]

This page also includes links to tools:
   http://www.w3.org/Tools/

This page has been updated more recently than I thought,
but may not be actively maintained. DanC signs it.
