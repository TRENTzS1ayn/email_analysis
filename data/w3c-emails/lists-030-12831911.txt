It does now :)

I'm not sure the validator is the best place for it, since it has a much
broader audience than these tools might want to have (esp. the stylistic
and the pubrules checkers).

Another possible place would be http://www.w3.org/QA/Tools , but I'm not
sure these tools fit well this page either.

I'll add links from the WG guidebook [1].
