That's a different scenario from mine. I'm not holding links from one
document to another, I'm generating fragments of xmlspec documents from data
files and then trying to render these fragments as structured appendices in
the spec. 

I'm just asking for this template rule to be split into two to ease
customisation: it currently performs two functions, (a) following of a
cross-reference to find a target element, and (b) rendering a reference to a
target element; and with my customisations of the DTD, it would be very
useful to be able to access these two pieces of functionality separately.
Doing so would substantially reduce the amount of code in my stylesheet
customisation layer.

Looking at it again, it would be even better if the big xsl:choose statement
were turned into an apply-templates with a special mode: then the way that
cross-references to each element type are rendered could be customized
separately.
