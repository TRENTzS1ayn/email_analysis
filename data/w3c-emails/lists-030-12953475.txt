The template rule for <note> elements in the new XSL stylesheet is:

  <xsl:template match="note">
    <div class="note">
      <p class="prefix">
        <b>Note:</b>
      </p>
      <xsl:apply-templates/>
    </div>
  </xsl:template>

But there doesn't seem to be a CSS style for p.prefix. Presumably the idea
was to have "Note" prepended to the text of the note; but it is appearing in
a separate paragraph with full line separation from what follows.
