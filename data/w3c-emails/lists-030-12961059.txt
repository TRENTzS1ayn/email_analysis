The diffspec.xsl stylesheet uses "yellow" and "lime". I had complaints that
these were too bright - they caused a strain on the eye.

In the latest XSLT WD (see http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#status) I switched
to 

   .diff-chg { background-color: #99ff99 }
   .diff-add { background-color: #ffff99 }

which seems to have met with approval.
