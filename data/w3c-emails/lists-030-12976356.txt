I have been asked by the I18N WG to forward to you some information
about changes we have made to our version of xml-spec.dtd and the
accompanying style sheet that transforms into XHTML output.  We would
like to know whether you feel it appropriate to include some of these
changes in the canonical version of the xmlspec suite.

Find enclosed the latest version of our DTD and the version of the XSL
stylesheet used to generate output.  The stylesheet contains a detailed
change log at the top that reveals most of the changes from the original
version of xmlspec. You can see an instance of the output at
http://www.w3.org/International/Group/charmod-edit


Best regards,
Richard
