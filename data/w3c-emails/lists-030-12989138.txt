Sorry, but I've spent a few minutes looking at these and there's no way I'm
going to give an opinion on the changes unless I see some proper
explanation.

Basically, we can't do this by looking at code and comments. There has to be
a high-level description of the changes - what new structures are provided
in the markup, what changes of rendition are there for existing markup. We
can then have a sensible discussion about which of these are general purpose
and which should remain part of your custom layer. (There appears, for
example, to be some markup designed for handling lists of requirements,
which is something I have in my own customisation for XSLT, but it's very
hard to tell whether there's any overlap).
