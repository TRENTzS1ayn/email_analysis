Hello,

After confusion regarding the use of this document by other W3C WGs [a] in 
May, and a second request for clarity in June [b], I was hoping that the 
subsequent release, in August, would include the appropriate notice. 
I'm hope the third time request will be the charm! <smile/>

  Subject: Copyright Status's of spec-prod documents
  
  Given a question about the creation of derivative works based on [1,2],
  elsewhere [3] I recommended the authors clarify the copyright owners (W3C
  or specific persons) and the specific licenses (W3C document or software
  license) under which they be distributed. I'm repeating this request in the
  spec-prod forum. The ambiguity created by these documents in the context of
  being hosted on the W3C site (which has specific terms and licenses) should
  be eliminated.

  Yes, or if Eve feels that she wishes to exclusively retain the copyright: "Copyright (c) 2000 Eve Maler. All Rights Reserved. W3C(r) liability, trademark, document use and software licensing rules apply. http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/"
  In either case, I recommend a further statement that it was obtained under a dated version of the W3C Software license: and "This document was made used in accordance with the W3C Software Policy http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software-19980720"
