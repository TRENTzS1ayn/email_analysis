| In August 2002, Norman Walsh announced:
|>To support the new pubrules, and because I've been meaning to do this

| Hello,
|
| After confusion regarding the use of this document by other W3C WGs [a] in 
| May, and a second request for clarity in June [b], I was hoping that the 
| subsequent release, in August, would include the appropriate notice. 
| I'm hope the third time request will be the charm! <smile/>

My bad. I thought that I had satisfied that request by adding
appropriate language to the stylesheets. I forgot to make sure that
similar language was added to the DTD before I republished it.

(I never expected to republish the DTD myself, it was only the
immediate urgency of the pubrules change that drove me to it. In an
effort to minimize the possibility of breaking existing documents, I
was careful to change as little as possible. But I changed not quite
enough, it seems. I'll add the language to the development version and it'll
be fixed in the next release.)

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
