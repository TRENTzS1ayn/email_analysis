Hi Susan, 

I plan to send soon a request to the Comm Team to clarify the versions
URIs rules in the pubrules, to make sure they stay exactly the same
across the various versions of the documents; this concerns especially
the frequent changes in the trailing slash appearance that makes the
life of the Webmaster a little more painful in the TR automation
framework. 

In the meantime, I think the Manual of Style shouldn't advise to use
different printing URIs from the one of the links: 
"Omit trailing slashes from visible URIs but include them in href
attributes and link elements. This saves the machine from having to make
an extra round trip and the reader will be free of excessive
punctuation." 
but should in the contrary advise not to use different URIs; in the
Semantic Web, even a trailing slash matters to compare URIs, and the
cost of a supplemental HTTP request to handle a redirect is low enough
not to make a big deal about it. Would you consider such a change? 

Thanks, 

Dom
