The xmlspec.xsl stylesheet contains two <xsl:strip-space> declarations
specifying the "author" element. This is a (recoverable) error according to
XSLT 1.0. [See section 3.4 as modified by erratum E30]

Sadly, the just-released Saxon 7.3 doesn't recover from it. In fact, it
triggers a sorry chain of events including a NullPointerException that gets
masked if you are using the Crimson parser, and the bottom line is that you
get no output, other than a message saying "Run-time errors were reported"
(though they weren't).

I'll fix the Saxon problems, but the original error in the stylesheet should
also be fixed.

Meanwhile, thanks for supplying an interesting test case...
