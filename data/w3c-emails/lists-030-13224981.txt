> Here is a diff for changing to utf-8. 

actually it shouldn't put in a meta charset element at all in html
output. The XSLT engine will insert one itself using the output
encoding it actually uses, so at best with the xmlspec.xsl
youget two equivalent <meta elements and at worst you get two
one of which is specifying the wrong encoding for the file.
