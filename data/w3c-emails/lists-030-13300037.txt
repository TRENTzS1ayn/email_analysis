Dom,

I was recently thinking it's a great waste of my time to have to compile and 
update bibliographies in my specs. So I've been looking for a source of TR 
data that I could use and DanC pointed me to:
  http://www.w3.org/2002/01/tr-automation/
  http://www.w3.org/2000/04/mem-news/tr.rdf

However, this only has the short name, latest date, title and editors. Any 
chance this could also scrape the full dated URI and status?
