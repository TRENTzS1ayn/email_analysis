Ooh! yeah... I've been thinking for a *long* time that the best
way to get the editors to get their bibliographies right is
to do it for them.

I've been wishing for a form where you could paste in a list
of document URIs and back would come a bibliography for them,
formatted according to our guidelines...
  http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/#References

Or just a "view as bibliography" in addition to
"view by author" and such.

I did some bibliography-formatting work in XSLT
for a URI scheme index...
  http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes#ctech
esp.

"TODO
     1. make dublin core bibliography formatting available separately
        from the resto of the stuff that the transformation does"

  -> http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemesIndex.xsl

That has support for citing internet drafts and RFCs.
Citations of W3C tech reports should be easy to add.

I offer a 1000 point bounty for the "format my bibliography
for me" service.
