Any chance of getting a stable ID on each of the entries in that
document?  Then I'll put together a two - stage XML Pipeline (XInclude
plus XSLT) which will give everybody exactly what they want.

Something of the form
  . . . id="http:__www.w3.org_TR_2001_REC-SVG-20010904"
would do the job.

The following template will add this to the existing doc't:

<xsl:template match="/rdf:RDF/*[@rdf:about]">
 <xsl:copy>
  <xsl:attribute name="id">
   <xsl:value-of select="translate(@rdf:about,'/','_')"/>
  </xsl:attribute>
  <xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()"/>
 </xsl:copy>
</xsl:template>

but it would be better to include this functionality somewhere in the
production process -- I couldn't quite figure out where that should be.

[Note that the nice overview at [1] is not quite as useful as it might
be, because lots of the links therein are broken :-(]
