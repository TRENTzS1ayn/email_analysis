I _think_ that's not what we want -- if you look at the normative
references sections of most of our RECs, they refer to _dated_
versions of other RECs.

That _is_ what we want, in my opinion.

But that's rarely what we want in a bibliography, I don't think.

Re latest version, see above.  The problem with URIs is that they are
not valid XML IDs (oops, even the version I have above is wrong, the
colon needs to be replaced as well).  And the only nearly-official
stable fragment identifier syntax we have for XML is IDs.  So I want
to put in my spec

  <rdfbib>
   <xi:include href="http://www.w3.org/2002/01/tr-automation/tr.rdf#http..__www.w3.org_TR_2001_REC-SVG-20010904"/>
  </rdfbib>

and have that work forever.  By 'stable' I mean that it will continue
to work as the order of elements in tr.rdf changes.
