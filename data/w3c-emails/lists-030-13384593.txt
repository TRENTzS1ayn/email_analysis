I believe the practice is to say what you mean, which IMHO means that for 
normative references one always provides a pointer to a dated version. (One 
can't normatively include the unspecified future, though in xmldsig we did 
get very closing to that with some of the Unicode specs and addendums! 
<smile/>) If your intent is to track another version then saying as much 
and providing both makes sense. 

Regardless, for a auto-biblio generation, I certainly want the dated 
versions.
