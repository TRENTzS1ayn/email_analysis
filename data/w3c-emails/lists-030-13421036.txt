I haven't touched XSLT in a while, and never did named templates with 
parameters nor external documents, so the attached files includes an 
*extremely* newbie attempt at generating a HTML bibliography from a XML 
file with bibliography tokens and their corresponding short URIs. I have a 
sense that my 3 verbose templates could be collapsed into one, and I 
presently don't deal with the formatting of single names, nor multiple 
instances of a document (such as FIRST EDITION) well. I don't expect this 
to be of much use to anyone, but if someone improves it, that would further 
my education at least. <smile/>
