| The real data are at:
| http://www.w3.org/2002/01/tr-automation/tr.rdf

In order to make this data useful for XML Spec bibliographies, two
more pieces of information are needed: an ID and a bibliographic key.

  <bibl id="XSLT2" key="XSLT 2.0">
    <!-- this stuff can come from the tr.rdf file, I think -->
  </bibl>

I don't know what to do about that.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
