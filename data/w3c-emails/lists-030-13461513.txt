Talking about preserving id attributes, I have noted something of the
same vain:

in XMLspec, one may want to do:

  <glist>
    <gitem id='foo-def'>
      <label>foo</label>
      <def>
<p>Foo is a bar.</p>
      </def>
    </gitem>
  <glist>

However, the XSLT transforms glist into a dl, label into a dt, and def
into a dd, and it drops gitem and its id. So you are forced to put the
id on label if you don't want to lose your ID when producing the HTML.

Basically, I think that the dt should get either label's or, if it is
absent (which is likely to be the case), gitem's id attribute.

I haven't had time to deal with this, using the trick of putting the
id on label, though.

Hugo
