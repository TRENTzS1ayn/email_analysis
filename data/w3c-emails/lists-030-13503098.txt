I'm forwarding this to spec-prod, since the copyright
is auto-generated by the stylesheet for the xmlspec
application, and none of the specs using xmlspec will
be correct until the stylesheet is changed.

>Hello, Chairs.
>
>This is a notification of a pubrules change, effective immediately. It is a change in Rule 1.7 [0], item 10:
>
>"The copyright must use the following markup."
>
>With the change of European host and the change of Gregorian Calendar year, the copyright notice for all technical reports has changed. The new markup includes the correct year, the correct markup for ERCIM, and short name links for the various W3C Policy documents. You'll find the new markup included in Publication Rules itself, as well as in the TR template [1].
>
>The pubrules checker is also being updated at this time. Unlike other pubrules changes, we do need to implement this immediately, as it is related to copyright. Both Henri, our Webmaster, and I are here to help you with any questions you may have on this change.
>
>Thank you for your attention, and best wishes for a productive 2003.
