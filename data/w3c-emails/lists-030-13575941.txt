For what it's worth, I've taken a sort of inverse approach in XML
Schema -- I've added support for a 'text' attribute on the <eg>
element to the stylesheets, so that e.g.

  <eg xml:space="preserve" text="&docHome;/XMLSchema.dtd,txt"/>

does the right thing, and written a very simple script which "quotes"
XML so that it can be included in this way.  Then my Makefile has
something such as

spec.html: spec.xml xmpl1.xml,txt

%,txt: %
xml2xmpl $< > $@

where xml2xmpl looks like this:

        #!/bin/sh
        echo -n "<txt><![CDATA["
        rxp $@
        echo "]]></txt>"
