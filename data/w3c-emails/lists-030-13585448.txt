As an aside, I actually started out with trying to use XInclude which I 
thought would be optimal but:

1. I couldn't figure out a way to include XInclude elements in XHTML and 
have it remain valid XHTML.
2. The returning XML isn't "encoded" for inclusion in XHTML, I thought of 
putting it inside ![CDATA[ but figured it wouldn't work since CDATA is 
*not* supposed to be parsed, and consequently the XInclude should be 
ignored.
3. Not sure how good the XPtr support in XInclude implementations (e.g., 
xmllint) is.
