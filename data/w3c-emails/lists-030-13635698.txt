Hello, Norm,

You were kind enough to make a CSS change before to the XML Spec
stylesheets [1]. When CSS is embedded we have no way to change it after
publication. Would you please omit this CSS rule as well?

     li, p           { margin-top: 0.3em;
                      margin-bottom: 0.3em; }

Optimal vertical spacing is font-dependent. W3C CSS style sheets say
only that our specs are "sans-serif." The font could be set locally to
anything and with unknown metrics.

Also, thanks for giving advice on [1] to use Tidy. Would you make the
following minor change or something like it? This step would make many
specs 10% smaller:

     For best results, run the results through Tidy with indent off.
