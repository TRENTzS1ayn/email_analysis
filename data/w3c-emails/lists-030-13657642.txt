At lunchtime today we had a BOF on the [re-]presentation of grammar tokens
in W3C specification documents.

In this conversation I mentioned to Susan an idea from the XAG where it
suggests a document dialect (in this case a genre) definition define
_multiple_ presentation/interaction bindings (e.g. stylesheets) available
pre-formulated for authors of instances in this dialect (of this genre).

  XML Accessibility Guidelines

This is a no-status draft, but one should note that the U.S. Federal XML
community in their exploration of eForms has looked favorably on this idea
of proving view independence of a model by validating usability in each of
several views.

  "Eforms for E-Gov" Pilot Project Update

Collateral ideas are:

.. the plain text form could possibly be eliminated from the morph repertory.

.. we should be looking at not just providing a "Zip of HTML for offline
use" but upgrading to routinely producing a fully compliant digital talking
book instance in accordance with

  ANSI/NISO Z39.86, Specifications for the Digital Talking Book

e.g. read starting at

We need to do pilots before we dictate fixed practices into the W3C
production practices, but we should also be thinking about using W3C work
products as example cases for the DI etc. technology that we are cooking in
working groups.
