/ Hugo Haas <hugo@w3.org> was heard to say:
| The XML Spec XHTML Stylesheet Version 1.6[1] produces invalid XHTML
| 1.0 by putting xmlns declarations on every element in the output,
| according to [2].
|
| I have made it exclude those attributes with the following patch:
|
|   http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2002/ws/arch/xmlspec-v22/xmlspec.xsl.diff?r1=1.6&r2=1.7
|
| Since I don't know where the html2xhtml used to generate it lives, I
| have just modified the Web Services Architecture Working Group's local
| copy[3].

That patch may have worked, but I think what you're seeing is a bug in
your xslt processors. The XHTML stylesheet goes to some lengths to
make sure that duplicate namespace declarations aren't produced.

Were you, by chance, using an older version of xsltproc?

                                          norm
