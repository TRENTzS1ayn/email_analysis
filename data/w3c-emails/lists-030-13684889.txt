/ Susan Lesch <lesch@w3.org> was heard to say:
| You were kind enough to make a CSS change before to the XML Spec
| stylesheets [1]. When CSS is embedded we have no way to change it after
| publication. Would you please omit this CSS rule as well?
|
|      li, p           { margin-top: 0.3em;
|                       margin-bottom: 0.3em; }

Done in CVS. It'll be in the next release.

| Also, thanks for giving advice on [1] to use Tidy. Would you make the
| following minor change or something like it? This step would make many
| specs 10% smaller:
|
|      For best results, run the results through Tidy with indent off.

Ok.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
