This afternoon, I published V2.3 of the XML Spec DTD. This version[1]
adds some PEs to make customization layers easier to write and adds
some content model fixes to make generating diff versions a little
easier. There are no user visible changes (that users are supposed to
take advantage of :-).

Share and enjoy.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
