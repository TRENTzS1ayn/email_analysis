Hello,

The Communication Team has set up a page whose goal is to serve as the
central homepage for W3C editors, where they can find links to the most
useful resources for them:
http://www.w3.org/2003/Editors/

It is now linked from the spec-prod mailing list archives:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/spec-prod/

Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions to make this
page more useful.

Regards,

Dom
