Norm and others,

GEO (I18N) and WCAG (WAI) groups have just produced the first version of
a single DTD based on an extended version of xmlSpec that will support
both their techniques documents.  


If you are interested in seeing the DTD and its documentation look at
'Miscellaneous working documents' [
http://www.w3.org/International/geo/#miscdocs ] 


Besides adding structural elements to support techniques, we made other
changes, including:

- created %i18n.att (xml:lang, dir) and added to common.att and
common-idreq.att

- created %l10n.att (locn-note, locn-alert, translate) and added
to common.att and common.idreq.att

- added general entities: lrm, rlm, zwj, zwnj

- added bdo to %local.emph.class (I will remove this later to
adopt the XHTML2 approach)

-removed phrase from %tech.pcd.mix - didn't seem appropriate

- added %ubiquitous.phrase.class containing phrase, bdo, emph

- added %ubiquitous.phrase.class to code and loc

- added img element to replace graphic so there's no alt
attribute, then created an image element containing img and (required)
alt elements

-added useful phrasal elements: rfc2119, qterm, qchar, abbr,
uname


Development of the DTD continues, but we thought you might like to know
what we have done so far.

Cheers,
RI
