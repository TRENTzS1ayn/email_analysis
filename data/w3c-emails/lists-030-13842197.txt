Folks,

I published a new release of XML Spec today. Version 2.5 adds
preverrataloc and translationloc to the header as well as rfc2119 to
the inlines. (I haven't (yet) tried to integrate the changes suggested
by GEO (I18N) and WCAG (WAI), but I've put that on my list.)

There's a new release of the base HTML and FO stylesheets to support
the new elements.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
