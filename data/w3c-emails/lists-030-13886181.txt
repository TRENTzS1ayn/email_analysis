Dan,

you found the essential one... not also that you can call the CGI script 
requesting the returned value to be in RDF. It will collect the right 
information for, eg, a specific document and return the RDF part.

Actually, nobody used that alternative yet, I am sure there are bugs 
there. And I am also sure you will tell me if you find any... however: I 
am on vacations. Ie, I may or may not react immediately!
