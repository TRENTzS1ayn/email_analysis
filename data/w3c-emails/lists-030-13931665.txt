Hello spec-prod,

I've just announced a new set of publication

Thank you for your continued contributions!

>     required later in the status section.

>  2) Member and Team Submissions SHOULD include a latest
>     version link (i.e., should resemble Rec track documents
>     as far as version links are concerned).

> The Comm Team is currently working on a proposal to clarify
