In W3C Specifications,

- - First level sections are very large, bold, and blue.

- - Second level sections are large, normal weight, and blue.

- - Third level sections are normal size, bold, and black.

I find the transition from "blue" to "black" very jarring. In
particular, these sections lose the appearance of being section
dividers.

This problem is particularly noticable in documents like the XSL/XML
Query Data Model where paragraphs discussing infoset properties often
contain a fair amount of bold text.

Is there any possibility that a different style might be applied?

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
