Hi all,

There was some discussion back in July about using the TR in RDF data to
facilitate the creation of bibliography in XMLSpec; while I'm not sure
where we are on this topic, nor who should have any action on it, I
wrote up a small tool to re-use these data for creating XHTML
bibliography, along discussions I had with Ian Jacobs.
As so often these days :), the tool is based on XSLT:
http://www.w3.org/2002/01/tr-automation/tr-biblio.xsl
which should present you with XML/CSS or XSLT-aware browsers with an
HTML form to submit URIs on which you want to get bibliographic data.

You can give it dated or undated URIs, separated by a space or a line
return. For instance, with the following URIs:
http://www.w3.org/TR/qaframe-ops/
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-qaframe-spec-20030912/

the results is as follows:
