This is really cool... another wish come true.

Request for Enhancement: support link targets.
The input should consist of pairs
label URI
and the bibliography should be formatted:

 <dt><a name="label">label</a></dt>
  <dd>...</dd>

Maybe make the labels a check-box option.

Strike "available at" there. That URI is the official name
of the document, not just a handy place to find a copy.

Hmm... the manual[1] says "A sentence containing a text-only URI."

For documents that have institutionalized identifiers and
bear them on their title page, I think the sentence isn't
called for.

Request for enhancement:

 If a reference is a W3C Recommendation track technical report that has
not reached Recommendation, state in the References section that it is
"work in progress."
