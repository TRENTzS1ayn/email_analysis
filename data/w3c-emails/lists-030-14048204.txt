/ Dominique Haza?l-Massieux <dom@w3.org> was heard to say:
| There was some discussion back in July about using the TR in RDF data to
| facilitate the creation of bibliography in XMLSpec; while I'm not sure

Coincidentally, I just did exactly the same thing with an eye towards making
sure all the XSL/XML Query specs have consistent bibliographic entries.

If you process the tr.rdf[1] file with tr-bibl.xsl[2], you'll get tr.xml[3]
which is an XMLSpec <bibl> for all the documents on the TR page.

I've also tweaked the customization layer that generates the HTML for the
XSL/XML Query specs so that

  <bibl id="xslt" key="Whatever the editor wants"/>

will use the <bibl> from tr.xml to generate the bibliography entry.

I'm sure there's room for improvement, but this will be better than
checking all the bibliographies in a dozen specs to see if they're
consistent.

                                        Be seeing you,
                                          norm
