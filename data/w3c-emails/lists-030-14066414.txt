The editors are not given in the original data (which could be fixed
pretty easily, I gather), so there is nothing I can do about that in the
tool.
I fixed the bug with regard to 1ed/2ed (hopefully). It's likely to break
with XML 3rd ed, though, I'll need to do a smarter algorithm, at some
point.

Fixed.

Should be fixed for all 2nd ed.

The URI accepted by the system is the one referenced in tr.rdf, which
itself is (supposingly) the one given by the document itself. And
indeed,
