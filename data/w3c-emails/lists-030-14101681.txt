Thanks very much, Dom. It's splendid.

Added to the Manual of Style:

Also added to the tools index for this mailing list:

Is it possible to add a quick note saying "Requires an XSLT-aware
browser"? MacIE for example displays text rather than a form "Stylesheet
to format bibliographic data..." through "$Id: tr-biblio.xsl,v 1.21
2003/10/28 15:51:46 dom Exp $tr.rdftr.rdf,  Editors, W3C , ,  . Latest
version available at  .. ," without a form.

Thanks again. A tool like this can cost US $20 or more a seat yet not
quite meet W3C's special requirements. This one is perfect.
