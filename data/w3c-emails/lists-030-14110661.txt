Glad you like it ;)

Actually, this requirement was only for the
test-it-and-use-if-you-like-it kind of announce; but since you have
linked to it from more visible places, I created a wider-accepted HTML
interface at:
http://www.w3.org/2002/01/tr-automation/tr-biblio-ui
which should do the same thing. That means you'd have to update the
links in the archives cover and in the MoS, but that will probably ease
the adoption of the tool itself...

Thanks for the feedback,

Dom
