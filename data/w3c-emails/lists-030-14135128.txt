My bad, I was talking of xhtml11, while you were speaking about xhtml1.
Anyway, the data on which the TR page is built are the same as the data
used to query the bibliography extraction, so there should be no
discrepancy (and indeed, the link from the TR page is .../xhtml1 not
.../xhtml1/, unless I missed something).
